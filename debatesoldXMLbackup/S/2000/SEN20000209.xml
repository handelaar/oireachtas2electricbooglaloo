      <P>I have notice from Senator Cox that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make available an information and education video outlining the current policy on waste management, indicating the advantages and disadvantages of thermal treatment, recycling and landfill.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to expedite and prioritise the tendering and completion of the extension and refurbishment of Granlahan National School, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, 1999 &ndash; Report and Final Stages; and No. 2, Shannon River Council Bill, 1998 &ndash; Second Stage. No. 2 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., and business will resume thereafter if not previously concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will obviously not ask for a debate on Northern Ireland, but there is a sense in which we are all watching as events seem to be sliding in a particular direction. We know that a large number of people are trying hard to avert what would be a catastrophe. All I can say, as we said last week, is that we wish well those who are trying so hard to avert what could be a major setback to the entire peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding No. 2 on the Order of Business, since there is general agreement on the principle <Col N="274" /> of the Bill and Second Stage is about principle, and since we had the assurance of the Leader last week that Fianna Fáil will be supporting the Bill, I suggest that Second Stage should be completed at 8 p.m. this evening and then we would have time next week to give it detailed examination on Committee Stage. The promoters of the Bill have assured me that they are open to any proposals for change to improve the Bill which the Government or other groups may wish to table. It is in the interests of the Bill that we try to complete Second Stage this evening and then have Government time next week for a detailed Committee Stage review. I would welcome the Leader's views on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael group for tabling the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998, in Private Members' time. It is a generous, positive and progressive gesture which is appreciated by all sides of the House. I fully endorse and support the suggestion of Senator Manning that Second Stage should be dealt with tonight in order that there can be support from all sides of the House and the Government side would not be in any way embarrassed and would be able to engage in making whatever changes are required. We know their views and that they support the principle and the approach of the Bill. It would be sensible to approach this matter on an all-party basis.</P>
      <P>I remind the House about that of which we dare not speak &ndash; the review of salaries and allowances of Members of the Oireachtas which is now under way. Discussions and presentations on the review will take place over the next few months. If Members have any views on matters which should be raised, as points of argument or otherwise, in support of a positive review of salaries and allowances, I would be pleased to hear them, as would the Whips or Leaders of any of the groups.</P>
      <P>On a related topic, a major discussion is going on publicly which is in danger of becoming a political football. It is based around the topic of Fianna Fáil struggling within itself over ethics in public office. It behoves all of us on both sides of both Houses to take a common approach on this matter. It should not be a case of one party or group trying to out bid the others in terms of morality. We need an open, simple and implementable system or series of principles which should attach to people going forward for public office. That should be agreed on all sides and should not be a matter for competition between parties. We do not need all public office holders to be paragons of virtue; they can be rogues as long as they are honest rogues. We need to approach the matter positively, and that should be done on an all-party basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I called for a debate on Northern Ireland to be scheduled for this week in the expectation that matters would have been resolved at the weekend. However, the question of what will happen in Northern Ireland is not <Col N="275" /> likely to be finally resolved until the end of this week, on Friday, when there is a danger of direct rule being re-imposed. We are at a very critical time and obviously we will not call for a debate immediately, but next week would seem to be an appropriate time to have one. Whatever decision is to be taken, it will be done by this weekend. It is a critical time and there is a danger of disappointment leading to recriminations and bitterness. We all wish that, even at this late stage, there could be some mechanism whereby the IRA and the British Army might &ndash; we will not say jump together &ndash; at least take a step together with the disposal of some hardware. The ultimate intention of the Good Friday Agreement is that all military and paramilitary presence should be removed from Northern Ireland. This is a time for cool heads.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to item 21, motion No. 8 &ndash; a Labour Party motion &ndash; which states: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to publish a White Paper on early childhood education&rdquo;. One of the first major initiatives taken by any Minister in the new Northern Ireland Assembly was that taken by Martin McGuinness on early childhood education. He decided that a free state system of pre-school education should be introduced. We could very well reflect upon that and look towards establishing a similar system in the Republic. Will the Leader of the House allow an early debate on that motion by the Labour group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that we should not debate Northern Ireland immediately. However, irrespective of the outcome between now and Friday, it would be appropriate for us to consider the issue in some detail next week. We all hope and pray that the present impasse can be overcome and that progress can be made in cementing the peace process. It was quite significant when, a couple of weeks ago, we saw farmers protesting outside Stormont. That indicated the healthy normality of political life in Northern Ireland, with which we can readily identify here. It would be good to debate the issue because there are major matters that merit such a discussion. Our history with regard to these debates is one of offering considered and balanced opinions. From that point of view, we should return to the matter next week, hopefully on the basis that there will have been a resolution to the problem.</P>
      <P>Under Standing Orders we cannot have a vote of sympathy in the House. However, it is appropriate for us to record the passing of the former Deputy Tom Foxe in Roscommon. He was an agricultural scientist, a profession I shared with him and the late Pat Upton. We have, therefore, recently lost two of the agriculturalists who were educated in UCD. He was a very decent man who achieved a great deal for his constituents. It is appropriate that we would record his passing and extend our sympathy to his immediate family and his colleagues in Roscommon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am shocked by what is happening in my native city of Dublin, which is becoming a bit like Al Capone's Chicago. Last night, a person was picked up, shot and flung onto the street. We have had gang warfare since January. I ask the Leader to ensure the Minister comes to the House to tell us how he proposes to tackle this scourge. There have been 12 violent deaths since Christmas. This sorry state of affairs must be tackled immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the expression of sympathy to the relatives and friends of the late former Deputy Tom Foxe. He was a Member of Dáil Éireann for two terms. He was a very respected and popular Member of the Oireachtas and is a major loss to his family and the people of Roscommon. It was generally accepted in this House that Tom Foxe was a gentleman. His contribution was always made in the interests of the community and the public. While he was involved in many aspects of life through his profession, he was also involved in sport, particularly boxing.</P>
      <P>His greatest legacy is that, in a tight voting situation in Dáil Éireann, he used his political mandate to ensure the issue on which he was originally elected, that is, the maintenance of Roscommon county hospital as an acute general hospital, was kept in place. That legacy will remain as an honour to Tom Foxe for years to come.</P>
      <P>He was a member of Roscommon County Council, which he chaired for a while, until his death. While he was not a Member of this House, I ask the Leader to convey the House's sympathy to his three sisters, the rest of his immediate family and his organisation, the hospital election committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I also join in the tributes to the former Deputy Foxe. I did not know him very well but I found him a gentle, unassuming and very hard working man.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader firm up the suggestion he made to the House last week that he would grant time for a debate on the issue of a holiday on St. Brigid's day to recognise the contribution of women to national life? Will he indicate a date for that debate?</P>
      <P>I have been asked by a number of people involved in the academic and cultural life of this city to raise the issue &ndash; which I know certain members of Fianna Fáil are also very anxious should be raised &ndash; of the possible destruction of Riversdale, the last residence of our greatest poet, W. B. Yeats. This is becoming a matter of international controversy. Over the years, I have campaigned to save houses associated with James Joyce. It is a shame that an important house associated with Yeats is under threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole on the question of ethics. There should be a discussion but it should not be too nit-picking and we should not be foolish about it. I am getting rather tired of filling in forms admitting I received no bribes <Col N="277" /> from anybody. It is very humiliating that, while everybody else seems to be getting them, nobody seems to think I am worth it. I was concerned to hear on the radio while I was on a train&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot think why.</P>
      <P>There has been a discussion in Fianna Fáil on this matter and it originally proposed to look for a tax clearance certificate but, according to the radio, it has withdrawn from that position because of revolt among backbenchers. It is now only requiring people to move towards a situation of regularising their tax affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris on the issue of W. B. Yeats's old home. This might appear to be a local issue, but it is of national interest. This very old 18th-century farmhouse is about to be demolished to clear the site for 28 apartments. While we can pursue the issue locally and put a preservation order on the house, W. B. Yeats was a Member of this House&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and, therefore, it is an issue of national importance. I would like the Leader to call on the State to perhaps incorporate this house into plans for the performing arts or something in that area. I am conscious that this is becoming a national issue and it should be debated in this House.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the tributes to the late former Deputy, Tom Foxe, and the expressions of sympathy to his family. He was a true gentleman, a man of politics, as has been said by all speakers.</P>
      <P>Now that draft No. 8 exists, a document entitled Standards in Public Life &ndash; Mandatory Code for Officeholders and Candidates issued by Fianna Fáil, will the Leader advise, for the benefit of the House, if this represents an outline of the Government's legislative proposals? If not, why not and when will we know? Will the Leader make a statement on the matter?</P>

      <P>Next 23 July will be decision day as to whether the debts of certain impoverished countries will be wiped out by those who have the power to do so. As we know, many of these debts were incurred as a result of certain reckless policies of financial institutions in <Col N="278" /> the 1970s, the decrease in prices for raw materials from these countries and, above all, the financial consequences arising from a price war among oil producing countries. Over 800,000 Irish people have signed a petition calling for the abolition of these debts. Will the Leader arrange an early debate so that we can reflect our support for those 800,000 people? It behoves the large powers to help in this constructive way and not always take fire brigade action by going into these countries with all guns blazing when matters get out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a special debate on child care provision? We will have a debate tomorrow on the new partnership but it is clear from reports so far that this issue has, in effect, been postponed and has not been dealt with in the context of the agreement. We have had a number of debates on this issue and the Government knows there is a crisis. It is extraordinary that the issue has once again been postponed.</P>
      <P>While we will have a debate tomorrow, it is only right, given the concerns raised in the past, particularly in this House, that we devote time in the near future to bringing to the Government's attention our serious concerns and disapproval of the fact that this issue has not been dealt with in the context of this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position regarding the mental health Bill? We discussed before Christmas the report on the mental hospitals, which was quite controversial, and it was well covered by Vincent Browne. What is the current position on that Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I support the suggestions of Senators Manning and O'Toole that tonight's debate on the Shannon River Council Bill should be considered as a Second Stage debate? These suggestions reflect a spirit of co-operation between various parties in the House. Its seems an ideal arrangement to make it a Second Stage debate, particularly given Senator O'Toole's suggestion that a further step could be taken next week or some time in the future. This would give the Government an opportunity to suggest change and amend the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that we, as a nation, have decided our future rests on e-commerce, we should all be concerned about attacks by hackers on websites in the United States in recent days. Such attacks are the terrorism of the future. This is the sort of havoc that can affect our lives in the future. Will the Leader draw this to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ascertain if new laws are required? In the United States the FBI is developing its ability to handle this type of attack. Has our law enforcement agency, whether it be the Garda or another group, got the ability to monitor and respond to such an attack? We have made a decision that this nation's future lies in e-commerce and we are <Col N="279" /> developing legislation along that line. Do we need other legislation to protect ourselves from terrorists who could damage such developments? Does the House consider this would be worthy of a debate? It is worth drawing the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the need for some action to be taken in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the urgent need to review the medical card guidelines, given that the proportion of our population in receipt of medical cards has dropped from 38% to the approximately 31% and an increasing number of single parents, on returning to work, have lost their entitlement to a medical card because they are not on the back to work scheme? If we want people, particularly mothers, to return to work, we should ensure they retain their entitlement to a medical card for a minimum of approximately two years while in employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of recent and impending appointments to the Supreme Court and the central place of the Constitution in Irish life, will the Leader facilitate the setting up of a judicial appointments committee to allow these appointees to put their views on the Constitution and its place in our lives on the public record?</P>

      <P>Mine is a third voice to ask the Leader to do something to prevent the destruction of the late Senator Yeats's house. Senator Ormonde has done a splendid amount of work locally. I have a personal interest in this because my relations once rented it. While they have not written anything yet, we are living in hope of something happening in the future, in which case two plaques might have to be put up on the house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with the remarks about Deputy Tom Foxe. I knew him quite well and all the plaudits were well earned and justified.</P>
      <P>My party leader was in Sligo recently and the chamber of commerce, in particular, asked that a broadband data transmission network be made available to Sligo. This is directly related to the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, which has been on the Order Paper for the past nine months. The Minister for Public Enterprise would be far better off dealing with this than making historically inaccurate statements in relation to an underground in Dublin. The underground in London was built by digging holes in the ground, destroying everything around them, building the underground and then filling them in again. If that is what the Minister for Public Enterprise proposes should be done in the centre of Dublin, she should tell the people of Dublin so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what was done in London.

      <P>Notwithstanding the great courtesy that Senator O'Toole has shown us, I find it astonishing that Members still do not have copies of the most recent national agreement. It is astonishing that copies were not made available as a matter of urgency to Members when everyone of significance, as the world sees it, including journalists and economists, are talking about it in detail, yet we cannot read it. That is profoundly undemocratic and quite wrong.</P>
      <P>I know Senator Quinn is a man of the highest liberal credentials but I am worried about the issues arising about the world-wide web. The only way to control the Internet is by giving the State totalitarian powers. People would be wise to accept that certain things cannot be done that way rather than moving down the road towards control levels. I suggest we do not move in the direction of State censorship of the Internet.</P>

I support the Senator in her call on the Minister <Col N="282" /> for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the man who introduced the phrase &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo;, to engage in an urgent debate on law and order.

      <P>Before I call on the Leader to reply I would like to be associated with the tributes paid to my fellow county man, Tom Foxe. I join in the expression of sympathy to his family. I knew him long before he entered the political arena. He was an agricultural adviser for many years in Country Roscommon. In that role he was always extremely approachable and most courteous. He had a great interest in his work and in the community which he served and went out of his way to help any farmer who was experiencing particular difficulties. As a Member of the Dáil from 1989 until 1997 and as a member of Roscommon County Council he proved himself to be an extremely hard working and effective public representative. As other Members have said, he was exceptionally popular with his constituents and with fellow public representatives of all political persuasions.</P>
      <P>Tom will be remembered with affection by everyone, particularly the people of County Roscommon who will recall his untiring campaign for the retention and upgrading of Roscommon county hospital. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with tributes to the late Tom Foxe. The Leader of the Opposition and former Leader of the House, Senator Manning, and I spent many great evenings in his company. I know Senator Manning wanted to pay tribute to Tom Foxe and we had arranged to do so tomorrow morning. If the Senator wishes to do so at that time, I will make time available for him.</P>
      <P>As Leader of the House, I offer my sincere and heartfelt condolences to the sisters, family, friends and colleagues of the late Tom Foxe. It is difficult to understand the sense of shock we felt when we heard the news of Tom's death. It is always sad when one of our parliamentary colleagues passes away. However, it is truly tragic when someone like Tom, in the prime of his life, is snatched from our midst.</P>
      <P>Tom brought many personal gifts to the principal tasks to which he devoted his life and he gave a lifetime of dedicated service to the people of County Roscommon. He was a person of tremendous ability, energy and commitment. This was clearly seen in the various roles he filled, most recently as a Dáil Deputy and a member and chairman of Roscommon County Council. He was respected by parliamentary colleagues on all sides of the House, who admired his strong sense of commitment and no-nonsense approach. It was this which gained him the respect and confidence of the entire community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tom was extremely popular with his constituents and colleagues in both the Oireachtas and Roscommon County Council, who always found him extremely approachable, courteous and pol<Col N="283" /> ite. He had a reputation for being a hard working and effective public representative and will be remembered with great affection, particularly for his unrelenting campaign on behalf of Roscommon county hospital.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Members of this House and of the Fianna Fáil Party, I wish to express my deepest sympathy to his sisters, family and friends on passing of a fine man. Go ndearna Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business, Senators Manning, Costello, Dardis and Quinn expressed concern about the current situation in Northern Ireland. All we can do is to extend our best wishes to the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister, President Clinton and all the leaders in Northern Ireland who are trying their best to bring this matter to a successful conclusion. We hope and pray that the unthinkable will not happen but that, in the interests of future generations, a breakthrough will occur. Everyone knows what is the right thing to do and there is never a wrong time to do it.</P>
    <P>I call on those people who can bring this matter to a successful conclusion &ndash; they have already done a great deal to bring the peace process to its current position in terms of their involvement with the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; to ensure that peace becomes permanent. All involved, including the Provisional IRA, have stated that they want to make the peace last and make it work. By the time the House sits next week, I hope a resolution will have been achieved. I will speak with the leaders of the various groups in the House after the Order of Business in respect of arranging to make time available for a debate on Northern Ireland next week.</P>
    <P>Many Members have indicated a desire to speak on Second Stage of the Shannon River Council Bill this evening. I propose, with the agreement of the House, to extend the debate on the Bill to next week's Private Members' time. I will make Government time available next week to continue Second Stage of the Bill and, if the Independent Senators agree, we will continue Second Stage during their Private Members' time the following week. Many Senators wish to contribute to Second Stage of this Bill and it is not possible under Standing Orders to facilitate all those who wish to speak during Private Members' time today.</P>
    <P>I will pass on the views expressed by Senator O'Toole regarding Members' salaries and allowances, and I hope all Members took note of those views.</P>

      <P>Consideration of this issue is long overdue, particularly given the new working arrangements of the House which involve four or five days per week due to sitting days and committees. Seanad Éireann now initiates one third of all legislation. A total of 76 Bills came before both Houses in the first two years of this Govern<Col N="284" /> ment's term. This figure represents an unprecedented number of Bills and shows the amount of work which Members must undertake. I hope that recognition will be given to the commitment Members make in the national interest and in the interests of those we represent. It is a great honour to be a Member of this House but it must be borne in mind that Senators are rearing families, making a lifelong commitment and giving the prime years of their lives to being Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I will make time available for a debate on childhood education as called for by Senator Costello. I will also make time available to facilitate Senators Ridge and Burke who called for a debate on the violent deaths which have occured in the past months and which all Members will condemn. I will pass on to the Minister the views expressed by Senators Norris, Ormonde and Henry regarding W.B. Yeats's residence. Senator Norris called for St. Brigid's day to be made a holiday in honour of our national saint. My dear mother's name is Brigid and I will pass on the Senator's views to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I will also convey to the Minister the views expressed by Senator Ó Murchú. Senator O'Meara called for a debate on child care. We debated this issue last year, I think. Much has been achieved in this area in the national agreement and I will make time available to discuss this issue tomorrow. I will also consider whether further time is necessary to debate this issue.</P>
      <P>I will pass on the views expressed by Senators Quinn and Ryan to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Senator O'Dowd called for a review of the medical card scheme.

The Senator may be having second thoughts about joining the Labour Party. When a good Government is in power the Senator must take it on the chin and he cannot always be whinging and crying in the House. I have heard it said in Fianna Fáil that when someone leaves the party to become an Independent or to join another party, if they go once they go twice.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)Every person born in the island of Ireland, regardless of citizenship, is entitled to sit in Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of an uncertainty that arose on Committee Stage. Bunreacht na hÉireann provides that every citizen of Ireland and any other person as prescribed by law is entitled to be a Member of Dáil Éireann. It further provides that any person who is entitled to be a Member of Dáil Éireann is entitled to be a Member of Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>The question I raised on Committee Stage relates in particular to two former Senators, Sam McAughtry and John Robb, who would have seen themselves as British citizens, in particular Sam McAughtry. Under the previous constitutional arrangements anybody born in this island was automatically a citizen of Ireland, whether they wished it or not. The new position is that people born in Northern Ireland are entitled to be but are not citizens of Ireland unless they ask to be or do something which makes them so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that we should not do anything to inhibit the intermittent but regular practice of nominating to this House people who can speak with the voice of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland or with an understanding of that community. If it is the case that only a citizen of Ireland can be a Member of this House, such people would have to take out Irish citizenship, which they could legitimately refuse to do. Otherwise they would not be eligible for membership of this House. They are not automatically citizens of Ireland any more, quite correctly because it implied a kind of imperial or colonialist claim on them. We should make it clear that people such as my two former colleagues, with one of whom I shared a considerable number of years in this House, will not be precluded from membership <Col N="286" /> of this House because of an unforeseen consequence of the changes to the Constitution, for example, because of the absence of a declaration of citizenship or an implication that they have chosen Irish over British citizenship. We should write into this Bill a statement that every person born on the island of Ireland, regardless of citizenship, is entitled to sit in Dáil Éireann. I put it like that because anybody who is entitled to sit in Dáil Éireann is entitled to sit in Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>I did not succeed in going through the Electoral Acts, so the Minister might tell me there is something in them. This is not an attempt to be awkward. I am concerned that we might have overlooked the possibility that citizens of Northern Ireland who choose to be British citizens would be excluded by these new provisions. They did not have to give up their British citizenship before because we said they were Irish citizens as well. I ask the Minister to address this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. Senator Ryan has done us a service in pointing out an act of omission rather than commission in that we might exclude citizens of Northern Ireland who do not opt for Irish passports from being nominated or elected to Seanad Éireann or Dáil Éireann. The input of those from Northern Ireland who have served in the Seanad has been extremely useful over the past ten years and one hopes it will continue. The current difficulties in Northern Ireland show how important it is to keep open every possible line of communication with all schools of thought there. It would be a pity if this legislation diminished the input which people, particularly from the Unionist tradition, could make to the debate on the affairs of this island. I am sure the Minister does not want that to happen as a result of the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment raises a matter briefly mentioned by Senator Ryan on Committee Stage, namely, the question in particular of the entitlement of persons from Northern Ireland who hold British passports to be members of the Seanad. He cites the example of two former respected Members of this House, John Robb and Sam McAughtry, and inquired whether by taking a seat in this House they would now in effect be exercising their entitlement, as people born on the island of Ireland, to Irish citizenship under the new section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Act of 1956, inserted by section 3 of the Bill. The concern of Senator Ryan and Senator Henry is that because it appears from Articles 16 and 18 of the Constitution that this is an act which only an Irish citizen can do, certain people from Northern Ireland might be dissuaded from following their footsteps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation did not arise heretofore for the reason that people born on the island of Ireland were effectively fixed with Irish citizenship. Section 6(1) of the 1956 Act makes this clear. It <Col N="287" /> states that &ldquo;every person born in Ireland is an Irish citizen from birth&rdquo;. Section 7(1) of the 1956 Act provides that &ldquo;pending the reintegration of the national territory, subsection (1) of section 6 shall not apply to a person, not otherwise an Irish citizen [this is, in effect, someone who is not a citizen by descent] born in Northern Ireland after 6 December 1922, unless, in the prescribed manner, that person . . . declares himself to be an Irish citizen . . . . .&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The effect of sections 6(1) and 7(1) as regards persons born in Northern Ireland is that most such people, irrespective of their desires in the matter, are Irish citizens in law. The section 7(1) declaration procedure is required only of a small number of people born there, such as children of United Kingdom nationals who were not from Northern Ireland or children of the small immigrant communities there. Others, being descended from Irish citizens and thus citizens by virtue of section 6(2), are exempt from the requirement. Oddly, the effect of section 7(1) for persons born in Northern Ireland is that if they can show that they are citizens by descent, they are thereby citizens by place of birth. The majority of the populace North and South are citizens both by descent and place of birth.</P>
    <P>The changes brought about by new Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution mean that the overt assertion of section 6(1) of the 1956 Act is replaced with an entitlement to Irish citizenship, and this is provided for in the new section 6(1) inserted by section 3 of the Bill. We have already discussed it in detail on Committee Stage. However, it is worth pointing out that by section 6(2)(<i>b</i>), the exercise of such an entitlement does not exclude one from holding British citizenship or any other citizenship at the same time. This is the concept of dual citizenship.</P>
    <P>The crucial difference between the provisions of the 1956 Act and in the Bill is that in the Bill citizenship by birth is, as it must be, by virtue of the new Article 2 of the Constitution, an entitlement. It is not just an entitlement of a statutory nature but it is also a constitutional entitlement because it has been inserted by the people in the Constitution. This would have a higher status than a legislative entitlement. Unless a person who is a member of, to use the term in the British-Irish Agreement, &ldquo;the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo;, born on the island of Ireland, does an act which only an Irish citizen can do, or there is something else in this Bill, for example, citizenship derived from parents, it cannot be presumed that that person is British or Irish. They could be either or both. It is like two sides of the same coin.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Senator Ryan is whether the taking of a seat in the House is an act contemplated by the new section 6(2)(<i>a</i>), that is, an act which only an Irish citizen is entitled to do. The follow on from that is whether, if this is so, it would dissuade a member of the Unionist community, which Senator Henry mentioned, from <Col N="288" /> taking a seat in the House. Article 18.2 of the Constitution deals with membership of this House. It states: &ldquo;A person to be eligible for membership of Seanad Éireann must be eligible to become a member of Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;  Membership of the Dáil is covered by Article 16.1.1º of the Constitution. It reads:</P>
    <P>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of twenty-one years, and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by this Constitution or by law, shall be eligible for membership of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan asked if other people are prescribed by law but there is no other category of people mentioned in the Constitution. He may be confusing that with the issue of citizens and people prescribed by law as having the right to vote, which is a different matter. It is contained in the same Article of the Constitution, so that confusion is understandable.</P>
    <P>The requirement to hold Irish citizenship is essential under the Constitution for membership of either House of the Oireachtas. Senator Ryan's amendment is framed in a way which attempts to circumvent that constitutional requirement by stating that birth on the island of Ireland, not citizenship, constitutes an entitlement to sit in both Houses. Such an amendment would require a constitutional amendment as opposed to legislative change. That is because the Constitution specifies that to be a Member of this House or the other House one must be a citizen. We cannot change that by legislation. That is because the constitutional provisions in question, at Articles 16 and 18, are in absolute terms under the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>I hope, however, that the people of Northern Ireland who identify themselves and expect to be accepted as British only would not be dissuaded from taking a seat in this House. It has worked well in the past when the constitutional requirements for membership of the House were the same as they are now. I accept that the changed circumstances have the potential to make this an issue. This need not necessarily be the case. The assertion of an entitlement to Irish citizenship does not require a person to disavow British citizenship or any other citizenship. As Senator Ryan pointed out, membership of either House does not require a person to take an oath of allegiance to the State.</P>
    <P>While I thank Senator Ryan for raising this issue, and note Senator Henry's interest, I ask him to withdraw the amendment on the basis that the change he seeks can only be achieved by an amendment to the Constitution and not to this Bill. I have taken advice and all the indications are that there is no scope for legislative changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a disaster. I must have misread the Constitution because I understood that the Constitution did allow for provision by law, in addition to what is in the Constitution, but obviously that is for voting, not for membership. <Col N="289" /> In a genuine and well-intentioned attempt to be more tolerant and liberal in our definition of citizenship and to understand the sensitivities of the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland, we have put into the Constitution a provision which will make it significantly more difficult to encourage people from that community to accept membership of this House. Previously they did not have to be asked about citizenship &ndash; the issue could be fudged. They were not asked if they were Irish citizens because there was no question of choice. We effectively compelled them, or purported to compel them, to be Irish citizens, whatever else they wanted. We have now given them a choice, quite correctly, but the consequence of their choice is that either they cannot be nominated by a Taoiseach to this House or, if they are nominated, they must agree that by accepting that nomination they are citizens of this State.</P>
      <P>I cannot speak for either of the two people from the Unionist tradition who have been mentioned, but Senator McAughtry, in particular, was quite adamant that he was British. He said he was British and Irish, but the passport he held was British. This is an unintended but quite serious negative consequence of something we all support.</P>
      <P>If a constitutional amendment is needed, we ought to have one. Otherwise if we are to engage in any attempt to have some Northern representation in this House, and many have suggested that should be the case, only those from the Nationalist tradition will feel entirely comfortable. Those extreme Unionists in Northern Ireland who would be opposed to it will be able to tell their more benevolent colleagues that these people have accepted citizenship of the Republic of Ireland because they cannot be in the Irish Parliament if they have not. That is a quite significant disaster, which will not bring the edifice down around our shoulders but will exclude an initiative we had begun.</P>
      <P>Members of this House, as I was when Senator Robb was here, and as others were when Senator McAughtry was here, will tell you that it was a unique individual voice which gave people an understanding of a community and a tradition which many of us do not understand very well. People who come from that tradition will now have to explicitly accept dual citizenship or to accept that nomination to this House implies the acceptance of dual citizenship. At the very least, that will dramatically narrow the options available to the future Taoisigh to nominate people from Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many liberal Unionists who would probably go along with it, but this makes it difficult for them. People such as Senator Robb and Senator McAughtry who come here and talk to us are criticised for it. That will be further compounded now. The Minister accepts the situation is more difficult. Under the old regime they were citizens whether they wanted to be or not. Now they have to accept that they are citizens &ndash; it is their personal choice. The difference is that <Col N="290" /> before there was no choice; now it is their personal choice. In future anybody from that tradition will have to make the personal choice to accept at least dual citizenship. They may not want to and many of them would not dream of it. Everybody negotiated this together, it is nobody's fault, but it is a very serious issue which merits a constitutional amendment, at the earliest opportunity, to state that anybody born on the island of Ireland is entitled to be a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are back to where we started long ago when this Bill began, on the question of the extraordinary need felt by the Minister to be able to second-guess even the admittedly more stringent conditions he has imposed. He has taken away the simple procedure of a declaration upon being married and staying married for three years, and substituted a list of other conditions, some of which are reasonable, such as of full age, marriage to a citizen, in a subsisting marriage and others. Just to be sure, having said that someone must fulfil all those conditions, he wants to retain for himself and his successors the right to say 'no' for reasons he has never given us, under circumstances he cannot explain to us. Our amendment simply states that where the Minister is satisfied that the conditions in paragraphs <i> (a)</i> to <i>(i)</i>of section 15A(1), with some amendments, are met, he shall grant them citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is least an Irish citizen can expect when their spouse is seeking citizenship and they meet the tests set down. Once the Minister is satisfied with those, and they tighten up the legislation considerably over the previous position, then he should not seek absolute discretion to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Absolute discretion, as interpreted by Ministers <Col N="291" /> for Justice, means that they do no have to indicate why. They can just refuse.</P>
    <P>He accepts that he is bound by the rules of natural justice, but the rules of natural justice as interpreted in this case do not mean he has to elaborate on his refusal. A bona fide applicant may meet all those conditions but reasons not known, or information the Minister will not share, will still be used to refuse him. That is not the hallmark of a liberal democracy and it is most assuredly not something consistent with the traditions of a State, half the citizens of which are probably living outside its jurisdiction. That is unique and perhaps one of the reasons that motivated previous Governments to make a quite liberal provision for citizenship by marriage was that so many citizens were living outside the State. Now there are additional complications which are bad enough, but may be necessary. On top of these additional complications there is absolute discretion.</P>
    <P>The first of my amendments is to remove the phrase, &ldquo;may, in his or her absolute discretion,&rdquo; from line 34 and substitutes &ldquo;shall&rdquo;  so that the section would read, &ldquo;Notwithstanding the provisions of section 15 the Minister shall grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation to the non-national spouse of an Irish citizen if satisfied that the applicant&mdash;&rdquo;. That is the provision we wish to make and the basis of my amendment.</P>

      <P>When we discussed these sections on Committee Stage, I queried the number of cases arising. I was given a ball park figure of 1,000 investigations taking place at any one time. With the aid of my assistant, Eoin Feeney, a student in Trinity College, I managed to get some more information. It was more alarming than I had expected. I did not realise that so many cases involved Irish people living in England. When we are teaching citizenship courses in schools, we should explain to people that getting married is serious, that it means something, whether it takes place in a registry office or not. It is curious that people who claim to be married cannot produce any photographs of the occasion. Someone took at least a snap at most of our weddings.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Department of Education and Science could take some action. The Department of Foreign Affairs has been very helpful in this area but the Minister for Education and Science could insert something about marriage into the school citizenship courses. Some people are entering into this contract in a casual manner. I was disappointed to find the large number of cases involved.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge Senator Henry's magnanimity in accepting the situation is serious where abuse of the citizenship process is concerned. The Senator has recognised, as I have, that citizenship is not a right when it is applied for by a non-national; it is a privilege which is conferred on an individual by the State and its <Col N="292" /> Government. As Senator Henry pointed out, there is a degree of abuse in relation to citizenship applications and that is unacceptable. Marriages of convenience are being used in this respect. Senator Henry is correct in stating that marriage is serious. In those circumstances it would do no harm to advise young people just how serious it is.</P>
      <P>We have already had a lengthy debate on Committee Stage on the issue of ministerial discretion and, therefore, what I have to say here will be largely familiar ground. I have already emphasised that the principle of ministerial discretion is one which has long been a feature of the exercise of government and has long been recognised by the courts. I remind Senators again that the High and Supreme Courts have pronounced that matters concerning non-nationals are properly for the discretion of the Executive. The most recent judicial pronouncement to this effect was in the Laurentiu case, a landmark judgment, in 1999.</P>
      <P>The Executive exercises the powers to deal with non-nationals through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is, of course, the case that this discretion must be exercised in a fair and responsible manner consistent with the principles of natural justice; no Minister can act on a whim or unreasonably. The courts would not be slow to admonish such capricious action. The powers must be exercised within the framework of legislation which exists, in this case the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts. That legislation, very properly in my view, acknowledges the nature of the executive power being dealt with by providing that naturalisation decisions are in the absolute discretion of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan spoke on Committee Stage of taking away a right in relation to the provision in the Bill to abolish post-nuptial declarations of citizenship. This right, as was pointed out at the time, was created by statute and its removal does not in any way breach the State's obligations under international law or its human rights commitments, nor does it breach any constitutional right or obligation. The present procedure is vulnerable to abuse, and this Bill replaces that procedure with one which is less vulnerable to abuse. The exercise of absolute discretion has always been a feature of citizenship law as it relates to naturalisation, and this Bill proposes to apply that discretion to a matter which is also a proper subject for that discretion, the new naturalisation provisions for spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The granting of citizenship is a privilege and the exercise of that choice is an executive function. I see no reason why it should not be in the discretion of the Minister to grant an application for naturalisation provided that the Minister exercises that power, as he or she must do, in a way consistent with the principles of natural justice. Regarding amendment No. 7, in circumstances where the Minister is charged with the exercise of his or her discretion, he or she is not obliged to provide reasons but is, of course, required to act in a manner consistent with fair procedures <Col N="293" /> and natural justice. Accordingly, in the context of an application for naturalisation by a spouse of an Irish citizen, the Minister would have to give careful and detailed consideration to the application. Discretion does not allow the Minister to act on a whim.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the case law in this area is that a requirement to give reasons would be inconsistent with the nature of the discretion. I draw the attention of Senators to the 1986 High Court case of Pok Sun Shun, in which Mr. Justice Costello had to consider the exercise of this discretion in the context of naturalisation. He concluded that the dictates of natural or constitutional justice did not in general require the Minister to give an applicant a hearing or inform him of the reasons for his decision. Mr. Justice Costello further pointed out that the Minister, having established that all the conditions set out in section 15 of the 1956 Act have been satisfied, might still refuse a certificate of naturalisation on grounds of public policy which had nothing to do with the individual application.</P>
    <P>The views of Mr. Justice Costello were referred to with approval in the later High Court judgment of Mr. Justice Kelly in the case of Mishra in 1996, also involving a naturalisation application. In that judgment Justice Kelly went on to say the following:</P>
    <P>. . . it must be borne in mind that the award of a certificate of naturalisation is a privilege and not a right. The fact that an applicant may comply with all of the statutory provisions set out in section 15 of the Act does not mean that it automatically follows that he is entitled to citizenship. If such were the case, there would be no discretion at all vested in the Minister. She would become a mere cipher who when satisfied that statutory requirements of section 15 were met would be obliged to grant citizenship. . .</P>
    <P>As was said on Committee Stage, the question of conferring citizenship on a non-national is ultimately a matter for the executive arm of Government. The Legislature can quite properly set out guidelines for the exercise of executive discretion. The democratic processes involved in the choosing of the members of the Executive, and the answerability of the Government, both individually and collectively to Parliament, are sufficient to ensure that discretion will be exercised in the interest of the common good. We cannot proceed on the premise that Ministers, duly appointed by the President on the nomination of the Taoiseach, and with the prior approval of Dáil Éireann, whatever party they may represent, have to be bound hand and foot in carrying out statutory functions on the basis that otherwise they could not be trusted to carry them out properly and fairly. Senators would not support such an approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listen to the words &ndash; fair, reasonable and according to the principles of natural <Col N="294" /> justice. Some judgments of courts state that the Minister has the right to exercise his discretion in secret without having to give people reasons. That is what the courts stated under the law and the Constitution, but that does not mean it is right and that is the issue which the Minister has not addressed since this debate began. He has consistently run for cover on the question of naturalisation generally and refused to confront the fact that this is a particular sub-set, which is the application for naturalisation of people who are married to Irish citizens. The courts have not ruled on that particular set of circumstances because to date the Minister had no discretion.</P>
      <P>What we are talking about here is a spouse of a citizen of Ireland, potentially the father or mother of children who are citizens of Ireland, who applies for naturalisation and to whom the State will say that even if the person's spouse is Irish, the person's children are Irish and the person meets all the conditions which are set down in a tortuous and detailed amendment to the previous legislation, the Minister may still say no and, having said so, he or she need not condescend to explain that to the person. That is a different situation because we are not talking about non-nationals in general but about the spouses of Irish citizens and potentially the mothers or fathers of Irish citizens. The Minister refuses to concede even for a second that that might be different. He quotes, correctly I am sure, previous judgments about entirely different conditions, where the people were not necessarily spouses. These people are all spouses of Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>Under the conditions the Minister has set down, they will, if our amendments are not accepted, have had to live in the country for a continuous period of one year's residence, will have had to live in the country for two years of the previous four years and will have to show that he or she intends in good faith to continue to reside in the island. What the Minister is actually saying is that even if the person satisfies these conditions, he will still reserve to himself the right to say &lsquo;no' and the right not to explain why he is saying &lsquo;no'. I find that quite extraordinary.</P>
      <P>He will make no concessions to what are Irish families and Irish children which are different from the powers he has which the courts have upheld. Significantly he quotes judgments in which he lost as if he had won in the case of one of the most recent ones. In fact, the court stated that many of the things he was doing were wrong. I must remind him that it was only the courts and not the enlightened view of his Department which got applicants for asylum out of jail while their applications were being processed. The judgments of successive Ministers for Justice in this area are at the very least questionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of great regret that the control freak instinct, which seems to take over every Minister for Justice, has taken over here yet again and that absolute discretion is being retained. It is a matter of regret that even if the Minister <Col N="295" /> insists on the maybe/possibly but arrangement, he must be able to still say no. He will not even condescend to tell the spouse of an Irish citizen, the mother or father of Irish citizens, why precisely she or he is not allowed Irish citizenship. What a wonderful way to be.</P>
    <P>He constantly defends himself on the grounds that he is not intolerant or illiberal but he shows instincts on something like this, where we accept there is some evidence of abuse of a right which used to exist and, because there is some evidence of an abuse of that right, he decides to abolish the right completely. It is a matter of great regret.</P>
    <P>He asked me to suggest amendments and I have gone to the considerable difficulty of doing so. I can tell the House what will happen. His colleague, the Tánaiste, will discover in about a year that many Irish people living abroad now discover that their spouses have no certainty of Irish citizenship. They will discover yet another obstacle to persuading the large number of highly skilled Irish people working abroad to come home because they will return to the absolute discretion <Col N="296" /> of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the security and citizenship of their spouses. As I said, what we will have, yet again, is the control freak instinct of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the belief that rights are dangerous and that only absolute discretion is safe, and the determination to explain nothing and to use the rhetoric of the liberal, of being fair, reasonable and consistent with the principles of natural justice. That same Department believed that being fair, reasonable and consistent with the principles of natural justice left the victims of Tiananmen Square locked up in Mountjoy Jail for 18 months because it believed those people had no rights. That is the mentality and the culture out of which this has come. I have endeavoured to be reasonable and to put the point to minimise the harm and reduce the uncertainty in the interests particularly of Irish emigrants and I have got precisely nothing. It is a matter of great regret but I am not surprised.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete line 38, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) is not a serious threat to either public order or the common good,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One accepts the validity of the Minister's case that what had been a formal declaration &ndash; which was perhaps appropriate in another and more innocent age, when the world and its wife did not see the desirability of living in Ireland and when the majority of our citizens tended to take the opposite view and leave the country, leading to extraordinary levels of emigration &ndash; needed to be tightened up. However, it would have been possible to do so in language that was, at least, reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains a list of matters the Minister must be satisfied about before he will consider an application for citizenship on the grounds of marriage. The second condition is that the applicant should be of &ldquo;good character&rdquo;. One would <Col N="297" /> not argue with that principle in general. However, I am sorry I must keep repeating that we are not talking here about people at large but about the spouses of Irish citizens and, in many cases, the fathers and mothers of Irish citizens. We are saying the Minister must be satisfied they are of &ldquo;good character&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have a different view. I think the Minister should be satisfied they are not of sufficiently bad character to be a threat to the wellbeing of society. The Minister or the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, gave the example of Arkan. The Minister is a good lawyer and is well trained. While <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> might be a useful argument, it is not very logical. There are about 100 other provisions of law which could deal with an individual as obnoxious as Arkan if one should come to live on our shores. The other provisions of this section would ensure he would have to be living here before he could apply for citizenship, in which case he could be arrested under about six different international conventions. Therefore, I would not worry about Arkan. However, I would worry about the spouses of Irish citizens with past convictions.</P>
    <P>We are suggesting that, instead of this ambiguous and uncertain phrase, the test should be stronger. We suggest deleting the words &ldquo;is of good character&rdquo; and that, instead, the Minister should be satisfied that the applicant &ldquo;is not a serious threat to either public order or the common good&rdquo;. The amendment contains the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo;, at least.</P>
    <P>The Minister lays great emphasis on the fact that nobody should be too worried about a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform acting in an arbitrary fashion. Unfortunately, the record of his Department and of previous Ministers has been one of acting in a somewhat arbitrary fashion. As I said, it had to be reprimanded on more than one occasion by the courts for the arbitrariness of its actions in the procedures for detaining asylum seekers and for deportation. Those were just two occasions in the past number of years when the Department was found to be acting in an arbitrary fashion. The record is not great and inserting ambiguities such as &ldquo;is of good character&rdquo; invites that record to reassert itself. It would be better to use a form of words to deal with people who we believe should not be in this State in the first place, rather than using petty offences committed in people's youth or minor offences which are technical breaches of the criminal law to say people are not of good character.</P>
    <P>The problem with legislation emanating from the Minister's Department is that it always contains a load of hoops for the applicant to go through but, in the end, the Minister retains his absolute discretion. We cannot at this stage get rid of that discretion, which the Minister is determined to hold on to, but we could invite him to explain why the spouses of Irish citizens would not, at least, have to be of some threat to society before they could be refused citizenship, given <Col N="298" /> that the Minister accepts that a spouse would have the right to reside here, almost without qualification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. We do not want drug barons and notorious criminals who marry Irish citizens being able to obtain Irish citizenship if they fulfil the other requirements. However, this amendment would cover such cases and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the proposed substitute for the term &ldquo;good character&rdquo; put forward in this amendment adds anything by way of improvement to the new section. On the contrary, I am of the view that it is a considerable disimprovement. It will hinder the understandability of the provision for those seeking naturalisation, and it will leave an unexplained and unnecessary inconsistency between the conditions for naturalisation of a spouse, on the one hand, and of any other applicant for naturalisation on the other.</P>
      <P>Good character encompasses a range of circumstances of which the issue of a serious threat to either public order or the common good is only a part. No satisfactory explanation is offered in support of the proposal that the other aspects of a person which are encompassed in the concept of &ldquo;good character&rdquo; should be omitted from the reckoning. Is a Minister to naturalise someone on the basis that he or she would pose only a minor threat to public order or the common good? There is the possibility that a person's presence in the State is not so serious a threat to public order or the common good as to warrant deportation &ndash; for instance, an active petty criminal who is the parent of an Irish child or has the protection of the State as a refugee &ndash; but is quite serious enough not to warrant granting that person Irish citizenship. We can or must tolerate the person's presence in the State, but that does not mean we have to honour that person with the privilege of Irish citizenship.</P>
      <P>Is the serious threat to public order or the common good confined to Ireland? It would seem that this is necessarily so. Is it possible, for example, that a minor acolyte or fellow traveller of the notorious Arkan, to whom the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, referred, who had indirect involvement in his activities could argue that he or she is not a serious threat to public order or the common good here? I know Senator Ryan is not enamoured by the Arkan example but it serves to illustrate the point that we should be very careful about refining this criteria further beyond good character. The example simply serves to caution that the words in the amendment exclude cases which, by any reasonable consideration, should not be considered as meeting requirements for citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister, I have to be careful about choosing examples to illustrate points I make in debate. The example of Arkan was chosen because the man is dead and I can thus speak freely about <Col N="299" /> him in a hypothetical way. I deliberately avoid drawing examples from those who are still alive, however internationally notorious they may be, since there exists the possibility &ndash; perhaps remote, but a possibility nonetheless &ndash; that I, or a successor in my office, may be called on to make decisions in relation to such a person in the future.</P>
    <P>I prefer to stay with the concept of good character, which is well understood in the context in which it is used in the Bill and captures the meaning intended, rather than go for the formulation of the amendment which fails to achieve the desired effect and may have unintended ones.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to make out what case, or perhaps combination of cases, Senator Ryan referred to when he spoke of victims of Tiananmen Square being kept in an Irish jail for 18 months. I am aware of one case, that of a Libyan, where the courts found that the asylum procedures and the process leading to the making of a deportation order had been properly gone through and where attempts to enforce the order were proper, even though the conduct of the deportee was such that the order could not be enforced. In that case, the courts found the continued detention of the individual beyond two months could not be sustained. The extreme behaviour of the individual concerned on more than one occasion meant that no airline pilot would take him as a passenger. That case was decided in the mid-1990s and was remote in time from 1989 and the nationality of the individual from Beijing. If Senator Ryan has further information on to this matter, I would only be too delighted to hear it because I am not aware of the case.</P>
    <P>In that context, the debate on immigration, whether dealing with this amendment or, indeed, generally, has been peppered with misrepresentations, intentional and unintentional, both inside and outside the House.</P>

      <P>I am not referring specifically to Senator Ryan and I wish he would not make false accusations. Like it or not, the conferring of citizenship is not a right. The conferring of citizenship on a non-national is a privilege and to suggest for a moment that any of the conditions, including this one, being inserted at this point on a non-national spouse are intended to inhibit or frustrate a genuine applicant is, to say the least, mischievous and, at worst, dishonest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>These conditions and the new procedures are being inserted in order to ensure that there will not be the kind of abuse in regard to applications for Irish citizenship by people who engage in marriages of convenience, which we have had to put up with in the past. It <Col N="300" /> is a reasonable and fair position and is meant to ensure that people cannot abuse the process of Irish citizenship and obtain Irish passports, which are a very valuable commodity, on the basis of abuse. Such a provision exists not only in this jurisdiction, but is common in democratic jurisdictions throughout the world. There is nothing illiberal, conservative or remotely unfair about it. It is about protecting our citizenship laws and ensuring they are not abused.</P>
      <P>I have seen a tendency during the course of the debate on immigration &ndash; I am not citing Senator Ryan &ndash; for people to be demonised by those who profess to be liberals. This demonisation process is because people honestly believe there should and must be controls to prevent abuse. I do not believe it is the mark of any true liberal that demonisation would become the norm or the order of the day just because people are trying to ensure that the fair procedures and procedures of natural justice of the State are adhered to.</P>
      <P>In respect of every condition contained in this and any other legislation in which I was involved, I can say honestly, without fear or favour, that at all times a genuine attempt was made to ensure people's human dignity was respected, that there were fair procedures and that there was natural justice. That is precisely what we are doing here. The exercise of discretion by a Minister cannot be contemplated unless there is natural justice and the procedures are fair.</P>
      <P>I cannot put it more strongly than that but, no doubt, we will continue to listen to arguments which are spurious, facetious and even false. No doubt, there will be those on the other side of the debate who profess themselves to be liberal and who will reduce themselves to name calling again, but I always say that when one is reduced to name calling, one has lost the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously we touched a few nerves. Let me repeat that when a Minister keeps to himself, even if it is constitutionally permissible, absolute discretion to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; without explanation, that is illiberal and is the antithesis of the way we assume we deal with people. The fact people do not have the rights of citizens does not make them subhuman. The fact our Constitution does not give the same protection, because it could not do so, to people who are not citizens of this State does not mean that those to whom our Constitution does not extend those rights are somehow unworthy of equal treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this Minister is saying, and has said for the past five minutes in his little rant which, among other things, attempted to impugn my honesty, is that because they are not Irish they do not count. Whether they are Irish or not they are entitled to be treated with dignity. When they are the spouses of Irish citizens they are part of an Irish family. The Constitution which this Minister supports, which I support and which his party's founding leader drew up, quite correctly gave a special place to the family in Irish life. What the Minister is now saying is that part of an Irish fam<Col N="301" /> ily does not have rights, because he or she is not an Irish citizen, and he is happy to take away the rights he or she used to have. He is completely wrong.</P>
    <P>As regards the story he said was not true, if it is not true &ndash; I will check with my sources &ndash; I will come to the House and correct it. I have no desire to stand over it. There are, however, many people seeking asylum in this country who are afraid to make their cases public because they believe that if they are critical of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it will put their case in jeopardy. If the Minister was prepared to come out from behind his defence of absolute discretion on this and other issues, we would have less fear and uncertainty. The Minister wants to have it both ways. He wants to have the right to do whatever he believes is right under the circumstances and the right not to have to explain it unless somebody brings him to the High Court or the Supreme Court, which people usually cannot do. He would be better off addressing his determination to have it both ways and spending less of his time trying to impugn my motives.</P>
    <P>My job here is to address the fact that section 20 of the explanatory memorandum states, &ldquo;The conditions for naturalisation of the non-national spouse of an Irish citizen are that&mdash;&rdquo;. That is not true. The wording should read, &ldquo;The conditions for application for naturalisation by a non-national spouse are that&mdash;&rdquo;.  The ultimate condition is not among those set out on pages 4 and 5 of the explanatory memorandum. They are the hoops an applicant must jump through before he or she can apply. The Minister must be satisfied the applicant has jumped through the hoops and can then decide at his or her &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; whether to accept the application.</P>
    <P>If we were to have a wonderful open, liberal governance and observe the democratic and liberal niceties, that section would not be written in that way. The Minister can get up on his sanctimonious high horse as often as he wishes, but he cannot get away from the fact that he said in this House this country will have a huge glut of asylum seekers. That phrase was unworthy of a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is responsible for dealing with a delicate issue.</P>
    <P>Many of us say things during our careers that we might regret a moment later. My experience over the best part of 20 years of the Minister's Department is one of irrationality concerning individuals, particularly those with dark skins, who are allowed come into this country &ndash; their attitude is impossible to explain otherwise. I attended a conference in Dalgan Park in 1992 at which one of the most distinguished development economists from South America was to speak. He was detained for three hours in Dublin Airport by officials of the Minister's Department for the sole reason that his skin was dark.</P>
    <P>Anecdote after anecdote is fed back to those of us who want to listen. The anecdotal evidence is overwhelming. Such things happen not at the direction of this Minister but because of an atti<Col N="302" /> tude and a culture that has developed in that Department over many years. So many people have stories and anecdotes to tell about this that we have good reason to be wary of all proposals to give more discretion to Ministers in that Department.</P>
    <P>As for the argument about my amendment, I have no idea who writes this stuff for the Minister. The emphasis in my amendment is on serious offences. If the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not know the difference between serious and non-serious offences, public order and a serious threat to public order and has not some understanding of what the constitutional term &ldquo;the common good&rdquo; means, he should get a new group of advisers to explain those terms to him. The phrase &ldquo;of good character&rdquo; is too low a threshold for the spouse of an Irish citizen because we will never know what test the Minister uses, so we are trying to make it a little less generous in regard to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Does a conviction for possession of cannabis at the age of 18 constitute a lack of good character on the part of the spouse of an Irish citizen with three children who are Irish citizens who wants to apply for citizenship? The Minister will not tell us the answer because he does not have to and he has no intention of telling us anything about how the mysterious processes of his Department work out these matters because he has absolute discretion and a court decision determined that he could hold on to it. He can hold on to it, but it will not make what he is doing any better. It is an offence to Irish citizens living abroad and takes away from them any degree of legal certainty about the future status of their spouses.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 3 to 5.</P>
      <P>Let me check where we are at in this ritual. To gain citizenship, the non-national spouse of an Irish citizen must be of full age, of good character, married to a citizen for three years, in a marriage recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting, the couple have to satisfy the Minister by affidavit that they are still married and at the time of application they must have had a period of one year's continuous residence in the island of Ireland, but to be sure, during the four years immediately preceding that period they must have had a total residence in the island of Ireland amounting to two years. This is a Minister who retains absolute discretion about such applications, in spite of all these conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country is one of the great trading nations of the world. It is trying to encourage its labour force to be flexible. It is trying to attract emigrants home and has people working and travelling abroad. In the case of a couple where an Irish <Col N="303" /> person is married to a non-national, that couple had better plant themselves firmly here. In order for the non-national spouse to gain citizenship, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform requires that such a couple must have lived here for two of the last four years, even if they have lived here for 12 months continuously. Who is he fooling? This is profound illiberality. Such a requirement is the same as using a JCB to plant a cabbage. Section 15A(1)(<i>g</i>) states, &ldquo;had, during the 4 years immediately preceding that period, [a period of 12 months continuous residence in Ireland] a total residence in the island of Ireland amounting to 2 years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If people are getting married for a few hundred quid to get around the old position, then the Minster has a point, but when he goes from the position we had to requiring that such a couple must have lived here for 12 months and have lived here for two of the previous four years, he is going from one extreme to the other. The other extreme is where this Department likes to be &ndash; in a position of total control. It likes to be there because it is a Department run with a control freak culture. It must always have the last word on everything, never mind citizens' rights. This is a classic over-reaction. Such couples could put up with the requirement that they must have lived here for 12 months. We must not forget all the other requirements they must meet and on top of those they must now prove that they resided in the island of Ireland for two of the last four years. That requirement is an over-reaction, it is disproportionate and should not be there.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. I will not labour the point. As I said on Committee Stage, there are many people here who work for international firms and, with great ease, are transferred abroad. They can be based abroad for two years, here for a year and abroad for another two years. This criterion would be almost impossible for such people to fulfil. I ask the Minister if this stipulation could be removed.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister intend to implement the provision at paragraph (<i>e</i>) that the citizens are living together as husband and wife? Surely a person or a spouse could be away for six or 12 months, as pointed out by various Members. What criteria will he put in place to define that they are living together or how does he define living together?</P>

      <P>The deletion of the requirement of paragraph (<i>g</i>) of the proposed new <Col N="304" /> section 15A(1) would reduce to one unbroken year the requirement of residence in Ireland for non-national spouses. The period of residence required for spouses is already greatly reduced compared to the normal naturalisation requirements. There must be some established links based on marriage and residence in Ireland. Three years' residence over the previous five years demonstrates a reasonable commitment to Ireland and is in line with provisions in many other European states. This legislation is not unique to this country. It does not illustrate any xenophobic tendency. I do not intend to make a steel cage out of our national boundaries. This legislation is common across Europe and the free world.  The conferring of citizenship on an individual who is a non-national is not a right, it is a privilege bestowed by this State through its elected Executive. I am satisfied that the proposed new section 15A offers a reasonable concessionary discount for spouses as against the normal requirement for naturalisation of five years out of the previous nine and I do not propose to accept any further reduction. As a holder of a Justice or Interior Ministry, I am not exceptional in bringing forward a measure like this.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan referred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as if it were, in some way, seeking to trammel people's rights or trampling on the rights of citizens and non-nationals alike. One of the truly great repositories of human rights in this State since its foundation has been the Department of Justice. If Members want the history I will give it to them. The Succession Act, 1965, was widely regarded as one of the finest and most enlightened pieces of legislation of its age and it came from the Department. The Land Acts, which did so much for Irish tenant farmers at the time and afterwards when the fee system was vested also came from the Department. In more recent times and during my time, the Employment Equality Act brought about equality in society and came from the Department. The Equal Status Bill is going through the Houses of the Oireachtas. It expresses the right of travellers and anyone who might have been discriminated against in the past in regard to services and gives them equality of treatment. It also comes from the Department. The Human Rights Commission Bill, 1999, set up a commission here to guarantee people's human rights. That too emanated from the Department in recent times and it is recognised across many groups, not just in this State but across Europe, who have studied it as one of the finest and most enlightened pieces of legislation of its age. In addition, the Status of Children Act, 1987, which was a revolutionary Act of its time, came from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am deeply saddened that the Department which has been the champion and repository of human rights in this State has become the target &ndash; and I am not citing Senator Ryan &ndash; of pseudo liberals across this country who seek to suggest that the protection of the rights of Irish citizens <Col N="305" /> by the Department is something to be frowned upon and regarded as a shame on the nation. I reject all those arguments for what they are. They are spurious nonsense. They are bar room talk. They do not represent common sense nor the views of middle Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity we are not on television because there are wonderful histrionics going on. I have frequently cited the experience of young teenage Asians from Shipley College in Bradford. On two occasions they attempted to come here on school tours but they were refused visas by the Department. Notwithstanding the clarion call for human rights no one from that Department, nobody from this bastion of liberalism, has ever offered me a whit of an explanation why 15 year old teenagers could not visit here for three days on a visitor's visa. This happened in two successive years. We do not know why they were refused the first year but I suspect when the second application was made the Department wanted to get its own back because of the trouble caused by the first refusal. It was so embarrassing that there were motions tabled on the Order Paper of the House of Commons criticising the behaviour of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That is the truth of it. This is the same Department whose Secretary General would not allow his photograph to appear in the IPA Yearbook until recent years. The Minister, the Chief of Staff and the Garda Commissioner allowed their photographs to be published but the Secretary General could not appear because he was too secret. That is true. Members can try to find his photograph in the IPA Yearbook from five years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has security considerations. He took on the job of Minister and he knew there was a risk involved but he is willing to be identified. The Secretary General at the Department of Defence and all prison governors have security considerations but one person was above being photographed. That is what I do not like about the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform no matter how much I like the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister keeps leaving out of this debate the fact that we are not talking about citizenship applications by non-nationals but about members <Col N="306" /> of Irish families and that is what the spouse of an Irish citizen is. The Minister ducks, weaves and talks of irrelevancies but he will not confront the reality that what we are dealing with here is the position of Irish families.</P>
    <P>The second thing he keep on citing is the fact that this is not unique. A number of European countries are similar to us in allowing citizenship by marriage. The Minister mentioned them in his speech on Second Stage, which unfortunately I do not have. At least two of them had one major thing in common with Ireland &ndash; they had experienced large-scale emigration. So many of their citizens lived outside the state and that was the practical reason they accepted citizenship by marriage. We are still in that position however, happily, we may have reversed it in recent years. That is why this is different and difficult and will be a further obstacle to persuading Irish people to return home.</P>
    <P>As Senator Paddy Burke said, we also come and go. Many of us now work among the world's most successful multinationals. Many of us who work for them are recognised as being particularly good. Therefore, we come from abroad with our spouses from outside Ireland and then we go abroad again with our spouses. We work in successful multinationals generating employment and wealth in this State. However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has stated that even though an Irish emigrant may be contributing enormously to the State, his or her spouse cannot become an Irish citizen unless the couple have lived in this country for three out of the past five years. It does not matter how successful these people are, their spouses cannot obtain citizenship.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not confront the fact that he is not dealing with the great mass of applicants, he is dealing with Irish families. Will he explain why Irish families are obliged to put up with such behaviour even before their cases are left at his absolute discretion? Why cannot the Minister make genuine liberal concessions to Irish families living in Ireland? Does he believe there is a conspiracy of such gargantuan proportions that these people will come to Ireland, live here for a year, meet the other conditions, sign affidavits and then bolt or is he just tightening up the law relating to citizenship for foreigners because his Department likes doing so?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 13, to delete &ldquo;in his or her absolute discretion,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to explain the context of this amendment. We have been discussing the section of the Bill dealing with the circumstances under which the spouse of an Irish citizen may apply for naturalisation. Section 5(2) contains the provision which is intended to be enlightened whereby, under certain circumstances, the Minister may waive some of the conditions. The section states that the Minister may, in his or her absolute discretion, waive some of the conditions, &ldquo;if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Why does the Minister wish to insert the phrase, &ldquo;in his or her absolute discretion&rdquo; under circumstances where he is &ldquo;satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship&rdquo;? Are we seriously suggesting that a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would refuse to waive the condition even if satisfied that the spouse of an Irish citizen, who wishes to become an Irish citizen, would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted that citizenship? It is not as if the Minister would have to investigate the case and then make a decision. The section says that, even if the Minister is satisfied that the consequences of not granting citizenship would be that someone would suffer physical harm or loss of liberty, he or she might still refuse to waive some of the conditions.</P>
      <P>In reasonably precise and unemotional language, I would like to know why it is necessary to include a condition in legislation which states that, even if someone could be hurt or have their liberty impaired, a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform might refuse to expedite an application for citizenship? This amendment seeks to address this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. If the consequences of not being granted Irish citizenship would be so serious for an applicant that, for example, his or her bodily integrity or liberty would be affected, it is impossible to consider that any Minister would need to rely on his or her discretion to grant citizenship.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister is in a no-win situation. He is being castigated on the one hand on the matter of &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; and, on the other hand, in relation to the inclusion of an option to waive some of the restrictions in certain limited circumstances. It is an unfortunate situation in which to be. The arguments we have heard are contradictory. In one instance the Minister is being criticised for the inclusion of the phrase, &ldquo;in his or her absolute discretion&rdquo;. However, he is also being criticised for including the right to waive certain restrictions or clauses, as outlined in the amendment. He seems to be getting the short end of the stick on both counts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 seeks to remove the words &ldquo;in his or her absolute discre<Col N="309" /> tion&rdquo; in subsection (2). Just as it is right that the question of granting naturalisation must be a matter of absolute discretion, and I have cited a considerable amount of very learned legal thought on this, decisions to waive certain of the conditions for naturalisation must also be matters of discretion. To have it otherwise would create an unworkable internal inconsistency in the new section 15A. It would also be inconsistent with its parallel provision at section 16 of the 1956 Act which deals with waiver of the conditions for normal naturalisation.</P>
      <P>The two systems of naturalisation would exist side by side. A spouse who does not meet all of the conditions for naturalisation under the new special scheme may, nonetheless, in his or her own right meet the conditions for naturalisation provided for under section 15 of the 1956 Act or may be a suitable candidate for waiver of some of those conditions under section 16 of that Act.</P>
      <P>A Minister considering an application for naturalisation in the future will have to consider it against the legislative framework of the totality of the naturalisation provisions, that is, the present sections 15 and 16 and the new section 15A. If some matters are to be matters of discretion, as they properly are at present, and others matters of statutory right, the position arises where no decision can sensibly be made because the conflict between the two is incapable of resolution. That is perfectly logical.</P>
      <P>The position is clear. I have outlined it in great detail. I have cited legal opinion from the highest court in the land in support of my contention that absolute discretion is something which is appropriate to the legislation. I have explained in great detail that the exercise of that discretion must be within the parameters of fair procedures and that natural justice has to apply at all times. I have explained as well that these provisions are not the product of a xenophobic Government or people but are broadly similar to those across Europe and are common in the free world outside of Europe. There is no great mystery about them. There is no Pandora's box. The discretion of the Executive, of the Minister in this instance, to grant or not to grant, is by no means unique to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan does not agree with me. He advances the case that it is wrong for the Minister to have discretion. That is something with which I simply do not agree. This legislation is, in broad terms, appropriate to the circumstances as they exist at present. They recognise a problem which exists. There is a difficulty in relation to abuse &ndash; there is no question about that. Due to that difficulty, I have been obliged to insert provisions in this legislation to protect Irish citizenship law. That is a reasonable position to take. It is not as if a Minister would act on a whim, unfairly or beyond the parameters of natural justice. I, as Minister for Justice, am entitled to ensure that in granting Irish citizenship there is minimal possibility of abuse of the process. I cannot do that under existing law. That is why I am bringing for<Col N="310" /> ward these provisions. I cannot conceive of circumstances where a Minister would operate unfairly and there is recourse to the courts.</P>
    <P>Let me make it absolutely clear that no non-national who is genuinely married to an Irish citizen has anything whatsoever to fear from this legislation. Some of the provisions of this legislation encourage people to come back to this State. I have also made it clear on a number of occasions that there is no barrier to a non-national who is married to an Irish spouse coming to live in this State. There is no barrier to a non-national who is married to an Irish spouse working in this State, irrespective of his or her status in regard to citizenship.</P>
    <P>Certain matters are being inserted here because there is an obligation to protect the citizenship laws. I have repeated again and again that the conferring of citizenship on a non-national is not a right but a privilege. That is recognised across international boundaries. It is commonplace. It is the norm in many states I can think of.</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment doubt that Senator Ryan has very sincere and deeply-held views on this. However, whether he or I express our views emotionally or unemotionally is beside the point. The point at all times is what is the best direction for this legislation to take. The Senator holds one view. I hold another. As I have said on a number of occasions in the past, a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At least the Minister's tone has improved. We have a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform insisting on having absolute discretion, in the event of knowing somebody's bodily integrity or liberty is threatened, to ignore that and let it happen rather than change some of the conditions for application for citizenship. The Minister has put up a general defence. I can understand why because what he is doing is largely indefensible and, therefore, he feels the need to go over it again and again.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a specific exception that the Minister inserted to deal with a situation where he is satisfied that an applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship. In the case of somebody who wants to become an Irish citizen and who is married to Irish citizen, a member of an Irish family, and the Minister is satisfied that if he does not waive some of the conditions in section 5 the person would suffer serious consequence in respect of bodily integrity or liberty, the Minister, who proclaims liberalism, human rights and all those wonderful phrases, could still say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and not even condescend to explain why. That, not the general principle, is what this is about. We lost the vote but we won the argument because of the strange and emotional reaction of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are saying the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could be satisfied that a member of an Irish family would suffer serious con<Col N="311" /> sequences in respect of bodily integrity or liberty if he or she does not waive some of these conditions, even if he or she is satisfied they want to reserve to themselves the unqualified right to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;. That is an extraordinarily illiberal protection demanded by the Minister and an extraordinary level of unaccountability. Without having any obligation to explain anything under the law, a member of an Irish family could be left with their liberty or their bodily integrity in jeopardy. That is profoundly illiberal and another example of the extraordinary &ldquo;control freak&rdquo; instinct of the Department of which the Minister is the political head. No other reason exists for this.</P>
    <P>How could a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform leave an Irish citizen and a member of an Irish family in jeopardy of either their bodily integrity or their liberty and refuse to allow them to short-circuit the process although they are in trouble? If he could not, why does he want absolute discretion other than to preserve as much latitude for himself as possible when dealing with foreigners?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete line 14, and substitute &ldquo;any or all of the conditions of <i>subsection (1)</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will not make an issue of this amendment but perhaps the Minister could explain why he only wants discretion under certain of these conditions and not others. I presume full age would have a different meaning in different countries. There could be people who are not of full age in this country but who are the spouses of Irish citizens. This is the same issue as waiving conditions. Why should it not be possible for the Minister to dispense with that condition in order to facilitate someone who is a member of an Irish family and who is married to an Irish citizen but who is not of full age in the definition of our law &ndash; they could be married at 17 &ndash; to short-circuit the process where he is satisfied that bodily integrity or liberty are threatened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned about the condition of good character because I know somebody who was granted Irish citizenship under dubious circumstances. Marius Schoon, who is now deceased, had a conviction for planting a car bomb in South Africa, yet he was granted Irish citizenship on compassionate grounds. I do not understand why the Minister cannot dispense with the condition of good character rather than fudging it. Marius Schoon was a terrorist, as he said himself in his wonderful South African accent, under any understanding of the law. Yet he got Irish citizenship and rightly so because he <Col N="312" /> was the victim of state terrorism. The Minister should not exclude the possibility of circumstances where people may not qualify under the condition of normal good character but who would deserve an exception being made. Perhaps the Minister could explain why he chose to dispense with some of these conditions and not others.</P>

      <P>The provisions of subsection (2) are for the purpose of giving the Minister the power to waive certain conditions for the naturalisation of spouses in cases where the spouse would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship. Those conditions which may be waived relate to the requirement to be married for a period of not less than three years at paragraph (<i>c</i>), the residence requirements at paragraphs (<i>f</i>) and (<i>g</i>) and the requirement that the person in good faith intends to remain on the island of Ireland after naturalisation at paragraph (<i>h</i>).</P>
      <P>The application of this section is most likely to arise in the context of a spouse who is living abroad and, in the circumstances envisaged by this subsection, it would be reasonable to waive those particular conditions. I do not consider that any of the other conditions of the new section 15A as inserted by section 5 should be waived.</P>
      <P>It is essential that a marriage does exist, which is what paragraphs (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) of the new section 15A seek to establish. If the person is not a spouse, then the proper course for naturalisation is by means of section 15 of the 1956 Act, with the possibility of the waivers of any of the conditions in that section allowed for by section 16. To provide for waiver of these paragraphs in the new section 15A is the equivalent of saying that we have set up this special scheme of naturalisation for spouses but people can apply under it although they are not a spouse and there is already a scheme for naturalisation of non-spouses. That does not make sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As to paragraph (<i>a</i>) which deals with full age, under Irish law the age of majority is attained at the age of 18 or on earlier marriage. If, however, a marriage has been contracted in a jurisdiction where that age of majority rule does not apply, and the spouse is what is known as a &ldquo;child bride&rdquo;, our naturalisation law should not do anything to encourage our citizens to contract such marriages. I cannot conceive of circumstances where waiver of the full age condition can be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the reasons I have already outlined and as was discussed extensively on Committee Stage, the issue of good character is one which should not be dispensed with. I am aware Senator Ryan was not overly impressed by some of the argu<Col N="313" /> ments put forward about Arkan. Where citizenship is bestowed in these exceptional circumstances, I can see no reason why the person so privileged should not be required to declare fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State. It is, as has already been pointed out, a provision of our Constitution at Article 9.2 that &ldquo;fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are fundamental political duties of all citizens&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the new scheme of naturalisation stands side by side with the present scheme. It is a special scheme with less rigorous conditions as to residence to cater for spouses of Irish citizens in certain circumstances. If a person does not qualify under the new scheme, there remains the present scheme with the possibility of waiver of some or all of the conditions in certain circumstances as set out in section 16 of the Act. It is not widely acknowledged or known that a large number of applications for naturalisation are made to the Department and that a substantial number are granted. We only hear about those which are not granted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not surprise me. Given that the present scheme exists as a fall-back, it is reasonable to reserve the new scheme for the special case of the non-national spouse of the Irish citizen. Accordingly, the narrower scope for waiver in the special scheme is proper.</P>
      <P>As regards the scheme of naturalisation, often the Minister of the day, including me, allows people to stay on humanitarian grounds. That is a discretion which is exercised sometimes against the decision of the appeals commissioner for refugees, the matter having been refused in the first instance. These exceptions are made. Nobody is going to highlight them. Senator Ryan is right but nonetheless it is important that it be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not hung up on this. I am intrigued by the possibility that a member of an Irish family could be stuck in a situation with consequences for bodily integrity or liberty and not be able to become an Irish citizen quickly because they did not get around to making a declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State. I thought it would have been possible to delay that to a subsequent time when it was safe and reasonable for the person to do it. I accept much of what the Minister says on the other arguments, particularly if full age is not defined as 18 or whenever the person is married. That is reasonable and I accept it.</P>
      <P>Condition <i>(i)</i> should be subject at least to postponement if the circumstances require it. It should not be a pre-condition for somebody who is liable to be killed or locked up that they have to make a declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State. That should not be an absolute pre-condition. When people are in jeopardy, it could be postponed. I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 10 is very simple. Line 36 contains an &ldquo;or&rdquo; that is not needed. We do not need to discuss it at length.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 concerns mean-minded exclusions of people who have spent a considerable period here. It concerns reckoning a period spent in the State by a non-national for the purposes of applying for citizenship, and states that periods of study cannot be included nor can periods of time &ldquo;seeking to be recognised as a refugee (within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We discussed this on Committee Stage and the Minister attempted to justify it. It would be better if he left some discretion or suggestion that it should not be always be the case, or that the Minister could rule on it under clearly defined conditions, but it simply states that &ldquo;When calculating a period of residence in the State for the purposes of an application for a certificate of naturalisation . . . no period shall be reckoned in respect of which the non-national . . .  had permission to remain under that Act or any other enactment for the purpose of&mdash;&rdquo;. This involves those who are here with permission.</P>
      <P>There are other parts of this section which one would not dispute, particularly concerning those who are here illegally. This involves those who are legally in the State to study, or while their application for refugee status is processed. The Government is saying that never, under any circumstances, can that period of time, however long it might be, ever be reckoned, even in part, as part of the time under which one could qualify for citizenship. That is mean-minded and is excessive and disproportionate. The fact that the Minister was endeavouring to put into law what was the practice in general is no excuse for putting it in this form. It would be reasonable to say that the Minister, to an extent he believes appropriate, can bear in mind the period of study and period of application for refugee status. To simply exclude them <i>carte blanche</i> is extremely unfair and is no great incentive to those who come here to study and perhaps feel they would like to live and work here. Many of them will in the future because, as Senator Henry said, there is a shortage of doctors here. This provides that they can come here and study, that our medical services will need them, but on the matter of citizenship the clock only starts once they go to work and there are no exceptions. The phraseology is entirely wrong and should be deleted.</P>

      <P>I stressed on Committee Stage, as Senator Ryan did, the unfortunate effect this could have on doctors on whom we depend to run our medical service, particularly outside the major centres. I asked the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, now that the Irish Medical Council has refused to recognise positions in some of the county hospitals for training, if it would be better for non-nationals to apply for those jobs which do not have recognition. They could not be considered places of study. They might be better to apply for those rather than going to hospitals which have good training programmes in place. She said she would find the answer for me.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to see this in the legislation because when we depend on people to run our health service and they have put years of work into our country, we should make that period part of the entitlement towards citizenship.</P>

      <P>To delete these provisions in the Bill would be to remove two important criteria regarding the period of residence in the State which will count for naturalisation pur<Col N="316" /> poses. The reasoning behind these provisions has already been explained on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b)<i>(ii)</i> of the new section 16A(1) of the 1956 Act, being inserted by section 6 of the Bill, deals with periods which for certain temporary stay purposes will not reckon as periods for naturalisation. The temporary purposes are: study, whether or not that involves an element of paid work experience, and temporary permission to enter and stay in the State while awaiting a decision on an asylum claim.</P>
      <P>There are good reasons why such periods should be excluded. In the case of a person coming to the State to pursue studies, the duration of his or her permission to remain is limited to the length of the study course. The person can have no expectation that by coming to the State for a limited period his or her time here will reckon for naturalisation purposes. A person admitted as a student is, by definition, here for the limited period of duration of the course of study. Such a person can have no legitimate expectation of being able to acquire citizenship on the strength of such a stay or of having that stay reckonable towards qualifying for citizenship. A student comes here for the primary purpose of obtaining a qualification, with perhaps an element of work experience, and then to return home where that qualification can be put to good use in his or her own community. It must be clear on the part of the student that this is so; that is what is stated on his or her student visa application or to the immigration officer or arrival. Nowhere is there any understanding that a student will be entitled as a matter of course to take up full-time employment and live the rest of his or her days in the State. That is an entirely different matter.</P>
      <P>I fully accept the point made on Committee Stage that many foreign students pay large fees and that the development of the overseas educational sector of our economy is very important. It is also the case, however, that in return students receive a first-class education which will considerably enhance their life opportunities. We cannot have a situation where every person who wishes to come to the State to pursue a course of studies is to be regarded, or regards himself or herself, as a potential applicant for naturalisation. It would be an unrealistic and unfair expectation to give to the person or to impose on the State.</P>
      <P>Periods in the State where a person is seeking refugee status will also not reckon for the purposes of naturalisation. Under section 9(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Refugee Act, 1996, which will soon be implemented&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;an applicant for refugee status is to be given a temporary residence certificate. Under the current arrangements for dealing with asylum seekers, an applicant is allowed to remain in the State on a temporary basis pending the outcome of the application. In either case, the basis for the stay in the State is temporary only <Col N="317" /> and an asylum applicant can have no expectation of being able to acquire citizenship on the basis of that temporary stay.</P>
      <P>Until the consideration of the asylum claim has been finally completed, whether under the current UNHCR approved procedures or soon under the Refugee Act, it is not possible to determine what the applicant's status will be. He or she may be recognised as a refugee or may fail to be recognised as a refugee and either be required to leave the State or permitted to remain on other grounds, including grounds which may have no bearing on the asylum claim.</P>
      <P>It is important to stress that an asylum applicant is admitted to the State for the purpose of determining whether he or she qualifies for recognition as a refugee, but the fact that a person is admitted for this purpose cannot guarantee the right to reside indefinitely in the State or to seek citizenship of the State. The person's status is determined by the outcome of his or her application. Where a person is recognised as a refugee there is power in the existing citizenship laws to provide a waiver for the normal naturalisation provisions for the person concerned.</P>
      <P>Where a person is recognised as a refugee, the Minister may exercise his or her powers under section 16(<i>g</i>) of the Act of 1986 to grant a certificate of naturalisation where all the conditions for naturalisation are not met. In practice this option has often been exercised by my agreeing to accept applications for naturalisation after three years' residence in the State rather than the normal residence requirement of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately prior to the application and four years' residence in the eight years prior to that period. My predecessors have done the same. The three years are reckoned from the date of the application for refugee status rather than from the date on which the person was recognised as a refugee.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Senator Henry raised the issue of medical doctors and I asked for the matter to be examined. Those doctors here to pursue postgraduate training in which work experience in a hospital is an essential component are required to obtain temporary registration from the Irish Medical Council. Periods of temporary registration are issued to any doctor for up to 12 months at a time and, in total, for a period of 260 weeks. This is usually sufficient to enable a doctor to complete a postgraduate course. There is a qualifying examination which must be passed unless the doctor can show that he or she meets the requirements for exemption. Senator Henry shakes her head as if she thinks that 260 weeks is inadequate.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to facilitate those from other countries who want to do postgraduate courses. They are of considerable benefit to their own countries when they return. If there is a difficulty with the length of time allowed, it should be taken up with the Irish Medical Council. It is the norm for that body to issue to any doctor temporary registration for a period of up to 12 months at a time for a period of 260 weeks in total.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of doctors from abroad who seek employment in full-time posts is different. They require full registration with the Irish Medical Council. Presumably the Irish Medical Council, before issuing such registration, would satisfy itself as to the qualifications and competence of the person to practise medicine in the State. The doctor will also, unless a citizen of an EU state or a dependant of such a citizen, require a work permit from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. If a doctor obtains full registration from the Irish Medical Council, and the prospective employer obtains a work permit from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, there is generally little or no difficulty with the immigration authorities.</P>
      <P>A doctor coming to the State on that basis, rather than for the purpose of study, can have a reasonable expectation that his or her residence on that permanent basis will, in the fullness of time, count towards the requirement for naturalisation. Some people exercise that option and some do not.</P>
      <P>Persons with temporary registration who later achieve full registration can change their immigration status and remain in the State to work in a full-time hospital post if a work permit is issued in respect of that post.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry will agree that the citizenship laws are not the appropriate vehicle to recruit trainee or full-time doctors and should not be used as a carrot to attract students to the State. It is a matter for the Irish Medical Council to ensure there are sufficient doctors of sufficient calibre to meet the needs of Irish society and naturalisation policy is not a suitable or effective means of regulating that supply. Ireland should feel proud of its record in training doctors, especially for work abroad. It should also be grateful to those who come here to train.</P>
      <P>The question of residence in the State is governed by the possibility of discretionary waivers under section 16 of the 1956 Act. Senator Ryan's concerns about the fixed nature of the exclusions in the provisions being debated are addressed in that context. The provision exists to ensure clarity about what is expected. That does not rule out a waiver of the residence conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are back where we started; we insert all the conditions, the Minister can waive <Col N="319" /> them but no one can ever question him about how he waives them.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry tells me that it seems more advantageous for a person applying for citizenship to have had a job without a training aspect because it is not study. If a person gets a job without any training the clock starts ticking for a citizenship qualification. The training undertaken by a person who comes to obtain better qualifications to provide a better service to the people of Bantry will disqualify him or her from citizenship for a few more years.</P>
      <P>I am glad there is some discretion in the existing Act. I read it but I missed that, but what I am not sure about is if such discretion exists, what clarity does this give? If the Minister can exempt people from it, what does clarification, as contained in these sections, mean? It seems to mean that the Minister is issuing a signal yet again to people that one should not think, if he or she is a students here and/or gets a job here, that the Minister will consider his or her application for citizenship any more favourably; and one should not think, if he or she comes to Ireland, gets the right to stay here and is granted refugee status, that it will make one's route to citizenship any shorter. What is the point of clarification of this kind if the Minister states that he can ignore it if he wants to do so? What sort of clarification is that? That is just a signal, and it brings one back to what these signals represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was not the least bit convincing. He seems to be concerned about expectations, the feeling that if he allows asylum seekers to <Col N="320" /> work, etc., it creates expectations. These were just slipped in because they were uncertain. They are there as statements to people who come here to study that it makes no difference and to people who come here and apply for refugee status that even though a person gets refugee status, he or she will not get an Irish passport until he or she has been here for X number of years. That is a pity. The Minister has produced no convincing explanation. As Senator Henry says, the Minister is telling people that if they can get into Ireland and get a job &ndash; we must begin to let people in because there are labour shortages &ndash; then one would be better off not studying while one is here because it only makes it more difficult for an applicant. That is a wonderful disincentive. The Minister will state that of course he can exercise his discretion afterwards, but the truth is that he is saying that to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also telling people that even if they are recognised here as legitimate refugees, which, one must remember, means people who are escaping from the threat of torture or worse, and even though he recognises that they had an awful life and escaped from a threatening situation, it will not count unless the Minister thinks differently. If the phrase, &ldquo;unless the Minister thinks differently&rdquo;, is as central as he says, then there is no clarity. However, if the Minister's discretion means nothing, then this is rigid, there is no greater clarity and the issues to which Senator Henry referred remain unresolved.</P>

The taking of a seat in this House as a Taoiseach's nominee by a citizen of Northern Ireland from the Unionist tradition will now involve such a person publicly saying, in effect, that they accept they are citizens of this State. In the past, they were citizens because we claimed them as such. Therefore, they did not have to acknowledge it. They could say they did not agree with it but, legally, they were citizens whether they wanted to be or not. People who were determined to be classified as British only could come here, safe in the knowledge they were doing nothing they disagreed with. Due to the well intentioned changes in Articles 2 and 3, that situation no longer prevails. It is now more difficult and problematic for a citizen of Northern Ireland who is a Unionist to accept a seat in this House. That is a great pity and is worthy of constitutional amendment at the first possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the reverse applies to the Northern Ireland Assembly. I am sure there are members of that Assembly who are citizens of this State but who did not have to acknowledge, in any way, that they were citizens of the United <Col N="322" /> Kingdom before they could become members of that Assembly. We have a peculiar situation where citizens of this State are free, without any diminution of their citizenship, to become members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, but citizens of Northern Ireland must at least accept in principle that they are citizens of this State. That is a very serious condition which the Minister ought to address with the Government as a matter of urgency. Otherwise, we will embarrass people from Northern Ireland and make life even more difficult for them. This is a very serious issue.</P>

      <P>This Bill has received an extensive airing in the Seanad. Some of us wish that more amendments had been accepted on Committee and Report Stages. The Minister should reflect again on the naturalisation of spouses of Irish citizens before the Bill's passage through the Dáil. I ask him to review the provision for absolute discretion, which is unnecessary. It is unfortunate the Minister had to go to Northern Ireland on important business during Committee Stage, although he was ably represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin. I hope the views expressed in the Seanad will be considered by him and his officials before the Bill's passage through the Dáil and that he will reconsider his position on a number of the amendments tabled in this House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his replies, although he did not accept our amendments. I ask him to make plain in the Dáil to Irish citizens that marriages in English registry offices are valid marriages. I was extremely alarmed to learn from the unofficial information I got that people who contracted marriages in registry offices in England sometimes described themselves as single on their return here. It would be a crime for such people to get married in this State. We need to make this very plain.</P>
      <P>There are far more marriages of convenience taking place than I had realised. The Minister will be aware of that from my contribution on Committee Stage. I eventually discovered that information for myself. I am sorry the Department was not able to find out more about it because it seems to be a very serious problem. This problem has grown greatly over the past ten to 15 years and is, apparently, becoming more prevalent in terms of registry office marriages in this State. It is important we make people understand the validity of marriages which take place in English registry offices because some people seem to take a rather casual view of them.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the contributions of my colleagues, some of which were made with great sincerity. As Senator Taylor-Quinn said, this Bill has received a great airing and this is the fourth day we have debated it. The Minister did his best to reply to all the matters raised. We had a very comprehensive debate. We <Col N="323" /> must not forget the nub of the issue, which is the Good Friday Agreement and the importance of bringing this Bill into force.</P>
      <P>As someone who lived in Great Britain, I am glad Senator Henry acknowledged the problem of frivolous marriages in registry offices, which are very common. One would have to go back 40 or 50 years to find a case of bigamy taken in this State. However, there is a problem and the Minister is correct to endeavour to ensure it does not raise its ugly head here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for the opportunity to address the House on the conclusion of the Bill. I reject all criticism of the legislation made by Members in their closing addresses, which, I suppose, is to be expected of me. However, I do not accept the legislation has been in any way besmirched by adding in certain sections to deal with the susceptibility and vulnerability of the 1956 Act to abuse. I would be in dereliction of my duty if I did not do so.</P>
      <P>Everybody would acknowledge that Senator Henry is not given to wild exaggeration or wild claims. She has confirmed to the House what I said on Committee Stage, and prior to that, about abuse. People are taking advantage of the 1956 Act to obtain Irish citizenship through marriages of convenience, particularly in England. They should recognise, as Senator Henry said, that marriage is a serious business and under no circumstances should they engage in this type of behaviour to circumvent the law on citizenship.</P>
      <P>The legislation I have brought forward closes off the loopholes in so far as it is possible to do so. I say very clearly that people who marry in England or elsewhere for the sole purpose of becoming Irish citizens had better realise that this legislation, when it finally passes through the Dáil, will mean that they will not be in a position to obtain Irish citizenship through marriages of convenience. That will be welcomed across most of this country. I have gone into the issue of non-marital spouses and there is no point debating the Bill again as we have debated it for a number of days.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Ryan's point on the situation of people from the North of Ireland wishing to become Members of this House, it is a constitutional provision that one must be a citizen of this State to become a Member of either the Seanad or the Dáil and only the people could change that. It may not be changed through legislation and would require a constitutional amendment. People would expect those who represent them in this or the other House to be Irish citizens. That was the position before this legislation and it will be the position after it under our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not as if I am saying to any person from the North of Ireland, irrespective of his or her persuasion, that they must abandon their British citizenship if they become a Member of the <Col N="324" /> Seanad or the Dáil. All I am saying is that if one exercises the option of becoming a Member of the Seanad or the Dáil, then one has to have Irish citizenship. However, that does not mean I am asking them to reject their British citizenship &ndash; far from it. They can hold both at the one time. In many ways, that is the unique achievement of our legislative and constitutional provisions.</P>
    <P>The position before was that they were regarded as Irish citizens whether they liked it or not. Now one can choose to be an Irish citizen or choose not to be, but if one exercises the right to become a Member of the Seanad or the Dáil, then one becomes an Irish citizen. If one wishes, one can, of course, retain one's British citizenship. I do not see how I could have achieved, within constitutional parameters, any situation other than that which I have achieved.</P>
    <P>I warmly thank the main Opposition spokesperson and other contributors, in particular the Independent Senators, who contributed to the debate. It was a most lively and interesting exchange of views to say the least. Some home truths were spoken on all sides and that is something which I always broadly welcome because a day should not pass when one does not learn something. I thank all the contributors to the debate, the Cathaoirleach and the staff of the House for the courtesy and the patience shown throughout.</P>

      <P>For the information of the House, this is a Private Members' Bill. The Second Stage of this Bill is being treated in the same way as a non-Government motion. The time allocated to the proposer is 12 minutes and the proposer will have five minutes to reply at the end of the debate. Every other Senator will have eight minutes to contribute as usual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Unfortunately we are not discussing this Bill in Government time, so our time is somewhat restricted. I will do the best I can to propose this important Bill in 12 minutes. The purpose of the Shannon River Council Bill is to set up a council for the catchment area of the River Shannon from its source to the points between Loop Head and Kerry Head. One of the most extensive waterways in Europe and the tributaries thereof are being dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The River Shannon and its tributaries are a huge economic asset to this country. Huge benefits emanate from agriculture, tourism and fishing in this area as well as from archaeological, religious and other historical aspects. It is a wonderful asset, but for a variety of reasons over the years it has not been given the type of official recognition it should have received. This Bill proposes to set up a council which will be able to <Col N="325" /> achieve a number of objectives in relation to the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to set up a council which will consist of not more than 20 members and will have a chairman and a chief executive. It is important that a chief executive and staff are put in place so that it can be effective and specific works can be carried out. It is important the Bill has specific functions. The functions of the council shall be to propose policies and priorities for the enhancement of the water quality of the River Shannon and its catchment basin and for the protection and enhancement of the environment and of the natural habitats of bird life and fish life in that region.</P>
    <P>The protection and enhancement of the environment covers a wide range of issues. The environment of the river covers many areas, including the agricultural environment, which will have to be dealt with. Recently, it became apparent when flooding occurred in the Shannon catchment area, particularly in counties Offaly, Westmeath, Roscommon, Longford and, indeed, in County Clare from the River Fergus in the Ennis and Corofin areas, that nobody was prepared to take responsibility. At all the public meetings held, one official body after another refused to take responsibility and that applied to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the ESB, the Office of Public Works, Bord na Móna, Dúchas, the inland waterways body and the fisheries boards. The situation is most unsatisfactory. The environment of the Shannon has been detrimentally affected as a result of this flooding and nobody will take responsibility. This is unacceptable and this Bill, as proposed, hopes to address that issue.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Bill, the enhancement of the environment has to be specifically addressed. All sides of the House would agree with that aspect of the proposal. Decisions on the environment and water quality are taken by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities. However, the local authorities do not work very closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which has put in place a pollution protection scheme and incentives to provide protection facilities in an agricultural context. Where flooding occurs, all the protection facilities, holding tanks and slurry pits cannot prevent pollution. Even if septic tanks are put in place in accordance with the planning requirements of a local authority when flooding occurs they can cause major pollution and have a detrimental impact on the environment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the co-ordination of the work of public authorities, this Bill recognises that the ESB, the Office of Public Works, Bord na Móna and Dúchas have statutory authority and specific responsibilities for certain matters. This Bill does not impinge on or take from those statutory responsibilities, rather it is an attempt to co-ordinate the work of those bodies to ensure they can co-operate in working to the benefit of the com<Col N="326" /> munities who live in the catchment area of the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>The ESB has a number of sluice gates at various points on the River Shannon, which are in place with a view to generating electricity. The points at which those gates open and close to contain or release water, particularly flood water, are vital. This issue must be taken up with the ESB. If this Bill was enacted, the Shannon river council would be empowered to contact the ESB and the Minister responsible for it to ensure matters are dealt with in a manner beneficial to the environment and the circumstances along the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>As regards the Office of Public Works, we recognise that no specific drainage plan was put in place, yet the Office of Public Works has responsibilities in this respect. However, it is difficult to get the Office of Public Works to take responsibility for it. I am sure the Cathaoirleach concurs with me on this because he lives in the area that was affected and he will appreciate the problem. There is a need for someone to oversee this work and to get in touch with the Minister responsible to make sure that the bodies concerned do what they are supposed to do within their areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>A great amount of silting has resulted from work carried out by Bord na Móna along the River Shannon and this has caused serious pollution. A good deal of pollution has resulted from industry in the main towns along the Shannon. Local authorities have also been polluters with sewerage systems, or the lack of them in some instances, releasing material into the River Shannon. I recognise that a good deal of work has been done in this regard in recent years and work is ongoing on sewage treatment plans in large towns situated along the river. I hope such work continues.</P>
    <P>The need to co-ordinate the work of the public authorities is the single most important point. It is vital that the Shannon river council co-ordinates the work of the various authorities with different responsibilities. Equally, the council would be in a position to provide technical or financial assistance to a person or body who needs it, which is extremely important. In recent times, particularly in the Athlone area and the callows area of Roscommon, there was serious flooding and many farmers lost out on the aftergrass from September onwards, which was a major loss. To compound matters, their lands were flooded and they lost bales of silage and all their winter fodder. In the case of such losses, it is important that somebody should be in a position to provide financial assistance and the Shannon river council is a body that could be empowered to do that. It is extremely important that should happen.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the council should have enforcement powers. The Minister should consider putting in place an annual grant to fund it &ndash; at least £10 million initially, because that is the minimum figure needed, which could be put to use for work along the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> While there are a variety of issues to be addressed, I can only touch on the most essential. There is repeated flooding in the areas I mentioned, including areas around the River Fergus, Corofin and the Ennis area. The Minister of State may say that we have had the heaviest rainfall in 50 years and that the levels of the river have not been as high since 1954. With global warming, we know there is a possibility of a greater level of rainfall in the years ahead. We will have to live with that and face up to it. This issue will not disappear. The environment will be damaged if we do not address this problem and give this body, which is representative of the entire area, specific responsibility. The Minister could make appointments to it and empower it to take action, advise him, make recommendations and ensure that bodies that have statutory responsibilities are made to take responsibility. That is the kernel of this Bill. I cannot go into the detail of it but I hope that between now and next week the Leader will be able to afford Government time to debate the Bill so that it is given the airing it requires to put in place constructive legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that.</P>
      <P>I appeal to my colleagues on the far side of the House to accept this Bill. There is an element of politics in everything we do, as there must be. Members on the other side of the House have to take a particular line on this Bill on behalf of their parties and we must respect that. A similar Bill, for which I have great enthusiasm, was presented to the House by Fianna Fáil with the support of the Progressive Democrats when they in Opposition three or four years ago. We may say all we want about people's views on politics. There is a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude in that regard, but we all have to do our jobs. It demeans politics if we cannot get support on this Bill. There should be consensus on it across the House because a similar Private Members' Bill was promoted in this House by Deputies Daly and O'Kennedy when they were Senators. I put it to the Minister of State that this is what drags politics into the mire. People cannot understand how politicians can do such things. How could such a Bill have been right then but not now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the House said today on the Order of Business that there is never a wrong time to do the right thing. I commend that sentiment to Members on the Government side and I ask them to reconsider this Bill. If they considered a similar Bill good three or four years ago, I look forward to their support on this Bill tonight. While I accept fully that the Government <Col N="328" /> can make any changes it wants to the Bill, I appeal to the Members opposite not to vote against it. If there is a Government position of voting against this Bill tonight, I ask my colleagues on the far side of the House to go back to the Fianna Fáil Party and bang heads together until they see sense. This is sensible legislation, which is in everybody's interest.</P>
    <P>The River Shannon is under the authority of anybody one would care to mention &ndash; up to ten local authorities, four harbour authorities, elements of industry, town councils and large concerns like the ESB. Any sensible and sane person would agree that this Bill makes sense. A similar Bill made sense three or four years ago and this Bill makes every bit as much sense now. I commend it to the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to what the Bill sets out to do, section 6 provides that the function of the council is to co-ordinate the activities of the public authorities, to promote public interest in and respect for the river and its waters, to make recommendations on the control of pollution and to co-ordinate the activities of public authorities, activities to which everyone would subscribe.</P>
    <P>I do not want to pretend to anybody that the passing of this Bill would stop the Shannon from flooding. There was a very famous figure in Irish politics who founded the largest political party in this State who set out to drain the Shannon many years ago. It was not done then and it will not be done now. I will be up front and honest. I will not tell the residents of Banagher or Roscommon that it can be done. However, enacting this legislation could forward matters.</P>
    <P>Earlier the ESB was mentioned. Everyone who lives along the river believes there is a strong man with a powerful finger in Ardnacrusha who can press a button and adjust the level of the Shannon by three feet. I do not know whether that is true but we have all heard that story a million times. The ESB denies it. A few years ago the farmers who lived near Banagher and Meelick took the decision to reduce the level of the Shannon by opening the sluice gates. That is an example of what I am talking about. There is no sense of trust or confidence in the regulations or the regulatory authorities. I am not saying that in a demeaning way about the county councils along the river. Roscommon County Council has invested a great deal in the River Shannon and deserves to be complimented for it. There is a case for the work of the county councils to be drawn together. That can be done in this legislation and it would give greater power to the county councils.</P>
    <P>We recently examined the Lough Rea report on pollution and a number of points emerged, one of them being that the farming industry was responsible for a large amount of that pollution. I am not having a go at farmers. It means that the rural environment protection scheme or whatever scheme is applied must be developed. Farmers must also receive financial support. We cannot expect a farmer who lives on the edge of a river to take on extra expense to do his work without <Col N="329" /> giving him support as well. This is for the environment and this issue should be addressed.</P>
    <P>With regard to local authorities, I challenge the Minister on his response to this matter. Can he tell us how many pipes filled with raw sewage are being pumped into the River Shannon? The number would frighten people. We should demand that tertiary treatment plants are used to treat all waste water flowing into the River Shannon. The water should be clean enough to pipe it back to Dublin. If we allowed people to drink the water in Dublin we would reduce the level of the River Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I never left the green and gold behind me.</P>
      <P>There are also issues related to industry which could develop well with the aid of a guiding light. There is no regulation. The Inland Waterways Authority has only a certain amount of power. I have spoken to Lieutenant Commander Charlie Lawn. At present, he is doing a good job in Brussels but he was frustrated by the lack of an overall authority. Most Members will know him because he was based here at one stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to pollution, Senator O'Meara and I have often referred to the increase in zebra mussels in the Shannon navigation area. The problem has gone beyond it now because it has reached some of the tributaries and entered the River Suck and many others. These mussels are having a bad effect on the eco balance in the area and they need to be dealt with. There are no trout left in the River Shannon. As if that were not bad enough, with the expansion of the zebra mussel population there will be no pike left either.</P>
      <P>The development of the algal bloom means that it can now be found in almost every backwater. Last year notices prohibiting bathing were erected at Lough Rea and on every beach, inlet and harbour connected to it. We could develop leisure industries such as fishing and boating as well as water sports and pursuits based on nature ranging from walking to bird spotting. The area surrounding the River Shannon is a beautiful part of Ireland and I say that as someone who was born and raised within 150 yards of the Atlantic Ocean. The Shannon is an extraordinary natural asset which has been under appreciated, underdeveloped and under exploited. The development of a Shannon River Council is crucial in terms of the future of Ireland. No right thinking, sensible or logical person could refute that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in terms of drainage it does not take a genius to work out that part of the present flooding problem is related to arterial drainage carried <Col N="330" /> out along the tributaries. Water now rushes into the main Shannon basin within hours of falling on the land, whereas years ago it would have taken a week to reach it. The river cannot handle the amount of water. Consequently, over the past three months there was a lot of flooding at Athlone, Meelick, Ardnacrusha and at the upper part of the river. That will be the case in future. This year people controlled the flow of water near Carrick-on-Shannon by damming the river or part of one of the canals. This must also be done in other places. In order to solve the problem we would probably needs to install locks on all the tributaries such as the Rivers Suck, Brosna and Little Brosna. We need to control water levels on some rivers in order to control the overall problem.</P>
    <P>I appeal to my colleagues on the other side of the House to do the sensible thing. I urge them to do it for Ireland and support this legislation. They wrote it and my party supports it. Let us all join together on this and put it to the Government.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to debate the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998. This Bill was originally initiated in this House by two colleagues, the then Senators Brendan Daly and Michael O'Kennedy. I supported them and I was directly involved at the time. Now the Opposition has decided to cross out a few names on the back sheet of this Bill, write some new names on it and present it as if it were a new Bill. That is not the case. This is a Fianna Fáil Bill which was initiated and put together after much research by Deputies Daly, O'Kennedy and myself in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of involvement and research was extensive. We drew on all the experience of Deputy Daly who was a former Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works. His expertise was extremely helpful.</P>
      <P>In the public Gallery are those who have suffered because of the inactivity of successive Governments over the years. We have representatives of farmers and householders from County Roscommon and other counties who live along the banks of the Shannon. They have had to put up with successive years of flooding, trauma and loss. Their problems came about as a result of a lack of activity and because no one wanted to take full responsibility for the Shannon and its waterways. No one wanted to take control of all of the waste that was dumped into it nor take responsibility for removing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is important. My party is as committed to it now as it was in 1995 and 1996. The Government side will afford the opportunity of debate and support tonight. It will also afford Government time next week for further debate of this Bill. The Department of Finance will take <Col N="331" /> responsibility for this Bill. I hope both sides of the House will bring forward whatever amendments they consider necessary and that they will be debated openly on Committee and Report Stages. At the end of the day I hope we have in the Shannon River Council Bill a mechanism that establishes an authority with overall responsibility for the River Shannon and its tributaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this Bill is vitally important. I also believe one of the finest riverways in Europe should not be left at the mercy of the whims of various bodies which have different agendas and are selfish in their approach in many ways. It seems that they are secretive even among themselves about what activity each body has responsibility for. That was established at a public meeting attended by approximately 500 people in the Shamrock Lodge Hotel in Athlone at which members of the public and the representatives of farmers and householders were left in the dark, given incorrect information and fed a line that no one could swallow. To put it mildly, the issue was bounced from one side to the other without anyone assuming responsibility. The only way we can resolve difficulties in this regard and obtain proper answers to the questions we have posed is if a single authority, which will have overall responsibility, is established. That authority will be obliged to answer questions in public on the basis of its statutory responsibility.</P>
      <P>If the Bill is passed by both Houses, a 20 member council will be established to oversee the River Shannon. The functions of this council in respect of the matters we consider important will be clear. If there are other responsibilities which need to be included in the Bill before it is passed by the House &ndash; hopefully within a number of weeks &ndash; I urge Members to come forward with appropriate amendments on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made many public pronouncements on the River Shannon over a long period. I have stated that it is a national scandal that we have allowed all sections of the community &ndash; those involved in industry, farming and tourism and the local authorities &ndash; in the catchment area of the Shannon to use it as a dumping ground. Every concern based in the area to which I refer has used the main channel of the Shannon as an outfall. However, during my lifetime, no one has thought it worthwhile to remove even one shovelful of refuse from the river. The chickens have come home to roost and the flooding experienced during and after Christmas has been as bad, if not worse, than that which occurred in the 1950s. I have no doubt that this phenomenon will be experienced again to an even greater extent. We can expect to see much more serious flooding if action is not taken immediately. The introduction of regulations and by-laws by local authorities in conjunction with the enactment of this legislation <Col N="332" /> is important. However, that is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>I support Senator O'Toole's comments on the outfall into the River Shannon. The Senator is a keen sailor and he will be aware of the fact that few of the hundreds of boats which use the Shannon have holding tanks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there are a number of exceptions. As far as I am aware there is only one pumping out station in operation on the Roscommon side of the river. This is based at Ballyleague and it is only used sporadically. The boats to which I refer travel the remainder of the river &ndash; from Loughrea, to the Hudson Bay and on to Athlone &ndash; on a daily basis and their owners dump their refuse and empty their sewerage tanks, if they have them, into the main channel. To where does the overflow from industry and local authority sewerage plants, the run-off from agricultural drainage plants and the waste from other concerns such as Bord na Móna go? It goes into the main channel. That practice cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>As long as responsibility for the River Shannon is left in the hands of numerous bodies, we cannot address this problem. I have always supported the Bill, I was involved in its initiation and in my opinion it will address the problem to which I refer. Fine Gael, Labour and the Independents have put their names to this Bill, which was initiated by Members on this side of the House when they were in Opposition. The Bill has the Government's support. In my view it represents a good day's work, particularly for the people in the Public Gallery to whom I referred earlier.</P>
      <P>I do not believe we can continue to allow the investments we have made in road, housing and farming developments to be washed away by floods. At some stage an actuary or accountant in a Government Department will ask why we should have to repair damage resulting from flooding when we should be dealing with the cause of that flooding. We have been dealing with the symptoms and we have forgotten to remedy the cause. The Bill represents the vehicle by means of which we can deal with the cause of flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to support the Bill on behalf of my party. We will, in whatever way possible and by means of any amendments we believe necessary and supportive, accommodate the passage of the Bill through the Seanad. I hope it will be passed by the Lower House later this year in order that the Shannon river council can be established, an event which will bring relief to the people of Counties Roscommon, Leitrim, Tipperary, Westmeath, Offaly and Clare whose representatives are present in the public gallery. As a result, the environmental problems to which I referred and the flooding caused by the Shannon will be the statutory responsibility of one body which will be answerable to the Oireachtas and will carry out its work on behalf of the people of <Col N="333" /> Ireland, particularly those who live in the catchment area of the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>Public bodies, be they local authorities or semi-State agencies, have a responsibility in this area. I hope they are aware that their actions will be closely scrutinised. It is time individualism and self-interest were put on the back burner in order that the public interest, particularly that of the people living in the Shannon catchment area, can be brought to the fore. The Bill represents the means by which this can be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Senator Finneran's sincere and warm support for the Bill. As he pointed out, the original Shannon River Council Bill was published by a former Member of this House, Deputy O'Kennedy, who hails from my constituency in North Tipperary. I am aware that the Deputy and his colleagues introduced the Bill as a genuine and sincere reflection of concerns which arose from the need to co-ordinate the activities of the multitude of agencies &ndash; local authorities, Government bodies and various other institutions &ndash; involved with the River Shannon.</P>
      <P>I live in a constituency which borders the great Lough Derg, in respect of which a number of environmental issues have arisen. It was these issues which led to the genesis of the Shannon River Council Bill. When I became a Member of this House I was happy to re-introduce the Bill because I did not want to see it die. With other Senators, I could see the virtue and necessity of putting this legislation on the Statute Book. It gives me pleasure to see that this badly needed Bill will receive all-party support in this House.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business on the first sitting day after Christmas I asked the Leader if we would be obliged to wait until farmers and householders were up to their ankles in flood water in order to tackle this problem. Unfortunately, it appears that this is the case. As other Senators pointed out, the recent flooding is not a new occurrence and it will occur again unless the problem is tackled. In that context, my colleague, Deputy Penrose, made numerous statements about the need to establish a council or authority with responsibility to co-ordinate the activities of the various bodies and groups operating in the River Shannon's catchment area. It is essential that such a body should have an adequate annual budget to enable it to carry out its functions. Those functions would have to include the maintenance of the main artery of the river as a drainage channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other issues arise out of the most recent flooding. Some of the victims of that flooding are in the Gallery and they know that one of the main problems is the urgent need for financial assistance targeted at those farmers who suffered due to the severe flooding last December and January, and back as far as last September. Much grazing was lost as a result of this flooding which has been particularly severe recently. It is essential that a proper financial package is put in place targeted at those farm<Col N="334" /> ers to help them deal with the severe difficulties they are facing.</P>
    <P>This Bill will probably be added to the Statute Book and we are open to discuss amendments to it to ensure that it meets the requirements of all those living and working in the River Shannon catchment. We also want to deal with agricultural and environmental concerns which are closely related.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the House had an excellent discussion on the report of the Lough Ree and Lough Derg monitoring group. That debate highlighted the range of issues, concerns and problems which must be addressed in the context of the River Shannon. There is a need for co-ordination and a sensible and essential approach to dealing with the range of issues pertaining to the river. We must put in place a body with responsibility for co-ordinating the work and responsibilities of the myriad agencies dealing with various aspects of the River Shannon. These agencies include local authorities, harbour boards, Government agencies, semi-State bodies and industrial, agricultural, tourism and angling interests. It is essential that this Bill is put in place.</P>
    <P>The Bill is sensible legislation but perhaps it does not go far enough. In that context I look forward to an in-depth and considered debate on amendments which will ensure that the Bill becomes the kind of legislation we require. That legislation must establish an effective, well funded agency with the necessary authority and power to co-ordinate the activities of existing agencies, bodies and institutions. The agency established must also effectively protect the River Shannon and the interests of those who live in its catchment area, and the concerns of farmers who have experienced flooding must be high on its list of priorities.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the all-party approach to this Bill. A reflection of good politics is that a good idea is not lost when a Government falls, an election is held and a new Government takes office. A good idea can be carried forward from one Government to another and from one party to another. Good ideas generated by long standing and experienced Members can be taken up by other Members, an all-party approach adopted and the ideas implemented. I look forward to further debate on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, and those in the Gallery who are interested in this legislation and who are affected by the problems of the River Shannon. Many people enjoy the River Shannon during the tourism season and are not adversely affected by it other than perhaps suffering a sore head after being in Killeen's in Shannonbridge or Haugh's in Banagher. The livelihood of those in the Gallery depends on decisions made in both Houses to ensure that they can continue to live on their farms. We support the Bill published by Deputies Daly and O'Kennedy which was well thought out and took some time to prepare. However, Deputy <Col N="335" /> Richard Bruton, who was Minister at the time, did not take that Bill on board in spring 1997.</P>
      <P>There are many problems involving the River Shannon which have to be addressed. A large number of organisations have an input into matters concerning the river. The input of some of these organisations is too great as they can control much of what happens on the river. A recent list highlighted the fact that 29 organisations had interests on the Shannon, including power generation, flood control, fish farming and so on. A single body must be given the responsibility of ensuring that the interests of those most affected by the Shannon are addressed.</P>
      <P>The ESB carries most responsibility for the problems faced by those living on the River Shannon. If it took the livelihood of these farmers and householders into consideration, it would lessen their problems. Many farmers in the Gallery affected by the recent flooding also experience annual problems with flash floods which leave them without winter fodder. I saw gates closed in Meelick while water was practically flowing up the streets in Banagher and no decision was taken for days to address this situation. Why is the water level in Lough Derg not kept lower? At a well attended recent meeting in Athlone a prominent representative of the ESB seemed more concerned with making a telephone call to someone whose son's boat was caught in an area of the lake into which he should not have strayed. This man was more concerned with keeping the water level high then he was for the thousands of people upstream who were affected and who suffered flooding over the Christmas. It was fortunate that a storm did not occur upstream during this flooding as Banagher would have been flooded; the town was within inches of being flooded. I welcome this Bill which will ensure that a single body is responsible for the complete control of the Shannon and its catchment area.</P>
      <P>We have spoken about arterial drainage and draining the River Shannon. Some speakers referred to how quickly water flows into the main channel. We know about that, but we have done nothing to reduce the water level in lakes to allow the floodwater through. I have heard it said that Ardnacrusha could take twice what goes through Meelick. If that were true, we would not have had the problems we had this year and in other years. It is unfortunate that almost all the farmers in the Shannon basin are moving out because we have taken no action to control the water level.</P>
      <P>The difficulties facing farmers because of flash floods were caused by vested interests. One of the principal bodies ensuring that no drainage and no cleaning of the Shannon channel is carried out is Dúchas. If the Government decided to do something about cleaning the Shannon, people like those we had in Wicklow, Friends of the Earth, would be dug in along the Shannon. If we ever move in to clean up the Shannon it will be a great opportunity for farmers to leave some of them where they should be left, in the middle of the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> Boating is very important to tourism, and the Shannon is well able to cater for boats if they stay within markers. It is not necessary to keep the water level high from October to March. If necessary, legislation must be changed to ensure that it is not kept at its current level. When people who work in semi-State organisations get an instruction to keep the water level at ten or 15 feet, they do so with no concern for unfortunate farmers who have to try to live in the Shannon basin. What is needed is one Shannon authority that will ensure that the water is kept at a proper level during the months when there is nothing in the channels, unless we want to flood them for wild duck and wild geese. However, farmers along the Shannon do not make much money out of wild duck or wild geese. In any event, because of changes in legislation over the past few years, they cannot shoot wild geese. Despite that, we seem to be able to keep lots of flooded land for them.</P>
    <P>We welcome and support this very well thought out Bill which, with the co-operation of all sides of this House, will be enacted in the not too distant future. In 1988, when the report on the problem of flooding in the River Shannon was launched in Athlone by Minister of State, Deputy Treacy &ndash; many of the Members here were in Athlone at the time &ndash; little did we think that 12 years later we would still not have put a spade in to clean the silt out of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>I live on the Shannon. I know how many people are affected by flooding. I could talk at length about the personal problems caused by the workings of different Departments who should have taken account of the livelihood of people along the Shannon. This Bill is one of the most important to come before Seanad Éireann. It will give people who are affected by flooding an opportunity to be part of a body which will ensure their livelihood is maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted we are debating this Bill. We are proactive in praising a Bill which had been the property of the Fianna Fáil Senators, and I am glad to support it.</P>
      <P>The Shannon is the largest river in the British Isles. The whole catchment area goes right down to counties Kerry and Clare. This Bill will include every aspect of it, every river, stream, tributary, every lake, pond and canal in what is a major basin area. It will be called the Shannon River Council Bill. The catchment area of the Shannon is bowl-shaped and that contributes to flooding and particularly the flooding problems experienced during the unprecedented heavy rains of late 1999 and the early days of the new millennium. The entire Shannon system is a highly prized environmental resource which has importance economically and recreationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me home in on the water quality aspect because it is of the utmost importance in economic and recreational terms. It affects numerous sectors, including agriculture, industrial development, tourism, trade and decisions relating to the infrastructure of the area. It is obvious that the <Col N="337" /> maintenance of a clean and attractive environment is crucial for the continued success and expansion of tourism, which is the first area I will examine.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that one in four tourists participate in water sports which would be associated with the river and its catchment. Such water sports include angling, cruising and sailing. Lough Derg is a very important part of the tourism programme which was referred to by Senator O'Meara. It is essential that we have a Shannon river council to deal with water protection strategies. That council must work hand in hand with the EPA. The EPA has set up an extensive monitoring system for rivers. The figures it produced surprised me. The EPA has sampled 3,000 locations on 13,200 km of river channel, which is quite enormous. What we need is a national database. This is essential in relation to monitoring programmes. Recent figures show that 71% of river channel lengths and 77% of lakes surveyed are not polluted. Our attention is always drawn to reports of severe pollution, fish kills and so on. However, the figures show that our waters are not as polluted as might be suggested in media reports. Only 0.6% of channels are seriously polluted. That does not lessen the importance of having clean waters.</P>
    <P>Pollution has been tackled. There have been closures of industrial activities associated with pollution. However, pollution still affects 11.4% of river channels. Eutrophication relates to extensive enrichment due to phosphorous deposits. The Shannon is threatened through eutrophication which is associated with the run-off from fertilised lands which causes phosphorous deposits &ndash; a figure of 50% is given by the EPA in relation to slight pollution. Industry still appears to be the major culprit in regard to serious pollution. We need early warning systems to ensure we know the problems in time. There are toxin-producing algae in Lough Derg, although techniques are being developed to help remove them.</P>
    <P>The onus is on local authorities to work in these areas, although they do not have sufficient resources. They are finding it extremely difficult to employ environmental experts because people who might have worked in the planning, engineering or environmental sectors of local authorities are being attracted to the private sector. Private consultants are able to pay larger salaries to environmental experts and this means that local authorities will lose out. Environmentalists are important for policy development, particularly on strategic policy committees. These committees will be made up of members of the farming organisations, chambers of commerce and environmental and voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>This Bill is timely. Because the Shannon river council will not be able to operate on its own, intensive links must be maintained with the EPA, the farming and tourism organisations, Dúchas and all the local authorities. The River Shannon borders counties Kerry and Clare and although County Limerick is situated on its estuary, it is <Col N="338" /> not mentioned. Limerick is an extremely important county, although it is sometimes forgotten.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>He was on it during his time as chairperson of Limerick County Council. I was also on the River Shannon Forum before I was chairperson of the council and I was one of those who attended the most meetings. It met regularly in Athlone and published reports during my time on it. However, I do not remember any other representatives submitting a report to Limerick County Council.</P>
      <P>Both County Limerick and County Clare suffer with an embargo on planning applications in high pressure zones because septic tanks pollute underground water supplies. This is important in County Limerick because the Shannon's flood plain covers most of the county. Local authorities are proactive in preventing seepage from septic tanks into underground water supplies. However, it is creating angst for local authority members who are constantly requested to push through planning applications in high pressure zones.</P>
      <P>Improvements have been made to the Abbey river and once the main drainage system for Limerick is complete the waterways will be navigable. This means a boat journey could begin at the Atlantic, pass through the Shannon Estuary, where passengers could view such sights as the Kilrush marina, on to Limerick and the Abbey river, through Ardnacrusha and continue on to Killaloe and Lough Derg and into County Fermanagh. Some 500 boats a year could use this stretch of water and this would create new business and tourism opportunities at Killaloe, Limerick and the Shannon Estuary. People sometimes say that only part of the Shannon is navigable but they forget about the Shannon Pot and the Shannon Estuary.</P>
      <P>We must look at the remit of the Shannon river council. I hope this advisory body is given enforcement powers. The EPA and the council should work in harmony to ensure the Shannon system is protected. It should also have a promotional role.</P>
      <P>Questions were raised about flooding in Limerick city. It seems the ESB released waters at a particular time which had a spin-off effect on the area and caused extensive flooding in the city. This was the first time the city was flooded.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to my party for the work done on the Mulcaire river which has alleviated the flooding in villages such as Cappamore but has created problems for farmers in that catchment area. More Government funding is needed to alleviate those problems. Some 40,000 farmers have already benefited from the rural environment protection scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All interested bodies should work together and adopt an integrated approach. This council must have strong enforcement powers and it must liaise with the bodies responsible for protecting the <Col N="339" /> Shannon, developing tourism and protecting and improving the lot of farmers whose quality of life has been severely affected by many decades of flooding. Many young farmers want to continue farming but they do not want the hardship of continuous flooding. I look forward to Committee Stage and to debating the amendments which I am sure will be sent to Members of this House by the various interested bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is noteworthy that we are discussing a Bill in the opening months of the 21st century which will assist in draining the Shannon. Éamon de Valera talked about draining the Shannon in my grandfather's time. I hope this Bill will get a quick passage through the House, that we will have more action and less talk and that results will be forthcoming as soon as is technologically possible.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that this well thought out Bill was not put back on the agenda until after the severe flooding of the winter which played havoc with people's property, homes and livelihoods. That is a great pity and something I regret.</P>
      <P>My party fully supports the recommendation that there should be one single river authority controlling, maintaining and caring for the Shannon from its source in County Cavan to where it enters the Atlantic at the Kerry-Limerick border. My party has put forward this policy for a number of years, mainly in the context of environmental protection and pollution control. There are now two demands, the objectives of which are not compatible. It will be a serious challenge to tackle these twin problems. Due to the nature of the River Shannon and the shallowness of its basin at many places, pollution tends to settle and linger, as it does in the lakes. If the bed of the Shannon is to be deepened, and it must be, to eliminate the flooding problems, the elimination of the pollution problem will be more difficult.</P>
      <P>There are serious challenges but maybe they are not coming at the worst possible time. Money is available in the national plan, on a scale not envisaged at any time over the past decade, to tackle this problem. The best available technologies must be harnessed to tackle the twin problems. The tackling and elimination of pollution in the Shannon is just as important as the elimination of the flooding problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Past actions have failed. There was far too much fragmentation. It is the same old story &ndash; everybody's business is nobody's business. A range of different local authorities were charged with certain responsibilities. In many cases the local authorities were, for one reason or another, some of the primary polluters of part of the Shannon. The ESB, the fisheries boards and a range of people were all charged with the responsibility for protecting water quality. That kind of fragmentation has totally failed. That is the key reason we must put in place now one single authority which has jurisdiction over the whole course of the river from beginning to end. It must be an authority with clear and recognisable enforce<Col N="340" /> ment powers which is prepared to work with all of the agencies and bodies, including the IFA, who have interests in this immediate area. Unless and until that is done, the aims of this Bill will not be achieved.</P>
    <P>My party fully supports this Bill and wants to see it become law sooner rather than later. Action should be taken to ensure that the authority is put in place, with the proper teeth, and that it is given resources and a timeframe. Its activities should be monitored for effectiveness in tackling those problems.</P>
    <P>The pollution is so severe in parts of the Shannon that one feels embarrassed and ashamed that fish are no longer living in parts of the lakes along such a lovely river. Its fish stocks ought to be one of the greatest assets in a country so dependent on recreational tourism, both for our own people and for incoming tourists. The fish are certainly not present in the numbers in which they were 20 years ago. Very strict measures will have to be taken and there should be no complacency and long-fingering any more.</P>
    <P>For years I called on the Minister &ndash; and I am glad the Minister of State is here now &ndash; to ban totally phosphate-based detergents, which are being used by riverboats in the Shannon. While it is only one element in the whole pollution process, it is one that could be eliminated with a stroke of the pen. I have pointed more than once to what Deputy Mary Harney did concerning smoky coal in this city. Everybody saw the problem and those with bad chests suffered from it, but nobody was prepared to take on the vested interests in the coal industry until she became Minister of State at the Department of the Environment. With one stroke of the pen she completely abolished smoky coal, an action which has made a huge difference to the air quality in the city and to people's health. This kind of action must be taken if we are to tackle pollution. Our children will not forgive us if we allow this on-going, relentless deterioration of water quality in the Shannon and its lakes.</P>
    <P>The rural environment protection scheme is now in place. It has been financed to a much higher extent this year, although I do not have the figure in my head. The farmers are also prepared to play their part to ensure that run-offs and eutrophication that happened in the past will be remedied, rectified and stopped. I hope that in the context of the national plan there will be sufficient treatment plants built for the towns which, prior to this, fed their raw sewage into the water.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the vehicle for an integrated approach to the solution to this problem. I hope it will pass through both Houses with the minimum of delay and that we will take this issue seriously. We owe it to our children. We cannot guarantee them much in a rapidly changing world but we owe it to them to give them a country with clean water, healthy drinking water and clean air. We have the capacity to do that if we apply ourselves. I hope that farmers living along the Shannon basin will never again have to endure what <Col N="341" /> they have suffered this year and regularly over a number of years. I hope that will never again be allowed to happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been listening for years to calls for the establishment of the Shannon river authority. We have been hearing about the proposed draining of the Shannon for 40 years. We need strong Government commitment to set up and operate this Shannon river authority.</P>
      <P>The Shannon has thrown up many problems over the years, the greatest of which were evident over the past few months in the serious flooding problems for farmers of that region. Farming is difficult enough without the added burden and hardship of trying to deal with a river that is out of control for many months of the year. I pass across the Shannon every week and see a vista of water, which is like a giant lake &ndash; one could regard it as a lake, such as Lake Michigan &ndash; in the middle of our country. It is a river which is out of control. It is eye opening to see the engineering technology which has been employed over the years in Holland to overcome its problems with water. It is amazing how the rivers there are controlled in winter. The water is at ground level but it does not overflow or interfere with farm land.</P>
      <P>Water is becoming scarce, it will be the cause of wars in the future. I was in Cyprus recently where there is no water. If that country had an asset like the Shannon it would have a better economy. The government there is discussing the idea of importing water from its old enemy, Turkey. That proves how valuable water is becoming. Scarcity of water will become a serious obstacle to economic growth in such countries.</P>
      <P>We have an abundance of water and we do not know what to do with it. It destroys parts of the countryside, wrecks family livelihoods and creates havoc. It is three years since this Bill was first debated, a fact which does not indicate any great commitment on the part of the Government to solving the problem. It shows that no attempt has been made to solve the problem until it raised its head again in a dramatic fashion of the past eight months.</P>
      <P>The River Shannon is a great tourist attraction. Tourism in this country could be boosted substantially if the water and pollution levels in the river were controlled properly. There should be an authority to monitor and co-ordinate all activities related to the river. Any such authority should have a substantial budget, statutory powers and the engineering expertise available in other countries to tackle the serious difficulties with the River Shannon. Holland is a classic example of what can be done to control river levels. Only one section of the Shannon causes major problems. It is not beyond the bounds of our engineering capabilities to tackle this once and for all. The people living in the region deserve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who have been trying to travel the roads in the west in recent months have had great difficulties because of flooding. It is an appalling state of affairs that the national primary road to <Col N="342" /> the capital was impassable for weeks because it was waterlogged. The commitment of the Government to address the problem must be demonstrated by the establishment of a Shannon river authority.</P>
    <P>There would be enough water in the Shannon to supply Dublin city if it was pollution free and properly managed. That is an asset of great value but we let it go to waste. Other countries would certainly appreciate a body of water even half the size.</P>
    <P>It behoves us all to tackle this problem which has blighted the west for generations. In the present economic climate we have the resources to solve this problem and it should be done forthwith. Drainage and farming problems would disappear in less than a year as a result. It would also improve the boating facilities on the river, attracting more tourists. Boating on the River Shannon is an experience which not many other European countries can match. People who come here for such a holiday talk about it for years. The River Shannon system, however, is underdeveloped. A substantial budget should be set aside by the Government for any such project.</P>
    <P>Water is a great resource. Some countries have put major desalination projects in place to remove the salt from sea water. Such projects cost enormous amounts of money and those countries embarking on them are not as rich as Ireland. They are doing so to safeguard economic growth. We have the asset and the resources to tackle the problems.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. We all await his contribution with interest.</P>
      <P>I heard Senator Quill's reference to Éamon de Valera. It reminded me of the story my late father used to tell of how one day, as he travelled around the countryside on business, he went into a house as they were about to say the Rosary. For those who do not know what that means, it was a practice in rural Ireland at one time. The lady of the house said, &ldquo;Sit down there young fellah, we will say a decade of the Rosary for Éamon de Valera and the draining of the Shannon&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There have been problems with the River Shannon for decades and we should address them immediately. The list of agencies making use of the river is mind boggling. The ESB plays ducks and drakes with the water, Bord na Móna runs channels out of it, which then go back in, the Office of Public Works tells us that it looks after developments on its banks and Dúchas seems to have an over-riding role which I cannot identify. There are 33 other authorities, State agencies, local authorities, semi-autonomous bodies, interested groups and parties which are all dipping in and out of the river. No wonder it is in a mess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the television news over Christmas I could not help but reflect on the reaction of the people of the midlands when in one part they were looking at their houses being washed away and their lands being flooded and in another they <Col N="343" /> were listening to economists saying that the Celtic tiger was roaring loudly and would continue to do so. The chances are that if the tiger had appeared anywhere near the River Shannon basin over the past few months, it would have drowned. The question is which agency would have been responsible for it? Would it have been the ESB, Bord na Móna, Dúchas, the local authority or would any body have been responsible? Who would have thrown a lifebelt to the Celtic tiger in the middle of the River Shannon over Christmas? That is the kernel of this debate.</P>
    <P>Obviously all of us welcome the initiative by our colleagues on the other side of the House to bring forward the Bill. I was one of the people who was strongly supportive of our former colleagues, Deputies O'Kennedy and Daly who, as Members of this House, introduced the 1997 Bill. I will not say that I have changed my mind to any great degree, but I believe that unless there is some formal statutory body with real teeth, as Senator Quill stated, this problem will continue to occur.</P>
    <P>The reason I am not totally convinced about the establishment of a Shannon River Council is that I remember the Shannon River Forum. I do not want my remarks to be interpreted as meaning that I am against the establishment of a Shannon river council but the purpose of the debate is to explore the various options to do something quickly because of what happened recently. It is possible that some of the people listening to the debate were members of that forum which used meet in Athlone. Senator Jackman referred to it. My mother, who was a member of Leitrim County Council, was the Leitrim delegate to it and she went to it regularly. Therefore, I was well informed of what went on. All the constituent bodies were involved in that forum &ndash; the farming interests, local residents and every agency which had anything to do with the River Shannon. However, the forum did not address or find solutions to the problems which were as real then as they are now.</P>
    <P>There must be some form of rationalisation. The buck must stop with someone, be it with the Minister, a Shannon river council or some other vehicle. Surely even the Minister will agree that the present ramshackle arrangement is intolerable and cannot be sustainable in the medium to long term.</P>
    <P>I express solidarity with those who have suffered grievously and continue to suffer in the River Shannon basin area and I do not wish to diminish what for them is a matter of life and death, of putting bread on their tables and looking after their families. However, I am also concerned about another aspect of this debate, that is, the impact of continuing pollution on fish stocks because of the perspective which I bring to it from living in the upper River Shannon where there are not the same flooding problems. This pollution is having a horrendous effect on the local economies of the upper River Shannon. For decades we have been fortunate in that the lakes <Col N="344" /> and rivers of the upper River Shannon have been able to provide excellent fishing facilities, mainly for the traditional cross-channel angler.</P>
    <P>As a young child, sometimes it felt like I was walking down Piccadilly, Manchester or Main Street, Blackburn, rather than Main Street, Drumshanbo, because of the variety of accents from May to September. There were significant numbers of anglers, not just handfuls. For many years they made a real contribution to the local economy, especially in an area like mid-Leitrim and north Roscommon where there is no basic industry infrastructure as the mines are now closed. The cry from that particular sector is that there must be a real attempt to tackle pollution because the fish stocks, which were in decline already from Roosky northward &ndash; the same may be true also from Roosky southwards but I have hard evidence only of the former &ndash; have been declining significantly over the past decade.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from Mr. Geoff Cooper, one of the people involved in angling in the Roosky area. He is not an Irish national, but he is proud to be a resident of Ireland. He is interested in the development and promotion of fishing. He lives in Tarmonbarry. I referred to him before in a debate in this House at which the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, was present. Recently Mr. Cooper wrote to me regarding the debate on the publication of a report by the body which is charged with addressing pollution in Lough Derg and Lough Ree particularly, and he stated:</P>
    <P>I think maybe we stirred up a can of worms which at the end of the day couldn't be ignored. The lazy, the ignorant and the incompetent . . . in the end have had to stand up and be counted. [Mr. Cooper refers to the agencies I mentioned earlier.] Perhaps now, if the pressure is maintained we can look forward to a general upturn in the quality of our waters.</P>
    <P>. . .  during the winter I do a one man angling roadshow for a holiday company and this year I have met hundreds of very disgruntled anglers. Many of them attended my shows [in the UK] just to put the point over that after several bad trips to Ireland they would not return. Last November I was at a promotion for a fishing tackle company and spent some considerable time in the company of Des Taylor who is a very famous angler. [He appears regularly on television and has a great deal of influence in the angling fraternity in the UK.] He told me that himself and Bob Nudd who is currently the world angling champion came to Ireland along with a film crew to shoot some promotional film for another holiday company. The results were so bad that they returned to England with no film footage whatsoever. If guys like them can't catch what chance has the average angler got[?]</P>
    <P>That puts in perspective the real difficulties which are being faced by those involved in another aspect of the debate. As I said, I do not wish to diminish the real problems which the agriculture <Col N="345" /> sector faces. I am attempting to add another dimension to the call to put in place some form of regulatory authority or an individual, be he the Minister or someone who he discharges, to take responsibility to rationalise what is obviously an unacceptable situation.</P>
    <P>If fish stocks continue to decline in the upper River Shannon region, there will be wholesale closures of bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels simply because the service providers will have no business to operate. If that happens, one can say goodbye to rural Ireland because there is nothing else for it. If the national development plan pans out over then next six years there might be something in the pipeline but, as the old saying goes, live horse and get grass. There is a viable coarse fishing industry which is oriented towards the River Shannon not just because of the river itself but because of its tributaries and lakes. As Senator Quill correctly stated, it is the most beautiful part of Ireland, including the part northward from the midlands and not just Kerry. If one goes north of a line from Dublin to Galway, it is definitely much nicer than if one goes south but that is a purely biased, parochial opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the approach being adopted by both sides of the House. There has been great co-operation and spirit throughout the House, and a great welcome from all sides for the Bill. We are conscious of course that a similar Bill was introduced here in 1997 by the then Senators O'Kennedy and Daly. There was a good spirit of co-operation then, as is evident from the debates that took place in this House on 26 March and 1 May that year. My colleague, Senator Taylor-Quinn, reminded me of them earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very interested in some of the comments of Senator Mooney and I liked the folksy way he told the story of the former President de Valera, the draining of the Shannon and the ongoing programme which, sadly, never existed but to which lip-service was often paid. I agree that the Shannon and all the counties touching on it are beautiful, but the Senator would not want to neglect the beauty <Col N="346" /> of Cork, Kerry or the rest of the south. I think he was simply a bit flippant.</P>
    <P>The Senator was correct, however, in what he said about the tourism infrastructure. If there is further damage to the Shannon, including its catchment basin and tributaries, it will wipe out many people who are making a good living from tourism. One has to feel in particular for people who are involved in the bed and breakfast business throughout the region. I am sure the enhancement and improvement of the Shannon meets with everyone's wishes, including every Member of this House.</P>
    <P>There are many important sections in the Bill. Section 6(1) states:</P>
    <P>The functions of the Council shall be to propose policies and priorities for the enhancement of the water quality of the Shannon River and its catchment basin and for the protection and enhancement of the environment and of the natural habitats of bird life and fish life in that region.</P>
    <P>We should be concerned for flora and fauna, wildlife habitats and everything else belonging to nature which needs protection in that region. Sadly Lough Derg and Lough Ree have had particular difficulties. In fact, many of the 11 lakes on the Shannon and its tributaries have suffered from pollution to varying degrees. It is sad this has occurred to such a tremendous resource like the Shannon which is a truly great waterway and a prime national asset. The Shannon deserves our every effort to protect and enhance it.</P>
    <P>Section 7(1) &ndash; another key part of the Bill &ndash; states:</P>
    <P>The Council shall as soon as may be and not later than one year from the commencement of this section and after consultation with public authorities, other organisations and persons connected with and having an interest in the Shannon Catchment prepare a Water Management and Pollution Control Plan, in this Act referred to as &ldquo;the Plan&rdquo;, and shall transmit a copy of the Plan to the Minister and each other person as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>That section is vital because the Shannon has suffered too many years of neglect.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney is correct in highlighting the beauty of the area and I am always stuck by the beauty of the Shannon at Clonmacnoise. It has special relevance for me, not just because it is an internationally renowned monastic shrine, but also because many Coghlans are buried in a graveyard there. Apparently, at one stage the Coghlans were driven west across the Shannon when they were dispossessed of their lands in Offaly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering if I could go back there and stake a claim. I will discuss that matter with the Senator afterwards. Many organ<Col N="347" /> isations are concerned with the pollution of the Shannon. One of the greatest recent problems has been the increased levels of water pollution in various areas along the Shannon. The independence of the Shannon river council will be important in tackling these matters. It will set the policies and priorities for enhancing the water quality of this great river, thus protecting its natural wildlife habitats.</P>
      <P>Due to repeated annual flooding, recommendations are urgently required to control the level of the waterway and its tributaries. Farmers and other householders in many areas along the Shannon are suffering great hardship from the severe losses caused each year by flooding, which they cannot afford. The council must look into this problem.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Government is facilitating the Bill. At the opening of the debate I listened with great intent to Senator Finneran whose contribution I welcome. I gather that the Government will table amendments to the Bill next week and that the legislation can thus be improved upon and, please God, greatly strengthened. I also listened with great interest to the contribution by Senator O'Toole, that intrepid mariner. I remember seeing a photograph of him aboard his cruiser on the Shannon. It is great to see that Members of this House appreciate so much the natural beauty of the river and its relaxing and restorative qualities. Maybe we should all spend more time there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true for the Senator. Senator O'Toole is a man of many parts and a man for all seasons. We must strengthen the Bill in order to find ways of providing for the effective implementation of any directives the council, in its wisdom, might issue. As many speakers have said, the Shannon is an outstanding tourist attraction and proper facilities must be put in place to ensure that pleasure boats do not contribute to the pollution of the river.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works and the ESB have a duty to discharge their responsibilities regarding the Shannon. I would also like angling clubs and farming organisations to become fully involved. I compliment the IFA for its past involvement in the care of the river. We must ensure, however, that there is no overlapping between the various agencies concerned. The management of the river to the most satisfactory level must be the goal because in the past it has been unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Bills come before the House with some faults and we are determined, on both sides of the House, to make sure they are improved. Whatever this Bill's faults, however, it is a stumble in the right direction and we cannot do any wrong. I am pleased with what I have heard. I am excited about the level of co-operation and I have no doubt that, given the goodwill that seems to <Col N="348" /> exist, the Bill will be improved upon and strengthened.</P>

      <P>Is cúis áthais dom a bheith ar ais anseo chun labhairt ar an mBille Príobháideach seo. Déanaim comhgháirdeachas leis na baill as ucht an chomhoibriú uathu chun an Bille a phlé. Tá mé anseo in ionad mo chomhleacaí ón Rialtas, an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Ó Cuilinn, atá tinn faoi láthair agus tá mé ag súil go mbeidh sé ar ais arís i gcionn tamaill bhig.</P>
      <P>I thank and congratulate everyone involved in bringing forward this Bill. I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, who is indisposed. We wish him a speedy recovery. I thank Senators for their collective contributions to reintroducing the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998.</P>
      <P>On many occasions, the question of the establishment of a statutory body with executive powers to manage the Shannon catchment has been raised. This proposal has always been rejected by successive Governments, on the basis that it is considered unnecessary. Indeed, implementing such a proposal would require major legislative changes.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as introduced, gives rise to a wide range of issues affecting the responsibilities of many of my Government colleagues, their Departments and agencies and bodies under the aegis of these Departments, including the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Dúchas, the Department of Public Enterprise, Bord na Móna, the ESB, the Environmental Protection Agency and many others. In addition, Senators may be aware that a draft EU directive has been under consideration which would establish a framework for Community action in the field of water policy. Any statutory authority for the River Shannon would have to be in harmony with the measures of that directive when it becomes European Union law.</P>
      <P>In March 1989, when I was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I established the River Shannon Forum to bring together all the organisations connected with the Shannon River and give them an opportunity to express their view, to co-ordinate the use of the resources of this great river and to ensure that a consensus was arrived at on the most efficient management of these resources. That forum held its first meeting on 21 March 1989 which was attended by 45 representatives. It met on average six times per annum, until responsibility for the River Shannon was removed from the Office of Public Works by the creation of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, including Dúchas, by the previous Government. This was a retrograde decision, the real victims of which are the unfortunate people who live under constant pressure from flooding in the River Shannon catchment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the flooding problems on the River Shannon, particularly the recent serious <Col N="349" /> flooding, I am well aware of how traumatic flooding of this magnitude can be. I take this opportunity to express again our deepest concern to all those affected. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and I and all our colleagues are aware of all these terrible flooding problems, as the Shannon River is the natural boundary of our constituencies.</P>
    <P>It must also be borne in mind that the recent flooding in the Shannon basin was the worst for over 50 years, with rainfall for the month of December 1999 being twice the normal average. It is also a fact that much of the area in question floods on an annual basis. This poses great hardship for the householders and many small farmers in the catchment.</P>
    <P>There has been a consensus over a considerable period that capital works to relieve flooding of the Shannon are not viable. There is no evidence to suggest this position has changed. The most recent of many reports on the Shannon, commissioned by the Irish Farmers Association and carried out by consultants Delap &amp; Waller, concluded there were no obvious localised engineering works apparent to them which, if carried out, would significantly improve the regime of this powerful river.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the particular problems in the mid-part of the Shannon. The Office of Public Works has already been in contact with Westmeath, Roscommon and Galway County Councils in this regard. If anybody has any proposals or suggestions on how the situation between Meelick, in south-east Galway, and Athlone might be alleviated, the Commissioners of Public Works will be available to consider these proposals or offer any other advice that might be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works is actively preparing flood relief schemes at Kilkenny, Carlow, Clonmel and other areas which have been affected by flood events in recent years. The key element has been to determine local wishes through the local authorities and local groups, so as to achieve a balance between flood relief and local priorities. As the House may know, a local interest group is very active in south Galway. The arterial drainage maintenance on the rivers where we have completed schemes yields a benefit by way of flood relief. I draw the attention of the House to the report on the arterial drainage maintenance programme published last year, which confirms its benefits throughout the country.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the initiatives of Senators in introducing this Bill, the sections referring to the functions of the council in the area of water quality, regulation and control of pollution are reflected in the draft European Union directive.</P>
    <P>I realise the serious difficulties encountered over the years by people in the River Shannon catchment. I have listened with great interest to the very sincere contributions by Members of all parties tonight. Many similar sentiments have been expressed by our predecessors in both Houses of the Oireachtas over the past eight dec<Col N="350" /> ades, yet nothing really positive has happened on this issue.</P>
    <P>I want to progress this matter. I have observed the all-party support for this Bill tonight. Members will realise the Shannon is intertwined in the affairs of some of our vital semi-State agencies, especially the ESB and Bord na Móna. On the basis of the unanimity expressed here, I am prepared, on behalf of the Government, to refer this Bill to the Oireachtas Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport for further and detailed examination, with a view to making clear recommendations to Government on the exact method of bringing this very important matter to finality. I trust this decision by me, on behalf of the Government, is to the satisfaction of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing us extra time to speak on this very important Bill. I wholeheartedly support the Bill, as have Members on both sides of the House. The Minister of State's contribution was very constructive. However, I was amazed by some of what he told us, particularly the major problems he outlined.</P>
      <P>The hardship endured by people should be put on the record. I live many miles from the area concerned but I see media reports every year about the difficulties encountered by people living near the Shannon. That hardship results in a poor quality of life. Every effort should be made to address this and no stone should be left unturned. If consultants have stated there is no way around this problem, we must look at it again. Given modern technology and the different methods of land drainage, sluice gates, monitoring of water flow and so on, we should be able to look, with consultants, at lowering the basin and other approaches to this real problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the situation in Clonmel. We tackled that difficulty with the co-operation of the county council and the backing of the Department and the Government. That problem is not solved, but the Shannon problem is much bigger than ours. If the Shannon problem is not sorted, the flooding difficulties experienced in many areas of the country will not be solved for generations to come. Despite the difficulties stated by the Minister of State, we must pursue this if farming and tourism are to continue in that part of the country. People should not have to endure such hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has received tremendous support throughout the country and from Oireachtas Members and the farming organisations, in particular. Queries in this regard have been brought to our notice, which the Minister of State did not address tonight. These issues include the funding allocation for the maintenance of the river channels and the setting up of an adequate annual budget to carry out maintenance on the main stream of the River Shannon as a drainage channel. This was one of the aspects raised by the farming organisations. Another important issue is the urgent need for financial assistance targeted at farmers who have suffered losses due to flood<Col N="351" /> ing. It is impossible to try to farm land and look after animals if land is waterlogged as these people whose lands were flooded in December 1999 and January 2000 have had to do.</P>
    <P>This Government, as we hear daily on the national airwaves, is awash with money. Each day we hear of the Celtic tiger and the bonanza. If we have any charity in our hearts, we must be serious about looking after those people. I implore the Minister to go back to his Government colleagues and get them to try to look after these people. As we all know, farming, as an industry, has gone through one of its most difficult periods. People are leaving the land in droves. Let us try to halt that and do something in the first few months of this new millennium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of the sentiments expressed this evening. I come from County Westmeath. As we all know, the Shannon touches 13 of the 26 counties. It is of the utmost importance that this problem is addressed once and for all. I thank Senators for bringing this matter to the House this evening. Originally, the former Senator, Deputy Daly, who served as Minister with eight different portfolios, brought this splendid Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran who, with myself and the assistant Government Whip, Senator Moylan, has worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to try to enhance this Bill and to see what can be done about the dreadful position in which people along the banks of the Shannon find themselves. We could talk at length about the hardship faced by these people but nobody in this House knows what it is like to have a flooded holding, to have one's house flooded or to see lives in danger as a result of continuous flooding.</P>
      <P>All Governments until now have been putting this matter on the long finger. It is good to see a Minister from the west, Deputy Treacy, make a proposal for our consideration. This House decided on today's Order of Business to take this Bill again next week during Private Members' time. Many Senators wish to make contributions and I want to afford them the opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>The problem is so serious that something has to be done. At the behest of Senator Finneran and Senator Moylan I met with people in the area last Sunday evening. They handed me a report commissioned in 1986 for the IWAI which was done by John Weaving. It contained proposals which would eliminate 30% to 40% of the flooding problem in the Shannon catchment area and, I understand, not at enormous cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals could be costed by the Minister's officials. I am only too pleased to let the Minister have this report to see what could be done &ndash; perhaps a five year plan from the people who are affected. We do not want any glossy statements from people who live far away, who work in large office buildings in cities and towns and who are not affected. This proposal, which could be implemented over five years, comes <Col N="352" /> from the people. As Leader of the House, I will hand it to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and ask his officials to see what it would cost and to confirm whether, in their professional opinion, it would eliminate 30% to 40% of the flooding when water levels are high during November, December, January and February, in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for coming to speak on one of the most important challenges facing us. We have a national policy on waste management which we produced to meet EU requirements. We produce rubbish, therefore, we must get rid of it. A debate is taking place in most regions on how we will manage to get rid of waste and there is much concern about the introduction of thermal treatment as a new process.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister and his Department consider, in order to properly inform the public, putting together an educational and informative video on waste management outlining our policy and the various ways to manage our waste, including recycling, reduction, reuse and thermal treatment? In a fair and unbiased way, perhaps the video could outline the pros and cons of all the types of waste disposal.</P>
      <P>If we introduce thermal treatment, people will have a valid health concern with the emission of dioxins, particularly as we have always had a clean and green image. It might be important from a tourism point of view to ensure nothing we introduce takes from that. We need to take account of the amount of waste we produce and to work with the producers and sellers of goods to reduce waste by not accepting the mountains of wrapping we get when we go to the supermarket or the corner shop.</P>
      <P>I would like to see an informed debate take place. It is within our remit in terms of education to try to ensure that we assist that debate at every level. Some 25% of the people have literacy difficulties. If we could introduce something which is audio and visual, it may help to inform all the people and not only those who are in a position to read the various plans and promotional literature published by the Departments and local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the polluter pays principle and that we must do something about our rubbish. For too long it has been too easy to simply put rubbish in a plastic bag outside our house, which is taken away and forgotten about. Information and education are the key to properly managing our <Col N="353" /> waste and ensuring our policy is implemented. I hope the Minister will consider my suggestion as a way to inform the public. With the introduction of recycling, reuse and reduction techniques, the Government might consider a moratorium on the decision on the introduction of thermal treatment as a process for managing our waste. We could use the interim period of two to three years to decide whether we could increase recycling and reduction techniques to a level where we could manage our waste by the use of landfill sites without having to introduce a technology such as thermal treatment.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say and I thank him for coming to the House to reply to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cox for raising this matter. Overall Government policy on waste management is clearly set out in the document Changing Our Ways, which the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and I published in October 1998. A copy of this policy statement was provided at that time to every public representative in the Oireachtas and at local authority level, and it has since been very widely disseminated among the general public.</P>
      <P>We are committed to a long overdue move away from one dimensional waste practices, based on landfill, towards a modern, environmentally sustainable system of waste management. Changing Our Ways sets out a broad framework for this transition. With a clear focus on the need to respect the waste hierarchy, Changing Our Ways strongly endorsed meaningful strategic planning by local authorities on a regional basis, a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill in favour of an integrated waste management approach, which utilises a range of waste treatment options and the mobilisation of public support and participation.</P>
      <P>The response of local authorities has been very positive. Emerging regional and local plans provide for an integrated package of waste infrastructure including extended networks of &ldquo;bring banks&rdquo;, civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations, materials recovery facilities, biological and thermal treatment capacity and residual landfill requirements.</P>
      <P>There has been a very strong emphasis on public consultation and engagement in this planning process and it is imperative that this continues. Public education, awareness and participation are an integral part of modernising waste management and are particularly valuable in the context of the specific plans now emerging and their implementation.</P>

    <P>New waste facilities, whatever their nature, are generally unwelcome to the public and invariably generate vigorous local opposition. In the first instance, the public needs reassurance that high standards of environmental protection will apply at all times. Nowadays very strict standards are laid down for all waste facilities, whether they <Col N="354" /> entail landfill or alternative thermal or biological treatment, and this message must be conveyed clearly.</P>
    <P>There are negative perceptions about thermal treatment, particularly waste incineration. However, when carried on in accordance with high environmental standards, incineration is generally regarded as environmentally preferable to the disposal of waste by landfill. It plays a major part in municipal waste management in EU countries that would be regarded as environmentally progressive. It is also worth noting that EU standards for waste incineration were reviewed recently and are to be made more stringent in a new Community directive agreed by the EU Environment Ministers last year and now before the European Parliament. Apart from issues of environmental safety, there are other considerations associated with the various waste management options open to us. Each has advantages and disadvantages, from a technical, operational or financial perspective.</P>
    <P>We need informed discussion of all the issues involved and meaningful public involvement and a policy of openness and transparency can mitigate the real concerns of host communities in relation to waste facilities of whatever kind. This will involve practical engagement with the issues across the different regions and I do not believe that a single video which, of its nature would have to be general in its treatment of issues, would be of any substantive value in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, it is the responsibility of regional and local authorities, which will drive the coming transition in waste management practices, to inform and guide this public involvement process. These authorities recognise the importance of this task and will be increasingly active in this regard as the year progresses.</P>
    <P>For instance, the local authorities in the Dublin region are already embarked upon a very significant public education and involvement programme with regard to the implementation of their regional waste management plan. Such a proactive approach merits support and my Department is exploring the scope for EU assistance towards such initiatives.</P>
    <P>With regard to recycling and waste recovery generally, it is my intention, in association with the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to prepare a further policy statement for publication this year. This policy document will address in detail the factors and practical considerations that are relevant to the achievement of Government policy objectives in this area. It will be widely disseminated.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the Department of Education and Science immediately prioritises and expedites the tendering and completion of the extension and refurbishment of Granlahan national school. I was approached recently by chairman of the board of management of the school, Reverend <Col N="355" /> Father Joseph Feaney, the principal, Mr. William Phillips, his assistant, Angela Keaveney, and other members of the board who include Mr. Joe Kane, Ms Mary Costello, Pauline Neary, Mary Gormley and Gerry Glennon. They sent me a statement which highlights the deplorable conditions prevailing at the school.</P>
      <P>Granlahan national school is a two teacher school, which had an enrolment of 40 pupils in the current school year. The school was built in 1963. It was originally a girls' school and in the early 1970s it amalgamated with the boys' school. The toilets were divided in two using a wooden partition and this is still the case today. Due to the overcrowding and the lack of separate male and female toilet facilities, the condition of the entire toilet block has deteriorated over the years to the extent that it has become unsafe and odorous. It is proving impossible to maintain acceptable standards of health and safety.</P>
      <P>In 1994 a shared remedial teacher was appointed to a cluster of schools in the area and that teacher works in the school three afternoons each fortnight. The school has only two classrooms. For the past five years that teacher and her pupils have had to use the school's cloakroom as a classroom. Children with learning difficulties who attend the remedial class deserve better than this and subjecting that group of children and their teacher to the indignity of working in a dim and dreary cloakroom is wrong and unjust. On the occasions when the music teacher attends the school and that visit coincides with the visit of the remedial teacher, the pupils who are learning music must be taught in the corridor. Surely that is not an acceptable practice.</P>
      <P>In June 1998 the board of management applied to the Department of Education and Science to carry out a small extension to the school and a total refurbishment of the whole building. The work was approved and sanctioned by the building and planning unit of the Department of Education and Science in Tullamore. The local contribution was fixed at 10% and planning permission and a fire certificate were applied for and granted. The board of management had taken a decision to carry out this work to the school during the last summer holidays, July and August l999. The board is extremely unhappy that delays and a lack of urgency in the Department's planning and building unit resulted in this necessary development being held up and the work not proceeding.</P>
      <P>The situation regarding the toilet facility and the accommodation for the shared remedial teacher and the music teacher is urgent. It is a matter of priority that the work should commence immediately. I am not aware of any other school where boys and girls share the same toilet block or where a teacher and her class use a cluttered and dark cloakroom as a classroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="356" /> I request the Minister of State to deal with this as a matter of urgency. I have been asked to use my influence to make whatever representations I consider necessary to get the work done on behalf of the parents, the pupils and the teachers of Granlahan national school. I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply to the matter. I hope his response will give some comfort to the people concerned having regard to their circumstances.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter. He may have observed that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, was here earlier ready to deal with this matter but unfortunately he had to leave due to a vote in the Dáil. He has asked me to respond on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the proposed building project at Granlahan national school, County Roscommon. At present, the school has a staffing level of principal teacher, one assistant and a shared remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The management of Granlahan national school applied for funding towards upgrading and refurbishing the existing facilities. A technical inspection was carried out by my Department's architectural service and a building project was approved subsequently. Architectural planning for the provision of a total refurbishment to the existing school, a new sanitary block, the installation of a new mechanical and electrical system and the provision of a new ball court and bus pull-in are at an advanced stage. Planning permission and fire certificate have been secured. The current position on the project is that working drawings are in preparation and this process is expected to be completed shortly. The intention is to progress the project to construction stage as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Senator will appreciate that there are a large number of school building projects on hand within the Department. Due to the priority which this Government has given to reversing the neglect of our primary schools evident previously, the spending estimates published this year show primary school building and renovation funding increasing by an unprecedented 186 per cent from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, we have significantly reduced the burden of fund raising faced by schools and communities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Senator that the project will proceed as quickly as possible through the remaining stages of the architectural planning process. My Department is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at Granlahan. On behalf of the Minister I thank him again for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 February 2000.</P>
