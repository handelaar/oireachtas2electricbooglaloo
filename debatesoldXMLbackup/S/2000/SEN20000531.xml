      <P>I have notice from Senator Kathleen O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide additional funding for psychiatric services in North Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Frank Chambers of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the Government's commitment to investment in education under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, taking into account the recent figures published in the OECD report, showing a reduced investment in education in Ireland in comparison with other EU countries.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator O'Meara as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret I have to rule Senator Chambers's matter out of order, as it is more appropriate for discussion as a substantive motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 2, Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators ten minutes; No. 3, Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes and all others Senators ten minutes; No. 4, Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; and No. 23, motion 22, to be taken from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. Business will resume thereafter if not previously concluded. Business will be interrupted from 1.15 p.m. until 2 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 23, motion 23, be the first item taken today. If the Leader agrees to provide time next week or on a specific date in the foreseeable future to take this motion, I will not press the amendment. It is a short motion which covers some of the most fundamental issues facing Irish politics. They are issues which we, as a House, should debate in depth. I do not want the Leader to say that last week there was a Private Members' motion. That motion was on a Bill from the Labour Party on a specific issue. The Government came back with an omnibus amendment and speakers were allowed eight minutes. I did not bother going in as there is no way one could even begin to cover the issues in eight minutes and many other people did not go in for that reason.</P>
      <P>That motion was agreed by all party leaders a week ago and it is now in the names of the leader of the Labour group and the spokesperson for the Independent group &ndash; I see Senator Ross, who does not answer to a leader, coming in&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Not since Senator Manning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As I well know. This motion is in no way threatening. These are issues which we have a duty to discuss. If the Leader gives a clear indication that this non-threatening motion, to which I am certain many Members on his side would like to contribute, will be taken next week, I will not press the amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business put forward by Senator Manning. I would like the Leader of the House to put his name to this motion and to see it being taken. It is not, however, my intention to press it to a vote today if the Leader gives a commitment to deal with this next week or on a given date. It is crucially important for Members on all sides of the House to say what they have to say on the record and to clarify the record in many ways. Many Members are uncomfortable with the present situation. I believe that Members, who are elected public representatives, should deal with this in an all-party manner. I ask the Leader to give an absolute commitment that this will be addressed next week or on an agreed date. That would at least bring us to the point where we could show the public that there is concern across the House, and not on any one side of the House, and that the high moral ground is not something that goes from one side to the other at any particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion referred to by Senator O'Toole is also in my name on behalf of the Labour group. I also urge the Leader to accept it to allow a debate today or tomorrow or next week. We have raised this every day in recent weeks and the Leader has fobbed us off each time, despite the fact that we agreed a <Col N="771" /> motion following his direction that we should come together and do so. It is time we had this wide-ranging debate on standards in public life. I urge the Leader to support such a debate and to specify a date for it.</P>
      <P>I seek a debate on waste management. A number of Members on both sides of the House have sought such a debate for several weeks. It is a major issue which is being addressed by every local authority but it also has quite major national implications in terms of the approach to incineration and the recent information on cancer-causing dioxins, landfills and charges. In addition, there is the question of the standard and content of each local plan. It is time for a debate on this issue so that we can tease out the implications for the national waste management policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's request for a debate on waste management, which has been sought by other Members since early in the last session. Senator Coogan, myself and others have asked for such a debate for a number of months. We are well into this session and it has not taken place. In the meantime there is guerrilla warfare throughout the country between groups against incineration, super dumps&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These points can be made during the debate which you seek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The key point is there is a total absence of national guidance and leadership and this House has the capacity to provide a coherent debate on this issue. I predict that ten years from now a tribunal will be set up by the next generation to establish what the politicians were doing to halt the destruction of our environment in the early years of the millennium. I do not want that to be said of the current generation of Members. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate sooner rather than later as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it disturbing that following general agreement between leaders of the various groups on an all-party motion my leader and others are saying today that a motion has been tabled without the consent of the other side of the House. The Leader agreed this motion and he said that there would not be a time limit for speakers. They could speak for as long as they liked and that is on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Eight minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that three weeks ago. We want an all-party motion to debate lobbying and what is going on in public life. I asked for and received agreement from the Leader on that. It is most unfair and does not give a good impression of the other side of the House. Government Members feel the same way. Why can we not have an agreed all-party motion and general agreement on when the debate should take place? I do not say we should have a debate <Col N="772" /> today but I understood there was agreement between all the leaders of the various groups on this and that is the way it should be. It is most unfair to all Members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate on the OECD report published yesterday, which has taken to task many economists, newspaper reporters and the media in this country for their pariah-like discussions on the economy. The OECD has suggested that the economy is booming and will continue to boom. We should debate its report.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Senator Lanigan on the Order of Business, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a small piece on the report on the front page of today's <i>Irish Independent.</i> It is time that good news is given at least the same amount of publicity as the bad news.</P>
      <P>We must congratulate the English credit card companies who will be taking on the cartel of credit card companies here. It is about time. The credit card companies, and the major banks who run them, have been ripping off the small business&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate that matter on the Order of Business. It is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that these companies will be entering the market and competing, I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate on the cost of credit charged by credit card companies and to see if any redress can be given to the huge number of people who have been taken asunder by the interest they charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning and others who have called for a debate on ethics in politics and on public lobbyists, etc. I do not see why people feel so threatened by such debate. The issue will not go away and the sooner we debate it the better. Within the next few weeks we will be leaving for the summer recess. I hope we will not seek a similar debate when we return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of waste management, who is advising the Minister on thermal treatment? It <Col N="773" /> appears that he is getting only one side of the argument. Senator Quill and Senator Coogan have requested that he attend the House to hear a balanced debate on the matter. Local authorities are floundering on how best to approach it. Surely as Minister he should give direction.</P>
    <P>I cannot recall the number of times we have requested that the Mental Health Bill be introduced and debated. I have received many letters in the past weeks detailing the deplorable conditions in some of the psychiatric hospitals. The sooner we deal with the Bill the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir, with regard to the matter on the Adjournment. Will the Leader ask the Minster for Education and Science to attend the House to outline the Government's commitment to education in the national development plan? Investment in education has played a very important part in the growth of the economy. A debate on the matter would be worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposed amendment to the Order of Business regarding the funding of our democracy and the other related matters. I invite the Leader to make the motion unanimous and to allocate more than the eight minutes allocated on the motion last week dealing with lobbyists. This matter should be addressed in an all-party manner.</P>
      <P>As the Government's representative in the House, will the Leader advise what the Government has in mind to ensure the retention of what remains of the rural post office network, which sadly is under threat again? The network should be guaranteed because it is part of the bedrock of rural life. Post offices are essential, but it appears that more of them may go. I ask the Leader to outline what the Government intends to do to aid their retention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on waste management. My view is that landfill sites are no longer an option for dealing with waste. There is much misinformation about waste management and I would welcome a debate at an early stage on this matter.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Coghlan's request for a debate on rural post offices. However, in terms of their continued existence, it would be marvellous if local people supported them. This is not happening in many places and that is why they are closing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not have a debate on rural post offices on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Cathaoirleach's ruling. However, I support the call for a debate on this matter. Such a discussion would educate the public, although I do not suggest Members are not here to be educated. Many people cry when post offices are closed but if they made a more con<Col N="774" /> certed effort to use and support them, they would not close in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposal regarding No. 23, motion 23. I also support the call by Senator Costello, Senator Quill and members of the major party in the House for a debate on incineration. I have asked for such a debate five times and the Leader assured me on each occasion that he would arrange it. This issue is critical because decisions must be made soon on whether we opt for incineration. We must know whether it is secure and safe or if it would endanger lives. The Minister's view has been one sided. We want to ensure a balanced debate takes place so we can inform local authority members who must soon make decisions in this area. However, they will avoid the issue because they do not know enough about it and they do not want to take any chances. The House is the proper forum for this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Leader cannot clarify the position, I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that only Committee Stage of the Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000, be taken today. The Minister made it clear in her characteristically blunt fashion that she felt taking all Stages at once was ridiculous. She has already committed herself to discussing Report Stage amendments with members of the Opposition. I am sorry the Leader did not contact her since and find this out. We will not be in a position to deal with Report and Final Stages today. To concentrate the Leader's mind, I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that only Committee Stage be taken today.</P>
      <P>I enthusiastically support the calls of my colleagues who raised the issue of waste. People should read the most recent report of the EPA to understand what is happening to our rivers. We will be buried in a mountain of waste within a short time. There is a need for a strategy and leadership. Every element from minimisation of the generation of waste to how it is dealt with afterwards must be involved, but none of that is happening at present. It is an extremely important issue. Apart from our quality of life, our tourism industry will collapse and will be buried in a mountain of waste within five years.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns of my colleagues about rural post offices. However, we should not forget that rural banks are also facing closure. People say to me that Internet banking will replace it, but I still do not know how to deposit money through the Internet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many ways of giving money and moving money around, but I cannot deposit money via the Internet. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the ideology of competition which has taken over this country and <Col N="775" /> which is at the root of an enormous number of developments that are threatening the fabric of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns expressed by many of my colleagues about rural post offices. I ask the Leader, in responding to the calls for a debate on this matter, to note that there is a simple solution to the problem. In England, banks are closing in rural areas, but post offices still exist there. If the banks and post offices came together, as happened in England, and provided a banking service through the rural post office network, everybody would be satisfied as the rural post offices would be retained and people in rural communities would have a service. I am sure others saw the excellent RTE series during the week on the closure of services in rural parts of the country. This is a problem in my county. The Minister is anxious to encourage two banking groups which are already involved in negotiations with An Post. The Leader should encourage the Minister to knock heads together in the banks and post offices.</P>
      <P>As regards comments I made last week about the emigrant issue and on which the Leas-Chathaoirleach indulged me, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has announced that the Government, in recognising the severe financial implications of the currency difference between the Irish punt and sterling, has agreed to make up the £250,000 lost to emigrant groups in the UK while the current sterling/ punt ratio remains. I acknowledge and welcome the Minister's gesture in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House for a debate on the control of drugs. A recent report shows that 12 or 13 criminal gangs control the drugs scene. It is important to have an urgent debate on the widespread use of drugs throughout the country. Drugs are not only used and abused in cities but in small rural villages and towns. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should come into the House as a matter of urgency to explain the steps he is taking to get rid of the 12 or 13 criminal gangs involved in drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Senator Ryan needs someone to second his amendment. I second the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Dino Cregan, Jackman, Coghlan and Coogan called for more time to debate ethics in politics and the funding of political parties and politicians. After the Order of Business yesterday, Senator Manning, Senator O'Toole and I discussed this matter and we arranged the wording of a motion. Last night I received the motion <Col N="776" /> and I have no difficulty putting my name to it so it is an all-party motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I endeavoured before this was done yesterday to ensure it would be agreed. Something must have happened along the way but the bona fides of this side of the House were not in question. One cannot have a debate on the same issue twice in the one week. It has not happened here and it will not happen under my leadership. We had a debate on this issue last week. I noted the Senators who spoke on it and those who requested it on the Order of Business but did not speak on it. I know some Members could not speak because of time constraints and commitments. We will see if we can allocate time to it as early as possible over the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Jackman, Quill, Glynn, Coogan and Ryan called for a debate on waste management. I hope to have this debate within the next two weeks. As we all know, local authority members have visited countries which suffered from this problem years ago to see how their local authorities successfully dealt with it. I can only speak for the midland region of Longford, Westmeath, Laois, Offaly and north Tipperary which is at an advanced stage in making a decision on this issue. It is timely that we should discuss it here within the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan called for a debate on the OECD report. I have no difficulty leaving time for such a debate. I welcome parts of the report which are in favour of what is happening in Ireland and the success of the policies which politicians in general but the Government in particular have been behind.</P>
      <P>An historic decision was made in Northern Ireland last Saturday but the banner headlines in the Sunday newspapers made one wonder whether the journalists employed by those newspapers actually live on this island because they appear to have missed what happened. These people are trying to set an agenda, but I have news for them &ndash; the Government will ensure that this country continues to enjoy economic success during the next two years.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan requested a debate on credit card charges and I will make time available for that. Senator Chambers requested that the Minister for Education and Science come before the House to discuss the investment in education provided for in the national development plan. I have no difficulty in arranging a debate on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Coghlan, Mooney, Glynn and Ryan referred to rural post offices. This issue has been discussed on many occasions. As long as this Government is in power, those who operate rural post offices have nothing to fear. However, people living in rural areas should do more to avail of the services on offer at these post offices. <Col N="777" /> They should also avail of the range of services on offer to them in the towns and villages in their areas rather than driving 50 or 60 miles to a city to buy produce. These people probably do not save any money by shopping in the city, particularly when account is taken of the transport costs they incur. I agree with the Senators' call that support be given to rural post offices.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan moved an amendment in respect of the Aviation Regulation Bill. We will review progress on that matter later in the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will amend the Health Act, 1970, the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988 and the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. In brief, this composite Bill sets out the Government's proposals to improve and update the statutory basis for the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances under the general medical services and community drugs schemes; to raise the age at which tobacco products can be sold to young persons from the present age of 16 years to 18 years and to raise the maximum fine on persons convicted for selling tobacco products <Col N="779" /> to under age persons from £500 to £1,500; to empower the Minister for Health and Children to prescribe any necessary administrative and technical details to facilitate the efficient administration of the scheme for the payment of subvention in respect of patients in nursing homes and also to empower the Minister to make regulations governing standards in private convalescent homes under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>For reasons of clarity, as this is a composite Bill, I propose to speak about each of the three distinct elements of the Bill and then to outline the detailed contents of the Bill as a whole.</P>
      <P>My purpose in amending section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, is threefold. In essence, section 59 is the statutory basis for the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances under the general medical services and the community drugs schemes, the schemes which allow the reimbursement by the State of medicines taken by patients in the community. As the legislation is 30 years old and the increasingly complex pharmaceutical issues facing us in this millennium could not have been foreseen when the Health Act, 1970, was drafted, it has been necessary to review the legislation with a view to improving and updating the regulation of the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances under the general medical services and community drugs schemes, promoting an equitable and more accountable service in this regard and making better provision for the delivery of community pharmacy services.</P>
      <P>Under present arrangements, drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances are provided without charge to persons with full eligibility, that is, medical card holders, in line with criteria for reimbursement. Traditionally, these items are supplied through community pharmacies or, in cases where there is no local pharmacy, by the patient's general practitioner who in these circumstances is known colloquially as a dispensing doctor.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to the provision of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances for persons with limited eligibility &ndash; non-medical card holders &ndash; is that community drugs schemes have been in operation over the years whereby the State meets a proportion of the cost of prescribed products. Under the current scheme, the drug payment scheme, an individual or family pays the first £42 in respect of expenditure on approved prescribed drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances and the balance of the cost is met by the State.</P>
      <P>A third arrangement, known as the long-term illness scheme, is in place for persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature whereby drugs are made available without charge in respect of the treatment of the primary condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will continue present arrangements and, as in the current situation, <Col N="780" /> drugs will be supplied without charge to persons with full eligibility and expenditure incurred by persons with limited eligibility in respect of themselves or their dependants will be recouped in part, as prescribed by regulation. Broadly speaking, &ldquo;dependants&rdquo; is defined as spouse, children under the age of 18 years or under 23 years if in full-time education, or children of any age with a mental or physical disability to the extent that it is not reasonably possible for the child to maintain himself or herself fully and who are living at home. The crucial or pivotal point with regard to a scheme such as the drug payment scheme, as is borne out by the definition of dependants, is that it is not means tested and is open to everyone. The Bill also continues to provide for the long-term illness scheme.</P>
    <P>My concerns are to ensure that arrangements for the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances in the community are equitable, all arrangements meet accountability requirements and the service to patients is a quality service. Section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, does not facilitate a clear and transparent approach to reimbursement, does not explicitly provide for accountability and is not adequately structured to promote a quality driven community pharmacy service. In other words, time and expectations have moved on but the legislation underpinning the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances has not. Steps must therefore be taken to bring the legislation into line with current demands and requirements.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the making of regulations concerning the granting of approval of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances for reimbursement purposes and the withdrawal of this approval for stated reasons. This will ensure an equitable, transparent and coherent approach to reimbursement. As I mentioned earlier, section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, is concerned with the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances in the community. The Bill therefore provides for the supply of reimbursable products through community pharmacies as the most appropriate dispensing arrangement in most instances for medicines taken in the community. This reflects current practice and policy regarding the provision of community pharmaceutical care in line with the contractor agreement for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970, which was introduced in 1996 and which is pro-active in promoting a quality driven service to the patient.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the service to patients has been enhanced as a result of the new contractor agreement which imposes obligations not in place before. A central and innovative element of the contractor agreement is a clause providing for a review by the pharmacist of the medicine therapy of the patient, including screening for any potential drug therapy problems, therapeutic duplication, drug to drug interactions, incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment, drug <Col N="781" /> allergy interactions and clinical abuse or misuse. The review also includes an examination of the rational and cost effective use of the medicine prescribed, including the choice of medicines and the potential for wastage. In addition, the contractor agreement is designed to improve the quality of services by encouraging greater investment in the pharmacy and facilitating the involvement of a greater number of pharmacists in a given pharmacy.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Bill makes specific provision for the making of regulations in regard to agreements between the proprietor of a community pharmacy and a health board pursuant to which community pharmacies supply drugs and medicines and medical and surgical appliances under the general medical services and community drugs schemes designed to foster the best possible community pharmacy service. However, the Bill also takes account of the fact that, in the absence of a community pharmacy service, some medical card patients in remote areas will rely on their general practitioners, dispensing doctors, for the supply of medicines.</P>
    <P>In addition, the provisions of the Bill acknowledge the dramatic pharmaceutical advancements which have taken place in recent years and which are likely to continue, perhaps at an even faster pace. In some circumstances, it may be appropriate for patient safety and monitoring purposes for certain sophisticated drugs to be dispensed in a hospital or clinic setting on an out-patient basis. The Bill, therefore, provides for the reimbursement of products provided by an institution that provides a specialist service under the direct supervision of a medical consultant, where approved by the Minister in accordance with regulations.</P>
    <P>In terms of supply and value for money, and in some cases patient convenience, it is recognised that community pharmacies may not be the most appropiate source of some non-drug items and that expertise in this area may lie elsewhere. On this basis, the Bill will also allow the reimbursement of some non-drug items supplied through other outlets approved by the Minister in accordance with regulations.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of value for money and accountability, the Bill will empower the Minister to make regulations to provide for the manner in which payments to community pharmacists and others who supply items under section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, are made by the relevant State agencies with responsibility in this matter and for the furnishing of information on items supplied, services provided and the costs involved. Regulations may also be made for the furnishing of information the relevant State agencies may require by suppliers of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to those dispensing these products. The Bill, therefore, provides a good legislative basis for verification of claims on the State by those supplying products reimbursable by the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> I will return to the amendment of section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, when outlining the contents of the Bill but I now move on to the amendment of the Health (Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>I regard the battle against smoking as one of the most important public health challenges facing us in the new millennium and this area is one of my main priorities as Minster for Health and Children. The adverse impact of tobacco consumption on public health is enormous. Smoking-related illnesses account for about 7,000 deaths each year in Ireland. Within the European Union the tobacco epidemic is killing over half a million citizens each year.</P>
    <P>Work is under way in my Department to prepare a new comprehensive tobacco Bill which will take on board a range of issues relating to tobacco and health. I hope to have this Bill ready for the autumn session. I am particularly concerned by the reported increase in the level of smoking among children and teenagers. One of the most disturbing facts about smoking is that for the vast majority of smokers the addiction begins in their childhood or teenage years. The tobacco industry has targeted children in their marketing campaigns and has sought to get them hooked at an early age. The sale of tobacco products to children and under age persons in particular is a most reprehensible practice and is one that has to be tackled aggressively.</P>
    <P>The report, Towards a Tobacco Free Society, launched by me on 7 March this year recommends, among other things, raising the age limit at which tobacco products can be sold to young persons to 18 years, as does the report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on smoking and health, published in November 1999.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment to the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, before the House today will have the effect of raising the age at which tobacco products can be sold to young persons from 16 to 18 years and will raise the maximum fine on persons convicted of selling to under age persons from £500 to £1,500. The increase in the maximum fine to £1,500 is the highest amount that can be included in this type of amendment and will act as a further deterrent to retailers. I take this measure on legal advice.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill amends the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. This Act, which came into effect on 1 September, 1993 has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and the second is to provide a system of subventions for dependent persons in need of nursing home care.</P>
    <P>With regard to subventions, section 7(2) of the Act provides that the Minister may by regulations prescribe the amounts of subvention that may be paid, and such amounts may be specified by reference to specified degrees of dependency, specified means or circumstances of dependent per<Col N="783" /> sons or such other matters as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>The rates of subvention were duly specified in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 (S.I. No. 227 of 1993). In order to facilitate the operation of the subvention scheme, provisions relating to the administration of the scheme are required. These provisions would cover areas such as making of applications for subvention; onus on the applicant to furnish infomation; assessment of degree of dependency; assessment of means and circumstances; calculation of amounts payable; notification of decision on applicants; review of subventions decision; death or discharge of patient; services to be covered by subvention; appeals against decisions; and recoupment of subventions.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, to amend section 7(2) to provide the powers to prescribe any necessary administrative and technical details. In addition, a further amendment of the Act is required to take account of the introduction by the Minister for Finance of a scheme of tax allowances in respect of capital expenditure on private convalescent homes in the Finance Act, 1999. The allowances apply to expenditure incurred on or after 2 December 1998 on the construction, extension or refurbishment of a convalescent home as well as the conversion of an existing building into a convalescent home. To ensure that the standard of care in convalescent homes is satisfactory, it is proposed that such homes be required to be registered under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>Regulations have been made under section 6 of the Act for the purpose of ensuring proper standards in nursing homes. It will be necessary to make similar regulations governing standards in convalescent homes, which may include provisions requiring convalescent homes to have adequate medical, nursing and para-medical staff and facilities, consistent with the patient profile of the home. I propose to amend section 6 of the Act to give ministerial power to prescribe different requirements for such homes.</P>
    <P>I will now outline some of the contents of the Bill. Section 1 amends section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, by the substitution of a new section for the existing section. Section 1(1), (2) and (3) provides for the supply of approved, prescribed drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with full eligibility and people with limited eligibility and their dependants.</P>
    <P>Section 1(4) provides for the supply of approved, prescribed medicines to medical card holders by dispensing doctors and also for the supply of non-drug items to people with full eligibility and limited eligibility by other persons as approved by the Minister. Section 1(5) provides for the supply of approved, prescribed drugs by an institution that provides a specialist service under the direct supervision of a medical consultant and stands approved by the Minister. Section <Col N="784" /> 1(6) provides for the making of regulations specifying the terms and conditions upon which and the extent to which health boards may defray the cost of supplying a particular drug or drugs or drugs for the treatment of a particular condition or conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 1(7) provides for the granting of an approval by the Minister for the purposes of the previous subsections and for the withdrawal of an approval for stated reasons and in accordance with regulations. Section 1(8) is a standard provision to the effect that the Minister may make regulations for the purposes of this section.</P>
    <P>Section 1(9) provides that regulations may provide for the manner in which payments may be made in respect of drugs supplied by community pharmacies and persons referred to in section 1(4) and (5) and in respect of fees for services. The regulations may also provide for the furnishing of information required on drugs supplied and services provided and for the refusal of payment if a request for information is not complied with.</P>
    <P>Section 1(10) provides for regulations in relation to agreements between the proprietors of pharmacies and health boards pursuant to which community pharmacies supply drugs for the purpose of this section. Section 1(11) provides that where a supplier of drugs to community pharmacies fails or refuses to comply with a request under regulations, the supplier shall be guilty of an offence and liable to summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500. Section 1(12)(1) is a standard subsection defining words or phrases in the section. Section 1(12)(2) is a standard provision for regulations made under section 59 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>Section 2 amends the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, by substituting a new section for section 3 of that Act to raise the age at which tobacco products can be sold to young persons from the present age of 16 years to 18 years and to raise the maximum fine on persons convicted for selling tobacco products to under age persons from £500 to £1,500. It also provides that it shall be a defence for a person who is prosecuted for an offence under this section to establish that he or she had taken all reasonable steps to assure himself or herself that the person to whom the tobacco products were sold, offered for sale or made available had attained the age of 18 years.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, by the insertion of a new subsection after subsection (6) of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, to provide for regulations to make different provision for different classes of nursing homes and prescribe different requirements for different classes of nursing homes. In section 7 of the Act a new subsection is substituted for subsection (2) in regard to the making of regulations prescribing any necessary administrative and technical details in relation to the operation of the subvention scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> Section 4 is a standard technical provision setting out the title of the Bill and providing that it and the Health Acts, 1947 to 1999, may be cited together as the Health Acts, 1947 to 2000, and that the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, and this Act may be cited together as the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Acts, 1988 and 2000. It also provides for the making of orders in regard to the coming into operation of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>These are the provisions of the Bill. I know everyone in this House is committed to fair and transparent arrangements for the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances under the Health Act, 1970. There can be no doubt that the House is committed to appropriate anti-tobacco strategies in view of the effects of tobacco on the nation's health. I am sure there is commitment to necessary changes in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. The Bill contains a range of measures in regard to its three distinct elements to strengthen and underpin existing legislation. We are prepared to listen to the debate and will consider any amendments which Senators table on Committee Stage with a view to bolstering the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and assure him that we welcome fair and transparent arrangements for supplying drugs and medical and surgical equipment under the Health Act, 1970. We are aware that this is a tidying up process to ensure we are kept up to date.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will include asthma in the long-term illness scheme. There has been a big increase in the number of people suffering from asthma, across all age groups, and it is a very expensive illness. At this stage, it should be included in the long-term illness scheme. Will the Minister keep the individual or family payment at the £42 rate? It is still a relatively large amount for people with ongoing medical expenses.</P>
      <P>The amendment to the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act is an important element of the Bill. Having considered the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, spearheaded by Deputy Shatter, the Minister proposes to make it an offence to sell tobacco products to people under 18 years of age. I was glad he took the report on board when it was debated in the Dáil last year and accepted the anti-smoking strategy. The Minister mentioned the 7,000 tobacco related deaths per year. The figure could be even higher. I was speaking to two visiting Americans today who had been here three years ago. I asked what they thought had changed in that time and they said that there was an extraordinary increase in the number of smokers, particularly in areas where one should not smoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know death related to tobacco product consumption is the most preventable cause of early mortality in Ireland. Research has shown that 80% of adult smokers start before the age of <Col N="786" /> 18. That is a staggering statistic. Of adult smokers, 50% had started by the age of 14 and the addiction had begun by age 12 for 25%. My experience as a teacher was that first year female students were often already addicted to smoking, a trend that is accelerating. The figures for young men are lower because of their interest in sports. It is difficult to get picked for the squad, let alone play, if one is puffing and panting. For young girls, however, there is pressure to look slim and many believe in slimming by smoking cigarettes. I am appalled by what is happening among that age group.</P>
    <P>The other age group about which I am concerned is the 25 to 30 year olds. Some of my daughter's friends have no intention of giving up smoking but when they reach 35 they will not be able to give it up. We must do something about smokers of that age.</P>
    <P>The Minister is attempting to increase the age limit for buying tobacco products to 18. I am concerned about how we will monitor the sale of cigarettes. This is the same as the anti-drinking laws &ndash; who will ask a 14 year old who looks 20 for identification? Shop owners could be penalised for any sale to an under age person by an employee. How will that be implemented? It will be extremely difficult to do so. I hope the Minister will take account of the fact that it should be an offence to have a cigarette vending machine on any premises where a person under 18 years of age is permitted to enter or to be present. If the product is available where young people gather it is obvious they will buy it. The issue of vending machines must be taken into account also.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the Bill, of which I hope the Minister has taken account, that a person prosecuted for the sale of cigarettes to a minor should not be able to rely on the defence of having taken all reasonable steps to assure himself of herself as to the age of the alleged under age purchaser unless the seller satisfies the court that he or she sought and obtained an appropriate document of age verification inclusive of an identity photo of the purchaser which attested to the purchaser being over 18.</P>
    <P>There are specifics of the anti-smoking strategy which have to be dealt with. The newly enacted measure requires that specified and prominent notices be in place at the point of sale of tobacco products in retail outlets warning of (a) the addictive and health dangers posed by cigarettes and (b) detailing the age restriction on sale and the vendor is obliged then to ask for age verification. I presume the Minister has all that in hand. I hope he has the detail in hand.</P>
    <P>I know from this document that fines of £500 to £1,500 are proposed and the Minister has stated that is the maximum with which he could deal under this legislation but the recommendation from the committee was a sum not exceeding £2,500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about the legal advice. A sum of £1,500 these days is nothing to many people. People talk in terms of millions. It has to be a harsh deterrent and it must be implementable. I will be proposing on Committee Stage that we examine this again. I do not know the relevance of the legal advice. Is it that it cannot be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Relating to an offence of this kind. We receive advice from the Attorney General on these matters. That is only by way of clarification on these matters. I would go higher if I could but that is what I am told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think the Minister would but I would like to know about fines in the context of other European countries. We have German parliamentarians visiting us. I wonder what sort of fines there are outside this country. I presume they are higher than £1,500. The Bill proposes that on conviction for a second offence the court should have jurisdiction to impose a fine of up to £5,000. Deputy Shatter has a legal mind and much experience and he would not go very casually into this area. He must have done his research and he has done tremendous research in the United States and Europe. The Bill proposes that on conviction for a second offence, the court should have jurisdiction to impose a fine of up to £5,000 and/or require the offender to do community service. This would be a major deterrent which I would love to see in other areas or, as an alternative to community service, to have jurisdiction to impose a term of six months imprisonment. If we were to take that harsh route, we would not have the vendors selling. The Bill, in addition to banning the sale of cigarettes to persons under 18, states that it should be an offence for persons under 18 to have cigarettes or any other tobacco products in his or her possession. That is also important.</P>
      <P>I emphasise this because we have not been able to arrest the increase in smoking. We know that the number of women has outstripped the number of men suffering from lung cancer. These are such serious issues for women's health that we must have these deterrents and we must be seen to implement them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amending the legislation for the nursing homes, we are now very aware of convalescent homes and even convalescent wings within nursing homes. I am glad to see that the quality of care which the elderly will receive will be under examination. However, over the past eight or nine years, since 1991, subventions, which we will address on Committee Stage, have not risen from £120. The Minister knows that. He has had letters from every young or elderly person or families who have had to pay quite an amount of money to ensure that their elderly parents are looked <Col N="788" /> after. The subvention of £120 over an eight or nine year period is relatively little and must be reviewed in line with inflation. It rose from £70.95 to £120 and has stayed at that amount over a number of years.</P>
    <P>My next question is more appropriate for the VHI. Coverage for two weeks after a serious illness is minimal and I hope the VHI takes into account the need to provide coverage for a longer stay in convalescent homes. That would free up beds in hospitals that are very necessary for people on waiting lists, which I hope the Minister will tackle. If the State cannot provide the necessary supports, there should be nursing homes countrywide. I welcome the fact that the Minister will take the quality of care into consideration, that it will be open, transparent and open to visitation and assessment on a regular basis and that the same will apply to convalescent homes. I am glad there will be funding available to people who open convalescent homes. Some people in my area are changing from nursing homes to convalescent homes but they are finding that if they have a nursing home and they put in a convalescent wing, they must have separate dining quarters as requested by the VHI and also separate corridors and entrances. This is expensive. We probably will be taking the option of providing more and more convalescent units. It behoves us to ensure that, for the money people pay and for the investment by the proprietors in nursing homes, they would all welcome assessment, evaluation and visitation from our health boards to ensure that standards are high.</P>
    <P>My interest in the killer diseases arising from tobacco consumption by young people, who for some reason we do not seem able to reach, is from a teaching viewpoint. The Minister is aware that teachers are making little or no impact in this area; perhaps they are within the confines of the school but certainly not when the students leave the school environs. We need to adopt more dramatic measures. With other members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I have examined this matter in Canada. We gleaned from other countries that they seemed to be able to get to grips with this problem but somehow here it still is, to use a pun, a burning issue. It creates havoc with the health of our young people. All it will do is place a heavier burden on our health services in the future when we will have to deal with so many tobacco associated illnesses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the age to 18 years but I would like the Minister to look again at the fines and check with the Attorney General whether we can make it more prohibitive for those who sell cigarettes illegally and who apparently slip through the net. Another issue we need to examine again are sweeteners, the molasses and other products which the manufacturers are including in cigarettes and which are aimed at young people. The Oireachtas committee is dealing with the compellability of witnesses and openness and transparency from the cigarette manu<Col N="789" /> facturers as to what they put in their products. We are entitled to obtain that information and we will be pursuing it with the Minister in the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. This Bill is non-contentious. On Committee Stage we may have different interpretations on certain sections but on Second Stage we all agree on its principal aim. I will not take too long to deal with the drugs items. There is a publication called <i>MIMS</i> circulated to doctors on a monthly basis. It is a list of prescribed medications, most of which would be available in the general medical services system. One will find there are many of what I would call &ldquo;me too&rdquo; drugs. These are similar drugs made to a standard specification by different companies but one finds there is very little price variation in these medications. The pharmaceutical industry is very important, especially in the south and in the Minister's constituency, but the level of competition in prices is more apparent than real for many of these drugs. Perhaps that might be examined in greater detail in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The Minister is pushing an open door with the section dealing with the sale of tobacco drugs. By coincidence this morning I read in one of the newspapers that the Canadian Government is looking at ways to bring home to the population the dangers of tobacco. It will probably move in the direction of ensuring that 60% of a cigarette packet will show the effects of tobacco on the person. There was a charming picture of cancer of the lung which, if put on a cigarette box, might make people change their views.</P>
      <P>Even in my profession I find quite a few people who indulge in smoking even though they would advise their patients to keep away from the dreaded weed. An ancillary profession, nursing, has a very high number of smokers. These are people who would be closer to the effects of tobacco than doctors, because they see them on a daily basis, yet they do not seem able to kick the habit.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that he was constrained by advice from the Attorney General in the amount he could fine people for selling tobacco to those under 18 years of age. The Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which is being put through the Dáil by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, contains fairly draconian penalties for selling to those who are under age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem mentioned by Senator Jackman was the control of vending machines, which is very hard. If I had a vending machine in the foyer of my hotel, I could plead that I cannot stop someone under 18 years of age putting money into the machine to buy cigarettes. It is a difficult problem and I do not know how the Minister will tackle it. It lets the vending machine owner and the owner of the premises in which the vending machine is situated off the hook. We will find it very difficult to prosecute in such circumstances. There were successful prosecutions last year under the old tobacco legislation in the Western <Col N="790" /> Health Board area but there does not appear to have been any follow up. Those cases got much publicity but it seems to have died down.</P>
    <P>Another problem the Minister will have will be with his colleague, the Minister for Finance. He gets £686 million per year in the tax take from the tobacco industry. That is not an insubstantial amount of money. The Minister may have difficulty there with his colleagues in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>As Senator Jackman said, nursing home patients have different degrees of requirements, varying from the high-tech, high demand homes to homes, although not convalescent homes, in which people are cared for in a non-medical manner with some nursing care but mainly home care in a nursing home ambience. We will have to look at this again because the Minister will have to apply different criteria for different but appropriate standards of care to the people who need it.</P>
    <P>Recently, the health authority came into a nursing home in my constituency, which cares for about ten or 12 elderly people who do not require a great degree of nursing care, and gave it a list of improvements which must be made but which will result in the closure of that home. The State will have to find places for these people. The inspector is within his or her rights in applying these criteria; he or she is applying the law. However, the criteria being applied are not appropriate to the degree of care being given. I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is my first opportunity to welcome the Minister to the House in his new ministerial role and I wish him well. I welcome the topics under discussion in this Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2000. It is opportune that we commemorate or acknowledge world anti-smoking or world anti-tobacco day with this debate in the House, and I would like that to be recorded as such. It is but a small move in terms of increasing the age of youngsters to whom cigarettes can be sold legally from 16 to 18 years of age and increasing the fine correspondingly for those who sell to under 18 year olds. It is a small move but it allows us to state, particularly those of us with very strong views in this area, exactly what our feelings are on it.</P>
      <P>We recently had a debate in the European Parliament on the new regulation in terms of tobacco marketing issues generally. A relatively tame and modest tightening up is being suggested at this point in time in Europe and, as many commentators have said, perhaps world opinion has moved even faster than the European Parliament in terms of legislation in this regard. I suggest the Minister looks seriously at the Canadian model. I have learned from interaction with various colleagues in Europe that graphic displays of health warnings, such as the lung of the smoker compared to that of the non-smoker, rather than just a sentence indicating that smoking will kill, endangers the unborn child or that smokers die earlier, has a far greater impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> Can it be that the best brains in politics, medicine and marketing cannot come up with a message that will be heard and acknowledged, particularly by young people? I do not accept that it is not possible to get the no smoking message across. We have not done it to date &ndash; maybe the tobacco companies are far more powerful or maybe Governments have become far too dependent on revenue from tobacco. It is a legalised drug that is far more harmful than many of the so-called illegal drugs, although I carry no brief for those.</P>
    <P>I feel extremely strongly that if one is hooked on alcohol or heroin, the State will help in one's rehabilitation. One will be taken in, dried out and there will be all sorts of rehabilitation programmes. If one is hooked on nicotine in Ireland and elsewhere, there is no help. What do we do? We effectively make all nicotine replacement therapy available on prescription only. Why does the Minister not put cigarettes on prescription only if the replacement therapy to help people get off this awful drug is not accessible except on prescription? I cannot understand the logic of cigarettes being freely available. Smokers can overdose every day of the week, each week of the year &ndash; they can smoke 100 cigarettes &ndash; and yet a nicotine replacement patch is available on prescription only in case they put two on together or have a cigarette while they have the patch on. I do not know what the logic is but there must be an issue to address. One cannot get a replacement patch if one is trying to get off cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister accept an amendment to this Bill on Committee Stage whereby, at the very least, GMS card holders could get all nicotine replacement therapy free on their medical card? Will he please consider that as our way of recognising world no smoking day? It is a small step. Will the Minister look at the reasons and ensure all nicotine replacement therapy is not prescription only and that it can be freely sold anywhere that sells cigarettes? I do not understand the logic of not selling it alongside cigarettes. Nobody but the addicted will want to buy it and they will only do so if they genuinely want to get off cigarettes. Why not have it available?</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am missing something in this, but it is one of the areas which has frustrated me for years. My colleagues know how almost irrational and less patient I have become with this subject over the years.</P>

      <P>I introduced a no smoking rule at our parliamentary party meetings years ago before the legislation came in. I have little patience with this matter and our consistent failure over the years to get the message across. It is a tragedy that our young people are smoking in even greater numbers, particularly young girls. Where are we going wrong? Surely the best political, medical and marketing brains can come up <Col N="792" /> with a clear message that will be heard by and impact on our young people. I do not accept that it is beyond us to get the message across in the political and marketing world of today. I ask the Minister to accept an amendment which I will table on Committee Stage to say that all nicotine replacement therapy should be available to medical card holders free of charge. If they need a prescription, they need one. I will possibly also table an amendment to remove the necessity for prescriptions and pharmacy only sales of the rest of nicotine replacement therapy for those in a position to buy it. I cannot understand the logic in this regard. By tabling an amendment we might get into the detail of this issue, which defies explanation to the lay person at least. Perhaps the Minister has more information in this regard.</P>
      <P>The environment committee of the European Parliament voted that the primary health warning should cover 60% of the front of a cigarette packet and should be in the form of a black border and black writing on a white background. There will also be an additional warning covering 40% of the reverse side of the packet. This proposal must go before a plenary session of the Parliament. The smokers' lobby telephoned me and I said: &ldquo;Please do not even waste your time on me; I do not want to know; I may not be rational. I will be polite but do not waste your time. I do not want to carry a brief for the cigarette industry.&rdquo;  The tragedy caused by cigarettes over decades is only now beginning to be recognised. The State has had to bear an enormous cost together with individual families in terms of the premature deaths of main income earners, mothers dying young and the effect on children in the womb. The effects of cigarettes have also been brought into the debate on cot death. I do not know, I only read what is written in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the damage caused by passive smoking and the attempts of the tobacco industry to deflect any serious debate in this regard and to deny there was scientific evidence in terms of the damage done by passive smoking. The industry still tries to justify its case that nicotine is not addictive. Nicotine is addictive but the other constituents in cigarettes are carcinogenic and there is little talk about them. The European environment committee, which also covers public health and consumer affairs, voted last week not to allow tar yields, ingredients and terms such as &ldquo;light&rdquo;, &ldquo;ultra&rdquo;, &ldquo;low tar&rdquo; and so on to be printed on cigarette packets so that they will not deliver any false messages in terms of less likely damage to the health of the smoker and the community around him or her through passive smoking. It is a live debate in Europe and perhaps we can plug into it or the EU could tighten up and learn from what member states have done because I am not sure that Europe is leading. Europe may just be reacting, taking a common denominator and then going further afield. The Minister has my support in anything he wishes to do in this area. We failed as politicians. We should have got together with <Col N="793" /> the medical profession and the marketing people to get our message out to our young people.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker has a medical background. Approximately 20 years ago an elderly doctor who was wringing her hands in desperation because of the state of general practice at that time and the little time that general practitioners had to spend with their patients to counsel and advise them on various issues said to me, &ldquo;Frankly with MIMS in one hand and the pill in the other you are an established GP today&rdquo;. That was 20 years ago but the climate is changing again and the need for one to one consultation and for GPs to spend time with their patients is recognised.</P>
    <P>There is a useful book relating to drugs and pharmacies for those who are interested in what they are prescribed. I am frustrated in people's lack of interest in the drugs they are prescribed. The contract referred to by the Minister is excellent but perhaps there could be an effort to explain to people exactly how drugs work in a user friendly way. We need to examine that urgently.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister fully in regard to nursing homes but we need to go further. The demography of the EU is changing rapidly. In ten years there will be 37 million more old people than today. They will still be primarily cared for in the home but with more women at work full time and the reduction in fertility rates, there will not be enough primary carers left in the home to look after the older generation. A new intergenerational contract will be urgently necessary so that we can contribute and provide financially during our productive years for the pensioners who worked hard and long to rear us and other generations in much more difficult times than we live in today. Such a contract will provide for the elderly and support those who can care for the elderly in their own homes properly.</P>
    <P>I do not have the time to raise the issue of the carer's allowance. Let us help those who can care for their own at home in every way we can and then let us ensure it is not put beyond the means of the average person or even pensioner who has worked hard all his or her life to avail of necessary care in nursing homes. Nursing homes should be treated in such a way that acute beds can be vacated and their residents should get the same care with the same support from the State as the convalescents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While this is a short Bill, it is nevertheless important because it makes a number of provisions in health legislation which are welcome. I refer to section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, which was innovative legislation. The fact that it has not been amended very much in the interim reflects the thought that went into it. I congratulate the Minister for updating section 59 regarding the supply of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances under the GMS and community drugs schemes. As somebody who worked in the health services for a number <Col N="794" /> of years, I have always seized the opportunity to speak on health legislation, especially that relating to the prescription of drugs.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick, is an experienced general practitioner and I appreciate his views not alone on this Bill but also on past health legislation. However, I regret that in regard to prescribing drugs too often a patient attends a doctor's surgery or a hospital and a prescription is written, especially in the case of antibiotics, and the antibiotic might be worth a tinker's curse to the patient. If he or she has a respiratory condition or urinary tract infection, who is to say that the organism causing the infection will be sensitive to the antibiotic? I believe the employment of the old culture sensitivity test before medications are prescribed would be beneficial in certain circumstances, especially in regard to UTI, respiratory conditions, etc.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains an amendment to the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988. This is one of my pet subjects. I have the honour, with Senator Fitzpatrick, of being a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and representatives of tobacco companies have appeared before us. When drug addiction is discussed, the denial and delusion stage is mentioned, especially as it pertains to the addict. In this case it applies to the drug barons, who are the tobacco companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the representatives of tobacco companies the concept of denial and delusion springs to mind but it does not refer to the unfortunate addict who cannot help himself or herself. Members of the public appeared before us, one of whom was in a wheelchair, and even though their health was in a deplorable condition they still were not able to help themselves; they could not kick the habit. The tobacco companies denied all the way to hell and back that nicotine was addictive.</P>
      <P>My colleague across the floor of the House said the message was not being got across. Legislation is in place and I congratulate the Minster for increasing the fines. However, he should send a clear message from this House today that the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act will be enforced. There is no point in introducing legislation without enforcing it, as we have done so often in the past in many areas that cause problems for public health. The increase in the maximum fine from £500 to £1,500 is a step in the right direction. Those who knowingly supply tobacco products for consumption to people under the age of 18 years, as prescribed in the Bill, should have their licence revoked. I have no sympathy for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxpayer contributes hugely to fund the treatment and care of those suffering from respiratory and the other illnesses arising from the smoking of tobacco. Seán Citizen is paying the <Col N="795" /> bill to cover the numbers who are submitted to care institutions for treatment and care. Taxpayers have a vested interest in ensuring that tobacco companies are hauled into line.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to advertising. It is not too long since television advertisements would show a man walking along the seashore at perhaps 1 o'clock in the morning looking the picture of desolation and loneliness. He would then be depicted taking a box of cigarettes from his pocket, there would be a whirl of smoke and the caption would read: &ldquo;You are never alone with a strand.&rdquo; The message was that a cigarette was the answer if one was alone and lonely. Another advertisement would show a man eating his nails with frustration, then a caption would appear suggesting that a hamlet would solve all his problems. While we have got away from that, the real villains are the tobacco companies who have rebutted every suggestion and proposal made to them during their attendance at the hearings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. I told one person who attended that if the evidence bit him on the nose he would still deny it. Those are the people we must get to.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for introducing an amendment to section 7 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. Section 7(2) of that Act provides that the Minister may by regulation prescribe that the amounts of subvention that may be paid may be specified by reference to specified degrees of dependency. That is very important. Not long ago a difficult approach was taken to the payment of subvention to those unfortunate enough to require nursing home care for themselves or their dependants. These new provisions progress matters considerably, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>The monitoring of nursing and convalescent homes is very important. While they provide a very important service, it is also important that they provide medical cover. For a long time nursing homes were run on a shoe string and, regrettably, the appropriate level of care was not provided. I welcome the Minster's pro-active approach to the matters before us and I echo his sentiments in commending the Bill to the House.</P>

I do not dispute his ability but I must dispute how he does his job. That is part of my role in politics.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Avril Doyle that no Government will ever be able to do enough when it comes to dealing with tobacco. I am married to a habitual smoker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also married to a doctor and since they are the same person it is something of a contradiction.</P>
      <P>We must begin to put those who make and sell tobacco products into the place in society where they fit, which is an atmosphere of disapproval. It is wrong to sell tobacco products and it ought to be said with the full force of society. There can be no ambivalence about this. It involves the Government realising and being prepared to accept that it has a strategy to replace the £650 million it currently gets from tax on tobacco products by raising it elsewhere if necessary. I therefore welcome the increase in duty on tobacco products in the last budget.</P>
      <P>We are concerned with a product that kills, I believe, approximately four million people a year on the planet. That is probably a conservative underestimate because as we all know, the drug barons of the tobacco industry are currently involved in a huge campaign to increase smoking in the developing countries where we have not yet got the proper mortality figures to identify the scale of death being brought about there. They did that deliberately and cynically once pressure was placed on them in the developed world and they are continuing to do so.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that these companies, like the breweries, are targeting young people with an intensive level of lobbying. I have no disapproval of drink, but the targeting of young people in these areas is very dangerous. According to the figures I have seen &ndash; I am sure the Minster has better figures &ndash; we have amongst the highest levels of drug and alcohol abuse among teenagers in the EU. I suspect we are rapidly moving to a situation where we will have levels of smoking among teenagers, especially among teenage girls, that are among the highest. Aesthetics should matter to teenage girls, but giving smoking glamour or appeal is one of the great achievements of the tobacco industry. Persuading young girls, who are otherwise so sophisticated about appearance and appeal, that having a cigarette trailing out of their mouths is supposed to improve one's general appeal is a sinister achievement of profoundly effective marketing on the part of the tobacco industry. There is a need to address it with the full resources of the State. Given our capacity to allow our young people to abuse drugs and alcohol to an alarming extent, we should not be surprised at the level of abuse of tobacco that is beginning to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the measures in the Bill but I wish to make a number of suggestions. It is time that committees of the House stopped meeting tobacco lobbyists. We should say that we know what they are doing is wrong. We do not invite the Fellonis or the Meehans to tell us about the drugs problem because we know what they are doing to society. It is time to tell the tobacco industry that its days of getting a hearing and taking up the time of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are over. It should be told that we do not need it any more, that it should go away and find a way <Col N="797" /> to do something useful with its resources and that it should stop harming society. There is a need for the Houses of the Oireachtas to say that there should be no more tobacco lobbyists around the place and that the Oireachtas has no more interest in them.</P>
    <P>People in the State who are managing investment portfolios should be encouraged either through specific taxation or other provisions not to invest in the tobacco industry. This may mean a specific revamping of the taxation provisions for pension funds or other areas. One could cynically suggest that pension fund managers have a vested interest in the tobacco industry because it reduces their liabilities substantially. Nevertheless, we should begin to consider that limited move. I have had an interest in ethical investment for some time but it should be said to anybody who wants to benefit from the tax provisions governing various pensions funds, etc., that it is conditional on them not taking any shares in companies involved in the manufacture and sale of tobacco products.</P>
    <P>This is a statement of values. We would be outraged if pension funds were involved in the drugs industry. I am outraged that some of them are probably involved in the armaments industry, but that is a separate issue. It is time to recognise that they are involved in an industry which does nothing but harm. There is no upside to cigarettes. It only becomes of some benefit once people are addicted because it relieves the symptoms of the addiction. However, beyond that, there is no upside to tobacco and, therefore, we should not be involved in it.</P>
    <P>If these measures were taken, it would begin the process of recognising that the existing situation is a form of legalised drug pushing and that the people who do it are legalised drug pushers. This is what it is all about, although I am sorry to say that about small shopkeepers. As well as making the moral position of society clear, practical steps must be taken to reduce demand, such as the elimination of advertising. Another suggestion is that the sale of tobacco products should be banned in places where people congregate, such as pubs, clubs and elsewhere. Tobacco products should not be available anywhere that young people might congregate.</P>
    <P>Availability should be restricted and selling cigarettes from slot machines should be stopped because it is uncontrollable. While penalties could be introduced, in most pubs there is a slot machine in the corridor on the way to the toilets which cannot be supervised. This should be made illegal. People should have to sell cigarettes over the counter and only in restricted outlets.</P>

      <P>Cigarettes should only be sold in off-licences in the same way as the sale of alcohol is restricted to a limited number of premises. Cigarettes should not be sold anywhere that families or children might be. I do not believe in prohibition, but ease of access should be reduced to the maximum possible extent.</P>
      <P>The price of cigarettes should be increased. I make no apologies for saying that it should be made prohibitively expensive to smoke. A specific health tax on premises that are prepared to sell tobacco should probably be introduced. If people want to sell tobacco, a specific health tax, in addition to the normal taxation rates, should be imposed on them. I want to discourage places from selling tobacco. It should be made as difficult and inaccessible as possible. I do not believe in prohibition &ndash; it has not worked in any area &ndash; but those measures would be useful.</P>
      <P>Any area to where the public has access should have, at a minimum, a legal requirement to make a non-smoking area available. I do not care how much the vintners whinge. The institute of technology where I work has one little area in one student canteen where people can smoke. Smoking is not allowed in any other place. I remember when people were allowed to smoke in cinemas. That is now prohibited and the quality of the atmosphere in cinemas has been transformed. I remember when people tried to get away with smoking in theatres.</P>

      <P>Any place in which the public congregates either for leisure or commercial purposes should have a predominantly non-smoking emphasis. The biggest centre of recreation in Ireland is the pub, but that is the one place where there has been no attempt to restrict smoking. Pubs should not be allowed to sell cigarettes; they do not need to sell them. In addition, they should have to make provision for an area for non-smokers which is proportionate to the size of the population that does not smoke. Approximately 60% or 70% of the adult population does not smoke now and that is the proportion of the space which should be available in any premises. These measures need to be taken. Although I do not blame the Minister, my only argument with these provisions is that they do not go far enough.</P>

      <P>I may not be as positive about other provisions of the Bill. The health service in general is in tatters. It is lacking in vision and philosophy. It is a health service that was imagined when Ireland was poor. It has not developed the vision to deal with the idea of a health service of the quality that should exist when a country is rich. One example is the so-called improvements in the drugs scheme. I agree with Senator Doyle's point that nicotine replacement therapy is not available to medical card holders, but the State is happy to spend thousands of pounds on them once they get cancer from cigarettes.</P>

      <P>It is ridiculous that nicotine replacement therapies are not available on the medical card scheme. Our priorities are confused at times.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, there are two problems in this area. In terms of the GMS, there is a question about what is available under it and it is a matter of continuing controversy. It is time to move on. We can afford to do better and it is time that was done. With regard to the drugs refund scheme and a single person with an income of £160 a week, a GP now charges £25 per visit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are obviously more affluent there. The maximum amount payable under the drugs refund scheme in that case is £10 a week. On an income of £160 a week, that is one sixteenth of one's income. If one adds other sums for other items, it could amount to close to 10% of the person's income. The irony is that the State spends 5.5% of GDP on health care but we are prepared to say that someone on a low income should spend 10% of it on their health care. We in the Labour Party have endeavoured to come up with the proper figure to provide a decent public health care system but all we got from the Minister was an inadequate and under-researched response, which was not up to his standard &ndash; I am sure the Minister saw the letter in <i>The Irish Times </i>last week from Dale Tussing &ndash; and it deserves a good deal better and a more in-depth response. It may not be the only way but it will be a lot better than what we have at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am glad the Minister is rationalising this and regulating nursing homes, an area which <Col N="800" /> needs fundamental and major resourcing is the provision of nursing home care for our increasing elderly population. It is a nonsense, only capable of being thought up by the Department of Finance, that anyone can afford to pay £400 a week indefinitely in a nursing home. Some £20,000 a year is what the John Byrnes and Dermot Desmonds of this world can afford but most people cannot afford the cost of a nursing home. I have no objection to people paying a reasonable contribution out of their income but we should not turn the elderly in our society into a burden on their children.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a problem with the ideology of the Minister for Finance. In his previous Ministry, the Minister for Finance believed in spending money on what he was doing, but he does not believe that in this ministry. The Minister's biggest challenge is to change his mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in which I have a great interest. I will not indulge in a diatribe about why the hospital employers are involved in brinkmanship with both the nurses and the non-consultant hospital doctors because it would not be productive. I hope the Minister will be able to come into the House as soon as possible to address the serious staffing issue in hospitals. This debate has an impact on that issue because if nursing and convalescence homes were used as step down facilities for hospitals, it would help to unblock the beds in the acute hospital service.</P>
      <P>I do not want to inflame the situation as regards the non-consultant hospital doctors but I am extremely worried by the lack of progress within the Labour Relations Commission and the fact the psychiatric nurses have decided to take strike action again next week. It must have been the Leader's influence and that of Senator Glynn that St. Loman's in Mullingar is not included in the first group of psychiatric hospitals to be hit by the strike. The psychiatric nurses say they will attack the flagship hospitals first, so I do not know how pleased those in Mullingar will be to hear that. It is a serious situation, as I am sure the Minister is aware, because some of the most vulnerable patients in the health service will be affected by this action.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with a reply to a parliamentary question last week, which the Department must have given to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, who is a truthful person, which suggested there was no problem with staffing in hospitals. However, that is not true. There are last vain advertisements in the past few weeks' medical journals for staff throughout the country, including Portlaoise, Tullamore, Galway, Castlebar, Sligo and St. Luke's. Those jobs have been advertised for 1 July. If they do not have staff for them now, they will not have any on 1 July. There are no locums for June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a useful Bill which deals with three separate topics. I hope the Department will try to seriously address the problem of patients who <Col N="801" /> believe there is no cure without a pill. The medical profession needs to be educated about it but so does the public. We have a big problem with multiply resistant <i>staphylococcus aureus</i> in the hospital service. There is not a hospital in the country which does not have a problem with it. This has arisen from the overuse, and some would say abuse, of antibiotics.</P>
    <P>Litigation in the medical profession is a serious problem. A doctor is more likely to be sued in this country than anywhere else in the world, including the United States of America. For reasons of defensive medicine, there is an over-prescription of antibiotics. The public must be made to realise this is not in their best interest. The Department should introduce an initiative because we are talking about preventative medicine to prevent more serious infections.</P>
    <P>The prescription of antibiotics for upper respiratory infections, which are mainly viral, is well known. I am sure Senator Fitzpatrick read the recent interesting articles about the inadvisability of prescribing antibiotics for children with an initial middle ear infection and indicating that perhaps they would be better to wait for 24 hours to see how they are doing. If the child does not do well, the doctor is in a serious position because it will be said that it would have been better to have prescribed antibiotics for the child in the first place. However, that might not be true.</P>
    <P>The over-prescription of antibiotics by medical practitioners as a protective mechanism has been influential in the development of multiply resistant <i>staphylococcus aureus.</i> We need to resist the pharmaceutical companies and to remember that some of the narrow spectrum older antibiotics may be the ones of choice. I am sometimes astonished to see patients on something I would have regarded as a hospital antibiotic which should not be given except in a hospital as a last line of defence. Just because an antibiotic is broad spectrum and will hit a lot of bacteria and is the newest does not mean it is the best thing to prescribe.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the problem of the availability of antibiotics without a doctor's prescription and on Internet sites. We heard this morning about the deaths from Viagra of two Irishmen who had heart conditions and 14 others had adverse effects. The last time I sought information on the prescription of Viagra I found 83 sites in the United States where it could be obtained without a prescription. It is as easy for someone here to look for it as it is for someone in the United States. We have a serious problem regarding the supervision of patients on antibiotics or any potent drugs who may be getting them without seeing a medical practitioner. The Department should make a major effort to address the problem of the overuse, if not abuse, of antibiotics for the medical profession and with a view to informing the public of the risks involved.</P>
    <P>The direct advertising of drugs is useful because patients may bring to one's attention the availability of a particular drug. However, a drug <Col N="802" /> may appear to be a cure-all for certain conditions but the downside of its use may not be made sufficiently clear. Pharmaceutical companies need to be extremely careful in the way they promote products which are aimed at the general public.</P>
    <P>I am glad that renewed efforts are being made to restrict the sale of cigarettes to people over the age of 18. The only difficulty is that existing legislation governing this area is not being enforced. I do not know how the new provisions will be enforced because it will be extremely difficult to ascertain whether a person is over 18 years of age. It will also be easier for shopkeepers to plead that they did not know a person's age. This restriction on the sale of cigarettes is welcome but I do not know how we will encourage environmental health officers and others to police the legislation.</P>
    <P>I was in a shop recently when a child of approximately eight or nine years of age purchased cigarettes. When I objected to the shopkeeper, I was informed that the child's mother was known to them. I stated that I did not care whether the shopkeeper knew the child's entire family and pointed out that it was illegal to sell cigarettes to the child.</P>
    <P>A useful survey, one among hundreds of its kind, was recently published by the Southern Health Board. It shows that children as young as eight or nine years of age, particularly boys, drink alcohol at least once a month and smoke on quite a regular basis. It is clear that our attempts to reduce the consumption of cigarettes and stop young people from taking up smoking must focus on providing information to children in primary school. We must adopt a multi-faceted approach to trying to prevent children taking up smoking because, unfortunately, those who smoke or drink at a very early age are much more likely to become involved in the abuse of illegal drugs. It is vital that we address this problem.</P>
    <P>A number of representatives from the tobacco industry in Ireland recently complained that restrictions on tobacco advertising are becoming even tougher. I have no sympathy for these people because approximately 90% of those who smoke want to stop but it appears to be extraordinarily difficult for them to do so. Regardless of what one might say about alcohol, no evidence can be provided to show that there are benefits to be gained from smoking cigarettes or any other form of tobacco.</P>
    <P>When advising people not to smoke, emphasis is placed on the dangers of contracting chest conditions, lung cancer and emphysema. However, it is important to note that people who smoke can develop terrible cardiovascular problems. Evidence which shows an earlier onset of heart disease among women who smoke and of their deaths from heart attacks is remarkable. I do not believe adequate emphasis is placed on informing women, particularly those who smoke, about the dangers of heart disease.</P>
    <P>I have never known a non-smoker, unless he or she was a severe diabetic, who lost a limb. <Col N="803" /> However, I am aware that numerous smokers have had limbs amputated. Such people have lost limbs at quite an early age, perhaps when they were only 50 or 60 years of age. We must continue to stress the problems which may result from smoking.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with a number of surveys which indicate that 40% of teenage girls smoke. I am inclined to believe this because I recently chaired a meeting in Trinity College and, despite the presence of huge &ldquo;No smoking&rdquo; signs, I was nearly asphyxiated and I thought I would have to be carried out on a stretcher. Those present at the meeting obviously possess some form of high intelligence because they had managed to gain entry to third level education. However, regardless of the emphasis that has been placed on warning people about the dangers of smoking and despite my strong objections, many of those at the meeting were puffing away on cigarettes.</P>
    <P>We must adopt a different approach to warning young women about the dangers of smoking. New surveys have shown the effects of tobacco consumption, particularly in terms of the thinning and ageing of skin. At 17, 18 or 19 years of age one does not think that one will be covered in wrinkles by the age of 40. However, it might be an idea to use &ldquo;before and after&rdquo; photographs to illustrate the position. In that context, I recall that, in the past, the &ldquo;Toni Twins&rdquo; television advertisements used to employ such photographs and inquire whether people could identify which model had dyed her hair. Perhaps we could try to make young women aware of the effect smoking will have on their physical appearance.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the sale of smuggled cigarettes. I work in a part of the inner city where I frequently see people selling cigarettes on the street at prices well below those charged in the shops. I accept that customs and excise officers and the Criminal Assets Bureau have enjoyed a degree of success in tackling this problem but there is a need to deal with it in an even more enthusiastic manner. I understand that it is more profitable to deal in smuggled cigarettes than in illegal drugs because people do not have to pay as much for them, the turnover is excellent and those involved in their sale are not as enthusiastically pursued as those who deal in hard drugs.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a full debate on nursing homes, an area where major growth has been experienced. Convalescent homes and step-down facilities could be used more extensively and provide great assistance to the acute hospital service. However, like the hospital service, such institutions are encountering difficulties in attracting staff. Perhaps the Minister will address this matter on another occasion.</P>

      <P>This important Bill is an attempt to update the legislation relating to smoking and convalescent and nursing homes. However, on Second Stage one is entitled to speak on wider health issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> I concur with Senator Jackman's comments on the provision and distribution of drugs through the various drug refund schemes which have provided relief to a considerable number of people. However, there is a need to expand the existing system. Statistics have increasingly shown that the number of people suffering from respiratory and lung diseases has increased dramatically. This may be due to changes in the environment which have been caused either by the release of various gases into the atmosphere or by global warming. However, the incidence of such diseases among young people cannot be denied. I am sure Senator Fitzpatrick encounters such people at his medical practice on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>People have been campaigning for a number of years to ensure that those suffering from asthma are included under the drug refund scheme. However, the Department, for whatever reason, has refused to accept proposals in that regard. This is most unfortunate because a large number of young children are affected by asthma. Many families come under huge financial pressure and incur major costs as a result of their children contracting asthma. The Department and the Minister have a responsibility to give serious consideration to this matter.</P>
    <P>Public representatives are aware of the financial hardship incurred by families in this regard, particularly by young couples with mortgages and other major financial responsibilities who perhaps have two or three young children suffering from asthma. Such people find it extremely difficult to meet the financial cost of drugs and other support services. At a time of economic boom, I urge the Minister to consider the needs of these people, allow them into the drugs refund scheme and provide them with the financial support they require. That would be a huge relief to the families of severe asthma sufferers. The Minister is progressive in a difficult Department but people have confidence that he will respond to these issues and show his ability to deal with them in a forward-thinking manner.</P>
    <P>On the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, I welcome the introduction of legislation in regard to revised policy in this area. However, I am very disappointed that in view of the amount of work undertaken by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in this area, in which Members of the Oireachtas from all parties researched the national and international situation and published a conclusive report, this legislation has not taken any of the report's recommendations on board. I am particularly disappointed that the legislation does not encompass the report's recommendations on fines. It is imperative that fines would become so frightening and prohibitive that they would prevent people from selling cigarettes to underage people. The increase from £500 to £1,500 is not adequate; the fine should be increased to £2,500, as recommended in the committee's report. That would be far more prohibitive and effective. I urge the Minister to introduce <Col N="805" /> an amendment on Committee Stage or to accept Members' amendments to address this matter.</P>
    <P>The report also includes recommendations in regard to advertising, promotion and monitoring. There is a huge onus on the Department, together with the health boards, to ensure that the sale of tobacco in health board areas is monitored closely. The Department must provide the health boards with the funding required to employ people to ensure that regulations are being complied with by manufacturers, traders and distributors. Such monitoring cannot be carried out effectively unless the Government provides the necessary funding to the health boards.</P>
    <P>Although I will not refer to any specific campaigns conducted by the Department of Health and Children, we have seen very successful advertising campaigns in the past. The Minister has an opportunity to promote an attractive, anti-smoking advertising campaign in the national broadcast and print media to encourage young people not to smoke. Some tobacco manufacturers sponsor major sporting events in which young people have a particular interest and, in doing so, subtly encourage young people to smoke. The Minister must counteract that influence.</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic increase in the number of nursing homes throughout the country over the past ten to 15 years. There has been a further increase since the Minister for Finance introduced the special tax incentive scheme in the 1999 Finance Act due to the attractiveness of investment in this area. I commend and support the thinking behind the scheme. However, those seeking tax relief through investment in the scheme will approach projects from a business point of view and it is very important that the Minister and the Department ensure that the standards in nursing homes built under the scheme are up to scratch. I recognise that this legislation will ensure that nursing homes built under the tax incentive scheme will be registered and I commend the Minister for that. I urge him to ensure that additional personnel are provided in the health boards to monitor these homes to ensure that they are properly managed and that a proper standard of care is provided.</P>
    <P>When nursing homes were built here initially, some of them left a lot to be desired and were closed down. It should be compulsory for any nursing or convalescent home to be registered in order that they or their patients could receive assistance. I note that the legislation distinguishes between convalescent and nursing homes.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, as carers and nursing and convalescent homes are closely inter-related. If carers were given more serious consideration and if better provision were made for the carer's allowance, fewer people would have to go into nursing or convalescent homes. There are some cases, particularly with very elderly people, where it is impossible for people to remain at home because of inadequate finances. There is room for <Col N="806" /> manoeuvre in this area between the Departments of Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently visited County Clare and we were delighted to welcome him to the county at such an early stage in his term of office, although we were somewhat disappointed that he was only there to put an initiative announced three years' ago by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Noonan, on a solid footing. Nevertheless, we welcomed his visit. However, the Minister did not manage to visit the mammography unit in Ennis General Hospital. That unit was established in 1984 as a result of voluntary fundraising carried out by a group of people drawn from throughout the county. A private fund was set up at that time and people continue to raise funds on a voluntary basis. I understand that a report was commissioned and is possibly on the Minister's desk&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the report has not yet been published, I understand that it contains a recommendation that such units should be centralised. There would be a huge degree of dissatisfaction with that. People from Dublin and other large urban centres may automatically think that major hospitals should be centralised but people living in counties Cork or Clare know how far away west Cork and west Clare are. If these units were to be centralised, the number of people who would avail of these facilities would be reduced. Middle class, mobile people would be in a position to travel to the centralised units to avail of the services but less privileged people who do not have cars would find it impossible to do so.</P>
      <P>Regarding the centre in Clare, a number of the specialists in Limerick are not happy with the recommendations in that report regarding centralising in Limerick. The people of Clare who have been using this service, and particularly those on the periphery of the county, are most dissatisfied at the idea of its being transferred, particularly given that it continues to be funded from voluntary sources with a little subvention in recent years from the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to undertake a close examination of this matter when the report becomes public. I am sure he has had it examined in detail already, but he will recognise that there is a social dimension to all of this and it is essential that services be provided near those who require them. Services 60, 70 or 80 miles away are not adequate for a high percentage of the population and I urge the Minister to look at this with a view to retaining the mammography unit in Ennis General Hospital.</P>

      <P>Senators Fitzpatrick, Doyle, Glynn and Jackman and all the Senators spoke strongly on the tobacco issue.

      <P>There is legislation of a much more substantial nature on the way. I am currently preparing a tobacco Bill. The Office of Tobacco Control has been established and a chief executive and board have been appointed. The next step is to appoint a tobacco-free council. The Office of Tobacco Control, in conjunction with my Department, is currently preparing the heads of the Bill. I look forward to bringing that Bill before the Oireachtas in the autumn session &ndash; that is the timeframe towards which I am aiming. Many of the issues raised here will be covered in that Bill. For example, we are looking at providing that 60% of the cigarette packet will show the effects of tobacco on the person. We are looking at the availability of cigarettes in retail units and the degree to which they are advertised in retail units. We know, for example, that when children go into shops to buy sweets they see packets of cigarettes adjacent to the sweets. I agree with Senator Ryan that we must change the climate to one of intolerance of cigarettes in society.</P>
      <P>As a newcomer to the Department of Health and Children, I am somewhat taken aback by the statistics and the research. People complain rightly about waiting lists and about the accident and emergency service. The reality is that health is a simple equation and the health status of the Irish people is poor relative to that of our European partners. Ireland has the highest instance of coronary disease in Europe and is highly placed on the cancer table. Accidents and injuries apart, these are the three main causes of illness and death in Ireland. One of the single greatest determinants of death and illness is cigarette smoking. If we focused our efforts on cigarette smoking, we would do the health status of the Irish people now and in the future an enormous amount of good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a moral imperative on me, the Minister for Health and Children, to attack this issue with everything at my disposal. Some people have accused me of becoming a fundamentalist overnight. I am not. I never smoked, although I tried it once. There is a downside to that in the sense that one can be overly intolerant of smokers because one has never been addicted. We must <Col N="808" /> understand that it is an addiction and smokers need help to quit the habit. It is estimated that about eight out of ten smokers want to give up smoking and have tried time and again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of nicotine replacement therapy was raised by Senator Doyle. The policy decision has been taken to introduce nicotine replacement therapy for medical card holders. The issue is how we will do it. The report of the tobacco-free policy group, which I launched in March, recommended the introduction of NRT for medical card patients in the context of cessation programmes. In other words, it did not want smokers simply going in and grabbing the NRT without anybody talking to them or without proper programmes. There is a dilemma in that obviously there is a lead in time before one can establish cessation programmes in all locations.</P>
      <P>The tobacco-free policy group's report was significant in that for the first time the Government stated that it accepted it had to do more than just campaign against cigarettes and state that people should not smoke, and that it must help people to get off cigarettes. The NRT is a factor in that process.</P>
      <P>The cardiovascular forum, which is advising on the cardiovascular strategy, was asked some time ago to tease out this issue with a view to advising Government on how best to introduce NRT in the context of the GMS scheme. That is happening at present. I am awaiting the recommendations of the cancer forum regarding the mechanics of doing it and the context in which it should be done. Obviously that will lead into the Estimates process also, but the bottom line is not so much the decision to do it, which has been taken already, but how we will do it. That is an issue because there could be a considerable amount of wastage. There is a necessity at some stage in the process to link it with a proper cessation programme. We are working on a number of different settings to develop that. Only yesterday we launched the minimum standards for public hospitals in terms of smoking and cessation programmes. Interestingly, Beaumont Hospital has a cessation programmes facilitator, whose function is to co-ordinate the smoking policy within the hospital but also to develop cessation programmes for staff, patients and families. There is a great deal of work to be done on that, but we recognise the importance of NRT.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle raised the apparent absurdity where a person has no difficulty buying 80 or 120 cigarettes but cannot buy NRT over the counter because it is a licensed drug. We need to tease out that matter a little further. If one takes NRT off the list of licensed drugs, then there remains the issue of dosage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other issues coming down the tracks. One ought not to be surprised if in five years the tobacco industry states that it will not sell cigarettes anymore. Some of the pharmaceutical firms <Col N="809" /> have pointed this out. There is no regulatory framework, for example, to distinguish between NRT and whatever else may emerge. The tobacco industry is one of the most resourceful industries in the world. We are facing a very tough opponent here.</P>
    <P>Senators Jackman and Fitzpatrick made interesting points about young smokers. We actually succeeded in making good progress from the mid-1970s to 1993, when we reduced the number of tobacco consumers from about 50% to 28% on average. Unfortunately in recent years it has risen to 31%. It seems that a significant proportion of those are young women and young people generally. That suggests to me that the tobacco industry has regrouped, refocused and redirected its marketing strategies to get people hooked again.</P>
    <P>That said, the proposed tobacco Bill will look at the issues of passive smoking in terms of where and how, and will give strong powers to the Minister to introduce regulations in all the areas identified by the Senators. This legislation is an interim step in line with what was said in the Dáil on Ash Wednesday, which was anti-smoking week. I thought I would use the opportunity available in this Bill to make this provision because I know about the volatility of the Legislature and the difficulty in getting provisions through. Legislation can take time and therefore I decided to take the opportunity of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill at least to increase the age at which a person can purchase tobacco products and to increase the fines, in accordance with the advice available, to the upper limit. I will seek clarification on the advice in accordance with Senators' wishes.</P>
    <P>I accept the point raised by Senators about the rate of nursing home subvention. Over the years the Department of Health and Children has actually secured an additional increase in the Estimates for nursing home subvention. It started off at about £4 million in the early 1990s. This year the bill for nursing home subvention is £40 million. Last year my predecessor, Deputy Cowen, secured an increase of £3 million or £4 million. He thought that this would facilitate an increase in the rate, but what happened was that the demand grew. The increase merely pays for the increase in the number of people coming into nursing homes and reflects the demographic changes in Europe and of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Shortly after coming into office I instructed my officials to prepare a strategic action plan for the elderly. This is currently being prepared in the Department, in consultation with the health boards. I want to move quickly on this plan because the timeframe presented by our aging population may cause difficulties and because there are significant gaps in services between acute and community care services. We have much to do.</P>
    <P>Approximately £200 million has been earmarked in the national development plan for a range of services for the elderly in the community, including community nursing units, res<Col N="810" /> pite care, day care centres and so on. I suspect that the bill will be higher before the strategy has been put in place. We will then have to go to the Minister for Finance. We have increased current expenditure in the health services by 56% in the last three years and the capital programme of £2 billion is very significant. However, I suspect we will need more.</P>
    <P>We also need reform. I note Senator Henry's point about industrial disputes. We need reform of what we are doing in hospitals. We must reform the hierarchical nature of the medical professions. Investment coupled with reform will give us a world class health service.</P>
    <P>The question of long-term illnesses, particularly asthma, was raised by many Senators. This is an issue of concern to me. How we define certain illnesses as long term must be decided. There is also the issue of Estimates. I will explore the feasibility of defining asthma as a long-term illness over the next number of months because asthma medicine is a costly item for many people.</P>
    <P>We are working with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on the issue of carers and the continuum between nursing homes, convalescence and care in the home. The point made in this regard is a very fair one. I have already had discussions with the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the question of taking an integrated approach to care and of giving carers greater support. Carers will be vital in assisting the elderly and others who are in receipt of community care, in ensuring that people retain independence in the community and in delaying recourse to acute services.</P>
    <P>People may not be aware of the Walk Tall programme, a substance abuse programme which is being comprehensively introduced in all primary schools. The programme was prepared by a team of psychologists and others in the Department of Education and Science in consultation with the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children. It is a very good programme and in-service for teachers who will provide it is now under way. The programme was introduced in 1,500 schools last year and will be introduced in another 1,500 this year. This will give complete coverage of primary schools. Its fundamental philosophy is to give children self-esteem and self-confidence so that they can withstand peer pressure. All the recommendations are that this is the key way to give young people the means to withstand the pressure to take a drink or to smoke. It is not enough to tell children to say no. We must arm them with self-esteem and respect for their bodies and for their health and well being. If we can do this we will prepare them to make the right decisions in the future. This programme is under way in all primary schools and over time it will have an impact on the educational aspect of the debate on smoking and substance abuse.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of MRSA. This is not totally relevant to the contents of the Bill but I am very conscious of the seriousness of the <Col N="811" /> issue. It raises very basic questions about hygiene in hospitals and the over-use of antibiotics in society generally. We are working with the World Health Organisation, and the National Disease Surveillance Centre now has responsibility for developing a policy on MRSA in hospitals. A consultant will be appointed to spearhead that campaign.</P>
    <P>I note Senator Taylor-Quinn's comments about the mammography unit in Ennis. I am examining the situation. When I was in Ennis I did not hear a great deal about this issue. Because I gave the grant to the control team to build the hospital and to do everything else I was asked to do, the agenda appears to have moved on very quickly. We must balance availability and accessibility with quality of care and concentration of the best service in one location.</P>

    <Title>Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (Amendment) Bill, 1999  [  Certified Money Bill ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to authorise the Minister for Finance to subscribe to the 1998 capital increase of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency &ndash; MIGA.</P>
      <P>The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency is part of the World Bank Group. It shares a president and board or directors with the bank. It was created in April 1988 to encourage the flow of investments for productive purposes among member countries and, in particular, to developing member countries, in many of which the perception of political risk remains a significant barrier to investment. The need for such an agency had become apparent from the experience gained by the World Bank group in working with developing countries.</P>
      <P>Earlier, in 1956, the International Finance Corporation, or the private sector arm of the bank, was established when it became clear that there was a need for a specific agency to encourage private foreign investment as opposed to the bank's own role in the public sector. Equally, when it became clear that poorer countries could not afford to borrow on the bank's commercial terms, the International Development Association, or the bank's &ldquo;soft&rdquo; window, was set up in 1960, to make concessional financing available for development. MIGA is the latest of the institutions to be set up aimed to fill another gap where political uncertaintly was acting as a deterrent to foreign private investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> MIGA improves the investment climate by issuing guarantees against political risk and engaging in other investment promotion activities. Its primary role, to facilitate foreign private direct investment, complements other investment agencies such as the International Finance Corporation and national insurance and promotional bodies.</P>
    <P>Prospective projects for MIGA coverage must be financially, economically and environmentally sound. The first two of these are normal considerations in any commercial insurance operation. The question of environmental sustainability, however, is a more recent consideration. It arises from fears that multinational corporations may bring investment to developing countries only at the cost of the degradation of their environment. MIGA is conscious of this danger and has recently taken steps to address such concerns.</P>
    <P>In June 1999, an environmental and social compliance adviser/ombudsman &ndash; CAO &ndash; was appointed to review any complaints that MIGA or the IFC might have violated their own environmental, social and/or disclosure policies. This was the result of efforts by IFC and MIGA, their shareholders, NGOs and members of the business community to find a workable and constructive approach to dealing with environmental and social concerns. The ombudsman's role will include an infomal advisory function as well as that of reviewing complaints.</P>
    <P>MIGA operates by issuing guarantees against non-commercial or political risks for foreign direct investments &ndash; FDI &ndash; in its developing member countries and by providing technical assitance to governments of such countries to improve their ability to attract foreign direct investment. MIGA covers private investments but may cover State projects where these are being privatised or run on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>MIGA provides political risk insurance to private investors for specific projects in developing countries. Its objective is to facilitate foreign direct investment by alleviating negative investor sentiment regarding political stability in the host country. MIGA does not provide export credit insurance nor does it provide insurance against normal commercial risk.</P>
    <P>MIGA has accomplished a great deal in its ten years of operation and has implemented several initiatives. It has become a significant agency in the world of international risk capital. On the guarantee side, the agency is now one of the largest political risk insurers in the world. Through reinsurance and co-insurance agreements, and through syndication of political risk insurance, MIGA now occupies a unique and central position as a standard setter for political risk insurers. It can now proceed with confidence to assume more risk in more complicated and larger projects. On the technical assistance side, MIGA's institution building activities for investment promotion agencies are highly appreciated by many host countries. These activities are drawing the attention of many senior executives and MIGA's <Col N="813" /> contribution on the legal side is highly valued by many governments.</P>
    <P>In this context it can be asked whether we need a multilateral agency such as MIGA, and whether the service it provides might not be equally well provided either by the private sector or by national governments. It is true that about 20 countries have national political risk investment insurance programmes. MIGA was created in recognition of the fact that various eligibility criteria of these national programmes rendered them unable to offer meaningful coverage to a considerable number of investors. Moreover, most developing countries do not have such programmes, leaving any of their national investors undertaking foreign direct investment no potential source of long-term coverage.</P>
    <P>Private insurers were writing political risk investment insurance when MIGA was created in 1988 and operate successfully now in a growing market. Thanks in part to MIGA's reinsurance activities, the private market has stretched the tenor of its coverage. Currently, the private market is flourishing in a very complementary fashion to the operations of the agency and the national insurers. Not only have private insurers not been crowded out, they have been crowded in by MIGA's operations. They have willingly joined MIGA in its co-operative underwriting programme which combines the agency and private sector coverage in a single policy for the insured investor.</P>
    <P>Senators do not need to be reminded of the importance of foreign direct investment. Over the past decades capital inflows have laid the basis for the current success of our economy. Our pioneering approach to the attraction of foreign investment has attracted considerable international attention, and many countries are now seeking to emulate our success in utilising such capital inflows to best advantage.</P>
    <P>In many of these countries perceptions among investors of political risk or instability can deter them from making large or long-term investments. This in turn retards the industrialisation of these countries and compounds existing social problems, such as endemic poverty. MIGA was created as a contribution to solving some of these problems.</P>
    <P>MIGA works very closely with other agencies and its convention specifically requires it to supplement the activities of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, and other international development finance institutions. It is also required to complement the activities of existing national and regional investment insurance entities. It does this through co-insurance and reinsurance with these institutions, bilateral exchanges of information, and its membership of the Berne Union.</P>
    <P>The MIGA guarantee is designed to promote new investments and new contributions to expand, privatise, or financially restructure existing projects in developing member countries. MIGA's long-term, that is 15 to 20-year, non-can<Col N="814" /> celable guarantee serves to mitigate investors' concerns about political risks and facilitates investments that otherwise might not be made.</P>
    <P>What does political or non-commercial risk insurance cover? Very broadly, MIGA offers guarantees to cover the following risks: currency transfer restrictions that prevent investors or lenders from converting local currency into foreign exchange and transferring the proceeds abroad; expropriation by a host government that affects the insured investment; war and civil disturbance, including politically motivated acts of sabotage or terrorism; and breach of contract by a host government in certain circumstances. These are all essentially actions by a host government which would jeopardise the return on the investment and if not insured against would deter much needed foreign direct investment.</P>
    <P>MIGA covers several forms of investment including equity, commercial bank loans, loans made or guaranteed by foreign equity holders and technical assistance and management contracts. This flexibility is designed to encourage private foreign investors to expand their activities in the developing world.</P>
    <P>MIGA is mandated to assist investments that contribute to the host country's development. The equity related direct investments that it facilitates are more stable than portfolio investments and are a necessary element of long-term sustainable development.</P>
    <P>MIGA assesses its success in terms of the number of jobs created, foreign exchange earnings and savings produced, tax and other revenues generated for the host government, and advanced technology and management practices introduced.</P>
    <P>All MIGA insured projects must be environmentally and financially sound. They must also be technically sound. MIGA's technical assistance work is designed to promote the flow of investment to its developing member countries and economies in transition. These activities focus primarily on sectoral ministries and national and local investment promotion agencies. It assists the agencies in capacity building and dissemination of information on investment opportunities in their countries. It also supports the investment marketing efforts of agencies by organising multi-country single sector conferences that bring together potential investors, local partners and host country investment promotion officers.</P>
    <P>The fulfilment of MIGA's objectives contributes to the development of the private sector in host countries and increases the ability of these countries to achieve economic and social development in an environmentally sustainable way. The agency's success in promoting foreign direct investment in its developing member countries and economies in transition makes an important contribution to the attainment of the overall development objectives of the World Bank group.</P>
    <P>Global private flows to developing countries increased from $42 billion in 1990 to $256 billion in 1997, although we witnessed a slight slowdown <Col N="815" /> in 1997 which was due largely to the crisis in East Asia. Growth has resulted from a combination of factors: the liberalisation and private sector growth in developing economies, particularly in the infrastructure sector; strong macroeconomic growth; an increase in trade; and a more integrated global investment and production regime overall. Against this background foreign direct investment continued to form the largest portion of net private flows and rose fivefold from $24 billion to $120 billion in the same period.</P>
    <P>The growth of foreign direct investment in developing countries acted as a catalyst for and benefited from the expansion of the investment insurance market. Concerns of project sponsors about restrictions on transfer of remittances, expropriation or nationalisation, and war and civil disturbance have inhibited the flow of foreign investments in the past. The increasing availability and use of political risk insurance as a risk mitigation mechanism have boosted investors' confidence to invest in developing countries.</P>
    <P>The Berne Union, which comprises 25 investment insurers including MIGA, reports that the use of political risk insurance has more than doubled since 1990 when it was $17 billion and reached $38.9 billion in 1997. In response to global trends private investment insurers are increasing the capacity and scope of their coverage and providing longer periods of insurance</P>
    <P>MIGA's role in relation to Africa may be of interest to Senators. It wants to respond to the growing needs of African countries. Several African countries have undertaken rigorous structural reform and adjustment efforts and these measures have begun to show rewards in the form of steady economic growth. Though these efforts have unfortunately been undermined by the spread of the AIDS epidemic and the resurgence of conflict in many parts of the continent, the economic potential of Africa remains enormous.</P>
    <P>I am aware that many Senators are closely concerned with the resolution of the debt burden which constrains the development of many African countries. Even after this burden is alleviated for the countries affected, they will still badly need foreign direct investment. Many of these are still shaky economies and they are not immune either from economic crises such as that which hit East Asia or from renewed political instability. MIGA's technical assistance and guarantee activities will be crucial to such African countries. The difference MIGA makes for them will be a key test by which the agency will be evaluated in terms of its effectiveness in diversifying foreign direct investment to poorer countries. Since its inception, the agency has underwritten 62 contracts of guarantee in Africa, facilitating an estimated $3.7 billion in foreign direct investment. The activities of the agency in providing technical assistance to promote foreign direct investment by strengthening the capacity of investment intermediaries to attract and retain <Col N="816" /> foreign direct investment are of particular relevance to Africa.</P>
    <P>MIGA obtains its resources from the capital subscriptions of its members. MIGA's initial authorised capital was SDR 1 billion. The current authorised capital is SDR 1.86 billion. The increase is accounted for by an increase of SDR 77 million in the initial capital to accommodate an increase in membership over that initially provided for and the current capital increase of SDR 786 million.</P>
    <P>As of 30 September 1999, full membership requirements in the agency have been completed by 150 countries. The current amount of the capital subscribed by full members is SDR 1.04 billion or $1.124 billion. On 29 March 1999 the Council of Governors of MIGA adopted a resolution for a general capital increase. Under this the authorised capital stock of the agency will be increased by SDR 786 million - $850 million.</P>
    <P>The proposed capital increase will help to underpin an underwriting strategy which envisages between $15 billion and $24 billion of new guarantees being issued up to the year 2006. After allowing for existing guarantees, cancellations, reductions, expiries and losses, MIGA's outstanding contingent liabilities would be about $15.7 billion gross by the end of that period. Based on historic ratios, new guarantees of between $15 billion and $24 billion could facilitate an estimated $105 billion to $168 billion of new foreign direct investment to developing and transition countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been a member of MIGA since its establishment in 1988 having ratified the convention establishing MIGA on 5 July 1989. The cost of the shares allocated to Ireland was about $4 million, of which 10% &ndash; $400,000 or £280,000 &ndash; was paid in cash. Under the proposed capital increase Ireland will receive additional shares involving an additional subscription of $3 million. This will consist of a cash payment of $537,000 &ndash; £396,000 &ndash; and callable capital of $2.5 million. Cash payment will be made in two equal instalments in the first two years of the capital increase. The first payment fell due before 29 March 2000; the second is to be made before 29 March 2001. Each payment will amount to £198,000.</P>
    <P>Ireland's contributions to MIGA are accountable as part of our official development assistance programme and count towards Ireland's UN GNP percentage target for overseas development assistance. Contributions to MIGA are payable from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Section 1 amends section 3 of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Act, 1988, to allow the Minister to subscribe to the 1998 capital increase of the agency as set out under resolution 57, adopted by the Council of Governors of the MIGA on 29 March 1999. Section 2 contains the short title.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I have no difficulty in supporting the Bill without amendment. This is technical legislation and I thank the Minister of State for the explanatory memorandum which accompanies it. It explains in great detail the functions and objectives of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, known as MIGA. It was created in 1988 as part of the World Bank, and Ireland has been a member since the agency was established. The main objective of the agency is to encourage the flow of investment for productive purposes among member countries and especially to developing member countries. To serve this objective, MIGA issues guarantees against non-commercial risks to foreign direct investment in developing member countries and also provides technical assistance to the governments of such countries to improve their ability to attract foreign direct investment.</P>
      <P>We in this country can understand the objectives of the agency because, for many years, we have been the beneficiary of inward investment. It has played a major role in the economic growth we have experienced in recent years. In our case, there was no need to issue guarantees against non-commercial or political risks because one of the main factors in our success in encouraging inward investment was the fact that, since the foundation of the State, we have always enjoyed political stability. Entrepreneurs who intend investing in the Third World often do so in countries where there is a lack of political stability. In such cases, MIGA plays a major part in offering guarantees to cover risks. These are outlined in the explanatory memorandum and include currency, transfer of restrictions, expropriation, war and civil disobedience, including politically motivated acts of sabotage or terrorism, and breach of contract by a host government, provided the investor obtains an arbitration award or judicial settlement for damages and is unable to enforce it after a specific period or, in certain cases, where the investor is unable to obtain an award or settlement.</P>
      <P>As well as providing guarantees against non-commercial or political risks for foreign direct investment, the agency also has the function of providing technical assistance to governments of developing countries to improve their ability to attract foreign investment. In Ireland, we have our own agency, the IDA, which has never lost an opportunity to attract foreign investment to Ireland. However, many countries in the Third World would not have this facility and depend on the agency to assist them in attracting investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of Third World countries which frightens me is that, in many of them where the standard of living is very low, there is serious conflict between different parties which results in civil war. It is often the case that, at the same time, these countries experience prolonged periods of famine. A good example is the ongoing war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. We are all appalled by the conditions in Ethiopia, yet war continues. Perhaps the Minister of State, in his <Col N="818" /> reply, could explain how MIGA deals with such a situation.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the non-governmental organisations for their work in overseas development. I am always deeply impressed by the generosity of young men and women who dedicate part of their lives to help the less well-off. With the economic growth we are experiencing at present we should be more generous in our contribution to this development and I am glad to see that the Minister of State with responsibility for this matter has outlined her intention to achieve the target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid within the next few years.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are concerned about the plight of poorer countries know that one of the best ways they can be assisted is helping them to write off their foreign debt. I support the comments of the Jubilee 2000 committee on the writing off of such debt and I understand that its petition was signed by almost 1 million people in Ireland and will be presented to the G8 leaders. I hope that, at their next meeting, those leaders will consider writing off the debts of developing countries.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not controversial. It increases our contribution to the fund by using the same mechanism of acquiring shares which was provided when MIGA was established in 1988. As well as being a financial measure to assist Third World countries, it is also a vote of confidence in our young people involved with NGOs throughout the international community. We salute them for their generosity and encourage them to continue with their valiant work to help bring an end to the poverty, hardship, starvation and destruction we have witnessed in many parts of the developing world. For that reason, I am happy to support the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I welcome the introduction of the Bill. Its passing will enable the Minister for Finance to adhere to the 1998 capital increase of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. The Bill has only two sections and, consequently, not much can be said except to review the original establishment of the agency and its success or failure to date. I hope we are not too repetitive. The explanatory memorandum is very detailed and most of us operate from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>MIGA was created in April 1988 as the newest element of the World Bank. Originally it had 42 member countries and now has 149, 22 of which are industrial and 127 of which are developing nations. I understand there is a possibility of an increase up to 165 as 16 others satisfy the criteria. The agency began operation in 1990 and encourages the flow of investment for productive purposes among member countries, especially developing countries where investment can be restricted due to the perception, and in many cases the reality, of political risks. Investment is only covered where projects are economically, financially and environmentally sound. MIGA offers guarantees for foreign direct investment <Col N="819" /> against non-commercial or political risks. It offers long-term insurance against political risks to eligible investors, which include commercial banks, for qualifying investments in developing member countries. Such insurance cannot be cancelled. It also provides technical assistance to Governments to improve their ability to attract foreign direct investment. MIGA can insure new investments originating in any member country and destined for any developing member country, investment contributions associated with the expansion, modernisation or financial restructuring of existing projects. Unconsidered new investments are therefore, also eligible as are acquisitions that involve the privatisation of State enterprises. MIGA provides coverage for investments in various industry sectors, including agri-business, energy, financial, manufacturing, natural resources, services and tourism.</P>
    <P>An eligible investor is typically a national of a MIGA member country other than the host country in which the investment is to be made. A corporation as well as a commercial bank or other financial institution is also eligible for coverage if it is either incorporated or has its principal place of business in a member country or if it is majority owned by nationals of member countries. While MIGA usually limits support to private sector investors, State-owned corporations or financial institutions may be eligible if they can demonstrate that they operate on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>With the capital increase provided in this Bill the agency assumes more risk and more complicated and larger projects. Its technical assistance is highly valued by many countries. The success of our own economy has been built by many sources of direct foreign investment over the past ten to 15 years. Many countries are now trying to emulate our success. However, many Third World countries have great difficulty attracting such foreign capital. This is caused by the perception and, in many cases, the actual political risks attached to those countries. This can lead to a lack of industrialisation and only increases the poverty trap in these countries and enlarges the many existing social problems.</P>
    <P>MIGA works closely with many other international development and financial agencies such as the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. MIGA guarantees and helps to promote new investment to expand, privatise or financially reconstruct existing projects in developing member countries. Its long-term guarantees of 15 to 20 years help to eliminate investors' concerns about political risks and encourage investments that might not be made without these guarantees.</P>
    <P>The main objectives, as the Minister set out, are political but non-commercial risks insurance cover to cover currency transfer restrictions, expropriation, war and civil disturbance and breach of contract by the host countries. All actions of host countries which would jeopardise <Col N="820" /> the return on investment need insurance risk cover to attract foreign direct investment. MIGA covers several forms of investment including equity commercial bank loans, loans made or guaranteed by foreign equity holders and technical assistance on management contracts. Its structure is flexible to enable encouragement of foreign investors to expand their activities into the developing world. MIGA assesses its success in terms of the number of jobs created and many other factors.</P>
    <P>MIGA assesses local investment promotion agencies in capacity building, identifying investment opportunities in their countries. It also supports investment/marketing efforts of these agencies by promoting multi-country, single sector conferences which bring together potential investors and local partners. The agency contributes to the development of the private sector in the host country and helps them to activate economic and social development in an environmentally sustainable way.</P>
    <P>In March 1999, as the Minister said, the council of governors of MIGA adopted the resolution for a general capital increase. The increase is to the tune of US $850 million. We have been members of MIGA since its establishment in 1988. The cost of the original shares allocated was US$4 million with Ireland holding 369 shares and up to 20% call-up cash at that time, which amounted to approximately £280,000, more than half our call-up could have been. We have suffered no further call-ups other than this. The proposed capital increase will give us additional capital in the agency of US$3 million with cash payments from transferred funds of up to £400,000 approximately in two instalments this year and next year. Our shareholding will increase to 281 shares out of a total new increase of 78,000 approximately. Our contribution is regarded as part of our overseas development assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned export credit insurance and the difference between it and what is involved here. Export credit insurance insures sales in risky economies, effectively insuring commercial activity. This scheme is different as it insures investment in risky economies due to political turmoil and instability. Where political or exchange control risks and also exchange rate risks are high due to the political climate, investors will be reluctant to invest in this type of underdeveloped country. This fund and its expansion now proposed, will underpin the risks with which investors are faced. The alternative to this worthwhile scheme is that no investment will take place and developing countries will remain poor with many social problems. The cost to Ireland is in our capital investment. We have, however, a contingent liability, as in all insurance, on the guarantee we give should investments go wrong. The present increase will give us a potential call-up of approximately £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>Third World debt is a major problem. The colossal debt has been a huge drain on poor countries who need to allocate enormous portions of <Col N="821" /> their national income towards paying interest on their debts without a reduction of the actual national debt. The initial loans from the World Bank and IMF were intended to develop these countries but the debt burden has caused these countries to become poorer and even increased the social problems among the population. The developing nations pay the West seven or eight times more in debt repayments than they actually received from the western countries in aid. Many people have called for the debts to be cancelled. I am of a similar view. A balance must be struck between direct cash investment and the guarantees provided by this Bill. Even a partial cancellation of debts would be of great assistance to some of these countries.</P>
    <P>MIGA is playing an important role in many African countries which are ravaged by political uncertainty and many natural catastrophes. Several countries have shown steady economic growth due to political reform. Some need direct foreign investment urgently as they have benefited from debt reduction. Many others still have unstable economies which are not immune to world economic crises. The technical assistance and guarantees of MIGA are very important to these countries and the agency's effectiveness will be judged on the success and the amount of foreign investment directed to those African countries. The agency has underwritten 62 contracts of guarantees in the African continent. This has resulted in up to US$4 billion foreign direct investment.</P>
    <P>The Bill and the work of the agency do not insure commercial risk but insure against political risks and instability. It allows us to consider issues relating to economic growth and development in the countries the agency attempts to assist. Private sector financial agencies and insurance companies have an important role to play in the economic growth of the developing countries. The fund is a good one and it would appear to be making progress and achieving results. In the past ten years MIGA has achieved much success with several successful, innovative initiatives. The Bill will allow us to play our part in the increased capital and guarantees of the multilateral investment guarantee agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the Minister, I could not resist speaking because there is so much in this Bill. While I am sure the intent is most admirable and that the <i>bona fides</i> of the proponents are above reproach, so much in this Bill presumes much. I give a few examples. The MIGA guarantees against currency transfer restrictions, against expropriation by a host Government, against war and civil disturbance and against breach of contract by a host government in certain circumstances, all of which sounds very admirable but if the assembled currency speculators of the world take a view about the currency of a developing country, as they often do, and it collapses on the foreign exchanges, we take that as the natural function of the market. <Col N="822" /> There is no reference there concerning currency fluctuations brought on by the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with this Bill. There is no guarantee against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am saying. The marketplace is regarded as natural but all these matters are regarded as risks.</P>
      <P>The fundamental problem the world has and which many economists have addressed &ndash; this is where issues like the Tobin tax come in &ndash; is that global financial transactions are utterly decoupled from trade. We are attempting to deal with this without facing up to the fact that globalisation of financial transactions has been a disaster for the world and has left a history of instability and uncertainly. The rationality, for instance, of the decline in the value of the euro against the yen at a time when Europe is prospering economically, politically and every other way and Japan is currently an economic and political basket case with serious economic structural problems and even more fundamental political problems is evidence of what I am talking about. If, as it should, the world wants to sort the problems of developing countries and to encourage investment in them, the first thing which needs to be sorted out is the irrationality, which is the direct opposite of theory, of the world capital flow system and the fact it is unregulated, untaxed and unrelated, incidentally, to reality.</P>
      <P>There is a presumption that growth is a good thing. I realise the World Bank discovered the environment about 20 years after everybody else and it has been, until quite recently, quite an unmitigated disaster. In a book called <i>Lords of Poverty</i> whose author I cannot remember, it is asserted that 65% of World Bank projects fail and that a considerable part of the World Bank's operating costs are devoted to the exorbitant salaries of the people who run the bank. The question which ought to be raised is the appropriateness of that institution to foster or deal with development in any shape or form because that institution has a record of failure which is perhaps unparalleled.</P>
      <P>I find the idea that we would classify our willingness to subscribe here as part of our ODA as a slight presumption. The overwhelming evidence from this country's experience is that bilateral aid works and that multilateral aid gets lost in a quagmire of bureaucracy, self-interest and, incidentally, the overwhelming priority of the World Bank and the IMF, which is the USA's view of the world. Both those institutions are dominated by the US view of the world which is valid but is not necessarily universally correct. Those two institutions have been dominated by the United States since their foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the issue of global flows which the Minister mentioned. The global private flows to developing countries increased from US$42 billion to US$256 billion in 1997. Why would they not when the last big flow of private money to <Col N="823" /> the developing countries was the wave of private sector lending to such countries which culminated ultimately in the international debt crisis, at which point the governments of the western world underwrote and took on the quite extravagant and irresponsible debts which the private sector in the United States and Europe had taken on, and turned what was private debt into public debt? It is still being repaid and is the greatest obstacle to development in most of the developing world. The burden of debt is their greatest problem. No matter what the scale of private direct investment, which is welcome in so far as it goes, it will not make a difference until the fundamental issue of debt development is dealt with. The IMF, in particular &ndash; the World Bank tends to talk a little more humanely &ndash; is determined to exact an enormous and quite disproportionate human price for any debt relief.</P>
    <P>I would like to go through the four questions here. The Minister said growth resulted from a combination of factors, liberalisation and private sector growth. Let us not get carried away with liberalisation. The fundamental problem of many developing countries, particularly those which were part of the market economy, was that they were corrupt and it was tolerated because, up to the collapse of the Soviet Union, they were at least corrupt on our side. Much of what they did was tolerated as long as they did not take the wrong side on many international issues. We are still reluctant to make democracy a fundamental condition of development aid. One of my favourite countries, Cuba, is not a democracy but since it is in receipt of virtually no multilateral aid and small amounts of bilateral aid from countries in a position to talk to it fairly bluntly about its failings, this is not an issue.</P>
    <P>The 1998 Nobel prize winner for economics, whose name I will not mention because I cannot remember it precisely &ndash; and if I could, I could not spell it and would only cause the reporters great confusion &ndash; is an Indian. He spoke about the assumption that growth and development are the same thing as one of the most fundamental myths of all. I do not have to look much beyond this country over the last five or six years to realise that growth and development are not the same thing &ndash; ask those who are outside the spread of the affluence of the past five or six years. Even more is this true internationally and the tragedy is that projects such as this, which are necessary to make a difference, are not sufficient because growth and development are not the same thing.</P>
    <P>If we have strong macro economic growth and an increase in trade and a more integrated global investment and production regime but do not have the institutions, the services and the type of political structures which guarantee the people of developing countries that the consequences of growth will be development, it will not happen. It does not happen automatically and, notwithstanding what is said here, global inequality is <Col N="824" /> getting worse. The difference in income <i>per capita</i> between the very rich and the very poor is increasing. The absence of the provision of fundamental services, such as basic health care, clean water and sewage treatment, is not being dealt with. Indeed, the IMF's appalling structural adjustment policies have made that worse. There is an absence of any moral position on the part of the western world, which is quite prepared to tolerate arms exports to countries which cannot afford to feed and clothe their people and to suck away further resources in arms exports. Things such as this, as part of an ethically and socially conscious and human focused development regime, would make a difference. They are not a substitute for a proper development philosophy and that is what is missing from this &ndash; the understanding that development is more than economic growth.</P>
    <P>I am being positive but I could be sceptical about the idea because I spent my life listening to the almost universal and unanimous hymn being sung that we had to reward risk taking. Funnily enough, I have no problem with rewarding risk taking but I always find with most of our risk takers that when one scratches a little below the surface, the only risk is whether their revenues will be 5% or 25% up. One will find somewhere not too far from the surface a guarantee by a state or multilateral agency that if things go too far wrong, they will be all right because the state will bail them out. It happened, as I said, with the international debt crisis in which the private banking sector was bailed out by states. It is happening again. They will be encouraged to invest in countries where they will get cheap labour, poor labour regulation and perhaps even child labour. The chorus of disapproval relating to child labour has not been matched by unequivocal and unambiguous action on it. Limited environmental regulations and the notion of the World Bank policing international environmental accountability are a little difficult to stomach given some of its activities in the past.</P>
    <P>I am not inclined to oppose the legislation but when multilateral agencies and officials of the Department of Finance sing the praises of such an agency it is my duty to add a word a caution. Growth and development are not synonymous in Ireland or abroad and the World Bank ought to examine the issue of development and what it means.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions on this short but important Bill. They understood the gist of the Bill and Senator Ryan widened the debate as is his right and wont. However, it is important to clarify that the legislation relates to political risk insurance. The formation of MIGA and its interaction with state insurers and those involved in the private sector has been a fundamental step forward. The entire area has been driven by the formation of MIGA to create a substantial arena for political risk <Col N="825" /> assurance. It is not involved in commercial insurance or export credit insurance, for example, which is a completely different concept and has no bearing on this and that was recognised by Members.</P>
      <P>Many mistakes have been made by the World Bank and the IMF in the past but in recent years, albeit late in the thinking process, there has been a fundamental shift in all policies, whether they are core policies of the IMF or World Bank or some of the peripheral policies which examine the social consequences of investment in many Third World countries. It is right that there must be a relationship between investment and its impact on the ground and the policy from which it derives. The possible social consequences of any investment cannot be isolated.</P>
      <P>Ireland and the Houses of the Oireachtas have played a significant role in this regard. While Ireland does not have the financial clout of many other countries, it has the moral authority which is well thought of when we speak on these matters. We have played a significant role as a people in driving that agenda home at many different international fora and ensuring the thinking behind many issues has changed for the better in recent years. We hope when we look back on the next decade that the impact of these substantial changes in policy will have borne fruit for the people at whom they were aimed.</P>
      <P>I do not accept Senator Ryan's remarks in the context of separating growth and development. While there may be some differences between them I do not accept that they are somehow divorced nor do I accept in the context of Ireland that growth has not resulted in development. I have first hand practical experience and I have no doubt that every man, woman and child in Ireland has benefited from what has happened in the economy over the past number of years. I defy anybody to point out an individual who, other than by choice, does not want to partake in this economy. I do not accept that analysis and to suggest that Ireland is an example of the separation of growth and development where they are two completely mutually exclusive concepts is seriously incorrect.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan referred to investment in foreign currency and the euro. I was frustrated trying to understand why people invested in the yen, for instance, as opposed to the dollar or why the yen appeared stronger than the euro until I examined the underlying figures and discovered the startling fact that the greatest investment on the world stage in terms of currency in the medium to long term is in the euro. The euro is going through the roof while the dollar and yen are going through the floor. The heaviest investment by the money men and women of the world is in the euro.</P>

      <P>I agree to an extent that Ireland has been extraordinarily successful in bilateral investment but we must examine our history in this area, particularly in Africa, where we have had a long gestation period for different reasons beginning with the missions in the context of our relationship with these countries. Ireland is a shining example of how to obtain real value from small resources as opposed to the waste of grandiose resources by institutions, such as the World Bank, and it has obtained a real return, particularly for the people it is trying to help. It is important that such experience is brought to the multilateral forum and is used to change the direction of policy, which Ireland has done. Collectively we can, through greater resources if they are utilised properly, make an even bigger impact in many Third World countries. It is wrong to suggest that one can be played off the other. We carefully involve ourselves and monitor investment. Ireland is at the top of the human resources tree. We have the people, understanding, culture, outlook and experience to make things happens, more so than many other countries. I believe that we have a greater role to play in the wider sense of what is happening in regard to multilateral relationships throughout the world.</P>
      <P>I have lived abroad. I emigrated to Africa and have seen it in good and bad times. I believe good governance is at the root of so much. It is not the exclusive basis but governance is a factor in what is wrong with so many countries. Despotic leaders took over African countries and destroyed their people to achieve personal aggrandisement in their homelands and on the world stage.</P>

      <P>Yes, I lived there for three years and was there when Robert Mugabe took over. The principle of good governance and the removal of corruption are fundamental if there is to be a way forward. I do not care what resources are invested in a country, whether it is foreign direct investment because if it has a stable political system based on good governance and which is not corrupt, it has a chance.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan referred to globalisation, the liberal economy and the market. He should examine what is happening in eastern Europe. I attended a meeting of the EBRD recently &ndash; I have done so for the past few years. The countries in eastern Europe that have good governance and a lack of corruption, both in the economic and political systems, are making the greatest progress. They have not necessarily received more money, aid or people telling them how to proceed. Given this fairly equal playing pitch, why have some of these countries made progress in leaps and bounds while others have not? It is because they have in their system a basic tenet, an unmoveable principle of good governance. In today's world they are proof of what emerging countries can do. Africa must take the same route. The world must take account of this in a much more direct way than in the past where it becomes directly involved, whether bilaterally or multilaterally.</P>
      <P>The tragedy is that the majority of the peoples in these countries have nobody to speak for them. Their own so-called leadership could not care less about them. They have wasted enormous resources given to them.</P>

      <P>In page 18, subsection (3), line 23, after &ldquo;airports.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Where airports which fall to be regulated by the Commission are owned by one and the same person and they operate as a group of airports whose activities are co-ordinated by the airport operator concerned, a determination by the Commission shall be expressed so as to operate by reference to the aggregate of charges levied at such airports.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If section 33(5)(<i>d</i>) was retained it could have serious implications. It is correct that the regulator should have regard to the level of service provided to airport users by the airport authority. The commission has the necessary powers under paragraph (<i>f</i>), but in order for the regulator to provide for the quality and the terms and conditions of services, the regulator would be obliged to be involved in operations that surely are not intended under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues from the regions will acknowledge that we Dublin people are not selfish. In the relevant UK legislation account was taken of the fact that Heathrow could overwhelm other airports and it makes special provisions in determining charges for groups of airports. This was necessary for the balanced utilisation of capacity between the three London airports and to ensure that the airport charges at Stansted and Gatwick were competitive enough to attract traffic and that they were not overwhelmed by a monopoly position at Heathrow.</P>
      <P>We have a similar situation with regard to Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports. In the interests of fairness and balance in terms of regional policy, the amendment proposes to regulate these three airports as a unit to ensure that the airport charges at Cork and Shannon are competitive with respect to Dublin. This is required in terms of market stability and regional development policy.</P>
      <P>All-embracing people as Dublin people are, Dublin Senators appeal to the Minister to consider seriously the amendment in the interests of the three airports I have mentioned to promote stability and balance and to ensure there is not a monopoly position in Dublin. Legislation introduced by the Minister to date has addressed the question of regional balance. To ensure this legislation is consistent with that approach I appeal to her to accept this amendment in the interests of regional balance and to ensure that Dublin Airport does not have a monopoly over Cork and Shannon airports. I am interested in hearing the comments of my colleagues on the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Senator Liam Fitzgerald's comments and, as he is a Limerick man, I hope they are conditioned by his concern for the regions. There is a glaring omission in the Bill regarding the failure to take into account that a number of airports might be owned by the same company or group and operate as a unit. This is a relevant and important matter. We discussed earlier the fact that regionality is not incorporated in the Bill in terms of the Minister deciding specific policy and we hope to return to the matter on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 37 is similar to amendment No. 21 tabled by Senator Liam Fitzgerald. The purpose of my amendment is to insert a new section which states:</P>
      <P>Where it appears to the Commission that two or more airports are either</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) managed by the same airport operation, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> (<i>b</i>) that they are owned by the same person, or by members of the same group of companies and they operate as a group of airports whose activities are co-ordinated by the airport operators concerned,</P>
    <P>any conditions imposed or modified by the Commission in relation to any one of those airports may be framed so as to prescribe a limit or limits operating by reference to the aggregate of amounts levied by way of airport charges at that airport and amounts so levied at the other airport or airports.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Aer Rianta operation of the three airports continues because the company has been successful over the years. At various stages in the history of all airports there is a high degree of interdependence and interaction between airports. One airport may support another financially at a particular time and <i>vice versa,</i> depending on the patterns that develop in relation to business and traffic through the airport and restrictions imposed by new legislation and agreements. It is vital that airports that may be in a weaker position are protected.</P>
    <P>One might say that the EU has many policies on protectionism but the Minister could not have any difficulty with the amendment. It is in the interests of all airports that they remain viable and are considered functional entities in their areas. They should provide an integral service to the economy, the people and the regions and it is vital that this position is maintained. It is also important that their costs are not prohibitive and that they do not find the situation impossible.</P>
    <P>A company will make the best judgments possible within the internal company structure to ensure that all its entities operate to the best advantage of the region. The Minister gave a commitment that the three airports will remain as one unit. Her restatement of that is most welcome but we must go further. Given that a commission and a regulator will be established under the Bill, there is no need for the Minister or the Government to proceed with an IPO. The Minister, who is the main shareholder in the company, will not regulate it. This function will be carried out by the commission. Therefore, any conflict of interest which could have existed heretofore will be removed once the legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>A similar section was included in the British Act relating to airports. However, such a section was omitted in this Bill. I presume it was an oversight rather than a deliberate exclusion and I hope the Minister will have no difficulty accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>Although the amendments are a blunt instrument, they are vital. There will be a problem if there is no attempt to allow flexibility and to ensure that the overall way in which regional airports are treated reflects public policy. I suspect the Minster may argue that because of her capacity to give directions under public pol<Col N="831" /> icy, she can deal with this matter without legislation. However, as is often the case, the hypothetical ministerial successor may not be as benevolent as she is.</P>

      <P>The consultants' report on Aer Rianta which the Minister received is an appalling document, full of assumptions about private sector efficiencies that will not survive in the real world.

      <P>After that, it puts together a justification for it. This is what most consultants do for most clients. They figure out as carefully as they can what the customer wants and then they put together the most plausible possible case for it. I read the report and I am sceptical of it. For example, the consultants used dubious models to reduce the figures for passenger numbers at Dublin Airport. However, they are using a model to produce projections for figures in Dublin Airport when no model ever projected the growth the country has experienced. As the OECD said, there may be close to double digit economic growth in the foreseeable future. However, the consultants suggested that Aer Rianta was overestimating passenger numbers.</P>

    <P>The fundamental issue is that Dublin Airport cannot continue to expand indefinitely. There is a limit on what an airport can handle. Therefore, the issue of making it more attractive for international operators to use regional airports arises. One of those instruments is charges. Some of the more enthusiastic free market economists suggested in Britain that airlines should make commercial bids for slots in Heathrow and that this would deter the eternal demand to go to Heathrow. Every airline appears to believe that it is not really world class unless it has slots in <Col N="832" /> Heathrow. I think it is the worst airport in the world.</P>

      <P>There are two ways of looking at development. To a degree, the economics profession believes that there is growth and then infrastructure is provided. It tells the Minister that only 2% of people travel by rail and, therefore, there should no investment in rail. My view is that if there was investment in rail, more people would travel by it.</P>

      <P>I mentioned that to illustrate the point that regional development does not happen by accident. The economists' theory is that it should level out naturally. However, nobody else believes it and many economists no longer believe it. A package of measures must be put together, including regional infrastructure which will suck development away from Dublin. Senator Liam Fitzgerald would not be too pleased about that, but if there is a possibility of a national unemployment rate of 3% in the next two or three years, we should worry about the quality of development and not employment. Part of the quality of development will relate to a much more even distribution of growth.</P>

      <P>These three amendments pursue the same objective while using different words. While the advice was to leave it as it is, we came to the conclusion it should be included in some form. I know the intention behind the amendments tabled by Senators Liam Fitzgerald, Taylor-Quinn and Ryan. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is too mandatory. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the amendments <Col N="833" /> tabled by Senators Taylor-Quinn and Ryan is the best way forward. We must amalgamate the three amendments to produce the desired objective. I will ask the parliamentary draftsman to do so and to come back with an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>This Bill shows the need to have a time lag between Committee Stage and Report Stage. Otherwise, we would refuse to accept amendments or accept wrongly worded ones.

The details can be operated by the management of the company in the interest of the sector overall.</P>

    <P>I hope the Minister will retain her shareholding in the company and maintain a public policy interest so she will be in a position to give specific directions to the company. Social obligations and policies must be considered in legislation when dealing with a semi-State company. Those will go by the wayside if we consider an IPO. The Minister can have the best of both worlds. Her approach is wise, good and commendable. She is laying down the framework to stay where she is as far as the company is concerned.

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 18, subsection (5), lines 40 to 42, to delete paragraph (<i>d</i>).</P>
      <P>I mistakenly referred to amendment No. 23 in respect of a previous amendment and I apologise for delaying the proceedings of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>It is correct to state that the regulator should have regard to the level of service applied to airport users by an airport authority. When making a determination on airport charges, the commission will, under section 33(<i>f</i>), be obliged to have regard to &ldquo;the level and quality of services offered at an airport by its airport authority&rdquo;. However, I am of the view that section 32(5)(<i>d</i>) may be at variance with that.</P>
      <P>The regulator's functions relate to the economic regulation of airport charges. However, in order for the regulator to provide for the level and quality of services and the terms and conditions of services supplied by an airport, he or she would be obliged to become involved in the operational management of the airports. I do not believe the Minister intended that this should be the case. The regulator would also have to become involved in determining the standard business contracts between airports and airlines. This would clearly militate against the effective operation of the airports and the regulatory office because the regulator will not have the necessary expertise to fulfil this requirement.</P>
      <P>The ground handling directive already requires that service levels should be set out in contracts between airports, airlines and ground handlers. The regulator, who has responsibility for granting licences to ground handlers under a separate part of the Bill, should not be involved in this process. I propose that the Minister accept the amendment for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished that this amendment has been tabled. I have a particular complaint about regulators. For example, the telecommunications regulator seems to believe that as long as she creates a commercial market everything else will work perfectly. That is not how the system operates. I am amazed by the idea that the regulator would not be in a position to ensure that airport operators provide a proper quality of service. As stated last week, I am not impressed by the quality of the service currently on offer at Dublin Airport and I am appalled by the idea that the regulator would be responsible for fixing <Col N="836" /> charges without having some input into the quality of service provided.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that the regulator would be obliged to agree charges and state that the level of service offered to customers in return for paying those charges was none of his or her business is wrong. I do not know what Senator Fitzgerald intends to achieve with this amendment. I accept that he is familiar with Dublin Airport and its concerns. However, I do not favour a situation where no one other than an airport authority would have a legal responsibility in this area or where such authorities would not be accountable to any public body. Under the Bill, the commission is accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and, therefore, is responsible for ensuring that a proper quality of service is provided. I am opposed to the amendment because it would considerably reduce the role the commission should play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter can be viewed in two ways, namely, that section 32(5)(<i>d</i>) is essential or that there is absolutely no need for it. We are familiar with companies such as Aer Rianta which operate to very high standards. Aer Rianta is second to none in terms of the level and quality of service it provides at the airports it operates. It is responsible for servicing aircraft, providing refuelling and ground handling facilities and supplying food for flight kitchens.</P>
      <P>A limit should be placed on the extent to which people should be allowed to interfere in any particular business. Does Senator Fitzgerald want the regulator or someone from his or her office to have responsibility for overseeing the operation of flight kitchens or refuelling facilities? Does he believe the regulator's office should be responsible for investigating the day to day operation of an airport authority? Whether this should be the case is a matter of judgment. However, it is my view that a limit should be placed on the extent to which we should allow the regulator to become involved in this area.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with Shannon Airport and can attest to the excellent level of service which is provided there, the pride with which workers provide this service and the astuteness exercised by the management in running the airport. The system put in place by Aer Rianta to facilitate the airport's operation is efficient and effective.</P>
      <P>This Bill is fundamentally concerned with the landing and taking off of aircraft and there is another item of legislation which deals with air safety issues, etc. I am reluctant to support a suggestion which would allow the regulator's office to scrutinise airport operations in minute detail. The regulator will have a responsibility to consider the aviation sector in general in addition to the airports which will come within his or her remit. Under other sections of the Bill, he or she will be responsible for making decisions on matters involving domestic and international competition and considering regional and national aviation policy.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Amendment No. 23 proposes that section 32(5)(<i>d</i>) be deleted. However, section 33(<i>f</i>) states that the commission &ldquo;shall have due regard to . . . the level and quality of services offered at an airport by its airport authority and the reasonable interests of the users of these services&rdquo;, whereas section 32(5)(<i>d</i>) states that &ldquo;A determination may . . . provide for the level and quality of services including the terms and conditions of such services supplied by an airport authority&rdquo;. I have no difficulty with deleting paragraph (<i>d</i>) because provision is made in this regard in section 33.</P>

      <P>While I am familiar with Shannon Airport, I am more familiar with Dublin Airport at which a multiplicity of services is available.

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree. I seek high standards just as Senator Ryan does and, for the most part, the quality of service on offer in Dublin Airport is excellent. I find it intriguing, given the primary purpose of this Bill, that a regulator would be given the power to move into, or interfere in, the areas clearly delineated by my colleague on the other side of the House. That could cause chaos.</P>
      <P>The regulator's area of expertise, as defined in the Bill, is quite clear and that is obviously the expertise which should be brought to bear to regulate those aspects of the aviation industry which have caused difficulty to date. The Minister has added four additional functions to that to widen the regulator's powers and scope. The regulator's main powers and functions are far too important, domestically and in terms of international competition, to allow a situation in which the regulator would be directed by the legislation to supervise and intrude upon services which, in spite of Senator Ryan's strongly held views, have been provided at top quality in Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>I am less familiar with Shannon Airport although I have passed through it many times and come from an area near the airport. I have never found the services at the airport to be anything other than of a high quality and have found the highest standards of courtesy operate there. I am baffled as to why a regulator should intrude on a variety of operations which, to date, have been performed at a very high standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to accept the amendment, that is entirely her own business. Section 33(<i>f</i>) states that the commission shall have due regard to the level and quality of services offered at an airport by its airport authority. I believe that the users of airport services should have some way of ensuring that what they consider to be reasonable standards are enforced. The Director of Telecommunications Regulation does not believe it is her job to ensure, for instance, that cable television standards are enforced, nor does she believe that complaints about monopolistic behaviour by cable television providers come within her remit. She holds the view that it is her job to facilitate competition and that is supposed to make everything better. That might be all very well in an ideal world but the world is not ideal.</P>
      <P>This is only an enabling provision. If we take away the provision that the commission may provide for the level and quality of services, all that will remain is the provision in section 33(<i>f</i>) which states that the commission shall have due regard to the level and quality of services. Having due regard to what the airport provides is not the same as saying that we expect certain minimum standards to be met. This is not a matter of great concern to me but if regulation, as a new concept distinct from the old idea of State ownership, is to function properly, then this is not just a matter of money or cost, rather it is a matter of ensuring that acceptable minimum standards are met. This not only relates to the standard of services provided to airport customers; it also relates to the standard of services provided to people who pay airport charges. We are saying that we are going to take away the commission's right to have some input into what those minimum standards should be. I find that astonishing but it is not my problem.</P>

      <P>In page 19, subsection (13)(<i>a</i>)(i), line 36, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 26 states:</P>
      <P>In page 19, subsection (13)(<i>a</i>)(ii), line 37, to delete &ldquo;user&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;not less than one half in number of its airline users&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may appear perverse to some people but, to some extent, there is a parallel between what we have just been discussing and what is involved <Col N="839" /> here. As it stands, there is the potential for a certain degree of chaos in section 32(13). It is very important that the cost of regulation would be contained. A mid-term review could significantly increase the cost of regulation and could impose a significant administrative burden on the regulator's office and the regulated entity.</P>
    <P>I accept that a precedent has been set elsewhere which suggests that, for this reason, an interim review should be avoided where possible. However, I also accept that such reviews may be necessary in exceptional circumstances. As a result, I feel it is worth retaining the option of having a mid-term review and my amendment does not oppose that. That said, the legislation should lay down significant hurdles to this costly option and this is where the parallel, to which I referred earlier, comes into play. I am referring to the type of vexatious, mischievous, costly and unnecessary complaints which could have arisen in the previous instance if the regulator were forced, by legislation, to go down to the shop floor. Structures are already in place to deal with those matters.</P>
    <P>The option to hold a mid-term review should be retained although such reviews are frowned upon and discouraged in other jurisdictions. There are exceptional circumstances in which a mid-term review proves necessary and I am calling for the retention of the option to conduct such a review while at the same time calling for the laying down of significant hurdles to such a review.</P>
    <P>If a determination were capable of being reviewed at the request of only one airline, as currently stated in the legislation, a situation could arise whereby an airline with a very small percentage of overall traffic could cause a review of the determination arrived at by the regulator. The review process would impose an unfair cost burden on the majority of carriers who might be quite happy with the prevailing position. It is important that the commission would be satisfied that substantial grounds existed for a complaint before a review would be instigated. If the commission were also to receive a complaint from the airport authority or not less than one half of its airline users, it would be in a better position to gauge the level of discontent and could satisfy itself that a strong case existed for reviewing the determination. That is a very important point.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that only one review would be allowed within the five year period of the determination. We attempted to catalogue the companies involved in this area &ndash; airlines, the airport authority and its users &ndash; when we discussed the Bill last week but the Minister, in her wisdom, advised us not to do so. More than one mid-term review would increase the uncertainty about a company's returns on capital, particularly in a capital intensive area such as airport industry. We are all in favour of promoting viability. I listened to the Senator opposite promote the principles of regional investment and viability. If we are to <Col N="840" /> promote it, we must provide the structures. Senator Ryan articulated the need to provide the structures which enable these risk-taking companies to invest with a relative degree of certainty in the short to mid-term. That is one of the points I am making here. No doubt more than one mid-term review would increase the uncertainty about the company's return on capital. That is logical. It is simple fact.</P>
    <P>It would also impact negatively on the company's cost structure, irrespective of the company involved and whether it operates from Dublin, Shannon, Cork or any of the other airports. This effect would then feed back to customers through increased airport charges. If one imposes fixed charges in any sphere of industrial, commercial or other activity, it is inevitable that the customer will be asked to carry the can. Given the costs in terms of money and time for the industry, having just one review within a period is the only sensible option. I am not suggesting that we should shackle anybody but the business philosophy of the Bill is to the contrary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused. Senator Fitzgerald made a determined effort to explain exactly where he is coming from. If both of his amendments were accepted, the section would provide that the commission may, on or after the expiration of a period of two years after the making of a determination, if it considers that there are substantial grounds for so doing and at the request of an airport authority or not less than one of its airport users concerned in respect of the determination, review the determination and, if it sees fit, amend the determination. In a sense the amendment restricts the commission's freedom to review its determination and I am not sure it would be wise to do so.</P>
      <P>Section 32(13) states that the commission may do so &ldquo;if it considers that there are substantial grounds&rdquo;. If the commission considers that there are substantial grounds, surely we should allow it proceed to review the determination. If we insert &ldquo;and&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;or&rdquo;, we will provide that the commission can do it if there are substantial grounds and, in addition, there is a request from either an airport authority or not less than one half of the users, that is, the airlines using the airport.</P>

      <P>However, the Senator is substituting &ldquo;airline users&rdquo; for &ldquo;users&rdquo;. It would not be enough for the commission to decide that there were substantial grounds. It would also <Col N="841" /> need to bring on board half of the airline users of that particular airport before it could proceed with the review. The Senator's amendment would tie the hands of the commission and restrict it from making a determination if it believes there are substantial grounds. I am not happy that more than half the airline users would need to be brought on board in order to allow the commission to proceed to review the scenario. On balance I would have strong reservations about going down that particular route.</P>

In this case I agree with Senators Taylor-Quinn and Ryan. If I agree to amendment No. 24, it would combine the two scenarios and the regulator could initiate a review only if requested to do so. This would remove his discretionary powers to do so. It would be better to leave the regulator with the discretionary powers to initiate a review so that he would not need to wait until he was requested to do so.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 26 is tied up, as Senators Ryan and Fitzgerald stated, with the definition section, on which we had a long discussion on the last occasion and to which we will return.

      <P>I am not sure that we should allow users to make interminable successive requests. There ought to be a period of time within which a request may not be made. If I raise an issue by way of a motion in the House I cannot raise it again until six months have elapsed.</P>
      <P>The commissioner should be able to make reviews when he or she sees fit but users should not be able to bog down the commission with endless lists of requests for reviews. Therefore, subsection (13) could be tightened up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection states that the &ldquo;Commission may . . .  at the request of an airport authority or user concerned in respect of the determination, review the determination and, if it sees fit, amend the determination&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is not used. It would not be advisable for <Col N="844" /> the legislation to specify that the regulator cannot entertain vexatious or frequent demands for reviews. The use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the legislation allows discretion.</P>
      <P>Sometimes when we draft legislation we forget that it will be applied by reasonable people who are determined to do as good a job as they can. We must try not to be too nit-picking while, at the same time, getting it right. The regulator appears to be a man of good sense. I am sure he will not entertain vexatious reviews. This subsection is to be discussed again on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister but I will not pursue the matter further at this point. There should be a six months' interval between requests by users for reviews. The world will not be so transformed in six months that people cannot wait. Every time a user makes a request the commission will be obliged to devote some time and resources, even to deciding not to entertain the request. Due process will require this. Therefore, there should be a time restriction.</P>
      <P>While the section deals with maximum levels of charges, I am concerned about deals which may be done between airport authorities and individual airlines and the level of transparency which might exist when airlines negotiate deals which involve them paying less than the maximum charges. We must ensure that a level playing field exists, that hard ball operators do not get an advantage or that a publicly owned airline is not forced to subsidise a private airline.</P>
      <P>The legislation merely sets maximum charges. I am happy to have airport authorities negotiate charges but there should be a degree of transparency. This is a difficult area because it involves commercial sensitivities but there is no point having maximum charges if nobody pays them. There is a need for more concern about what charges are actually paid, as distinct from setting maximum charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulator will have the power to set the maximum charges. Aer Rianta, the airport authority, will then deliver on the charges. I cannot understand how cases are made for lowering airport charges. How are the airports to run? Who is to pay for staff, for safety and for all the matters which must be paid for? Aer Rianta recoups only 17% of airport charges for income while airport authorities in the UK recoup 50%. Other activities subsidise airport charges. Until now airport charges were subsidised by duty free sales but that is no longer the case. Nevertheless, some operators appear to think that airports can run on thin air and fancy dreams. They cannot; they must be paid for. The suggestion that the State should subsidise an airline when that airline is making a large profit is mind-boggling. The State cannot contribute from public funds to a private operator's growing profits. I am delighted that companies are profitable but we must remember that airports must be paid for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with what the Minister has said about the provision of proper airport facilities, particularly with regard to reliable safety measures. The provision of these facilities involves a cost factor. It is important that airports are economically viable and are not obliged to cut back on essential services which deal with safety, fire and aircraft in difficulty. These are vital issues that must be given priority by the airport authority. That can only be done if funding is provided. Some airlines are exceptionally successfully while others are not. Some airlines are simply trying to get off the ground.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to elaborate further on the overall charges, particularly on section 32(5)(<i>a</i>)(ii) which states:</P>
      <P>A determination may&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) provide&ndash; . . . . .</P>
      <P>(ii) for limits to apply to particular categories of such charges, . . . . </P>
      <P>I would like to know what is included in this subsection so that the commission will have some idea what the Minister and the Department have in mind. There is also reference to a combination of any such limits. Perhaps the Minister could deal with the &ldquo;particular categories&rdquo; and identify what the Department has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to address the two points raised by Senator Ryan. He is coming a little nearer to what I tried to say in the beginning and perhaps he knows that. I believe, as he does, that there should be a minimum period for reviews and that it should be written into the Bill. As he correctly pointed out &ndash; and we will all keep away from names and labels &ndash; even though the Bill clearly provides that the regulator must have reasonable grounds, there must as a corollary be a duty on the regulator to investigate the grounds and determine whether they are reasonable. He, she or the three man commission may not always be able to decide with the flip of a coin that the grounds are vexatious. For that reason, and to be fair to the regulator and all of the other users, the Minister should seriously consider Senator Ryan's point and agree to a minimum period of review. This would cut down on the potential for daily requests for reviews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>My officials have explained that point to me. It is after two years. The regulator cannot allow a review until after another two years have passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan asked another question about the minimum charge. I too feel strongly about it. The minimum charge can be determined in accordance with the scale of the operation of the applicant for review. It is not up <Col N="846" /> to me to decide how that is done and I cannot articulate how it should be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a minimum charge. If there is no minimum charge far more opportunistic moves will be made by people who want to milk taxpayers' money. For all of the reasons that the Minister and Senator Taylor-Quinn have so forcefully outlined, airports must operate every day and plan ahead. If every review causes a minimum charge and disruption and turns out to be vexatious &ndash; and they will &ndash; then they are taking away from the true potential for growth and expansion of those airports and their ongoing viability. The Minister and Senator Taylor-Quinn made the point very forcefully about the need for a minimum charge. I appeal to the Minister to consider providing for this in the Bill on Report Stage.</P>

    <P>(<i>e</i>) to have due regard to other revenue earned by the airport authority at an airport to which <i>Part 3</i> applies which is derived from services which are not subject to competition.</P>
    <P>(2) In performing its functions the Commission shall take into account the international obligations of Ireland.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill as drafted does not provide for the economic operation or the development of airports. This section is skewed totally in favour of the airlines, particularly given the narrow definition of airport users. That is my personal view and I am sure Senators will express views to the contrary in a few minutes. Perhaps I will have to reconsider. The original definition of airport users, on which there was consensus, should be re-examined. The Minister has made a commitment to do that before Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Under this section the development and operation of airports is based solely on the requirements of the airlines and ignores other interested parties such as the State, passengers, tourism interests, business interests and local communities. The section does not take account of the fact that airports require a long-term planning horizon if they are to deliver capacity in time to meet demand &ndash; a point made in previous amendments to other sections.</P>
    <P>This contrasts with the shorter-term focus of the airlines. Some airlines have such a short-term focus it is as if they are playing leapfrog. Airports must invest in fixed infrastructure while airlines have mobile assets. That is an important distinction on which the Minister and other speakers have elaborated. A reasonable rate of return on capital invested will not provide for the financial viability of the airport.</P>
    <P>The British Act was selectively applied to this section but the fundamental provision necessary for the proper determination of airport charges, as set out in the British airports Act, is not included. Section 39 of the British Act sets out four conditions which the regulator must take into account. It must further the reasonable interests of users of airports in Britain; promote the efficient, economic and profitable operation of the airports, encourage investment in new facilities at airports; satisfy anticipated demand by the users of the airports and impose the minimum restrictions consistent with the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes no provision for the regulator to have regard to existing international agree<Col N="849" /> ments, such as bilateral agreements, the Chicago convention, and ICAO and EEA undertakings. The British Act includes a section similar to the proposed new section which takes these issues into account. The Minister knows better than most that we are tied into international and European civil aviation organisations &ndash; Ireland signed up to international agreements which deal with safety and security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extremely important section because it deals with the purposes to which airport charges are put. The commission has specific responsibilities and, in making decisions on airport charges, must bear in mind the objectives. This section clearly outlines those objectives but they are limited. They are tied into the basic economic and accounting realities &ndash; economic viability and the provision of efficiency and competitiveness, quality of service, operating and other costs, efficient and effective use of resources, reasonable rate of return on capital and the operating and other costs incurred by an airport authority. All those are related to the tight structural management of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While all the conditions listed in section 33 are necessary, there is a need to broaden the remit. Paragraph (<i>h</i>) in amendment No. 33 would achieve that. It reads: &ldquo;(<i>h</i>) the encouragement of investment in new facilities at airports in time to <Col N="850" /> satisfy anticipated demand by the users of such airports,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Liam Fitzgerald's amendment would insert a similar provision. It is important that the idea be taken on board because, unlike airlines, airports must make policy decisions in relation to infrastructural development years in advance of when it will be required. They must anticipate requirements and be in a position to forecast the infrastructural facilities which will be needed at the airport. Unlike airlines, which can change airports, airports are not mobile assets &ndash; they are fixed in one place and can only develop in that place. Consideration must be given to the airport authority in this matter. That is why it is so important to encourage investment in new facilities at airports in time to satisfy anticipated demand by the user. The airport cannot suddenly provide the capacity for an airline which might want to use it, it must be provided in advance. That involves forward planning and strategic thinking on the part of the airport management.</P>
    <P>This section ignores the importance of regional airports. Airports outside Dublin, such as Shannon and Cork, are hugely important to those regions. They are the cornerstones to economic development in tourism and manufacturing in those areas. They have been the means by which communities have promoted their tourism product and manufacturing incentives. Shannon Airport was a major factor in selling areas such as Limerick, Ennis and Shannon and was a huge attraction for drawing investment into the region. It is important these matters are considered when discussing the objectives of airports. That is why I include in the amendment the wording &ldquo;the specific requirements and needs of the regions and the communities where such airports are located&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a cost for airports in providing special facilities for different groupings, especially for the disabled. It is important proper facilities are included in all airports, not just on a token basis but on a much broader basis than has happened heretofore. That should be seen as normal practice. A cost is involved so it is important that the regulator would have the provision of these facilities as an objective. It is very important that airports remain as viable economic entities. The Minister took on board an earlier amendment which dealt with two or more airports being treated as a group rather than singly. That will lend to paragraph (<i>k</i>) of my amendment.</P>
    <P>There is nothing unusual in what I propose. I am sure the Minister and most Members would agree with the thrust of my amendment and I hope she will take it on board. Many of the paragraphs are similar to the paragraphs in the new section proposed by Senator Fitzgerald. The Bill will be improved and strengthened if my amendment is included. The airports and the regions in which they are located will be improved by the inclusion of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had best lay down a marker because there is a difference of view between myself and the Minister and, perhaps, other Members. I do not believe airports should be sinks for public money.</P>

      <P>However, they should not be excessively constrained by a commercial definition of profitability. The Minister's amendment No. 29 states: &ldquo;in the context of a sustainable and profitable operation of an airport&rdquo;. One could almost believe that sustainable and profitable were the same thing. It is sometimes good to invest in airports, even when the short-term prospects are not good, much the same as it is good to invest in road infrastructure in a recession to encourage expansion from the recession.</P>
      <P>I understand the Government has asserted that the EU prevents the State from investing in airports. The Government and the Minister are wrong to say that it is now difficult under EU regulations to invest in airports. I am at a loss to understand why we are going through considerable contortions when a large amount of public money is available which could be used to develop airports. We are trying to figure out what to do with them when what they need most are large injections of capital. There are limited understandings &ndash; Department of Finance understandings &ndash; of what is regarded as an acceptable rate of return and these are very narrow. There are social rates of return on many investments which cannot be measured. It should be remembered that the Department of Finance still believes that education is a social service to help the poor whereas I regard it as an economic investment which produces a vast return to society. There is a fundamental difference of opinion between myself, the Department and, I suspect, the Minister, and it is a similar case as regards this legislation.</P>
      <P>Commercial criteria should be used to adjudicate on airport performance because the bottom line is one of a number of effective ways of examining how people use resources. However, that is not to say that profitability and commercial viability ought to be the dominant criteria for the development of regional or other airports. Therefore, I am concerned by the Minister's definition. One of the reasons I support Senator Taylor-Quinn's amendment is that the concern, especially for disabled passengers, must be moved beyond definitions of commercial performance and must be separated from that. One of the most welcome sights I have seen recently was a front page advertisement from Aer Rianta regarding a certain airline &ndash; we cannot name it &ndash; which distinguished itself by humiliating people by charging £15 for the use of a wheelchair. It has finally been told to behave itself, and not before time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> We need to be careful and it is a matter of how we measure things. I have no problem saying that, most of the time and under most circumstances, airports should be self-financing. However, I would be concerned about that because, whatever the Government or I may say, the good times will not last forever. Some time this country will experience another recession. That is an inevitability and the way market economics and the world work. I would not like us to be constrained by either narrow interpretations of EU regulations or narrowly defined legislation from sustaining regional airports which are and should be instruments to get us out of a recession as well as facilities we provide to assist successful industry. The Minister's amendment further tightens the limited horizon of the commercial focus of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to some of the debate, especially Senator Ryan's contribution. Airports should be sustainable and they should be profitable, especially given the number of people travelling at present and which will certainly increase. That has been aided by competition between airlines. Senator Ryan earlier decried the ethos which applies to business in general. What makes it competitive and efficient is competition. I could not believe it when I heard him decrying it. In section 33, the regulatory authority will have to take into account the cost competitiveness and operational efficiency of airports. I can think of nothing which will give more impetus to that than competition between the various airports. If the Minister can inject that into the system, it will facilitate cost competitiveness and efficiency and will also facilitate the travelling public by ensuring people can travel in a cost competitive way. It is essential that we who live on an island on the west coast of Europe and are a peripheral nation of the EU have competitive transport rates for goods and passengers as compared with the rest of the European Union and the wider world. Rather than decrying competition, we should ask the Minister, where possible &ndash; I know it is difficult &ndash; to ensure maximum levels of competition.</P>
      <P>There is another point on which I disagree with the previous speaker. Regional airports are essential to the economic&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Knock Airport, which is not a regional airport, is seeking investment at present to facilitate economic development at the airport, and that is similar to what Shannon Airport did many decades ago. That is a sensible economic approach to take because it will relieve investment in other areas of infrastructure where the State will not receive a return. It can be argued that there are instances where normal commercial criteria should be set aside in favour of regional development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> It is a complex issue but my main point is that competition is the life of trade and it will also be the life of efficiency and economies of travel in the future as well.</P>

      <P>Yes, but then he went back on it and said we should be putting money into Knock and Farranfore. He debated the two sides of the story as well. We cannot look at these amendments without looking at section 33, which we seem to have ignored. Section 33 lays out that the commission shall aim to facilitate in making its determination the development and operation of cost effective airports which meet the requirements of users and shall have due regard to the various factors laid out there. The amendments are down as if there was not a section 33. I and my colleagues have put forward in section 33 the matters to which the commission should have regard. I will go though the three of them now. Both Senator Liam Fitzgerald and Senator Taylor-Quinn have included in their amendments much of what is in section 33 as if it was not already there.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald's amendment refers to furthering &ldquo;the reasonable interests of users of airports to which <i>section 31</i> applies&rdquo;. If one were to accept that, one would have to take out section 33 because section 33 states the legislative requirements which more or less equate with what both of the Opposition amendments are about, except perhaps the wording would be slightly different in some cases. I will go through some of the others now. We will leave amendment No. 29 for the moment because that is my own amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 30, in the names of Senator Madeleine Taylor-Quinn and Senator Fergus O'Dowd proposes the same matters as are already in section 33, not perhaps in exactly the same words but in much of what is there. On paragraph <i>(j)</i> which proposes the provision of adequate and proper facilities for disabled persons using the airport, Aer Rianta already has by-laws which enabled it to make provision for wheelchair users and access. Like Senator Ryan, I was delighted to see the quarter page advertisement in the <i>Irish Examiner,</i><i>The Irish Times</i> and the<i> Irish Independent</i> and in all of the newspapers, which I think were repeated on Sunday, whereby they set out the by-laws allowing not just for that but making it mandatory that all airlines should provide for that. It is a disgrace that people travelling with airlines were refused wheelchairs for getting on or getting off purposes except where they could pay a charge of £12, or <Col N="854" /> £15 now. In this era of acceptability and equality, if one has special needs then the special needs should become mainstream, not the other way around. They have the power to do that and they have taken it in hand. The Senators will have seen the advertisements as we all did. They have these by-laws to make proper provision and they have already invoked them which is very good. I am delighted they have done so.</P>
    <P>I will return to Senator Liam Fitzgerald's amendment but paragraphs <i>(h)</i> and <i>(k)</i> of amendment No. 30, as I said, are already catered for. On paragraph <i>(i) </i>concerning regional development, Aer Rianta has never had a regional remit as such. It has adopted it but it has not had it in law. The regulator will need to understand what he is to take into account in terms of regional development. Perhaps we could have due regard to the reasonable aviation interests of the regions in which the airports are located or perhaps the contribution of the airports to balanced regional development.</P>
    <P>On paragraph <i>(j)</i> I have spoken about the provisions for disability. They have recently adopted a by-law, statutory instrument 469 of 99. They have requested all airline service providers and other agencies to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the needs of person with a disability by providing special treatment or facilities. We all agree they are right in that.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald's amendment on the commission's international obligations in performing its functions proposes that &ldquo;the Commission shall take into account the international obligations of Ireland&rdquo;. It is very proper that this be accepted because the Senator listed all the obligations to which we subscribe or to which we are members or partners. That section is acceptable and proper. Paragraph <i>(d)</i> of the Senator's amendment states: &ldquo;to impose the minimum restrictions that are consistent with the performance by the Commission of its functions under which <i>sections</i><i>32</i> and <i>33&rdquo;.</i>On Senator Madeleine Taylor-Quinn's amendment, we should do something about the regional remit, whatever way we could incorporate it. Section 33 is reasonable in that it lays down in the legislation what the regulator and the commission should have due regard to and lists those items. We will not be involved in repeating items that are already in the list. Of Senator Fitzgerald's amendment, we would be glad to take paragraph <i>(d)</i> and subsection <i>(2)</i> and in Senator Taylor-Quinn's and Senator O'Dowd's amendments, we wish to examine the regional remit section. It would read something like, &ldquo;the contribution of the airports to balanced regional development&rdquo;. It is particularly important in Shannon and in Cork too because they are pivotal to their regions and to sustained growth and development. An airport is quite central to all that goes on in a huge region. I am thinking particularly of the ongoing march of Shannon airport and its continuation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> That means we will return with it on Report Stage but at last we will have refined it. We are working through the various points put to us and trying to winnow them into manageable proportions and still incorporate them in keeping with the integrity of the Bill. To return to those two amendments, in Senator Fitzgerald's amendment, we are examining paragraph <i>(d)</i> and subsection (2) and in Senator Taylor-Quinn's amendment, we are examining paragraph <i>(i)</i> and trying to achieve a proper wording for that.</P>
    <P>I will go on to the Government amendment, about which there was some concern. I advise Senator Taylor-Quinn that paragraphs <i>(h)</i> and <i>(k)</i> are already in section 33. Paragraph <i>(i)</i> is the regional remit one and the one on which we will try to put a wording. Paragraph <i>(j)</i> is the one they already have concerning the legislative powers to enable them to respond properly to the needs of the disabled or any other group and they have shown good faith of that quite recently in the past week in their ads.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 29 states:</P>
    <P>In page 20, paragraph (<i>b</i>), line 16, after &ldquo;investment,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in the context of the sustainable and profitable operation of an airport,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We should be quite clear. Aer Rianta is keen that this would come from it. Members have a right to know if a draftsman put an amendment forward or if I did. Aer Rianta feels it should receive the level of charges which would allow it to run an airport in a sustainable and profitable operation. I agree with everything the Members said about the need for infrastructure.</P>
    <P>A commercial State company is meant to be able to pay its way &ndash; that is the ethos of a commercial State company &ndash; and not be reliant on hand-outs or payments from the Exchequer. As Senator Ryan said with regard to the growth factor, no matter what the OECD may say about it being in double figures for many more years &ndash; more years than many of us will be around &ndash; there will be a down turn, of that we can all be assured. It will be better for a commercial State company to be used to paying its way and being viable in case the bad times come, although we hope they will not. With regard to amendments Nos. 27 and 30, I will come back with a composite amendment embracing paragraph (<i>i</i>) in Senator Taylor-Quinn's amendment and subsections (1)(<i>d</i>) and (2) in Senator Fitzgerald's.</P>

      <P>This is a particularly important amendment and it should be included in the objectives of the commission because of the anticipatory element of the amendment. We are talking about pre-planning, strategic planning, in terms of putting in place infrastructure which would be ready and available for future development within the airport. We are talking about forecasting and projecting figures in terms of the number of users of and numbers going through the airport and the required facilities to cater for them.</P>
      <P>It is important that the commission encourages the airports to provide and encourage investment in these facilities well in advance of when they are required. It is vital to the amendment tabled by the Minister which reads &ldquo;in the context of the sustainable and profitable operation of the airport&rdquo; to which we have just agreed. The airports can only be sustainable and profitable if investment in new facilities is encouraged in those airports in time to satisfy the demands which will arise. One amendment feeds very easily into the other &ndash; in fact, one depends on the other. They all work in work in tandem. It is in the interests of the Bill to include the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 35 relates to aviation terminal service charges, as the Minister well knows, whereas section 32 relates to airport charges. There is an almost identical provision under section 35(12) for a review of a determination. Without going into it again, I suggest to the Minister that all the issues which arose in regard to the determination and the review of determinations of airport charges ought to be looked at in terms of the determination of aviation terminal service charges as well. Everything that was said would apply here as well and, perhaps, even more so because it would be the airlines&mdash;</P>

      <P>I concur with Senator Ryan regarding the deep discussion we had on airport charges on section 32. The realities are that they almost apply identically because airports refer to airport terminals and I wonder why there was even a need to include the section. Will the Minister elaborate on the specific differences between aviation terminal charges and airport charges? What are the two different categories? What could the commission expect to consider? Will the Minister identify clearly the difference between the two charges?</P>

      <P>The section deals with the regulation of aviation terminal service charges. These are charges for air navigation services provided by the Irish Aviation Authority to aircraft <Col N="860" /> taking off from or landing at Irish airports. Procedures, durations and applicability of charges for determination are similar. The statutory basis for the terminal charges currently levied by the IAA is contained in section 43 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, and associated statutory instruments. The section deals with the IAA and the charges it imposes and I presume the other charges are imposed by Aer Rianta.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 23, before section 38, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;38.&ndash;(1) The persons specified in <i>subsection (2) </i>may appeal to the High Court against a determination or an amendment to a determination made by the Commission pursuant to <i>section 32 </i>or <i>section 35,</i> either in whole or in respect of one or more parts thereof, or a request for information made by the Commission pursuant to <i>section 32</i> or <i>section 35,</i> either in whole or in respect of one or more parts, and the High Court may confirm or modify the determination or amendment or request for information either in whole or in respect of one or more parts making any consequential amendments to the determination or amendment to a determination or a request for information, as the High Court may think fit, or prohibit the Commission from implementing either in whole or in respect of one or more parts <Col N="861" /> thereof, the determination or amendment to a determination or request for information.</P>
    <P>(2) The following persons shall be entitled to take an appeal referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i> above:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) an airport authority, in respect of a determination pursuant to <i>section 32(2),</i> or in respect of an amendment to a determination pursuant to <i>section 32(13),</i> or in respect of a request pursuant to <i>section 32(12)</i>;</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) a person subject to airport charges, in respect of a determination pursuant to <i>section 32(2)</i> or in respect of an amendment to a determination pursuant to<i> section 32(13)</i>;</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) the Authority in respect of a determination pursuant to <i>section 35(2)</i> or in respect of an amendment to a determination pursuant to <i>section 35(12)</i> or in respect of a request pursuant to <i>section 35(11)</i>; and</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) a person subject to airport terminal services charges, in respect of a determination pursuant to <i>section 35(2) </i>or in respect of an amendment to a determination pursuant to <i>section 35(12).</i>(3) A person entitled to take an appeal pursuant to <i>subsection (2)</i> above shall take any such appeal within the following periods:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) in respect of persons referred to in <i>subsection (2)(a)</i> above, the period of 28 days following the date of receipt of notice pursuant to <i>section 32(10)</i> or the date of receipt of a request pursuant to <i>section 32(12),</i> as the case may be;</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) in respect of persons referred to in <i>subsection (2)(b) </i>above, the period of 28 days following the date of publication of the notice referred to in <i>section 32(10)(a)</i>;</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) in respect of persons referred to in <i>subsection (2)(c)</i> above, the period of 28 days following the date of receipt of notice pursuant to <i>section 35(9)(a) </i>or the date of receipt of a request pursuant to <i>section 35(11)</i>; and</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) in respect of persons referred to in <i>subsection (2)(d) </i>above, the period of 28 days following the date of publication of the notice referred to in <i>section 35(9)(a).</i>(4) Notwithstanding an appeal under <i>subsection (1)</i> above by a person specified in <i>subsection (2) </i>and within the time specified in<i> subsection (3),</i> the appeal shall not affect the validity of the determination or amendment to a determination, and its operation unless, upon an application to the High Court, that Court suspends the determination or amendment to a determination until the appeal is determined or withdrawn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> (5) The hearing by the High Court shall be a hearing on the merits of the case and the parties shall be entitled to introduce all relevant matters whether or not those matters were presented to the Commission in relation to its determination, amendment or request.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill only provides for judicial review, which is considered to be quite limited. Both judicial reviews on legal matters and an appeal on factual matters are provided in other regulated areas, such as telecommunications and electricity and I do not understand why there should be different provisions for aviation regulation because of the importance of economic regulation and its impact on the airport authority's income.</P>
    <P>The provision of a statutory appeal will help the commission to determine the airport charges and will provide the affected parties with a forum to resolve any issues in regard to its representations if they feel, for example, that they have not been addressed adequately. Consistent with the Minister's recommendations in the White Paper on Governance and Accountability in the Regulatory Process the section provides that the determination will be effective during any appeal. I propose an appeal process for a rehearing of merits and it should be examined on a much wider basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Another obvious deficit in the legislation is the lack of an appeals mechanism. While a judicial review is a form of appeal, it is laborious, costly and time consuming and is, therefore, not an immediate process. There is a need for something more specific, clear and urgent. An appeals mechanism has been clearly defined in legislation relating to all other semi-State sectors and there is no good reason for not providing a proper appeals mechanism in this legislation. Apart from the opportunity to obtain a judicial review, there is a need to provide an opportunity to appeal to the High Court if an applicant is not satisfied with the commission's determination. The right and freedom to appeal to the courts should be provided for in the legislation. Senator Fitzgerald and I concur in this regard and our amendment proposes such a facility. The Minister should not have a problem with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our amendment relates to a specific and wrong tightening up of the rules in the section. It deals with the attempt to restrict the grounds under which leave to appeal a judicial review may not be granted, which is possible under the Constitution. Section 38(5)(<i>a</i>) currently states: &ldquo;The determination of the High Court of an application for leave to appeal for a judicial review. . . shall be final and no appeal shall lie from the decision of the High Court or the Supreme Court in either case save with the leave of the High Court which leave shall only be granted where the High Court certifies. . . &rdquo;. Our amendment proposes that the Supreme Court <Col N="863" /> should also certify so as to allow for the possibility of the Supreme Court examining the High Court's decision to refuse a judicial review. The Bill provides that if the High Court says &ldquo;no&rdquo; there is no further recourse.</P>
      <P>That is a bad principle, which is envisaged in the Constitution for exceptional circumstances provided for by legislation. It is not the standard position and if the State's attempts to restrict judicial review become standard practice, there will be a restriction on the rights of the citizen in general and section 38(5)(<i>a</i>) is a particular example of it. An attempt to restrict the application of judicial review and to appeal to the Supreme Court is also contained in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999.</P>
      <P>It is an important amendment in terms of the way we deal with judicial review in general. I do not agree with the amendment tabled by Senators Fitzgerald and Taylor-Quinn. There may well be a case for an appeals mechanism against the determination of the commission. That is always interesting but I do not agree with the notion that people could keep going back to the High Court. The list of people set out includes a person subject to airport terminal services charges and a person subject to airport charges. Does that include individual customers, because they sometimes pay? It is wrong that each of those could appeal to the High Court in perpetual motion. That is not what the High Court is for.</P>
      <P>It is not for the High Court to decide prices. If that was the case every time the Minister allowed the ESB to increase its prices &ndash; I am not sure if she still has that power &ndash; I could have appealed to the High Court. That cannot be allowed. It is not the function of the courts to determine such things and to allow that would create an endless quagmire. It must also be borne in mind that at least one of the bodies will be a State organisation, which will use resources that would otherwise be part of the profits it would pay back the State for its investment to continue the process of a merry-go-round of High Court actions. I do not agree with amendment No. 36, nor do I agree with the restriction in section 38 on the right of appeal to the Supreme Court, which is what the amendment in my name is concerned with.</P>

      <P>We may at some stage establish whether Senator Ryan is a social democrat or a social anarchist because I was amazed at his suggestion that the right of citizens to appeal <Col N="864" /> to the High Court should be refused. People and companies do not make appeals to the High Court lightly. However, as a democracy we have basic democratic institutions, principles and rights. I do not see why any group should be discriminated against with regard to their right to appeal to the higher courts. It would be wrong for this House to seek to constrain anybody's right to appeal to the courts.</P>
      <P>The courts are there to administer justice. They are vital in a democracy. Legislation should make it easier for companies and people to appeal to the courts. It would be extraordinary to inhibit or restrict them. The suggestion that powerful companies, such as airport companies, should be restricted in their access to the courts is also extraordinary. All traders, whether they are shopkeepers, grocers or whatever have the right to make appeals to the courts on matters such as over or under charging. Individual owners of airlines should not be discriminated against because of their supposed privileged or unique position. That is normal democratic procedure and it is wrong for legislation to inhibit that right. I urge Senator Ryan to reconsider his views on this fundamental principle of freedom in a democracy.</P>

      <P>It appears that amendment No. 38 seeks to provide for an appeal on the merits and for judicial review. It would be bad to provide for an appeal to the courts.

There should be an appeals mechanism but the idea that the High Court, which is already swamped with work with consequent delays of 18 months to two years, would be the vehicle for appealing aviation service charges or airport charges generally is ludicrous.

      <P>This section is extremely important. Authorised officers must be in a position to do the work required by the commission and the section deals in great detail with this area. The powers provided in it are similar to those <Col N="868" /> given to the CAB and perhaps they are too strong. In the process of selecting those officers, regard must be had to the suitability of the applicants. They should not operate as a type of Gestapo force and behave in a manner which is totally over the top. A certain amount of common sense and balance in terms of how the legislation is applied is extremely important. For example, the section gives an authorised officer the power to enter a premises or place owned or occupied by a person at any reasonable time. Who will determine what is reasonable?</P>
      <P>There is a need for common sense. In the process of carrying out their duty, the authorised officers should take an approach that is reasonable and fair. It should not be heavy handed as in other instances. Much depends on the type of person selected for the job and there should be an in-house training course on how the officers should deal with their respective clients.</P>

      <P>Why would a body, which has a function of setting charges, need the power to enter any premises, require people to produce books or documents and secure for later inspection any premises or part thereof in which books, documents or records are kept, etc.? They are similar powers to those attached to a search warrant, although the section states later that an officer cannot enter a private dwelling. These are not powers to investigate an offence. They appear to be powers that the commission can exercise when it wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it should include a reasonable ground such as where it believed it had been refused information which it needed or believed information had been withheld. I may have missed something in the section but it appears the commission can do it if it wishes. However, to take such action, an agent of the State should at least have reasonable cause based on some suspicion of some wrongdoing. It should not be the case that officers of any State agency can enter premises and take such action simply as a way of gathering information for their own convenience. They can ask for the information and if they believe information has been withheld, then they can use these powers. As it stands, there is no <Col N="869" /> caveat that there must be a reason for the action other than inclination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no inclination. How could that be the case? The House passed the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998, which allowed for authorised officers. If officers feel that information is being withheld, they can act. I am sure such a situation will not arise, but provision must be made for it. If there is a suspicion that information is being withheld, an officer should be able to get it.</P>

      <P>The Bill amends the Third Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act which states that clauses on confidentiality in legislation shall not be regarded as interfering with the operation of the Freedom of Information Act. There is a list of legislation where such clauses arise and it states that for the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act the clauses on confidentiality shall not apply in those cases. It would be better to also mention the commission in the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes to insert &ldquo;in paragraph 1(2) of the First Schedule, by the addition of &lsquo;the Commission for Aviation Regulation'           &rdquo;. This means the commission for aviation regulation would be referred to in the First Schedule as a body covered by the Freedom of Information Act, like many other bodies, and in the Third Schedule of this Bill and its provisions for confidentiality would not be regarded as preventing the operation of the Freedom of Information Act. It seems inconsistent to refer to the legislation in the Third Schedule and not to refer to the commission in the First Schedule.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann urges the Minister for Finance to introduce further measures to encourage the development of Ireland's high-tech industries and in particular, to allow further tax concessions to employees of software businesses to enable them to compete with international software companies.</P>
      <P>This motion addresses an issue of great concern to many people who are employed in Ireland's new economy. I refer to high-tech industries in general, but particularly to the software packaging industry. I received representations from the Irish Software Association and from young people involved in the software industry which expressed the view that even though the industry is prospering it is in danger. This country has profited enormously from the software industry and benefited greatly from the presence of multinationals. We have capitalised on and exploited the great investment that has been made but, due to our current tax regime, the industry is in danger because it will not be able to expand in the future and is currently unable to attract and retain the personnel it requires.</P>
      <P>What is ironic about this industry and the new economy is that neither lacks financial capital. There is plenty of money available for investment but there is a lack of intellectual capital. The software industry in Ireland is facing a human resources crisis. One need only consider the staff turnover rate of 20% to realise that the industry is incapable not only of attracting young talented people but also of retaining them. The reason for this is difficult to define. However, if the software industry is to flourish, we must ensure that companies are in a position to retain the staff they attract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems the industry faces is the fact that it is losing competitiveness. Wages are rising by 15% and, as the Minister of State will be aware, those involved in high-tech industries quite rightly do not give two hoots about the Minister for Finance's partnership agreement or the national pay deal. As a result of the skills shortage in Ireland, wages are constantly on the increase and we are losing competitiveness and personnel because people are moving abroad and staying there. Despite the high salaries on offer <Col N="873" /> in Ireland, the peripheral attractions are not as great as those abroad.</P>
    <P>The software, computer and other high-tech industries are global in nature and cannot be treated in isolation. Multinationals do not remain in a country any longer than necessary. If these companies do not like the circumstances in which they are obliged to operate, they do not announce that they are departing but merely cease operations and leave on slippered feet at dawn.</P>
    <P>The major difficulty in attracting and retaining suitable personnel revolves around the question of shares and share options. We must find a way to match the rewards on offer overseas if we are to retain the people who work in these global industries. I refer to the rewards offered by Microsoft, Oracle, Symantec and other multinationals which move their operations around the world in search of cheap and efficient labour. In the United States these companies reward their employees by giving them stock options.</P>
    <P>I do not wish my intentions to be misconstrued. Stock options have been totally abused by the banks in Ireland and by people who work at the highest level in companies here. They have been given willy-nilly to people at the top and they have not been distributed on a democratic basis to those at lower levels. The Government cannot direct that stock options should be given to employees, but it is in a position to make the giving of such options easier. If stock options are democratically distributed among the workforce they will provide people with a great incentive to remain in the industry. Between 98% and 100% of Microsoft's Irish staff possess stock options. These provide them with a great incentive to work, they offer them an opportunity to profit and they tie them in to the company because of the possibility of future rewards.</P>
    <P>The concept of offering stock options is good provided those options are distributed on a democratic basis. There is nothing the Government can do to force companies to introduce stock option schemes but it can alter the tax regime to make them more attractive to employees. The difficulty with stock options in Ireland is that they are subject to income tax at the top rate of 44%, whereas they are taxed at a much lower rate overseas. It is not a great incentive to offer someone in Ireland stock options to take up employment or to remain in their job, particularly in view of the rate of tax which applies to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will have been lobbied <i>ad nauseam</i> by the Irish Software Association and others on this matter. I suggest that the rate of tax which applies to stock options should be reduced from 44% to the capital gains tax rate of 20%. That makes a great deal of sense because once they are exercised stock options become shares. I am aware that various Ministers are in favour of doing this. If we reduce the rate of tax which applies to stock options, we will put an end to the extraordinary haemorrhage of labour out of the software industry. If stock options were <Col N="874" /> taxed at 20%, there would be no incentive for employees to move to the US or another country with a far more benign tax regime.</P>
    <P>The main problem the software industry faces involves the shortage of labour. I understand that 24,000 people are employed in this industry, which makes a contribution of £4 billion to the economy. The fact that 40% of technological investment in Europe last year occurred in Ireland is evidence of the importance of this sector. It is vital for our economy that this sector is nourished and nurtured and that we do not risk companies moving because they cannot get staff or staff moving because they cannot get companies. This is a real problem.</P>
    <P>After the US, Ireland is the second largest producer of software packages in the world. We are in a particularly strong position in this area but the danger is that because our tax policy is forcing companies to remain small, they will move out of the country because they are unable to make that jump of scale.</P>
    <P>There would be great spin-off benefits from the Government making a concession of this kind. We would certainly attract Irish emigrants back into the country. I am aware of many cases in which Irish people working abroad have been offered jobs here with stock options but they will not come back because of our tax regime.</P>
    <P>If this concession were made, we would be able to compete globally and companies' cash-flow would improve. Stock options do not have immediate cash-flow or profit implications for a company. The manner in which they are treated in accounting terms is very controversial because there is a dilution of certain shares; stock options do not go through the profit and loss account as many people think they should. Stock options offer companies a very cheap method of financing their employees.</P>
    <P>We should start to look at more radical ways of paying our employees rather than at national pay deals. Anyone who has worked in a software company, either at management or staff level, will know that the global situation is so critical that it is the people who are out of work who are dictating the pace to management. If a job is advertised in this industry, it is the prospective employees who will decide the job conditions, not the employers. The situation has become so critical that prospective employees are interviewing employers. The first question they ask is not about the salary as that is peripheral, rather they ask whether they will have car parking, share options or other benefits. These benefits are critical in this industry which is experiencing staff shortages worldwide.</P>
    <P>Microsoft, which is based in Stillorgan Industrial Park, had 180 vacancies for very well paid jobs at one stage this year. It now has 60 vacancies. The company offers stock options to all its employees but, because of the tax position, that is not even a sufficient incentive to attract or retain employees. Microsoft even recruits at the airport and the fact that it finds it difficult to fill vacanc<Col N="875" /> ies is a prime example that stock options do not necessarily mean access to the gravy train. One of the criticisms made of offering stock options to employees is that they get on the gravy train but that is really only true of the people in top positions.</P>
    <P>Microsoft employees are &ldquo;out of the money&rdquo; because they were given share options at very high levels and will not actually make money for a long time until the shares climb to the price at which they were allocated. Microsoft shares have fallen in value since its employees were given share options. Share options do not necessarily lead to the gravy train but they are a means of keeping employees on board, providing them with an incentive and making the industry a more permanent element of our booming economy.</P>
    <P>The principle advanced in the motion should not be exclusively applied to the software industry. It should be applied to all sectors of the e-commerce and computer industry and there is no reason it should not be extended to all industries. There is nothing wrong with providing tax concessions to boost these industries and there is nothing wrong with paying people in a different way to the rigid straitjacket we have imposed on ourselves through the pay deal.</P>
    <P>I understood that preparations were being made to provide for a concession of this sort in the Finance Bill but, for reasons of which I am unaware, that did not happen. I thought there was a real possibility that the concession would be included in the subsequent Finance Bill and perhaps that may yet happen. However, I do not think it was necessary for the Government to introduce an amendment of this kind, the tone of which is so unhelpful and wishy-washy that it leads me to believe that the Government is perhaps still being dictated to by the so-called social partners rather than following its own ideological, thrusting and sometimes refreshing attitude to the economy.</P>
    <P>The amendment reads &ldquo;. . . acknowledges the support the Government already gives to industry generally. . . &rdquo;. That is so nonsensical, meaningless and unnecessary as to be insulting to the House. The phrase is complete hogwash. It goes on to read &ldquo;. . . including the high-tech sector, and supports the work being undertaken on the tax treatment of employee financial participation by the Consultative Committee. . . &rdquo;. The answer to all our problems is some consultative committee established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. We are back to the social partners. The Government wants to let IBEC and ICTU consider this matter and arrive at a solution to which the Government will agree.</P>
    <P>We need a decisive Government decision on this issue. All we need is for the Government to decide that this would be good for the software industry, its employees and the country as a whole. Yet, the Government is incapable of accepting this type of motion without sending it off to Peter Cassells, John Dunne or someone <Col N="876" /> else who will come back with some sort of solution in November. That is a ridiculous attitude and is uncharacteristic of the Minister for Finance who is usually capable of making a decision and sticking to it. To refer an issue as important as this one to such a neutered committee is shameful. We need to look after the software industry and allow it the opportunity to compete. Its hands are currently tied by our punitive tax laws which are worse than those anywhere in the world and it will not be able to compete if we continue along this road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Senator Ross is to be congratulated for tabling this motion which, although it may not have wide popular appeal, certainly addresses a significant element in our economy. I share Senator Ross's dismay at the Government's amendment although he may have attacked it in a more trenchant manner than is politic. I would hope that the Government might at this stage be prepared to reconsider its amendment, as has happened on a number of occasions in the past when it listened to the case made on this side of the House and decided that it was to the national advantage not to move a divisive amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross has analysed the amendment and has shown that it is really rather weak. It betrays the insecurity that anything which might be construed as mildly critical must be bad. In fact the motion does not tie the Minister to anything. It only urges him to do something for which there is an unbeatable argument. I do not wish to be as trenchant as Senator Ross, but the amendment is fairly vapid. It does not really betray a genuine anxiety on the part of Government other than a feeling that it must amend the motion. This may be the case because there is an innate conservatism, to which I refer without ill will, in the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The motion is important because, as Senator Ross stated, Ireland is in an extraordinary position in the software business. Ireland is the second largest exporter of software after the United States of America. When I was told this the other day, I could not believe it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a remarkable phenomenon. I knew that Ireland is the largest contributor in Europe &ndash; Ireland produces 80% of the software products for Europe. It is an astonishing phenomenon. It is part of the Celtic tiger economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only today I heard somebody on the wireless say that perhaps the Celtic tiger might start suffering from mad tiger disease. Perhaps this may happen. There are vulnerabilities and we would be foolish if we were too cocky to acknowledge them. This a perfect industry for this island nation because the product is so easily exported electronically. Even if it is exported physically, these elements of the industry are light and the transport difficulties of an island are obviated. In <Col N="877" /> addition, Ireland has a highly sophisticated workforce, but we could easily lose them and Senator Ross brilliantly demonstrated exactly how this could happen.</P>
    <P>Unlike Senator Ross, I have not been lobbied extensively. I have been lobbied by one person, Senator Ross. To show what a remarkable mind he has, I have actually been led to understand all this stuff about share options and the difficulty under which we are ignorantly placing our people by taking a negative attitude towards share options. It is simply the practice of allocating shares to employees in a company in order that they become part-owners. That is obviously good for morale. As the value of the company increases the value of the shares increase, although, as Senator Ross pointed out, sometimes because of the stock market fluctuations one can appear temporarily at least to have backed a loser. If one makes people owners, they will behave differently and will tend to stick around because they have a vested interest in the success of the company.</P>
    <P>In many countries the situations are different because share options are taxed much more leniently. This will act as a vacuum, sucking people away from Ireland. Coupled with that is the problem of wage inflation, which can be addressed partly by the concealed benefit of share options. Staff turnover rates in the industry in Ireland are running at 20%, and annual salary inflation is more than 15% in the average case and significantly higher for key staff. One can compare this to some rather interesting and curious statistics form some other countries which surprised me. Ireland's salary inflation of 15% compares with levels in Italy of 6% in 1998 and 6% in 1999 also, and similar rates of inflation applied in France and Germany. If we do not use this mechanism to correct that disparity, Ireland will place itself at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Although companies require capital, nowadays it is far easier to get because the capital markets are fairly fluid. Many companies in this sector find that financial capital is easier to secure and retain than the right kind of human capital. The software industry believes correctly that the remuneration of staff needs to be restructured in such a way as to reward innovation and commitment and to encourage longer tenure in companies. We must secure Ireland's capacity to compete globally. Senator Ross did not quite put a price tag on it but, as I understand it, the Irish Software Association has been looking for a reduction in the tax on share options from 40% to 20%. This would allow the sector to compete globally.</P>
    <P>Fruit of the Loom used to be based in Donegal and it was a big employer &ndash; Senator Bonner would know about this. I have just returned from Morocco and the Moroccans are delighted with themselves because due to low wage costs they have been able to attract Fruit of the Loom there. We have lost it. This is already starting to happen in the software industry and that is the first indication that something may be going wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> We have already had a parallel experience. The lowering of corporation tax for multinational corporations, for example, has led to a huge boom in Ireland and it is obvious that the lowering of tax on share options might well have a further significant impact on this important industry. In the old days I was so involved in the tourism industry that to give it a boost I used to say that it was one of the most significant engines driving the economy and I am glad to say that has turned out to be the case. It is obvious that now the most significant engine driving the economy is the software business. An American is quoted as saying that Silicon Valley is the economic engine of the world and options are the fuel. We ought to learn from them. The Americans are not sentimentalists. They know exactly what they are about when it comes to business. They recognise that if they want to develop the industry they need to give an appropriate reward.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ross said, most of the greatest names in the information technology business are located in Silicon Valley &ndash; Hewlett Packard, Netscape, Yahoo, Sun, etc. In 1997, they got £3.6 billion in venture capital investment and Silicon Valley accounted for $40 billion in exports or 40% of that nation's electronic exports. It has actually surpassed Detroit as the leading exporter in the nation. It has grown this industry largely because it has given this benefit of share options where a penal tax code is not in operation.</P>
    <P>I like to think of myself as something of a socialist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do like champagne. I also like smoked salmon so I suppose I am a smoked salmon socialist. It might appear that we are giving to the rich but that is not necessarily the case. We are certainly not taking from the poor in order to give this tax break. We are creating a situation which allows us to compete with the rest of the world. This is one of the most valuable things the Government could do.</P>
      <P>If this tactic is permitted by the Government, the software industry believes it will be able to double employment in the sector to 40,000 by 2002, there will be a five-fold increase in indigenous exports to £2 billion and there will be software exports of £10 billion. The industry's ability to harness the necessary human capital to fulfil this potential for growth is undermined seriously by escalating pay rates. If the biggest threat to the industry goes unchallenged, Ireland's ability to achieve the national goal set out for the sector will be limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great pleasure in supporting this important motion. This is a significant industry. There are 24,000 people employed in it and it contributes £4 billion to the economy generally. Over 40% of technology related foreign direct investment in Europe has come to Ireland. I thought Ireland was the second largest exporter of software but I have obviously been overtaken <Col N="879" /> by events because Ireland is now the largest. Despite the example of the lowering of corporation tax rates in a parallel industry, we are perhaps allowing our innate conservatism in these matters to put a splinter in the paw of the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Senator Ross on this foresight in putting this motion before the House. In the light of the fact that there is so little competitive language between the motion and the amendment, I hope the Government will be able to withdraw the amendment so that the motion can be passed. The motion merely urges the Government. It ties it to nothing. I saw the grim little shake of the head which passed between the Minister and Government Senators &ndash; let us have that on the record of the House. The Government may rue this day.</P>
    <P>I hope we do not have to put this matter to a vote. In any case, thanks to Senator Ross we have fired an opening shot in an important battle to ensure that this aspect of the Celtic tiger continues to thrive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this debate. It is also my hope that we do not have a division on this question and that the Opposition Senators will support the amendment when they hear why we propose it.</P>
      <P>I am saddened to hear Senator Norris refer to the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State as conservative. One of the reasons for our opposition to this motion is that tax concessions to employees of software businesses would not be sufficient. Our challenge in the software industry is to look at the overall picture.</P>
      <P>A survey of e-business has been carried out by ISME, the organisation which represents small and medium sized businesses. Of the 16 recommendations arising out of the survey, none refers to profit sharing or share option schemes as being necessary to retain employees. Senator Ross may argue that this is because ISME members are mostly small private companies. However, there are many other measures which the Government has taken, is taking and proposes to take to support the industry in recognition of its importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has established an interdepartmental committee to oversee the area of e-commerce and the software industry. The Department of Public Enterprise, the Revenue Commissioners, and the Departments of the Taoiseach, Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment have participated in putting supports in place to encourage the development of high-tech industries. The Department of Public Enterprise has undertaken a huge programme of investment in infrastructure. It has been involved in the liberalisation of the telecommunications market. We have been successful in setting up global crossing deals and many advanced communication infrastructure projects and corporate infrastructure projects are under way, with an advisory committee on tele<Col N="880" /> communications. We have recognised that without the infrastructure in place, Ireland cannot retain high-tech industries. This is one of a number of measures we have initiated under the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has introduced the IT 2000 project which is running in schools in partnership with businesses. This project will educate young people, starting at the beginning and giving young people the information and knowledge necessary to become the software programmers, systems analysts and business analysts who will be needed to run this business. Some 95.2 million were provided for additional third level places in e-commerce and software development.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has worked very closely with overseas enterprises and with IDA Ireland, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta in attracting businesses and maintaining very strong links with businesses which have been in place in Ireland. I cite the example of Digital, which was established in Galway 28 years ago. The company has since been taken over and still operates as a software house based in Galway, providing employment to almost 1,000 people. At one stage as many as 1,700 people were employed in Galway in that industry.</P>
    <P>This debate is not merely about tax concessions for employees. That may hold employees but if companies are not there, tax concessions for share options will not make a difference. The tax implications are only part of the question. One of the nice things about the software business and the high-tech industries is the possibility they afford of businesses operating in a very flexible manner. This flexibility will allow working tele-working, working from home or from remote locations, flexible working hours, mothers' hours, job sharing and a partnership approach which can tailor the workplace into something which is more family-friendly and, therefore, more employee-friendly.</P>
    <P>Many people who choose to return home to Ireland do so because of our quality of life and because they want to bring up their children in the environment in which they grew up. They want to bring their children to their local schools and local areas. We must encourage the additional supports necessary &ndash; and not just in the taxation area &ndash; to extend the environments in which employees can work.</P>
    <P>We are not simply looking at tax concessions to employees in software businesses. Tax concessions will not be sufficient to attract and maintain business or the human resources necessary to keep our competitive edge. We must look at the broader issue. The Government and the Minister for Finance are doing that. To call the Minister a conservative is a joke, but I am glad Senator Norris has found another way of bringing humour to the debate.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for our success in this area has been our openness to change and new ideas. <Col N="881" /> The Government, through the consultative committee and in the commitment given in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, intends to ensure that we will look not only at the way tax treatment of employees' financial participation can be improved but also at the wider picture. We must examine the opportunities to mould new ways of working and to develop the market so that the people who would work in this industry will stay in Ireland, regardless of tax concessions. As with any investment which people choose to make, a tax concession is never a good enough reason.</P>
    <P>We are not taking a narrow focus. Our approach will be broad and we will be open minded. We will use our opportunities to develop family-friendly workplaces and an environment which allows families to grow up with the quality of life which those who live and work in Ireland have come to expect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have witnessed the growth of the software industry from very humble beginnings in the early 1980s. This has been a unique experience. I have happy memories of visiting San José, the capital of Silicon Valley and the birthplace of dozens of the most powerful and successful companies, such as Hewlett Packard, IBM, Intel and so on. Thousands of smaller companies which are also successful in their own right have been established there.</P>
      <P>When I visited the valley in 1985 I was part of a delegation led by the then Lord Mayor of Dublin who is now Taoiseach. Dublin had been twinned with San José in 1984. At that stage we had no great knowledge of the computer industry. Before we went to San José we went on a fact finding mission and visited three companies in Dublin that were mostly involved in hardware. I did not know the difference between hardware and software then. That shows how little knowledge we had.</P>
      <P>The delegation was aware that computer graduates from Trinity were finding employment in the valley. We hoped that when they became decision makers in their industry that they would remember Ireland and establish a base here. That was the delegation's main objective during our visit to the valley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the House a flavour of how far behind Ireland was in the software industry. We had no IDA representative in San José. IDA representatives were based in San Francisco. On a number of occasions the IDA had endeavoured to secure an interview with the management of IBM, one of the major players at that time, but they were completely ignored. Fortunately, the mayor of San José was very favourably disposed towards Ireland and he arranged a lunch where the Taoiseach and I sat at the same table as the vice-president of IBM. During lunch the vice-president told us that he was responsible for all of IBM's business in North and South America. That put us in our place. We were there to make a case for this very small island. We told him <Col N="882" /> about the progress we were making and that a number of our graduates had found employment in Silicon Valley. To our amazement he said, &ldquo;If what you tell me about Ireland is true then why have you not joined the Common Market?&rdquo;  Ireland joined the Common Market 13 years earlier in 1972. He was a bit embarrassed when we told him that. But then he took out his business card, handed it to the IDA representative and said we could have an hour of his time whenever we wished. IBM is now one of the biggest players in the Irish software industry. On the last occasion President Clinton visited Ireland he went to Gateway 2000 and announced that there were 200 American firms operating out of Ireland. From a very humble beginning our computer industry has mushroomed.</P>
    <P>The software industry has grown to become one of the most important sectors of our economy. As Senator Ross said, it employs 24,000 people and contributes £4 billion to the economy annually. We are now the second largest producer of packaged software, just behind the United States. This is an amazing achievement. Silicon Valley grew from a small apricot farming community to be the powerhouse of the world's computing industry. Who would have thought that, at the start of this millennium, Ireland would be the second largest exporter of software in the world?</P>
    <P>At present the industry is facing significant challenges and that is what this motion is about. The average turnover in employees is approaching 20%. The percentage is significantly higher in key staff areas. I have some experience of the financial sector and I am aware that it too has a huge turnover in staff. Companies are giving people bonuses so that they will still be with them in six months' time. Measures must be put in place to keep staff in key industries. As Senator Norris has said, it is now easier to secure financial capital than to retain the type of human resource capital that is needed. Who would have thought that this could happen in Ireland, that human resources would be a problem rather than capital? This is what is happening in the computer industry.</P>
    <P>Remuneration of staff must be constructed in such a way as to reward innovation and commitment and to encourage longer tenure in companies. The Irish Software Association recommends that this could be done through the effective taxation of share option schemes at 20%, the rate of capital gains tax. Taxation of share options should be a single event taking place when shares are sold off. If this measure is not put in place then it will seriously hamper the growth of the Irish software industry by encouraging the movement of employees and development to lower taxation economies.</P>
    <P>Share options are widely believed to have played a huge part in the success of Silicon Valley. Granting share options is the practice of allocating shares to employees in a company so that they become part owners. As the value of the company increases the value of the shares can <Col N="883" /> increase dramatically. Employees have a vested interest in the success of their own company.</P>
    <P>If this measure can lead to the continued success of Ireland as a major player in the software industry then I concur with the sentiments expressed in the motion. </P>

      <P>I thank Senator Ross for raising this important issue this evening. I would be surprised and disappointed if Senator Ross, in the context of what he said earlier, considered me to be a conservative. Not much has been said about my senior colleague, the Minister for Finance. Some things have been said about me. Conservatives are afraid of being innovative and we are not afraid of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to what Senator Ross has had to say about a number of things over the past three years since the Government came to power. The Minister and I have talked to every group and organisation that wanted to meet us. We have looked at the opportunities that exist in the hi-tech industry and we have made many changes over the past three budgets. I am not saying that we have done everything. Perhaps we can give more consideration to the industry. I have an open mind on this matter.</P>
      <P>I firmly believe that the more ownership an employee feels he has within an organisation the greater the success potential for that organisation. This principle works. It is one mechanism we can use to move from State owned monopolies to the more competitive arena.   </P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to outline the supportive stance which this Government is already taking in the case of Irish industry, including the high-tech sector, both through direct expenditure and via the tax system. Successive Administrations over recent years have facilitated the creation of a positive business environment for industry in Ireland which is attracting an increasing level of private investment. I know that a Senator was not happy with this development earlier in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In comparison to other European countries, Ireland offers an attractive package of financial incentives combining a supportive tax policy and the provision of grants towards start-up costs. The Government is also conscious of the need, in an <Col N="884" /> increasingly competitive and global business environment, to adopt new ideas to maintain Ireland as an attractive location for investment and also to encourage an enterprise culture. All of this is relevant in the context of what we are discussing here. We must look at the overall picture.</P>
    <P>Apart from attracting overseas investment, the Government is committed to supporting the development of the indigenous sector through Enterprise Ireland which provides a one-stop-shop for industry. Over the life of the national development plan a total of £3.8 billion will be spent on measures to ensure Ireland remains an attractive location for investment under the Productive Sector Operational Programme. Some £1.9 billion will be spent on research, technological development and innovation and £1.9 billion on industry.</P>
    <P>The recently launched £560 million technology fund will support advanced research in strategic technologies, particularly the development of world class capabilities in niche areas of information technology and biotechnology. This investment should ensure that Ireland remains one of Europe's most attractive locations for knowledge based and innovative high-tech investments.</P>
    <P>In July 1998, following detailed negotiations, the Government reached an agreement with the European Commission for the introduction of a single 12.5% rate of corporation tax across the board. The timetable to achieve this rate is set out in domestic legislation. Members will be aware that the rate from 1 January 2000 will be 24%, from 1 January 2001 it will be 20%, from 1 January 2002 it will be 16% and from 1 January 2003 it will be 12.5%. These rates apply generally to trading income. A 25% rate applies in the case of non-trading income.</P>
    <P>In order to assist small and medium-sized enterprise the Government decided in the recent budget to bring forward the 12.5% rate for small and medium enterprises. The 12.5% now applies to small and medium-sized enterprise whose total trading profits do not exceed £50,000 per annum. This is a significant benefit for such enterprises, many of which would include firms in the software sector. Successive Governments have supported the policy of reducing the tax burden on labour and capital and this has helped us to achieve the vast growth rates we see today. It is, of course, only one of the many factors that have made our economy competitive, the most important being the skills and acumen of our businesses and employees.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that EU considerations have begun to impinge more and more on the national tax policy initiatives of member states. The most direct impact arises from the EU treaty on state aids. While these treaty provisions have been in existence since the treaty was signed, the European Commission has in recent years begun to take a more active role in its application to taxation matters. State aid, as such, is not prohibited as the Commission may grant exemptions or clearance for certain schemes, for example, for <Col N="885" /> areas lagging behind in terms of their economic development.</P>
    <P>Consequently, in relation to the intent of the Senators' motion, which calls for the provision of specific tax reliefs for the high-tech sector, one must be mindful of EU state aid rules. Any proposal for a tax concession will have to be considered in the context of a relief that will have general application rather than specifically applying to the software sector. I appreciate, however, that the Senator was driven by particular difficulties arising in the software sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of what he says applies across the board.</P>
      <P>Income tax reductions are an important part of the Government's strategy to maintain and improve competitiveness and to encourage the take up of employment. The last three budgets have seen major progress made in taxation policy. The standard and top rates of income tax have been reduced to 22% and 44% respectively and the Government is committed to reducing these rates further. The Government also recognises the need to focus the tax system on the low paid and a national minimum wage of £4.40 per hour was introduced in April. A commitment has been made as part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to exempt, over time, all of those on the minimum wage from tax. Increases in the personal and PAYE allowances since 1997 have also removed approximately 176,000 low paid persons from the tax net, including 40,000 elderly people. This ensures that no income tax is paid on incomes of less than £110 per week. These income tax changes have resulted in very significant increases in the net pay of all employees, including those in the software area.</P>
      <P>The Irish tax system already contains a number of supports for employee share schemes and recent Finance Acts have significantly improved these tax reliefs. The aim of providing tax concessions for employee share schemes is to encourage such schemes, thereby increasing the level of partnership in the firm, improving the performance of the company, its profitability and widening share ownership. The Government is fully committed to employee share schemes and profit sharing as means of fostering partnership at the level of the enterprise. I share the view that greater employee share ownership and profit sharing can also be ways to help Irish industry to be more flexible and to meet the challenges of the global economy by tying wages more closely to performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently three main types of tax relieved employee share relief schemes &ndash; the approved profit sharing schemes, employee share ownership plans and save as you earn share option schemes. Tax relief for approved profit sharing schemes has been available in Ireland for the past 18 years. There are 343 such schemes in existence. These profit sharing schemes must be approved by the Revenue Commissioners and an employee may receive from his or her employer <Col N="886" /> up to £10,000 of shares per annum free of income tax. One of the major conditions of the scheme is that the shares should be held for at least three years. These schemes have become increasingly popular in recent years and 47 new schemes were approved by the Revenue Commissioners for the year to 5 April 2000.</P>
    <P>Employee share ownership trusts are intended to operate in tandem with an approved profit sharing scheme. Shares must be made available from the employee share ownership trust via an approved profit sharing scheme. The employee share ownership trust, however, can obtain finance by borrowing from the employer company or from a bank, receive dividends and sell shares, as well as take contributions from the employer company. The ESOT can hold shares for much longer periods &ndash; up to 20 years &ndash; than an approved profit sharing scheme, which must distribute the shares to participants within 18 months of receiving them.</P>
    <P>The amount of shares that can be appropriated to each employee tax efficiently from an employee share ownership trust is generally a maximum of £10,000 per annum. In certain circumstances this figure can, on a once off basis, be increased to £30,000 where shares have been held as security for borrowings. To date there is one approved share ownership trust &ndash; Eircom. The Revenue Commissioners also have a number of other applications on hand.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1999, introduced tax reliefs for savers who are in share option schemes. There are two aspects to this relief. The first element is an approved savings related share option scheme which is offered by employers and can include a discount of up to 25% on the price of the shares when the option is granted. There is no income tax liability on the discount. The second element is a certified contractual savings scheme which is the means used to save the money to buy the shares. Members of a scheme must save for a three or five year period. Individuals who save for a five year period may leave their savings on deposit for a further two years. Employees can save between £10 and £250 per month and any bonus or interest on the savings is paid free of tax. The save as you earn legislation does not require employees to purchase the shares at the end of the savings period. This ensures that employees would not be forced to buy shares where the price of the shares had fallen below the offer price. To date, 32 companies have been approved by the Revenue Commissioners to operate the SAYE schemes and these companies employ 35,000 people. In addition, 29 companies have submitted preliminary documentation to the Revenue Commissioners for consideration and these are currently being examined. It is not as bleak a picture as Senator Ross suggests.</P>
    <P>Recent Finance Acts have improved the attractiveness of employee share schemes and the number of such schemes has increased substantially. The amount of shares that can be appropriated to each employee tax efficiently was increased from £2,000 to £10,000 per annum. The period for which shares must be held to avail of tax reliefs has been reduced from five years to <Col N="887" /> three years. The Government also made significant changes to the tax rules on share options in this year's Finance Act. The main change that employees in the computer industry are seeking is to remove entirely the income tax charge on share option schemes in order that the only tax liability would be capital gains tax charged on any gain on disposal.</P>
    <P>Under current rules, where a share option is granted to an employee, he or she is charged income tax at the marginal rate on the difference between the price paid and their market value at the end of the exercise. Following the enactment of the Finance Bill, 2000, on 23 March, this income tax liability can now be deferred until the shares are sold or for seven years, whichever occurs earlier. This deals with the situation in which employees were forced to sell shares to pay the tax. The tax change makes it easier for employees to acquire and hold shares. When the shares are disposed of the individual may also be liable to a capital gains tax charge of 20% on the difference, if any, between the market value of the shares at the exercise of the option and the sale price.</P>
    <P>It has been said on a number of occasions that the Government is prepared to consider further tax concessions for other forms of employee financial participation. In this context, however, it must be borne in mind that providing tax breaks for profit sharing can, as with all tax breaks, create opportunities for tax planning and tax avoidance. Without being negative, we must be as fair to all as is practicable.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness states:</P>
    <P>The Government and the social partners acknowledge the role of . . .  ESOTs, gain sharing, profit sharing and other financial employee incentives in developing a deepening partnership and in increasing performance and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>A consultative committee involving the ICTU, IBEC and appropriate Departments and agencies will be established to prepare proposals for consideration in the budget later this year. I am not dismissing his point but Senator Ross's remarks were unfair. The Minister is taking the lead, as is the Department of Finance, but we live in an age of consultation and it has worked very well in many areas. There is an understanding of the potential of share options and what can be achieved. I do not see anything wrong with involving the social partners directly to ensure the maximum is achieved. That is good. The targets for conclusion being set in the Department of Finance are short and defined and are being delivered upon. I could say that it will happen without placing a timeframe on it which would mean waiting three or four years, as used to happen with a range of issues and where committees were used as a mechanism to do nothing. That has changed in many ways in Government and in different Departments, so I do not agree with the Senator. We need to deliver and, if the way to do <Col N="888" /> it is in consultation with the social partners, then so be it.</P>
    <P>The committee in question has already been established and has held meetings on 16 February and 23 May and is due to meet again on 21 June. It is examining all aspects of employee financial participation, including the tax treatment of profit sharing and share options. Important issues are involved which need careful consideration and the committee is the appropriate place to carry out such an exercise.</P>
    <P>In the end, the Senator is right in saying that it is the Government which will decide on what measures should be taken in the public interest. The House will be aware from the debates on the Finance Bill that there is a wide measure of support across parties for new thinking and new proposals in this area. The considered views of Members of both Houses as expressed in those debates and this evening will inform the Government's deliberation on these matters. This is the democratic way to proceed and I assure the House in that regard and especially Senator Ross who is listened to.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I urge Senators to support the Government amendment which recognises the efforts and achievements made so far and our firm intention of making further progress on this issue with the support of both Houses. Perhaps Senator Ross would consider and understand why the Government thinks it necessary to table an amendment. It embraces the point he is trying to make. If we do not deliver within the timeframe I outlined, it might be opportune to revisit the issue. If the Senator is serious in achieving the aims of his motion, I have provided him with the means to do so in what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his input and his consideration of this issue we have raised.</P>
      <P>I support the motion moved by Senator Ross. There is a broader picture and I will return to the issue of taxation and its impact. We should recognise that we are debating a software industry which is uneven. To regard Ireland as the second largest exporter of software in the world is a classic example of how facts can mislead. While it is true and a statement of fact, much of the software we export has little added value. It is not much more than putting products in boxes before exporting them. That may sound demeaning but much of it is questionable and it does not mean we have a thriving computer software industry merely because we are the second largest exporter in the world. Many of those exports have had little intellectual or added value from this country. That is a huge problem for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer to see the research and development end of the computer industry locating here than the assembly lines. Apple in Cork would be much better off if it dealt with the technical and support or the research and development ends <Col N="889" /> rather than the assembly end. That is the future and this country could suffer badly. I remember ten years ago speaking on employment and unemployment and making the point that Fruit of the Loom was an unsustainable industry in the long term because the work done there was not attractive to parents as a future for their children. Many aspects of the computer industry are the modern equivalent of the Industrial Revolution in that they involve putting pieces together.</P>
    <P>All that I have said is reinforced by the fact that we have the worst record in Europe in terms of investment in research and development, and that is a fact. Next to us is Belgium and it is twice as good as us. I know I am pushing an open door in that it is Government policy and I have heard Ministers make that point. I have argued the point with IBEC, during pre-budget discussions with the Minister and in consultation discussions on taxation during the negotiations on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that there should be a double tax break for reinvestment by companies in research and development.</P>
    <P>A great deal more is involved than merely giving a break to people working in the industry. We need an industry which will develop on the basis of our intellectual input and added value. To do that, we need qualified people who will be paid to do simply that. Companies need to hold their nerve, take stock of the situation and invest the time, money and intellectual resources to develop their products rather than sourcing them from other ends of the world and basing an industry on other people's research and development.</P>
    <P>Conceding the proposal in the motion would make coming to, locating and remaining in Ireland much more attractive for multinationals. Ireland is the country in Europe which would gain most from doing this. We are in the euro zone &ndash; I am not sure Senator Ross agrees with that &ndash; and that is attractive to the American market especially. American software geniuses hate being located in a country where English is not the spoken language. There is a huge attraction in coming to Ireland. If they must locate in Europe, Ireland is an attractive venue. Granting the added attraction of what is suggested in the motion would also make it more attractive for emigrants to return and, more importantly, taking the longer and broader view, the economy would gain from the greater input of these people. That must be the future.</P>
    <P>Nothing is more likely to keep future Ministers for Finance awake than the stark figure of the percentage of GDP which is dependent on a handful of multinational computer companies which have locations throughout the world and which could move their operations out of the country to the Far East or wherever on the basis of a board decision. We have seen elements of that and more could happen in future. These people are obviously driven by market considerations and they will go wherever they get the best value. They get that here at present for a variety of reasons. While research and development is an <Col N="890" /> expensive option for any multinational company, it would mean we would not be undercut by other countries because we would be able to deliver as cheaply as anywhere else. It would also mean we would have a substantial educated workforce to add that value and to participate in industry. That is hugely important.</P>
    <P>The motion deals with employees but we should also examine the issue in terms of the broader economy. I shiver every time I hear people say that we have the most educated and computer literate population in Europe or wherever. Just as companies need to reinvest in research and development, the education system needs to continue to reinvest in computer literacy. The Government's decision to introduce Schools IT 2000 as an investment in computers in different levels of education has proved to be a huge success. Nonetheless we cannot rest on our laurels. We now need to progress that. Three years ago, the idea that every school in Ireland should be connected to the Internet and that pupils, classes and schools should have e-mail addresses sounded like something from Jules Verne, such as <i>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</i> or <i>Journey to the Centre of the Earth</i> or the time machine. That has happened and we must now look to the next step. We need to do a great deal more. We need to harness that, bring it to bear and ensure people in education at whatever level, first, second or third, experience and interface with the most modern technology and the newest software and that teachers at whatever level are trained and encouraged to do that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross always likes to hear something pro-teacher in the debates on the motions he proposes. The teaching profession over the past three years, in its own time and voluntarily, has had almost 80% of its members retrained in computer skills. That has been done at no cost to the State. In the UK, the US and in western Europe, education ministers are trying to devise methods to achieve the same result. It is an example of what can be done through the consultation process which I am glad to see the Minister reinforced and restated in his contribution. Senator Ross will be delighted that there will be further consultation and that the Minister of State has listened to me and the other Members to ensure that the input of politicians will go right through the consultation process so they will not have to waste their time going to the partnership meetings under PPF. I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House for the second time today. I welcome the content of the motion which we are debating and the amendment in particular. I was delighted to see Senator Cox taking part in this debate because she is our expert on e-commerce and on computer technology. She explained to Senator Ross the reason for the amendment which was reiterated by the Minister. I also concur with much of what Senator O'Toole said, particularly on the type of industry we have <Col N="891" /> attracted to date and where we should be going from now on. He mentioned the computerisation in schools which Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, introduced in his first year in office.</P>
      <P>One of the problems we might have in the future is that while we are making a great effort to educate our young and make them computer literate, more needs to be done at national school level, particularly on the training of teachers and the availability of people to teach in the schools.</P>
      <P>Only last week a national software conference was held in Ireland. It was clear that the growth that the sector has achieved in a relatively short time has been phenomenal. There are now over 750 software firms in Ireland employing over 23,000 people. We can reflect on the fact that except for the great work done by the IDA in the 1970s and 1980s, when unemployment was so high, that without the jobs created in telecommunications related industries at that time, our economic position would have deteriorated to an even greater extent.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been active in the past 30 years in enticing inward investment in the telecommunications and related sectors to set up in this country. We have targeted industries with a high knowledge content as to the way to develop our economy. Notwithstanding the fact that the enlargement of the European Union is just around the corner, Ireland will continue to win a large proportion of future e-commerce business. Our third level institutions are producing top grade graduates and this does not go unnoticed by foreign investors. Many employees in software companies receive excellent wages simply because of the economic nature of supply and demand. I heard an interview with a number of employees who were employed in Northern Ireland who had moved to Dundalk and Dublin because of the higher level of the wages they were earning here in the e-commerce and computer industries compared with the wages they were earning in Britain and Northern Ireland. One of these employees doubled his wages by moving here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has also invested much in putting a world class telecommunications network in place. The Government has adopted a broad based approach built around the development of the following key priority areas: telecommunications infrastructure and cost, education and upskilling in the existing business sector, effective regulation, research and development. I note with interest the proposals included in the IDA Ireland annual report in 1999 which stated that achieving success in the e-commerce business in Ireland in the coming years is as important as attracting the electronics companies to Ireland was during the 1970s and 1980s. A number of key reasons are included in this report why e-commerce companies should set up in Ireland as a base for world-wide activities. The key incentives in this regard include the deregulation of the telecommunications sector which will ensure the <Col N="892" /> development of a more competitive telecommunications market. There are currently over 30 licensed operators, 12 of whom are active in the marketplace. The enhanced connectivity from Global Crossing will provide Ireland with a state of the art network and virtually unlimited bandwidth at highly competitive prices. The network provides access to the major cities of Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and the US. Other incentives include the substantial investment in the telecommunications infrastructure in all regions and the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, which has been passed by the Seanad and is currently before the Dáil. This will provide Ireland with one of the most business friendly environments for the development and distribution of intellectual property rights.</P>
    <P>A Bill is also set to give legal effect to electronic signatures and the writing of electronic contracts. This Bill is being sponsored by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In this regard, I take this opportunity of congratulating our European Commissioner for Consumer Affairs, Mr. David Byrne, for setting in train the process for the regulation of contracts on the Internet. Commissioner Byrne has started the process of looking into mechanisms to govern consumer protection rights for people who enter into contracts over the Internet. The Commission wants to bring forward proposals to regulate procedures and dispute mechanisms for contractual arrangements entered into via the Internet. Entering into contracts on the Internet must bring with it regulatory procedures and dispute regulation mechanisms so that consumers who enter into contracts on the Internet are protected. Currently, the US Congress is also examining ways to protect consumer contractual rights for Internet business.</P>
    <P>It is important that the EU and the US work closely together on these issues in an effort to bring about a common and uniform approach to deal with contractual arrangements on the Internet. The Government is also working with the education sector and the private sector to ensure that our future skill needs in the software sector are met. A wide variety of measures initiated by the Government include more than doubling the output of software engineers, the creation of over 5,000 new third level places, predominantly in computer science, engineering and software and the development of new network management programmes. Enterprise Ireland will also be looking for partnerships with other countries to help our software industry to continue with rapid growth. A total of £411 million has been allocated to various educational initiatives designed to develop appropriate skills to promote innovation and provide additional third level college places in high technology courses over the next four years, to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>The Government has always assisted industry in general with its grants structure. Originally there was export sales relief and that is followed now by manufacturing tax relief, which will be <Col N="893" /> expanded into all service industries as well. I am delighted that in obtaining Objective One status, the BMW region will retain the lucrative grants structure because the BMW region, particularly the west, has suffered greatly from a lack of investment and jobs created by Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. Their record in the west of Ireland has been dismal to date, but I am delighted that the Government has given a commitment that over 50% of the jobs created by the IDA will be in this region. The computer industry in general is easy to set up in places such as the west. It is easy to export the product afterwards. I remember reading with interest some time ago about a doctor in America had employed a secretary in either Mayo or Kerry, which shows the effect of the computer industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to Fruit of the Loom and the difficulties experienced with some of the manufacturing industries relocating in Morocco. The Government has made a great effort to replace those jobs in east Donegal, in particular, and has attracted two companies in the past year, providing over 300 jobs. One of those companies is Pacific Healthcare. At the official opening I thought all the employees would be highly educated with computer skills but I was amazed to find most of them had only come through a fast training course. The computer industry can cater for all types and levels of education.</P>
    <P>I hope that the consultative body set up will deliver, in conjunction with Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, what Senator O'Toole seeks. I appreciate that has to be looked at. We cannot bring in schemes and improve existing schemes for one type of industry; we must be fair to all the other types of industry. The Government is tackling this problem and I hope the consultative body will deliver the incentives to which Senator Ross referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I hope he takes notice of what is said from the Independent benches tonight because many of those about whom we are talking are constituents of ours. Our great prosperity has been built on the information technology and pharmaceutical industries. It is important we recognise that and make sure the foot soldiers within those industries are given the rewards they need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to express a personal interest in this debate because I have one son involved in this industry. I regret to say he is not in this country, not because of a lack of jobs or, indeed, the financial situation but because a large number of the jobs in this industry are very routine. As I am sure the Minister of State is well aware, young people like challenging jobs. We must make sure we keep enough of the information technology industry involved in research and development to give the challenge to those people who want to work in this area and the interface they need to stay here. When I ask my son about the jobs in Ireland, I am told there is nothing at the moment which would give him the challenge he is getting <Col N="894" /> in his job in London. I suppose that is probably true.</P>
    <P>Shortly after I was elected to this House, the Digital firm in Galway closed down. I remember saying to the then Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, that if we were able to hold on to the research and development cohort there, which was very good, we were bound to replace the industry very shortly. She made huge efforts to hold on to it and within months Boston Instruments came in.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that we have to make a huge effort to hold on to the innovators in these areas. Iona Technologies was built up by three constituents of mine, Senator Norris and Senator Ross. These people have been extraordinarily important in building up these industries. They have to be able to see that there will be something for their employees so that they will stay with them.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox made a thoughtful contribution regarding the position of women in the information technology industry. Sometimes I believe the Government will have to introduce conscription to keep women in their 30s and 40s in the nursing profession and in information technology because they are very badly needed. They comprise about 50% of the graduate workforce and are an even greater percentage in the operatives area. The Government would be well advised to re-open the issue of child care. Each year when the budget comes around, there is much mumbling about what must be done about child care but, alas and alack, nothing really concrete is done. I await with anticipation the opening of a crèche in this establishment. The situation has become so serious that if we want workers in a certain place at a certain time, one has to accommodate those workers. I suggest to the Minister of State that the lip-service given to improving child care provision is not enough. We must see some concrete action in that area.</P>
    <P>I supported individualisation when the Minister for Finance brought it in. I thought it was a good idea and a move in the right direction, having suffered from the opposite for almost 30 years. I told the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, that I was once described by a tax official as being like a wholly owned subsidiary of my husband. I very much appreciated what he did in at least making me an individual operation. There has been too much lip-service in this area. We have to look at the employees we need and see what will facilitate them. Senator Ross put forward one area in which we could be supportive and I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who contributed to this debate, particularly those whose speeches were not scripted. I would also like to thank the Minister of State for his reply, which was disappointing. If I was critical of the Minister of State's attitude and that of the senior Minister to this matter in my original contribution, I make the point that I do not wish to withdraw those criticisms, even in the light of what the Minister of State said. While the Government is probably sympathetic to the sentiments in this motion, it shows a marked indifference to doing anything <Col N="895" /> about it and it is very disappointing that it has done so.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's reply was basically a list of the tax concessions and incentives now available to people in various industries, particularly the software industries, and the profit sharing schemes. It contained much information of which we were already aware. His response to the plea to do something about the software industry and the dangers in that industry was inadequate.</P>
      <P>As I have said before, I am little tired of coming into this House and hearing the Minister say something is a great idea but that we have to consult the social partners. I do not give two hoots about the social partners. What the Minister of State said tonight was that we are basically sympathetic to this idea, which is quite enterprising, but that we have to get permission from IBEC and ICTU before we do anything. That is what is happening. We do not need ICTU and IBEC to tell us whether this is a good idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Bonner said he hoped that committee comes to the conclusions in this motion. As it happens, so do I. The implication of what Senator Bonner said is clear, if the committee says &ldquo;no&rdquo;, the Government will say &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Why should the Government be dictated to on something like this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger here is greater than the Government acknowledges. If the Government had been listening to the people who have been lobbying it, it would realise there is a real danger that some of these multinationals will go. These multinationals will go while the Government is telling us not to worry, that IBEC and ICTU are telling it what to do and that they will take a year to decide whether it is a good idea or not. It is a very simple operation to change a tax rate in this <Col N="896" /> way. It is needs quick legislation &ndash; an amendment to the Finance Act. It could be done any day and it certainly does not need these people, who have only held two meetings and have another one coming up, to tell us whether it is a good thing or not.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable for a Minister of State to tell us a parliamentary committee is sitting outside this House without, as far as I know, any politicians on it &ndash; I am open to correction on that &ndash; but with various State agencies which have nothing else to do anyway telling us whether the enterprise economy will work. The last people who should be telling us about enterprise are IBEC, ICTU and the State agencies, the people with the safest jobs going. Even if every multinational disappears, they will still be sitting in safe jobs. It is ridiculous and it is not acceptable. It is not a way to govern this country and it is wrong. It is very easy for a Government to kick something aside to these people but it is not the way the country should be run. It is a complete cop-out.</P>
    <P>I do not want to exaggerate the dangers and I want this motion to have a positive impact and tone. I want the Minister to extend this principle of giving tax allowances on share options throughout developing industries. Let us give them to workers in Intel, Dell and the other great multinationals and to the Iona Technologies and Baltimore Technologies, publicly quoted companies to which Senator Henry referred, but let us also give them to privately quoted companies. The liquidity in such companies makes it harder for them to release some of their capital. Let us extend this principle as a way for rewarding people. It works not just for the individuals but for the companies because it makes us competitive in a global industry and if we do not compete the dangers will be there.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude on a positive note. I hope the Minister of State leaves the House with a message for the Minister for Finance and the Government that this House will not put up with obstructive amendments but also that there is a real need for this enterprise economy to flourish courtesy of the Government, not the social partners.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to respond to this matter which relates to the urgent need to provide additional psychiatric services in north Tipperary and specifically in the Nenagh area. A number of weeks ago I attended the inaugural public meeting of the Mental Health Association in north Tipperary. It was a good and worthwhile exercise and the objectives of the meeting were to bring people together and form a committee and also to lobby on two fronts. The first of these fronts is to create a more positive attitude to the whole issue of mental health because, undoubtedly, there has been a negative reaction to this area in the past. Mental illness has been considered a stigma for a family or an individual and this must change, particularly against the background of the rate of suicide in society. It behoves all Members to deal with this issue and to promote a positive approach to mental health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the second front, at the meeting I undertook to raise in the Seanad the urgent need to address the level of psychiatric services for the population of north Tipperary. I hope the Minister of State will address at an early opportunity the fact that north Tipperary is still in the county structure in terms of the provision of services on the psychiatric front. This means that Nenagh must report to Clonmel; the centre of operations for the county is in Clonmel. As the Minister of State is aware, Nenagh is in north Tipperary and is part of the Mid-Western Health Board area, while Clonmel is in south Tipperary and is part of the South Eastern Health Board area. The Mid-Western Health Board obviously is responsible for the provision of health services in the north Tipperary area. This anomaly is creating severe problems on the ground because there is a lack in terms of the driving forward of the agenda <Col N="899" /> regarding the provision of services in north Tipperary. In addition, the main hospital is in Clonmel.</P>
    <P>For a number of years Nenagh has been promised a psychiatric unit and it is once again on the agenda. It is over two years since the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, announced spending of just over £5 million on Nenagh hospital. Part of this funding was to provide a psychiatric unit. While planning permission has been granted for the extension of the hospital and planning work is proceeding on the consolidation of the health board run services on the campus, there is still no move on the psychiatric unit.</P>
    <P>The Glenroyd day care centre is down the road from the hospital. This is a converted house and it is the only day care centre for psychiatric patients in the entire area. It has one psychologist and it runs its day care service as well as it can. There are no residential, hostel or emergency services. A person rang me about this matter last week. He told me that one can only get medication from Monday to Friday, or from Tuesday to Friday if there is a bank holiday weekend. One is in trouble if one needs medication on a Saturday or a Sunday, particularly if it is a long weekend. This is the reality for people there.</P>
    <P>The waiting time for an appointment is approximately 18 months for an urgent case. I spoke to a parent of a 21 year old who has been through the mill for approximately ten years because of his son's psychiatric illness. The son has received the best possible service from Glenroyd, as have others, but if it was not for his father's perseverance, support, capacity and ability to deal with the problem, God knows where the son would be at this stage, as his father openly admits.</P>
    <P>I tabled this matter because it is an urgent issue. There is a need to bring matters to a head. I know from talking to my colleagues that the provision of psychiatric services around the country must be upgraded. However, it is my duty to bring this matter to the Minister of State's attention. Depending on his response, I will continue to ask why more resources and services are not provided for the community of north Tipperary in this extremely important area. I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this matter.</P>

      <P>The mental health services in north Tipperary are divided into two sectors, Thurles/Roscrea and Nenagh, with a population each of approximately 30,000. Prior to 1990 the services in these areas were provided by the South Eastern Health Board on an agency <Col N="900" /> basis for the Mid-Western Health Board. Following discussions on the future services in north Tipperary between the boards, a joint agreement was reached on the transitional arrangements. This will eventually allow for the transfer of responsibility for the mental health services to the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>The first phase of this transfer was facilitated in early 1990 when a day hospital was opened in St. Mary's Health Centre, formerly Thurles District Hospital. An interim situation currently exists whereby the South Eastern Health Board continues to provide acute in-patient and long-term provision and discussions are ongoing between the boards on the future of mental health services in north Tipperary.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board currently provides community services on a sector basis. Two day hospitals, one in Thurles and one in Nenagh, are staffed by a multi-disciplinary team providing acute care in the community. A day centre in Thurles provides maintenance and support for people suffering from mental illness. The services in north Tipperary will be further enhanced by the provision of a 24 bed acute in-patient psychiatric unit based at Nenagh General Hospital. The unit will provide in-patient care for persons from the north Tipperary catchment area who require a more intensive level of care than can be provided by the community-based services. A planning brief for this unit has been agreed and an application for planning permission is currently with the local authority. The provision of this facility means there will be no further admissions of Tipperary North Riding patients to St. Michael's unit in Clonmel.</P>
      <P>The prioritisation of services within its functional area is a matter for each individual health board. I understand from the Mid-Western Health Board that the development of the acute psychiatric unit at Nenagh is being progressed as part of the national development plan. The board has purchased a property for the development of a new day centre to serve the Nenagh sector. A planning application is being prepared by the board for submission to the urban district council. It is intended that this project will also be funded by the national development plan.</P>
      <P>I am confident these development proposals which are being progressed by the Mid-Western Health Board will greatly enhance the psychiatric services for the people of north Tipperary. I understand the Senator's frustration about the catchment area in north Tipperary. I hope the 24 bed unit, which is included in the national development plan, will be operational in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 June 2000.</P>
