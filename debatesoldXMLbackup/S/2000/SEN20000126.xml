      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reason why Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe which does not avail of Naltrexone for detoxification of drug addicts, and if he will introduce it on a pilot basis.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 20, motion No. 14 on the Order Paper. No. 1, motion re Order of Business is to be taken without debate. No. 2, Eighth Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the procedure for taking expressions of condolences, is to be taken without debate. No. 3 is the Irish <Col N="2" /> Nationality and Citizenship Bill, 1999 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages. No. 20, motion No. 14 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business will be resumed thereafter, if not previously concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the resignation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and wish him well in his retirement. He was always a courteous Minister and a good parliamentarian. He had great respect for this House and always treated it with great courtesy. He has had a full political career, which is not over yet. I wish to express my appreciation of him.</P>
      <P>I know it is not normal to comment on appointments to the Judiciary but given that one of the appointments made yesterday is that of Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, a distinguished former Member of this House, it is appropriate that the House sends its best wishes on her appointment to the highest court in the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of this new session and new year, will the Leader indicate the legislation he hopes to bring to the House in the coming weeks? <Col N="3" /> He might also note from the Order Paper of the other House how little of the legislation we processed last session is before it. We had a very productive session last year.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader set in train the honouring of commitments made last session, including an invitation to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Jim Mitchell, to come to the House to discuss its report and also one to Deputy Lenihan to discuss the work of the review group on the Constitution? I know that has to go before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but both sides of the House feel it will be worthwhile to have these discussions soon.</P>
    <P>In a serious vein, will the Leader reconsider the possibility of taking the Shannon River Council Bill? There has been massive flooding and many Members will have more direct experience of that than I. This Bill would stir the Government into setting up a single authority, which seems to be what is wanted by those who are involved and know what they are talking about. It is a good Fianna Fáil Bill which had the support of virtually every Member on the other side in the last session. We should be big enough to accept that this is a good, important and constructive Bill. This side of the House will do everything to ensure it is put on the Statute Book without delay, obstruction or hindrance.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader have a debate on Northern Ireland in the next couple of weeks and, unlike some of the earlier debates, will he allow time for all Members who wish to contribute?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add to Senator Manning's comments on the resignation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews. He has always been extraordinarily helpful, open and accessible to the Independent Senators and has made a great effort. I asked him for help on matters regarding Kosovo and Turkey, to where he sent someone to observe the trial of a teacher-trade unionist. I have always found him accessible and supportive of the work of parliamentarians on all sides, including the Independents. I wish him well and I hope he will be able to spend more time in his house in Connemara.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to the House to give us an update on taxis? I support his proposals and I want him to know he has widespread support. Extra taxis are as necessary now as they were before Christmas. The fact that the Christmas rush is over should not change his position. I hope he proceeds with the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is about to publish the minimum wage legislation. I have not seen the publication so I would like to know whether it is intended initiating the legislation in this House or in the Dáil. I think the House would agree that at a time of growing wealth, the mealy-mouthed attitude of employers, who are holding to £4.40 per hour for workers, is absolutely disgraceful. I <Col N="4" /> am sure Members on all sides of the House, regardless of their occupation, would like to see people at that level sharing in the wealth. There is a general view that that figure should be increased.</P>
    <P>During the recess, the Shannon River Council Bill was raised by the Labour Party and others. I support what Senator Manning has just said. We have all seen the need for co-ordination in relation to the Shannon. Apart from the obvious problems which received television coverage, there was the back-up of sewage and other unacceptable problems during the flooding. Apart from the difficulties caused for farmers as a result of the flooding of their land, there was also flooding of houses. The Leader should put the boot in to the Minister because, time and time again, arguments have been made for a co-ordinated body. If he is about to be moved, the last thing he might do is announce tomorrow morning that he intends publishing this particular legislation, or publish it now since it already exists.</P>
    <P>During the recess there was a lot of discussion about the privatisation of various State bodies &ndash; Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and so on. It would be helpful if the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, would come to this House and outline the Government's thinking on this issue and perhaps she might find there is a lot of support for some of the ideas. Members could be reassured that there are certain strategic matters, such as control of the airports, which the State needs to retain, but they might be open to discussion in other areas. We need to be informed of the Government's views so that we can all make plans. The workers who are dependent on these industries are also interested to know what is taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to be associated, on behalf of the Labour Party, with the tributes paid to the outgoing Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews. I wish to put on the record that we found him to be a good Minister, a gentleman, courteous at all times and a man of integrity. I congratulate Catherine McGuinness, a former Member of this House, on her elevation to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Senator Manning in relation to the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts coming to this House, which I would welcome, the report of the committee was not circulated to Members of this House. I ask the Leader to ensure that each Senator receives a copy of the report. We were treated very badly in relation to the Budget Statement, which was not circulated to us, even though it was circulated to members of the media. Protocol and courtesy should require that we receive a copy of all reports, regardless of whether it is a Dáil or Oireachtas committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Order of Business, the Labour Party is not pleased that we should begin this session on the wrong foot in terms of No. 3, <Col N="5" /> the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, 1999. It is proposed by the Leader of the House to take Committee and Remaining Stages today and that, if the remaining Stages have not been dealt with by the end of Private Members' time at 8 p.m., we should continue on into the night. I do not think this is a good way to do business. This is controversial legislation and many issues need to be teased out. It would be more appropriate if the remaining Stages were taken on another day and we dealt with Committee Stage tonight. I would like to hear the Leader's reply. The Labour Party will oppose all Stages being taken on the same day.</P>
    <P>The national minimum wage legislation has been published today and it would be most appropriate to set the minimum wage at £5 per hour at least, considering that the budget's tax measures come into effect at £108. The proposed minimum wage, £4.40 per hour, means that at least £76 of a person's earnings on such a wage would be taxed. Our inflation figures announced today are, at 3.9 %, by far the highest in Europe. That is double the rate last year and three times what it is in Britain. It would obviously be better if people on low incomes got more money.</P>
    <P>There are nurses outside the gates today looking for free third level fees. They are the only group being discriminated against and it is very desirable that money should go to them, given that they are finding it hard to make ends meet while in college.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other groups in paying tribute to the outgoing Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews. I understood we would do this more formally, but given that it has arisen on the Order of Business, it is appropriate to salute the work he has done and to wish him well in retiring from his Ministry, though he is staying in the Dáil until the next election. This House acknowledges his huge contribution to the peace process in Northern Ireland but also the very forthright way he condemned what was happening in East Timor when he told the Indonesian Government in no uncertain terms what the Irish Government's attitude was. It was one of the more forthright denunciations we have heard from a Minister for Foreign Affairs and he took a very direct interest in that issue. We also salute his work on the wider international stage for both the UN and the EU. We wish him well in whatever he decides to do in the future and acknowledge the tremendous contribution he has made as Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Shannon flooding, I have a serious solution. The Shannon could contribute its water to the greater Dublin area. A major problem at the moment is the increasing level of extraction from the Liffey to supply Dublin's need for water and it would be quite easy to draw water from the Shannon to Dublin. I am not sure about the impact that would have on flooding from the Shannon, but it would be of some help. <Col N="6" /> At least once in the history of the State we would be taking water out of the Shannon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be useful to have some sewerage schemes to treat the water before people are asked to drink it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the stated objectives from the foundation of the State would then be delivered upon.</P>
      <P>Regarding the minimum wage, obviously the legislation will be coming to us and, regardless of what the level should be, we have to acknowledge that it is a major breakthrough to establish a minimum wage. People have campaigned for this for a long time and it has finally come to fruition.</P>
      <P>I join in the congratulations to the new members of the Supreme Court, particularly Judge Catherine McGuinness. Those of us who served in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will recall the skills she brought to bear there. All her judicial skills will be put to very good use when she joins the Supreme Court Bench. We also wish the Chief Justice and Mr. Adrian Hardiman well.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello on the publication of reports. I accept the Public Accounts Committee sub-committee which reported was a Dáil group and I appreciate why, in those circumstances, they felt it appropriate to circulate the report only to the Dáil. However, it is a recurring problem that Senators are not circulated with documents that are freely available to Deputies. It would improve our performance as legislators and public representatives if these documents were made more fully available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three brief points to make. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to speak to the House or to report on the safety aspect of commuter rail, given that on three occasions serious accidents were only narrowly averted when people fell between the carriages of the DART due to the crush of people on the platform. Concern about these issues has been raised in CIE. I understand a voice-over service will be provided. We must introduce measures to try to prevent accidents rather than have to explain them afterwards.</P>
      <P>I note with dismay in this comprehensive documentation that there is no reference to the review of the censorship laws promised by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, last summer.</P>
      <P>We have lived with the dreadful imperial anomaly of ground rents for a long time. I thought they were to be abolished with one stroke, so to speak, but I am disappointed that item 74 on page 9 of the document states that it is not possible at this stage to say when that will be done. Will the Leader indicate when it will be possible to abolish ground rents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to a report on the level of absenteeism in our schools submitted to <Col N="7" /> the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Science and Technology, it is disturbing that a consortium of organisations which contributed to that report found that more than 30% of students are still leaving school before they reach the age of 15. Given that the Education (Welfare) Bill is going through the Dáil, that we dealt with that Bill in this House and a good deal of research was carried out on the level of school absenteeism, I question the accuracy of this information. In light of rumours of a high level of absenteeism, the Minister should report to the House on this matter. The public are concerned about the level of school absenteeism at a time when there is so much talk of the Celtic tiger. The findings of this report are disturbing and a discussion on this matter would be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the retirement of Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, I worked closely with him over a number of years on the parochial front and prior to that my father worked with him since he was elected to the Dáil in the 1960s. When my party was in Government in the 1980s and I was a young public representative, I recall attending residents meetings and the Minister on occasions saying, &ldquo;Cosgrave, will you arrange that deputation?&rdquo;  In the 1990s we held clinics a few yards apart in the same hotel and when some difficult cases were presented by constituents, I told them the Minister, Deputy Andrews, would deal with them. I wish him well and also extend good wishes to his wife, Annette.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call, on which there is a consensus, for a Shannon authority or a body that would have overall responsibility for the control and co-ordination of activities on the River Shannon. I am not sure whether that could be dealt with in the River Shannon Council Bill which has had a reading in this House or through another body. We must progress towards establishing such an authority to ensure communities will not have to endure a repeat of the recent flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader raise with the Government the position of student nurses who are expected to do a degree course? They are probably the only group who are discriminated against as regards third level fees. It is inappropriate that a person who has a diploma is expected to do a degree without any support from the State. Their fees are not even paid. There is a case to be answered and the matter should be addressed through the appropriate channels. This may be through individual health boards, such as the Eastern Health Board which is paying 50% of the fees of permanent nurses. However, this is not happening in other areas. The nurses have a case <Col N="8" /> and I ask the Leader to bring it to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>There is all-party agreement on the urgent need for a single authority, council or body to manage issues relating to the River Shannon. It has taken floodwaters lapping around the ankles of Ministers for this matter to get the attention it deserves. It should not be necessary to wait for such serious flooding to have this major issue debated. In common with other Members, I urge the Leader to talk to his local colleagues and senior Ministers and ensure legislation is introduced urgently on this matter. Such legislation is urgently needed and the Government will be neglectful of its duty not only to people who live in the Leader's area but also to all those who live along the River Shannon if this matter is not taken seriously in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent study on radon gas levels in schools makes worrying reading. It was carried out by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and covered 685 schools. A total of 175 of those schools have levels of radon gas which are unacceptably high. In view of the health hazards attached to radon gas, I ask the Leader to invite the appropriate Minister to the House to discuss the matter. I and other Members are aware of growing concern about the levels of this gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;F&rdquo; word has been used with &ldquo;Lanigan&rdquo; on other occasions but not in the same context. I join other Members in paying tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews. I knew the Minister before he entered politics and he has been a gentleman in every area of his life. He was also capable of taking on responsibility and he had the capacity to let other people do their jobs without interference. He was the type of boss or chief executive officer who could give responsibility to others and let them get on with the job. He will be missed by the Government and when he leaves national politics at the next election.</P>
      <P>The HIV/AIDS strategy for the Irish aid programme was launched yesterday, particularly with regard to HIV and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa which is a development issue for Irish aid. Will the Leader arrange a discussion on this report and the overall Irish aid programme at an early date? The most recent statistics on HIV and AIDS in the African continent show that in 1998 a total of 33 million people were affected by HIV and the rate was rising by 16,000 people a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 95% of the people affected by the virus are in the poorest countries in the world from <Col N="9" /> Africa to rural India and on to the CIS and Eastern Europe. The West has in a sense dealt with or contained the problem through research and funding. However, the West's capacity in this area is not being transferred to poorer countries. The statistics show that 33 million people, which is ten times the population of Ireland, are affected by HIV. That is not the true picture because many of those who die from tuberculosis in these countries are infected with HIV. As a western country we have to do something about it. I ask the Leader to allow time to discuss this matter. Senator Henry has just returned from countries where there is an epidemic of HIV and a waste of human resources. I have been to countries where in one instance 63% of those tested were HIV positive. As part of the western economic booming world this is a matter we have to address carefully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the need to improve the position in regard to the training of nurses, the grave shortage of nurses in our communities and hospitals and the fact that surgeons cannot operate at critical times due to staff shortages. In that context the protest outside the House today is shameful and student nurses ought to be treated fairly and properly paid to attend courses rather than, effectively, fined for their wish to help and serve their community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been to Uganda and Zambia I support Senator Lanigan's call for a debate on HIV-AIDS in that area. The Irish aid effort is truly remarkable. The support we have provided has helped to feed 11,000 orphans in the town of Kitwe in the Copperbelt alone. It seems to be nothing but bad news there with the health indicators going backwards by the hour and 20 to 30 years of improvements in health care being lost within as many months. Our efforts are enormously important. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, on the report she initiated which was published the other day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senators Lanigan and O'Meara's request to allow time to debate the serious problem of the flooding of the Shannon. It is important that Government time be allowed to debate this matter. In the event that Government time is not allowed, the Fine Gael Party will table the Shannon River Council Bill for our next Private Members' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Senator Lanigan and other speakers in their compliments to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, who has been a wonderful Minister and has done great work in regard to the peace process in Northern Ireland and equally in the Third World and in areas of conflict such as East Timor where his contribution made a huge impact in attempting to resolve the problem. We have been fortunate to have in Deputy Andrews a Minister who is sociable and well able to articulate the face of <Col N="10" /> Ireland abroad. In losing him from Foreign Affairs we lose one who has had a distinguished career. I wish him and his wife well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I too wish to join with Members in wishing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, well in the future. He is one of the two longest serving Fianna Fáil Members in the Dáil, having entered the Dáil in 1965. He has been dedicated to public service and to the Fianna Fáil Party. His skills and dedication as a Minister will be missed. However, he leaves behind a proud record of achievement. His time as Minister for Foreign Affairs was the pinnacle of achievement for a man who was marked out for public life and public service, having been elected in 1965 to serve the people of Dún Laoghaire, a constituency he will continue to represent. It was never a surprise that he would enter politics and public service. Being a son of the late Todd Andrews he was steeped in republicanism. It has been his honour over the years to have served under every Fianna Fáil Leader since Éamon de Valera was Taoiseach. He showed early promise as Government Chief Whip, Parliamentary Secretary and Minister of State but it was not until he was elevated to the Department of Foreign Affairs by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, that he came into his stride. He also served as Minister for Defence and the Marine. However, it was at the Department of Foreign Affairs that Deputy Andrews showed real conviction and vision. He was a major player in achieving the breakthrough in the North and in bringing us to the exciting point at which the nation now finds itself. Above all else he achieved as Minister this brought him the greatest sense of personal achievement.</P>
      <P>As a Minister and previously, Deputy Andrews has always been strongly dedicated to supporting human rights issues. He was a vigorous campaigner on behalf of the Birmingham Six and showed a particular energy in addressing the plight of the oppressed in the Third World and other troubled areas.</P>
      <P>He has a proud record of achievement in foreign affairs. Following such people as Frank Aiken, he built on Ireland's influence on disarmament and neutrality and on Ireland's engagement with the UN. Last year he took a particularly proactive stance on East Timor. He was very vocal on the Kosovo crisis and during his time as Minister for Foreign Affairs he undertook high profile visits to Somalia, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Algeria in support of Irish development aid and human rights.</P>
      <P>He has been vigorous in the important work in securing a place for Ireland at the UN Security Council and at the time of his resignation was Chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe which made important interventions in the Balkan and Chechnya crises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the great honour when I became a Member of Seanad Éireann of sharing an office with Deputy Andrews. I learned a great deal <Col N="11" /> about politics from watching the way he conducted his business over my first five years as a Member. We in this House salute his achievements and dedication to public service, and look forward to his continuing involvement in the important work of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I join Senators, on behalf of the House and the Fianna Fáil Party, in offering my sincerest congratulations to Mr. Justice Ronan Keane on his appointment as the new Chief Justice. Mr. Justice Keane is one of Ireland's most experienced legal brains and he has long experience at the Bar. I also congratulate former Member of the House Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness and Mr. Adrian Hardiman on their appointments to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business, Senator Manning inquired about legislation for the coming session. I will have this for the House tomorrow morning. As the session goes right up to Holy Week, which is the third week in April, there is quite an amount of legislation to be processed by the Seanad and Dáil.</P>
    <P>I share the view expressed by Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello and Dardis who requested that the Chairmen of the Committee of Public Accounts and the All-Party Committee on the Constitution come to the House and that we debate these two important matters.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Senators I mentioned already, Senators Finneran, O'Meara and Taylor-Quinn expressed their great concerns about the River Shannon area and the major flooding which took place there over the Christmas recess. I am in favour of the Seanad taking the Shannon River Council Bill, which is a Fianna Fáil Bill, and I will endeavour to do everything possible to have the Bill processed in this House in this session. I, along with other Members of the Oireachtas and members of local authorities, visited the River Shannon area and experienced the dreadful flooding conditions and the shocking plight of those who are trying to eke out an existence on the lands adjacent to the Shannon. The Government must address the matter seriously.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the National Minimum Wage Bill will be a Seanad or Dáil Bill but I will notify the House of that in the morning. The Bill was published today and I welcome it. I congratulate the Government on bringing it forward.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello also asked that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, should attend the House to inform it of the Government's plans for airports. He requested a debate on the future of our airports. Senator Finneran called on the Minister for Health and Children to explain the situation regarding fees payable for student nurses' degree courses. I will convey the Senator's concerns to the Minister immediately and there will be no problem in having such a debate if it is requested.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="12" /> Senator Ridge has asked me to inform the Minister for Public Enterprise of her concerns about commuter rail safety, and I will do so. She also called on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine the fact that a review of the Censorship Board is not included in forthcoming business. I will pass on the Senator's views on that matter.</P>
    <P>As regards legislation on ground rents, I can inform the Senator that this matter will come before the House in mid-2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 12 and 13.</P>
      <P>I wish to begin in a reasonable, quiet fashion. Amendment No. 1 proposes the deletion from the Bill of the reference to the Act of 1986. Having read the Bill carefully I understand that the only reference to that Act relates to the spectacular change in public policy which will deny to Irish citizens the right of being certain that the person they marry will be entitled to citizenship. The current position is that this country, for good reason, given that there are probably more people born on this island living outside the island than on it, has stated that if they marry a person who is not entitled to Irish citizenship then a simple and sensible procedure based on the requirement that they must be legally married and must remain married for three years comes into force. Then that spouse of an Irish citizen is entitled as of right to Irish citizenship. I wish the Minister would listen to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing the reason the 1986 Act needs to be in this Bill, which is to deal with the offensive denial of the right to marry whom they wish which Irish citizens used to have and which this Minister proposes to take away because of the xenophobia that runs his Department. That is what it is about. If the Minister can explain to me how I could deal with the text of section 4 and attempt to amend it and leave a reference to the Act of 1986 in the list of definitions, let him do so. We have plenty of time to discuss it. I am attempting to raise the point that the text of the 1986 Act should not be in this Bill, that it is an addition to the main thrust of this Bill which is connected to the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> The parts of this Bill related to the Good Friday Agreement are most welcome. It is a matter of regret that matters of great controversy were slipped in using ambiguous language. For instance, it does not say anywhere in the explanatory memorandum that the spouse of an Irish citizen would no longer have a right to citizenship. We have an extraordinary explanation that does not explain what is in the Bill. It gives the clear impression that there are new conditions attached to the right, whereas the right is being taken away. This is in a country where the majority of the people born on the island live outside the island, yet we are saying we will make it more difficult for them to marry people who are not Irish. That is the first of my remarks but since the Minister took exception to them he might as well reply now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister came here when we were discussing this Bill on Second Stage. On both occasions I said I felt that there were parts of this Bill which the Good Friday Agreement did not require and that is why I support what Senator Ryan has said. On both occasions neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister referred to the fact that there were parts of this Bill which had nothing to do with the Good Friday Agreement. If we do not remove this reference to the 1986 Act now we will not be in a position to oppose the section on marriage later.</P>
      <P>I regret that, without public debate, there have been major changes made in how people can acquire Irish citizenship. It is so serious that I sometimes think public debate has been stifled in this area rather than clearly explaining in the explanatory memorandum how these changes would affect people other than those of Northern Ireland. I regret that. When we were poor we were good about giving citizenship to people, but now that we have become a little richer it will be more difficult for people to become Irish citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated earlier, Senators Ryan and Henry are discussing the substance of section 4. That should not happen in regard to an amendment. That was the point I was making to Senator Donovan, the Government spokesperson in the Seanad, when Senator Ryan accused me of not listening to him. I listened to what he said but I disagree with his comments. I reject his notion that staff in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform suffer from xenophobia. That is a regrettable assertion on his part against civil servants who are not entitled to speak in this House. He should withdraw his remark because it is incorrect. It is unfair to blame public servants for framing legislation in accordance with Government policy. If he has criticisms to make I and the Government will accept them. I will make my political points in my own way. I assure him that I am in a position to defend this legislation through this House and <Col N="16" /> any other House. Any reasonable person listening to me will agree with what I have to say.</P>
      <P>I oppose amendment No. 1, &ldquo;In page 3, to delete lines 12 and 13&rdquo;. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986 is referred to in this Bill and that definition should be retained. It is disingenuous of Senator Ryan to state that the legislation does not make it clear what section 4 is doing. The explanatory memorandum, which has been published along with and parallel to the legislation, makes the position clear. Page 2, section 4 states:</P>
      <P>Along with the changes necessary as a consequence of the Constitutional changes, the Bill includes measures&ndash;</P>
      <P>replacing the present system of post-nuptial declarations of Irish citizenship for the non-national spouses of Irish citizens with a naturalisation procedure for such spouses involving a reduced residence requirement. . . . .</P>
      <P>The reality of the position which has not been put forward by Senator Ryan is that the non-national spouse of an Irish citizen, other than a naturalised Irish citizen, may make a declaration accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship after three years from the date of the marriage or where later from the date on which his or her spouse became an Irish citizen. There are conditions which must be met. The marriage must be subsisting at the date of lodgement of the declaration and the couple must be living together as husband and wife. The Irish spouse must provide an affidavit to that effect at the time the declaration is lodged. This provision, which I thought we would deal with when we came to section 4, inserted into the 1956 Act by the amending Act of 1986, replaced the original provision under which only the wife of an Irish citizen could make such a declaration. She became a citizen from the date of her marriage.</P>
      <P>The declaration is of acceptance of Irish citizenship. Unlike the provisions relating to naturalisation there is no requirement of residence, good character or a declaration of fidelity and loyalty to the State. Subject to the person satisfying the necessary conditions, he or she becomes a citizen from the date of lodgement of his or her declaration. A declaration may be lodged directly to the Minister or with any Irish diplomatic mission or consular office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the experience of my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs that a variety of fraudulent schemes have been organised to exploit loopholes in this provision with the intention of securing an Irish passport. These abusive practices are of serious concern. An Irish passport is a most valued possession and gives open access to the territory of the European Union and its employment markets. The fact that declarations can be made by spouses who have never set foot in Ireland, and who may never do so, makes the process of validating such declarations within my Department or the Department of Foreign Affairs extremely difficult. I do not <Col N="17" /> think anyone will disagree with me when I say that this is hardly a satisfactory basis for the acquisition of Irish citizenship, particularly when abuses are taking place.</P>
    <P>Senators may recall the position which arose in the Irish Embassy in London in 1987 involving the issue of Irish passports based on bogus marriages. The person concerned was convicted of fraud and given a custodial sentence. However, the cases are still active and the true extent of the fraud may never be known. This was abuse on an organised scale but individuals trying to defraud the system are also encountered on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>It is informative to look at the practices of our European neighbours in this area. Many European countries require a minimum period of residence as an absolute precondition to naturalisation, whether or not the applicant is married to a national of the country. They also apply other conditions such as good character, intention to remain in the state and language competence. Greece, Denmark, Estonia and Canada have similar absolute residence requirements. Some countries have such absolute requirements but impose a shorter minimum residence period for spouses of nationals and other applicants for naturalisation &ndash; France, Germany, the UK and the US form a common law jurisdiction with similar, more favourable residence requirements for spouses. A small number of European states &ndash; Austria, Belgium and Italy &ndash; permit the naturalisation of a spouse after a certain period of marriage without regard to residence in the state but reduce the marriage period required of spouses resident in the state. In addition to, for example, Turkey, Cyprus and Portugal, Ireland is one of the few Council of Europe states where the only consideration for acquisition of citizenship by a spouse is marriage for a greater or lesser period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me or the Minister to decide what is in order in this House but for you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. The procedure in the House is that amendments are grouped and usually the Department dealing with the legislation suggests the grouping. It is not my fault if the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not suggest any grouping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to pursue this amendment at great length. I wish the Minister would return to the issue. He has said that the current situation is that a declaration is sufficient after three years of a validly subsisting and continuing marriage. We could rationally discuss possible ways of tightening up this requirement provided the person knew what qualifications were needed in order to obtain citizenship. We could talk about a minimum period of residence, although I might not agree, or a declaration of fealty. We could talk about any such issue. However, because it is indefensible, the Minister will not talk about the fundamental change provided for by this Bill. This change means that, even if someone meets what the explanatory memorandum coyly describes as <Col N="18" /> the conditions for naturalisation of the non-national spouse, which are no more than the conditions one must meet before one is allowed to apply, &ldquo;the Minister may in his or her absolute discretion grant an application&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is a diversionary tactic to go on about tightening up the conditions when we are changing the underlying fact which is that currently, subject to certain conditions, spouses of Irish citizens are entitled to Irish citizenship as of right. I am prepared to listen to evidence of the scale of abuse. The scale of abuse in Britain concerned a corrupt official and not fraudulent marriages. That official was convicted because of corruption.</P>
    <P>The Minister may wish to tighten up on residence. It is an interesting concept that an Irish citizen living abroad will have to identify his or her potential spouse's character in advance of marriage for fear that they would not be allowed citizenship. The truth is that additional requirements such as good character, full age, living together as husband and wife and living in the State are not conditions which guarantee citizenship but conditions which give one the right to ask for it. Having met the conditions one can still be refused citizenship because the Minister retains his or her absolute discretion to do what he or she likes with each application. That is the issue I would like the Minister to address. I do not ask him to address the tangential issue of possible abuses or individual states and their different rules.</P>
    <P>The fundamental issue is that having gone through an increased number of hoops the spouse of an Irish citizen is still not given a right to be a citizen of this State. This has nothing to do with the abuse of the old system but with the peculiar attitude of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to citizenship generally. We will come back to this issue later.</P>
    <P>I know what &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; means because I have a letter written by the Minister to a Member of the Dáil about a particular application for naturalisation which was turned down in which the Minister said that, because he had absolute discretion, it was not the practice to give any information as to why the application was refused. Under this provision, in spite of the Minister's departure in the direction of good administrative practices, and maybe he has a case, the real change is not the extra conditions or the sensible requirement that people should live in the State for a while. We could discuss such conditions rationally if there was a right to citizenship at the end. The real change is that even if applicants meet all the conditions they still do not have a right to citizenship.</P>
    <P>This is a fundamental change from the previous system which is neither signalled in the explanatory memorandum nor the Minister's speech from which he quoted liberally in his reply. I read his speech this morning and there is nothing in it or the explanatory memorandum to explain or justify, not the changes in procedure or the details, but the fundamental deprivation of the right to <Col N="19" /> citizenship. This means that if an Irish citizen living abroad wants to return here the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will decide whether their spouse can become an Irish citizen no matter how many conditions they meet. The Minister has claimed for himself the right not to have to give an explanation so that he can exercise arbitrary judgments without accountability. A refugee seeking asylum will have a fairer procedure for having his or her application dealt with than the spouse of an Irish citizen who is refused citizenship by the Minister. There is no appeal, no independence and no transparency. That is the nub of the issue and it is time the Minister addressed it.</P>

      <P>Two different positions are being taken on this section neither of which has been clarified. Why does the Minister require the inclusion of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, in this legislation? The amendment seeks to exclude the 1986 Act and the Minister has not clarified why he requires the inclusion of that Act.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced on the basis of the Good Friday Agreement. There are a number of citizenship Acts and two positions are being taken. On what grounds does the Minister require the inclusion of this section in the Bill? What is the relevance of the 1986 Act to the general thrust of this legislation? Can the Minister proceed without the 1986 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Citing criminal activities involving the fraudulent issuing of passports from the basement of the Irish Embassy in London in 1987 is not a good reason for making these changes. We encourage people to work abroad to obtain experience. We encourage multinational companies to come to Ireland and working for such companies means that one will probably have to work in their operations in various parts of the world. We encourage people to go to areas of the developing world to assist in aid programmes. The people we are encouraging to undertake these activities are likely to be at a marriageable age &ndash; in their late 20s and 30s. Under this section these people will have serious problems if they marry a non-Irish person. How will they definitely be able to say they can return here for one year, if that does not suit Intel or Motorola and they must move on to one of their other operations after six months? How will they be able to say, in good faith, that they intend to reside in Ireland from the time of naturalisation?</P>
      <P>This section makes it extraordinarily difficult for people who will not be in a position to undertake the various commitments required. The number of people who have fraudulently married to obtain citizenship is very small. It would be better to deal with them in the courts than to include this section which could seriously disadvantage many of our citizens who marry non-nationals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a nonsense and should not be taken seriously. This provision prevents abuse of the process. It prevents marriages of convenience, which are taking place and result in people obtaining Irish citizenship. I wish to make it clear that on no account is this legislation about preventing genuine spouses of Irish nationals obtaining Irish citizenship &ndash; that is neither the intention of the Bill nor is it stated anywhere that that is the position, other than in the mind of Senator Ryan and perhaps to a lesser extent in the mind of Senator Henry. The Senators are entitled to formulate their opinions and as Senator Ryan is aware, I would be the last&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to disallow any person the right to express his or her opinion &ndash; that would be quite wrong. When those opinions are at variance with the facts, however, I am equally entitled to give my opinion. If Senator Ryan will stop interrupting me, I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>I have explained the realistic position. I do not believe the citizens of this or any other country should have to stand by and watch their citizenship laws being abused in this fashion. I would not be doing my duty as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform if I did not try to ensure that this does not continue.</P>
      <P>The termination of the scheme of post-nuptial citizenship means effectively that non-national spouses of Irish citizens habitually resident outside the island of Ireland will, after the transitional three year period provided in subsection (2) of this section, no longer be in a position to obtain citizenship based on their marriage. However, new section 15A in the 1956 Act, being inserted by section 5 of the Bill, which provides a special scheme for the naturalisation of spouses of Irish nationals, contains at subsection (2) a provision whereby the Minister may waive certain of the conditions for naturalisation of spouses. The conditions which can be waived include the residence requirements in the island of Ireland at subsection (1)(f) and (g) of that section, where the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider sections 4 and 5, taken together, to be a reasonable and well balanced approach which takes into account the position in the EU and other states. The balance achieved is between the desirability of having a means for non-national spouses to become Irish citizens on the <Col N="21" /> one hand and the protection of the interests of Irish society by reducing the scope for abuses &ndash; to which I referred &ndash; of our citizenship on the other. The conditions attaching to this special scheme of naturalisation are not in any sense unreasonable and would be regarded in many states as basic requirements for the grant, something which I am sure we value greatly and would not wish to see bestowed lightly or dishonoured by abuse. We can discuss them in more detail when we come to section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For a man who is so assertive about his willingness to explain himself, the Minister did not explain why he retains absolute discretion after all these conditions. Is this because he is embarrassed by it? Are Ministers perfect? Do they never act out of mistaken belief or prejudice? The rest of us make mistakes and jump to conclusions. We do things which perhaps we should not, which is why any powers we have are constrained by the law and the Constitution and none of us can act out our fantasies, prejudices or our less than worthy impulses. However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can say what he likes &ndash; he has absolute discretion. Will the Minister tell me what constraints there are on his absolute discretion? A person cannot appeal to the courts and the Minister does not have to explain himself to anybody. I have a letter in which he says he does not propose to give any reasons for his decisions because he has absolute discretion.</P>
      <P>Spouses of Irish citizens must go through all the hoops &ndash; I have no objection to many of them although some are impractical &ndash; before they can apply and the Minister can refuse them without a reason or an explanation of what conditions they must meet. This is the nub of the issue and he will not discuss it because it is indefensible. The power which already exists under naturalisation is indefensible and I am certain that sooner or later he will be caught in the courts. Just as he was caught on deportation, he will be caught on this absolute indiscretion. It is an extraordinary power to claim for oneself in a democracy.</P>
      <P>The Minister is now saying he has absolute discretion <i>vis-à-vis</i> the spouse of an Irish citizen to decide whether they can become Irish citizens or not. That is what is less than worthy in the Minister's speech and the explanatory memorandum. They do not address the nub of the issue which is the complete reversal of the situation. Prior to this, there were conditions which gave one a right. Now there are conditions which one has to meet before one can apply to the Minister who will then exercise his absolute discretion. During this debate, either now or later, the Minister will have to address this issue or we will be here until midnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not leave this House without the Minister explaining to me what absolute discretion means, why he believes he must have it and why he has introduced such a fundamental change. The conditions are not the fundamental change, although <Col N="22" /> I do not like some of them. The fundamental change is that we have gone from having a right to having none. The only right spouses will have is to apply for naturalisation. They must meet certain conditions and then they can apply. As far as I am concerned, that is totalitarian.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, it is not possible for me to give Senator Henry the precise <Col N="23" /> number for the simple reason that I do not know the extent of the fraud. However, I am aware that the Department of Foreign Affairs comes across this matter from time to time. If Senators Ryan or Henry can table an amendment this afternoon which will ensure that abuse does not take place in the future, I will be willing to consider it. I am obliged to listen to what the Senators have to say, but if they have a constructive method whereby abuse can be prevented, I will be willing to listen. While the Senators are normally very constructive, on this occasion they have not come forward with proposals which would protect the type of situation emerging which I have described, that is, the whole issue of marriages of convenience whereby people get married in order to become Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>As I have already explained, Irish citizenship is a very valuable possession. My difficulty is bringing forward a measure which will prevent this type of abuse while at the same time satisfying Senators Henry and Ryan. I have no such proposal at present.</P>
      <P>The Laurentiu judgment was a learned judgment which re-emphasised and reinforced the power of the Minister in relation to making decisions on deportation, together with specifying that the policy itself should be laid down in legislation. This measure was introduced in 1935 under the Aliens Act. It was the Aliens Act, 1935, operated under successive Ministers, which was dealt with in that learned judgment. I do not believe the legislation will be found to be unconstitutional. If tested, the Supreme Court or High Court will decide. I am confident it is constitutional. It is my duty to ensure in so far as I can that legislation coming before this House is constitutional. However, I cannot give any guarantee in this regard.</P>
      <P>I remind Senators Ryan and Henry that I am constrained by the rules of natural justice, and this is an excellent thing. In exercising what Senator Ryan describes as an absolute discretion, I must nonetheless have regard to the rules of natural justice and ensure it prevails. If it does not prevail, people can have recourse to the courts. I do not believe that any Minister for Justice worthy of the name would discriminate unfairly against any individual.</P>

      <P>In deference to the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senator Taylor-Quinn, perhaps we should not pursue this issue for too long and wait until we reach the section. For someone who is so sensitive about natural justice, the Minister has a view on absolute discretion. My understanding of natural justice is that if one has a negative judgment made against them, they ought to be entitled to see the evidence on which that judgment was made. I am aware the Minister does not tell people who are refused naturalisation the reasons this has been refused. Perhaps he could begin his commitment to natural justice by meeting that preliminary requirement. People <Col N="24" /> should be informed why naturalisation has been refused and be given the right to reply to the accusations made against them. Currently this is not the case and that is why I am concerned about the issue.</P>

      <P>I will not be repetitive. I am surprised the Minister has no idea of the scale of the problem. To introduce legislation which will adversely affect so many Irish people who may marry non-Irish and are living abroad, I would have thought the Minister must know of thousands of cases. However, I only read of occasional cases in the newspapers. I presume that if it was thought there were fraudulent cases, the Department would have pursued them. I find it extraordinary that such a draconian measure is being introduced when it appears there is no knowledge in the Department about the scale of the problem.</P>

      <P>As someone who some time ago lived in London for a number of years, I am satisfied, from first-hand information, that marriages of convenience in order to obtain Irish citizenship were widespread at a particular time. This was well documented. Whether the Minister or the Department of Foreign Affairs have the figures is irrelevant because this happened in another jurisdiction. I believe the number was several hundreds. The practice was quite common during a certain period until the incident in the embassy brought it to a head. It is not too long ago since there was uproar in this House regarding the alleged passports for sale controversy whereby a number of people from foreign countries received passports by investing money in this country when investment and jobs were badly needed. Even though the numbers involved were trivial, there was uproar in this House, particularly on the Opposition side. Yet when the Minister tries to introduce a measure which will restrict abuse in the issue of Irish passports, which should be done, there is an outcry and a claim that this is wrong. We cannot have it both ways. If just a dozen passports are granted for spurious reasons, such as contrived marriages of convenience in Great Britain, South America or wherever, then we should legislate against this practice.</P>
      <P>We seem to have been debating sections 4 and 5 rather than section 1. It is a pity these sections were not taken together as they are co-related and I fear there will be a rehash of the debate. I am not criticising what Senator Ryan said because I know he is sincere in his views. However, in essence, what we have been discussing for the last 45 minutes is sections 4 and 5. These sections are inter-related and should have been taken together.</P>

      <P>I have already outlined that the Laurentiu case reinforced and re-emphasised the discretion of the Minister of the day, the Executive, in regard to naturalisation matters. That matter has come before the courts on a number of occasions and the courts have upheld the right of the Minister. This may come as a surprise to the Senators, but that is the position. The Laurentiu case is an example of that. When the Supreme Court dealt with this case, which dealt with deportation of a failed applicant for asylum, there is no question that the right of the Minister in this respect was reinforced and re-emphasised. In his judgment, Mr. Justice Keane &ndash; soon to be Chief Justice &ndash; expressed a concern about the delegation of powers to non-elected officials. He was concerned that those who were elected would exercise the powers for which they were elected. In that context, there are no circumstances in which there is a particular attitude in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; not in my time. In fact, policy is determined firmly, reasonably and fairly &ndash; though Senator Ryan may not agree &ndash; by me as Minister and by the Government and that is the way it should be. Any notion to the effect that the attitudes of particular officials are paramount is nonsense. It is also unfair to the officials concerned to say things like that.</P>
      <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 to 1994, give the Minister absolute discretion in naturalisation matters. That is a matter of fact and implies that even if an applicant meets the criteria for naturalisation set out in the Act, it does not follow that the Minister must grant naturalisation. Any other arrangement would change the nature of naturalisation from a privilege bestowed on the applicant as a right. Of course, none of this absolves the Minister from the requirement to follow fair procedures in considering applications for naturalisation. The Minister is obliged, without question, to follow fair procedures and there is no doubt about that. It is also true to say that the courts have upheld the right of the Minister of the day not to disclose information to applicants as to why they did not obtain naturalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What am I doing here in this legislation? I am doing no more than is done in the United States, which is a traditional country of immigration. In the United States the position is that if someone marries a United States citizen, the procedure I am setting out in this legislation is followed. I am doing nothing that is in entirely or in any sense illiberal &ndash; I am applying common sense. I am ensuring our citizenship laws are not abused. That is what I am trying to do. If any Senator has a formula which would be better than this, I like to think I am reasonable and would listen to it. Senator Ryan is quite correct &ndash; even the Pope <Col N="26" /> has accepted he is not infallible and what is good enough for the Pope is good enough for me. In that context I am telling Senators I am not trying to disadvantage or be unfair to anybody. If a Senator has a formula which resolves this abuse of Irish citizenship, tell me what it is and I will listen to it.</P>

Were I give to a figure that was to prove wholly and wildly inaccurate, I would probably then be accused of giving wrong information to the House.

      <P>It is very easy to deal with the Minister's problem, which is to add those conditions in section 5 to the conditions that already exist and then give anyone who meets them the right to citizenship. That simply means that the conditions are met &ndash; the situation is tightened up with a residency requirement and some other matters. Anyone who applies for citizenship will have to have lived here for a considerable period.</P>
      <P>The Minister is saying that because there are a number of abuses &ndash; the precise number of which he cannot say &ndash; he is going to take away the rights and certainties of the vast majority of non-Irish citizens lawfully married to Irish citizens in order to deal with a problem, though he cannot tell us the precise magnitude of that problem.</P>

However, on two successive years, two 15 year old Asians from Shipley College, Bradford, who were coming to Ireland on an educational tour organised by their school in the 1980s, were refused visas to enter the State. As there is no accountability and nobody will discuss the issue, one can only conclude that they were picked out because they were Asians. They were on a school tour and were going back to the UK, where they were legal residents, when they were finished.</P>

      <P>Senators will recall that on Second Stage I undertook to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to the commencement provisions for section 9(3) of the Bill which would have the effect of stitching into the Bill the specific date the new sections 6 and 7 of the Act as inserted by section 3 of the Bill are to have effect. These new sections deal with the changes to citizenship by birth in Ireland consequent on new Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and restatement of the law on citizenship by descent. Amendment No. 8 spells out that these provisions will, once passed into law, operate with effect from that historic day, 2 December 1998, on which the Government made the declaration under Article 29.7.3º of the Constitution which brought new Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution into effect. That intention was already clear from the terms of the Bill as introduced. This amendment will have the effect that future readers of the Bill, when enacted, will have full <Col N="28" /> information on the operation of the Act as well as a reminder of that significant day.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 6 are consequential drafting amendments to the interpretation and other commencement provisions of the Bill to ensure that the necessary definitions also operate with effect from 2 December 1999.

      <P>The Senator normally asks difficult questions. The definition of Ireland is being removed. The present definition is based on that of the national territory in the former Article 2 of the Constitution. The new Article 2 contains no corresponding definition. It refers to the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas. Section 2(d) provides that reference to the island of Ireland in the Act includes a reference to its islands and seas. References to Ireland occurring elsewhere in the 1956 Act at present are replaced by references to the island of Ireland or to the State as contextually appropriate. Those occurrences, which are not covered by substantive replacement sections, by repeal or otherwise, are dealt with at section 8 which deals with miscellaneous amendments. I am sure everybody will accept that this is a progressive change, as is the deletion of the definition of alien.</P>

Building on his welcome deletion of the term &ldquo;alien&rdquo;, he should address terms in other legislation in his capacity as Minister with responsibility for law reform. Our legislation, historically, is full of offensive and vulgar language, particularly that dealing with people who are mentally handicapped, which would not be used <Col N="29" /> in society any more. It would be useful to pursue a programme of the removal of that language from legislation. Some of the language dealing with children and handicapped children dates back 20 or 30 years and contains offensive phrases that I do not even want to put on record. Their removal would be useful. I accept the Minister is busy but given that he accepts the principle that language should represent our values, it is important this matter, which would come under law reform legislation, should be on the agenda.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat confused on this matter but I am sure the Minister will be able to clarify the position. I accept that a considerable <Col N="30" /> purpose of this section is to ensure that those born on the island of Ireland or on Rathlin Island who do not want to become Irish citizens are not coerced into being Irish citizens, but does the position on citizenship by birth still maintain? Section 6 of Part II of the 1956 Act dealing with citizenship states that every person born in Ireland is an Irish citizen from birth. There are no qualifications about that, whereas in this section a person seeking citizenship would have to jump through a number of hoops.</P>
      <P>We have discussed this matter previously. If a pregnant lady from Latvia, her husband and two children booked into a guest house in Gardiner Street, not intending to stay here for long but the lady went into premature labour and gave birth to a baby in the Rotunda Hospital, under the 1956 Act that child would be a citizen of Ireland and his or her parents and siblings would be entitled to stay here. The Minister may not believe this might happen but I aware of similar cases. Such a child's parents and siblings would not be citizens but under the 1956 Act they would be entitled to stay here because such a child would be entitled to the care and comfort of his or her parents under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which we have signed, and under a Supreme Court judgment handed down in 1991. Will that situation still pertain if section 3 is passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has outlined the present law on this matter very well. Since 1956 the statutory position has been that every person born on the island of Ireland is an Irish citizen. As she correctly outlined, this applies irrespective of the immigration status of one or either of the parents. One effect of the new Article 2 of the Constitution is to declare the constitutional entitlement and birthright of every person born on the island of Ireland to be part of the Irish nation. The new section 6 of the 1956 Act provides that section 3 of the Bill reflects this constitutional entitlement. In a nutshell, there was a statutory entitlement and now there will be a constitutional entitlement. This is much stronger than a statutory entitlement.</P>
      <P>There was a landmark decision in the Fajujonu case in 1989 in which the Supreme Court held that when non-nationals had resided for an appreciable time and become a family unit in the State with children who were Irish citizens, such children had the constitutional right to the company and care of their parents. This was a landmark decision for obvious reasons. It was a good decision with which most people would agree. Although the parents as non-nationals had no constitutional right to remain in Ireland, they were entitled to assert the choice of residence on behalf of their minor children in the interests of those children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parents of Irish children have the alternative of applying for residency on this basis. Such applications are generally granted by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The only <Col N="31" /> matter which would militate against such an application would be a strong public interest in the opposite direction. As Senator Henry pointed out, minor siblings are also allowed to remain. The families of Irish born children are in practice allowed to take up employment without the need for a work permit and, Senator Ryan will be glad to hear, to set up a business without seeking the Minister's permission. In respect of applications over the last two years, 1,300 people have been given permission to remain in the country on the grounds of having an Irish born child. The move from a statutory right to a constitutional right, allied to the landmark judgment, takes account in a caring way of the position of Irish born children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the position when there is a marriage and when people are living together as partners? The rules in sections 4 and 5 are specific but what is the position if a married couple is living in Ireland, where one partner is a non-national and has not complied with the rules for citizenship under the Bill, and a baby is born? What is the situation if an Irishman is living in Ireland with a non-national, such as an Asian girl, and they have a child? What citizenship applies to a child whose mother is Asian and father is Irish and who are living in this jurisdiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined in regard to the position of a child born in this jurisdiction, it would not matter if the person concerned was Asian or of other extraction. This would be irrelevant. The same position I outlined in regard to Irish born children would apply. The nationality of the father or the mother in that respect would not matter once the child was born in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn wants to know the position if the child was born abroad. If that was the case and the child had an Irish father, for example, he or she would have citizenship by descent. I hope that answers the Senator's query.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position if a couple is not married and do not have a legal marriage certificate in the jurisdiction in which they reside but the father is claiming paternity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter whether they are married. That is irrelevant. The Status of Children Act, 1987, abolished the distinction in so far as there was a difference at that time between a child born in marriage or outside marriage. It would not make any difference whether the couple was married. It would not be a determining factor in terms of the child having Irish citizenship. If the child was born in Ireland, the position is that he or she would be an Irish citizen. Otherwise, if one of the parents is Irish, the child is entitled to citizenship by descent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of Irish law regarding citizenship by descent, as provided under sections 6 and 7 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, <Col N="32" /> 1956, or under the proposed section 7, to be replaced by section 3 of the Bill, apply irrespective of the marital status of the parents. Section 5 of the Status of Children Act, 1987, states:</P>
    <P>It is hereby declared that, in relation to a child, any reference to father, mother or parent in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and 1986, includes and shall be deemed always to have included the father, mother or parent as the case may require who was not married to the child's other parent at the time of the child's birth or at any time during the period of 10 months preceding the birth.</P>
    <P>For example, a person born abroad who can show that his or her father or mother was an Irish citizen, even if the parents were not married to each other, may be able to claim Irish citizenship by registering in the foreign births register. He or she must make a claim because he or she is outside the State. Unfortunately, I do not have figures regarding the frequency of such births. The Department of Foreign Affairs rather than my Department is involved with regard to the foreign births register. I hope this answers Senator Taylor-Quinn's query.</P>

      <P>I have moved to a different seat because I am having trouble hearing due to 12 flights in 12 days. Why is subsection (3) included? It states that a person born in the island of Ireland is an Irish citizen from birth. Why is it necessary to also include &ldquo;if he or she is not entitled to citizenship of any other country&rdquo;? It is curious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry asked why section 3(3) is included. The blunt answer is that it is to avoid what I would describe as statelessness. Section 6(3) provides for the passive circumstance that a person born in Ireland who had no entitlement to citizenship of another state would be an Irish citizen. This applies to most people born in the State after 1 January 1949. This is the effective date for the British Nationality Act, 1948, which is a United Kingdom Act. People born in the State before that can also claim British citizenship. The idea is to avoid statelessness. We do not want a limbo in our citizenship laws. This is the concept behind the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>How could they be stateless? If they were born here they would be entitled to be Irish citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>But is that not the whole point? I accept this matter is complex. A person has an entitlement to be an Irish citizen. For example, if I live in Belfast and do not want to be an Irish citizen I need not be an Irish citizen. It is a question of entitlement. The concept behind it is one of inclusiveness and allowing people to make up their own minds.</P>

      <P>The option is available. The idea behind subsection (3) is to avoid statelessness. Senator Henry asks what is the need for this subsection if one is already a citizen. The reason is that it is an entitlement where one can exercise the option. I trust that alleviates any concerns the Senator may have in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that it does not cover that issue. I appreciate the view expressed by Senator Henry but subsection (3) seeks to avoid the statelessness of a person who does not exercise an option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate this is a complex and difficult matter. I am a bit bothered about section 6 which is to be inserted in the 1956 Act, subsection (1) of which states: &ldquo;Every person born in the island of Ireland is entitled to be an Irish citizen.&rdquo; That seems absolute, unambiguous and clear. Subsection (3) states: &ldquo;A person born in the island of Ireland is an Irish citizen from birth if he or she is not entitled to citizenship . . . &rdquo; I understand subsection (3) would apply to citizens of Northern Ireland. They are entitled to be Irish citizens because they are born in the island of Ireland, but unlike those of us who were born here they do not automatically become Irish citizens because they are entitled to be citizens of some other state.</P>
      <P>A document produced by the Minister's Department about a year ago suggested the question of automatic citizenship for the children of asylum seekers might have to be reconsidered. Some people are concerned that the children of two Romas here who were born in this State are entitled to citizenship of Romania. I cannot see how we can do this one way and not the other. If we were to imply that the child of two Romanians was not entitled to citizenship, then equally anybody born in Northern Ireland would not be entitled to citizenship either. My understanding of the difference is that an Irish citizen from the moment of birth has the unqualified right to become an Irish citizen without any dilution of that right, but in the second case one has to ask for it or, if under age, somebody has to ask for it for you. Senator Henry has had eminent members of the legal profession interpret it quite differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it from this section that all people born in the island of Ireland, including the Unionist community in Northern Ireland, automatically become citizens of the island of Ireland now? Is it true that, as the <Col N="34" /> law stands and until the abolition of Articles 2 and 3, all people in the 32 counties of Ireland were automatically citizens of Ireland under the Constitution? As the law stands, are most of the elderly Unionist community in Northern Ireland citizens of the island of Ireland or the Republic as was the case until the Constitution was amended? Will this legislation ensure that all communities in Northern Ireland continue to be citizens of the island of Ireland or will they have to repudiate that citizenship or confirm seeking that citizenship? We recognise there is a Northern Ireland dimension to this section and Senator Ryan raised the broader dimension at international level. There is a need for further clarification of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed comprehensively on Second Stage. My understanding of the point raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn is that under the provisions of this Bill, birth in the island of Ireland or any of its islands gives an option to people in Northern Ireland, particularly those of the Unionist tradition. There is no obligation or compulsion on a person living in Northern Ireland who wishes to take up the option of becoming a British citizen but it provides a platform, if they so wish, to do it. It is not forced upon them. The thrust of this legislation is to give an option to people on the island, particularly those in Northern Ireland, who may choose otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation reflects the Good Friday Agreement. The objective of the exercise is to ensure that all people born in the island of Ireland, North and South, have an entitlement to Irish citizenship. Anybody born in the jurisdiction is an Irish citizen. It was not the case under the 1937 Constitution that people born in the North were Irish citizens, though that was a widely held belief. The legal situation is changed through this legislation. What will now happen is that a person born in the North will have an entitlement to be an Irish citizen. Obviously the legislation does not specify what act is required by an individual to exercise that right of entitlement but one can envisage the kind of circumstances which would be required. For example, if a person applied for an Irish passport, that could be validly interpreted as a person exercising his or her right or entitlement to be an Irish citizen; if one were to make a declaration of citizenship under the citizenship Acts, that would also be interpreted as a person exercising his or her entitlement; seeking to register one's child under the foreign birth register would be reasonably interpreted as an act which would lead one to conclude that one was exercising his or her entitlement to be an Irish citizen; seeking to be registered on the register of electors or exercising a right to vote could reasonably be interpreted as leading to the conclusion that a person was exercising his or her entitlement to be an Irish citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> Many people born in the North of Ireland do not want to be included automatically as part of the nation consistent with the British-Irish Agreement and it is important that they are in a position to exercise their entitlement also. Therefore, the doing of any act of the nature which I have described is a reasonable way of dealing with the issue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of section 6(3), to which the Senators referred, the position is that we had to avoid the case where a person might be stateless altogether. What we are providing for there is somebody who is passive, in other words, somebody who does none of the things which I have mentioned. If that person did not have an entitlement to citizenship of another state, then section 6(3) catches such a situation and that person would be deemed to be an Irish citizen. As I said, it applies to most people born in the State after 1 January 1949, which was the effective date for the British Nationality Act, 1948, because people born in this State before that date can claim British citizenship also.</P>
    <P>I hope that explains the position, although I suppose it is fair to say that section 6(3) might be pointed to by people born in the North of Ireland as discriminating against them because they will have to take an active step to show that they are Irish whereas most people born in the State are Irish by default. It would be impossible, however, to argue logically against section 6(3) because it could lead to a vacuum in which the citizenship of a large number of people was uncertain from an international perspective. That would not be right. Therefore, there would be no procedural difference &ndash; this is crucial &ndash; between people North or South demonstrating that they are Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>I accept it is quite complex but I hope my explanation is adequate because, as Senators pointed out, this is very important. It is necessary that we debate it fully. I am glad the issues have been raised so that I had the opportunity to answer, dare I say it, very intelligent questions on this subject.</P>

      <P>Section 6(3) of the 1956 Act, to put this in perspective, provides that &ldquo;Every person born in the island of Ireland is an Irish citizen from birth&rdquo;&ndash; we will take that as the starting point. Section 7(1) of that Act provides that</P>
      <P>Pending the re-integration of the national territory, subsection (1) of section 6 shall not apply to a person, not otherwise an Irish citizen, [in effect, by descent] born in Northern Ireland . . .  after the 6th December, 1922, unless, in the prescribed manner, that person . . .  declares himself to be an Irish citizen.</P>
      <P>It was necessary, therefore, for the person to make a declaration to become an Irish citizen. What we have done here, in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, as I have already stated, is to give people an entitlement. I instanced the ways in which they can be seen to exercise that entitlement, but the important thing is that the entitlement is the same for everybody.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been helpful. I have two questions. First, how does somebody who is underage indicate that he or she wishes to be an Irish citizen? Second, in particular, if the person needs somebody of full age to make the declaration for him or her, what about families in Northern Ireland where the children want to be Irish citizens and the parents do not? Must the children wait until they are 18?</P>

      <P>A person need not be of full age to obtain Irish citizenship. For example, if the parents were to make an application on his or her behalf for an Irish passport, that would mean that the child was an Irish citizen or they could decide to make a declaration and the descent rule would then apply. In this respect, it is important from the perspective of Senator Taylor-Quinn's questions that I would point out that in 1956, the year in which I was born and the year of the legislation on which we are speaking, there was an inter-party Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 22, to delete subsection (1).</P>
      <P>This amendment is part of my continuing opposition to the whole thrust of what I regard as using a sledgehammer to crack a nut or, more appropriately, using a JCB to plant a cabbage. The subsection is entirely out of proportion to the issue. I have no problem with an amendment either to section 8 of the 1986 Act or to section 8 as amended by the insertion of section 3 of the 1986 Act. I have no problem with any attempt to tighten up those parts of the Bill. We could debate the precise conditions forever and it would be a worthwhile debate, but my problem is that currently an Irish person who marries abroad knows with certainty that their spouse can become an Irish citizen subject to certain simple conditions. They know that all they have to do is meet the conditions. We can argue forever about what those conditions should be.</P>
      <P>I genuinely have some problems with the idea that if one is intent on making sure one's spouse becomes an Irish citizen, one has to check out whether they have a criminal record. The phrase &ldquo;good character&rdquo; is fine, in general, for applications for naturalisation. Spouses of Irish citizens are in a unique and different situation, however, and therefore we cannot attempt to transpose the conditions that are applicable to naturalisation generally. It would be helpful if we knew the scale of the problem, but to take away the certainty from every Irish citizen who marries a non-national and replace it ultimately with the Minister's absolute discretion is wrong. The simple way around this is that section 5(1) should read:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation to the non-national spouse of an Irish citizen if satisfied that the applicant&ndash;</P>
      <P>It should not read &ldquo;may, in his or her absolute discretion&rdquo;, but &ldquo;if satisfied that they meet the conditions&rdquo;. That would leave an Irish citizen who marries a non-national certain that the spouse could become an Irish citizen, subject to the conditions that are laid down in subparagraphs (a) to (i).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would deal with the issue of abuse, although I am not necessarily agreeing with all these conditions. If the Minister wants a middle road, however, it is fair enough to tighten up the con<Col N="39" /> ditions because some of them may be too loose. Ireland is now an appealing place, for reasons of prosperity. An Irish passport generally generates goodwill everywhere. There is a case for tightening up the conditions, but the Minister has made no case for eliminating the certainty that already existed. The conditions can be changed, but there is no reason to eliminate the certainty. All the Minister needs to do is dispense with a phrase that was taken over from the provisions for naturalisation generally and inserted here, but which is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>This is a very specific case and it is wrong to pretend that naturalisation or citizenship on grounds of marriage is in any way similar to naturalisation generally. This is a very different situation. We have certain rights in our Constitution concerning marriage and the sanctity of the family. To put the relationship between husband and wife, and the certainty that was there&mdash;</P>

I do not want to start using the sort of language again that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform brings out in me on a regular basis, but that is the solution to the Minister's problem.

      <P>I agree with what Senator Ryan has said about this section. Increasingly, Irish people go abroad to work. Young people, many of whom are graduates, get jobs all over the world and then come back having married somebody from another country. That is occurring on an increasing basis. In addition, many Irish people work abroad with voluntary organisations, including APSO, Trócaire and Concern. They do wonderful work in the Third World and meet people from the host country or from other countries, who are engaged in similar voluntary work. They may end up getting married and do so in the knowledge that there are fairly straightforward rules and regulations governing the situation relating to their spouse. It is not commendable to change these rules at this point. There may be a need to tighten up the rules because problems have arisen in this regard and, up to a point, we can see the Minister's position. However, young Irish people are increasingly going abroad and coming back to reside here with a wealth of experience. Making things more difficult for them when they have got married and are coming back to live here can put a huge strain on married relationships and make life quite difficult. In view of the demands and financial pressures on people, especially when they are relocating from another country, this section represents an added and unnecessary pressure. The Minister should review his position on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to the House the difficulty which presents itself here. There is no question that there has been abuse of this provision whereby a person who is married for three years can automatically be entitled to citizenship of this State. There is no doubt about that abuse, details of which have been communicated to my Department by the Department of Foreign Affairs. I feel obliged to ensure that the abuse is dealt with. It is important that the State is protected and that the State's citizenship laws are respected at home and abroad. I cannot allow that kind of flagrant abuse to continue under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody would disagree with me when I say that even the condition which currently exists might militate against the person obtaining citizenship. For example, at the present time the person must be married to the other person for three years. There are circumstances where people's marriages break down within that period. It is not correct to say that the current situation is without any condition because the three year rule is there. The present system of post-nuptial citizenship is unsatisfactory for the reasons I have outlined because it permits non-nationals to declare themselves to be Irish citizens when certain conditions are fulfilled. It does not contain safeguards against abuse, and that is what I am trying to do. At the present time the marriage must be subsisting and both persons living together as husband and wife. If these conditions are fulfilled at the time of the post-nuptial citizenship declaration, the declaration is still valid even if they cease to be fulfilled immediately afterwards. This does happen, incidentally. In a recent case, the Irish partner approached my Department and asked that the post nuptial citizenship declaration not be accepted. However, if the declaration is validly made we have no option but to accept it.</P>
      <P>It might be agreed that a major defect of post nuptial citizenship declarations at present is the absence of a good character condition. A person of bad character should not be granted Irish citizenship just because they happen to marry an Irish citizen. That is a fair assessment.</P>
      <P>We need to exercise control over who is granted the privilege of citizenship. For this purpose, I respectfully submit to the House, the Minister must have discretion. Naturalisation cannot be automatic. However, as I have said all along, the Minister's discretion must be validly exercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of now, no amendment has been tabled in this regard, other than what Senator Ryan stated in his contribution. I had hoped we would proceed with the Bill this afternoon but if Senator Ryan wants to table an amendment I will give him the opportunity to do so &ndash; it would be unfair of me to try to rush the Bill through the House without providing that opportunity. However, I <Col N="41" /> must advise that I might not accede to such an amendment. I will certainly consider it&mdash;</P>

      <P>If an amendment is tabled I will give it every consideration, but my initial reaction is not to agree to it. There are a number of reasons for that which I will not go into now. However, the issue of absolute discretion, for example, has been upheld by our courts. The constitutional position is quite clear and was confirmed in the recent very learned judgment in the Laurentiu case by the incoming Chief Justice. If he is of the view that the right of the Minister to discretion needs to be reinforced or re-emphasised, I do not believe Senator Ryan or anyone else will argue about its constitutionality. However, the Senator might argue clearly and logically that this discretion should not exist and I am willing to listen to that argument. If he wants to table an amendment, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will give it every possible consideration.</P>

      <P>What is the legal position of the spouse of an Irish citizen who would not otherwise have the right to reside here? Does the fact that such a person is married to an Irish citizen give him or her any right to reside here? If I married someone who was not entitled to live here &ndash; for example, someone who was not a resident of the EU or the European Economic Area &ndash; would the fact that she was married to an Irish citizen give her the right to reside here?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard the advice from the Minister's official, which was, &ldquo;Effectively, yes&rdquo;. Therefore, anyone married to an Irish citizen can, effectively, reside here. The question then is about the conditions under which they get citizenship.</P>
      <P>My problem is that the two situations are extremely different. In one case, a person is married to an Irish citizen and is, therefore, part of an Irish family and is, by definition, in most cases the mother or father of children who are Irish citizens if they were born here.</P>
      <P>I have no problem dealing with abuse. The engineer in me rebels against the idea of solving an undefined problem. The intelligent approach to any problem is to quantify it first. I spend a month at the beginning of first year chemical engineering telling my students not to start solving a problem until they know what it is. The Minister says he does not know how big the problem is but he knows it is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a constitutional right to freedom of speech, as does every citizen of this State. There is no doubt that right is abused. However, the fact that a right is abused is not a reason to abolish it. That is the fundamental point. If this were carried through to other areas, the Minister would have <Col N="42" /> an absolute discretion to decide who could exercise the right to freedom of speech because people abuse that right scandalously. The fact that a right is abused is no justification for abolishing it. The right to trial by jury, the right to silence and the right to use an alibi are abused but there is no reason to abolish them. Similarly, the right to citizenship by marriage is abused. However, I do not believe it is abused on a very great scale and, even if it is, the entire resources of the Government of this State cannot, or have not bothered, to quantify it.</P>
    <P>We could deal with the genuine issue, which is abuse by people outside the State for the most part, by the conditions the Minister has inserted. However, the Minister should not deal with it by the removal, not of the right of the person to be naturalised but of the right of an Irish citizen to have his or her spouse treated properly. That is what is being taken away. We are saying to Irish citizens who marry non-nationals that, even if they meet reasonable conditions, we will still not give them any right to citizenship, just because other non-citizens living in the State have no absolute right. That situation is entirely different. There is a reasonable presumption that people who have been in a subsisting marriage for three years are here for the long haul.</P>
    <P>The fair balance to deal with the Minister's problem &ndash; which he cannot quantify but which I accept he believes is real &ndash; is to tighten the conditions that must be met but to make them objective conditions. In other words, while the Minister must be satisfied, reasons must be given if he is not satisfied. People can then either appeal that decision or meet the conditions in a second application.</P>
    <P>The Minister is essentially saying he cannot be certain he has thought up every possible condition and, therefore, he wants to reserve this right. The Bill requires an applicant to be of full age, good character, married for three years, in a recognised marriage, living together as husband and wife, have at the time of the application one year's continuous residence, have during the four years immediately preceding that period a total of two years residence, intend in good faith to continue to reside here etc. Those are enough hoops to put someone who meets those conditions through.</P>
    <P>While one in every thousand might still abuse the situation, Irish people's rights are important. An Irish citizen has a right to be certain that his or her spouse has the right to become a citizen. For example, if the spouse were refused citizenship and the Irish citizen died, a person with no children who had lived in this State for 20 years could lose the right to reside in this State because his or her spouse had died. Imagine that prospect for an Irish citizen. A person could be refused citizenship for reasons about which we do not know at the Minister's absolute discretion.</P>
    <P>Irish citizens are entitled to certainty. We can debate the nuances of that certainty and the degree to which there must be a tightening up. <Col N="43" /> That would be a useful and interesting debate, particularly, as I said, if we had some evidence of the scale of abuse. However, there is no room for negotiation on the removal of the certainty which Irish citizens used to have. That is the issue and the reason I put down my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no certainty about this matter because there is provision in our law in regard to the issue of people being married for three years and living with one another for three years. Marriages have broken down within a three year period. Let us be perfectly frank about it &ndash; that happens. Senator Ryan seeks to draw an analogy between absolute rights and constitutional rights on the one hand and, on the other, a right which has its basis in statute which can be removed by statute. He went on to argue passionately and eloquently about an amendment which he has not tabled.</P>

The opportunity is there for Senator Ryan to put down an amendment if he wishes. I understand the constraints of time and the pressures under which Senators operate and so on. I am prepared to discontinue today and to come back another day to consider Senator Ryan's amendment on Report Stage. It would be less than honest of me not to say to the Senator that my initial reaction would be not to accede to his request, but I will look at it if he wishes to put down an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> The issue is that the termination, for example, of the post nuptial citizenship scheme will not adversely affect the situation of non-national spouses in terms of their joining their Irish spouses in this State. Any person who marries a foreign national is entitled to bring his or her spouse into this State. I do not seek to impose any restrictions on them. The person concerned is entitled to work, for example. There are no immigration limitations operating which would inhibit non-nationals, who are spouses of nationals, coming into this country. Present immigration arrangements recognise the special position of spouses of Irish nationals and, regardless of their nationality, they are not required to hold work permits before entering the employment market.</P>
    <P>It is not a requirement that a non-national spouse must obtain Irish citizenship before coming here. If it were otherwise, it would be most unfair. I accept that. Senator Ryan said the engineer in him advocates not asking people to solve problems which are not stated or evolved. Was it Lord Longford who, when questioned about an unsolvable problem, said that he had the solution to the problem and that the solution to the problem was that there was no solution? Life does not, as Senator Ryan will be aware, conform to the very strict rules of chemical engineering. If it were otherwise, I would suggest to him the probability that Wordsworth would never have written <i>Tintern Abbey</i> and I doubt if Caligula would have made his horse a senator.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not rely on IQ tests to measure intelligence. The Minister is playing games. He is perfectly entitled to come in here, and we can argue the toss about all these conditions. I have my doubts about the question of good character &ndash; it is a peculiar one. However, he will not explain why he insists on reserving this absolute discretion to himself. Of what is the Department afraid? What has made the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister determined to reserve for themselves an unqualified right to say they do not care if a person meets all the conditions, they will not get an Irish passport? That is what it says and it is what absolute discretion means. It means a person can meet all the conditions, and the Minister knows there are people living in this State who have met all the conditions under section 15 of the 1956 Act and who have been refused naturalisation at the Minister's absolute discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he can do so there, he can do so here. The trouble with doing it here is that it is not only the <Col N="45" /> rights of a non-national which are in question but he is taking away the right to certainly of an Irish citizen. The Minister is a trained logician because I understand solicitors do some logic. I am not talking about certainty about what will happen in the future but about the certainty of knowing the conditions which have to be met. The conditions currently are that a person is legally married and remains married for three years. The fact that some marriages break up before three years is not what I am talking about. I am talking about the fact that two people who are married, one of whom is an Irish citizen, should know with absolute certainty that after three years the non-Irish spouse can make a declaration which makes him or her an Irish citizen. If the Minister wants to add additional conditions to that and to say that if he is satisfied those conditions are met, the person shall be entitled to be an Irish citizen, I would have no problem with that because that deals with his issue, which is abuse. He can then be satisfied that all those conditions are met. If he is satisfied that the person is not, for instance, intending in good faith to continue to reside in Ireland after naturalisation, he can say so and the courts can sort it out. However, he does not have to say so. He will not allow himself to be asked to say so. Instead, he is including absolute discretion. He has removed it from where the courts have accepted it is reasonable, which is where people who have no other connection with Irish people &ndash; they are not married to an Irish person and are applying strictly on the grounds that they are living here.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are many reasons it might not be refused. This is a different situation. We are potentially talking about the father or mother of an Irish child or people who marry when they are older and who have no children. We are talking about the fact that they cannot be sure after meeting any set of conditions that they are guaranteed an Irish passport. That is not fair.</P>
    <P>One can be certain that citizens of Bulgaria, Romania, Nigeria or Somalia married to Irish citizens who do not possess Irish passports and who travel home regularly to visit their families will encounter difficulties on each occasion they pass through immigration control in this country. It is more than likely that these people will be delayed and obliged to prove their identity. That is the nature of the system and it would be very difficult for citizens of those four countries who continue to carry a passport issued in any of them to re-enter Ireland having visited their families. These people are entitled to know the circumstances under which they can escape, if they wish to do so, from that invidious position. However, the Minister will not grant them that certainty. He is intent on imposing on them a series of extra conditions with which they must comply before they are allowed to apply. The Minister continues in his desire to retain the power of absolute discretion without being accountable to anyone but, as he indicated, according to the principles of natural justice. His understanding of natural <Col N="46" /> justice is that he does not have to explain his decisions to anyone. That is a peculiar concept.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister address the issues raised by inclusion of the term &ldquo;his or her absolute discretion&rdquo;, which is the only major point of disagreement between us. He indicated that I can table an amendment on Report Stage which will be taken in the near future. Given that the Leader of the House wanted to take all Stages today, I congratulate the Minister on calming him down. However, the Minister also indicated that he will probably not accept the amendment if I table it. Will the Minister inform the House why he feels obliged to retain his power of absolute discretion. With all the conditions to which I referred earlier fulfilled, why does he still believe there is a need for him to retain that power?</P>

      <P>I understand the reasoning behind Senator Ryan's argument. Nonetheless, I wish to take this opportunity to tease out what he had to say. It was for that reason I asked him to table the amendment again on Report Stage in order that we could consider its merits and demerits to see whether his way of proceeding is preferable to mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated earlier, my instinct is to decline to accede to the Senator's request and I explained the constitutional position and that of the courts. Equally importantly I have outlined that in exercising his discretion the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day will obviously be obliged to adhere to fair procedures because natural justice must be dispensed. There is no way around that. The Minister must exercise his discretion in accordance with those rules and <Col N="47" /> he must act constitutionally because, as is clear in Irish law, the High or Supreme Courts can inform him that he may not proceed if the route he proposes to take is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The current position in America is that if I were to marry an American citizen I would not automatically obtain US citizenship and I would be obliged to fulfil the conditions which are laid down in that country. Even then, however, the Executive in the United States retains the discretion to decide whether I should be granted citizenship. It is true that by virtue of being married the path towards obtaining citizenship is considerably less difficult. We propose to follow the American model in this regard.</P>
    <P>American immigration law has often been quoted in this House and elsewhere when discussing, for example, the issue of asylum seekers. However, we are not going to enter into that debate this evening.</P>

      <P>Nonetheless, let it be said that the legislation, by means of the measures I am proposing in respect of non-national spouses, mirrors and reflects the position in the United States of America. I am not saying that everything the American Government does is correct. However, I am stating that I agree with it in this particular instance. The legislation before us reflects the position which obtains in many countries across the globe. It is not as if this is unique to Ireland, it is common practice in many jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>I wish to pose a number of questions. When should the Minister be satisfied? Is the Minister's satisfaction a subjective or an objective matter? If it is felt that the Minister's being satisfied that certain events have taken place is a subjective viewpoint, could the argument not be made that he or she exercising his or her discretion is doing precisely the same thing, making a decision which is subjective? If that is the position, surely the argument can be turned on its head and it can be stated that we are discussing semantics. If, on the other hand, the argument were to be made that the Minister's being satisfied was an objective test, his or her satisfaction &ndash; even if the test was objective &ndash; would, of necessity, still contain a degree of subjectivity. If that is the position&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to remove all of the Minister's powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;it would appear that the Minister is still exercising a discretion, albeit subject to the necessity that he bring on board the conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister were not to consider the conditions and exercise his absolute discretion without doing so or if, for example, he was to exercise the discretion and have undue regard to the conditions, in my view he would be acting outside the <Col N="48" /> laws of natural justice and fair procedures. If a Minister takes such a course of action, the courts are there to deal with such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; has been considered by the courts which held that it is constitutional. The discretionary powers of the Executive in relation to immigration laws have been recognised by the courts as being valid in this respect. There is no easy solution to the problem but there is no doubt that such a problem exists. Senator Ryan might address his mathematical mind to this problem.</P>
    <P>I have an obligation to the people of this country to ensure that their citizenship laws are not abused by people who are clearly doing so at present. It would be wrong of me to exclude entirely Senator Ryan's proposed amendment without giving it consideration. I ask him to submit his amendment in writing on Report Stage and I will consider it. I have told him my initial reaction to his amendment but it does merit my consideration.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Section 4 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will use this opportunity to reply to what the Minister said. I picked the unhappy example of the right to free speech which is a constitutional right. He played a few games with that one. There are many other rights which are not constitutional rights. For instance, I have the legal right to consume alcohol. Prohibition would be constitutional in this State but it would be the wrong response to the abuse by some people of that right. I have the right to drive a car. Unfortunately, 450 people are killed every year due, in most cases, to an abuse of that right. Therefore, we regulate the way that right is exercised to try to minimise the damage that is done. We do not abolish that right. We do not insist that people meet certain conditions to get a driving licence and, when they have met all the conditions, allow the Minister &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo;. We accept that one of the downsides of any right is the possibility that some people will abuse it. We try to write the rules in such a way as to minimise the abuse. We do not abolish the right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is strong on the United States. There is an enormous difference because if the US had the proportion of its population born on its territory and living outside its jurisdiction that we have there would be almost 100 million citizens living outside the US. There are probably a couple of million people who were born in Ireland living outside of this State. Therefore, the way the US regulates citizenship rights for spouses of its citizens is different from the way we, as a small country with a huge number of <Col N="49" /> people who have Irish nationality living outside the State, regulate it. As the Minister will say &ndash; and I might as well anticipate him &ndash; it also means that it leaves us more open to abuse. Therefore, I have no problem provided we are clear that the spouse of an Irish citizen has a right to reside here. I have no problem with the residency qualification. I am not sure we need it but if the Minister wants it then I have no problem with it.</P>
    <P>I always come back to the reason the Minister wants this section. The proposed section 15A(1) states that the Minister may grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation to the non-national spouse of an Irish citizen if satisfied that all the conditions are met. As I said, I am prepared to give him that, but he is saying that even if he is satisfied that all of those conditions are met he can still refuse it. Tell us why he must have that power. That is the nub of all of this. We can argue and fight about the detail at great length. Some of the details are ridiculous. After he is satisfied that all of these conditions are met why must he spoil it all by saying, &ldquo;Even if you meet all the conditions I still will not let you&rdquo;? That is not good law, nor is it a fair way to deal with Irish citizens. He is entitled to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>It would be better if we knew the scale of the problem. He believes there is a problem. My problem with his Department is it believes there are problems all around but no one else can see them. Nevertheless, they believe there is a problem and they want to tighten up the regulations. Let them tighten up the regulations but let us leave something of certainty behind because it has worked for most Irish people. It made life easier for people living outside the State. It was a degree of certainty. Why does he have to say that he cannot consider granting naturalisation certificates until he is satisfied that all the conditions have been met? There is a provision for making some exceptions later on but he must be satisfied they are met. He then wants to say, &ldquo;Even if I am satisfied I can still say no&rdquo;. Why?   </P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental problem with section 5 is that the Minister will have &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; in relation to naturalising someone even if they complete all of the conditions in the proposed section 15A(1)(a) to (i). There is something fundamentally wrong with that. In his earlier reply he referred to objective and subjective assessment and claimed that no matter what way he does it there will be objective and subjective elements to any judgment made. He also said that if a Minister made a decision and disregarded all of the conditions involved in this section he would view it as being contrary to natural justice. He said we would all view it as being contrary to natural justice. He further stated that the applicant would have the alternative to bring his case to the courts for adjudication. It is a ludicrous position that anyone who would make an application could be subjected to <Col N="50" /> that type of rigorous scenario and have to go to the courts of the land to take on the Minister and all that pertains within his Department. It would be a difficult task for a non-national to take on the Minister and the Department to prove that natural justice was not applied.</P>
      <P>Specific conditions are laid down and I will raise questions relating to them. For the Minister or anyone else to grant themselves absolute discretion is contrary to any type of natural justice. He is going down a serious route when providing that &ldquo;in his or her absolute discretion&rdquo; the Minister could refuse naturalisation after someone had complied with all the conditions laid down in this section.</P>
      <P>I would like to know what person or departmental official will make a decision regarding those conditions laid down in this section. We know what &ldquo;is of full age&rdquo; refers to. Paragraph (b) provides that the applicant &ldquo;is of good character&rdquo;. Who decides what good character is? What are the criteria that determine a good character? I would like to have the specific criteria used by the Department to define a good character put on record. Paragraph (c) states: &ldquo;is married to that citizen for a period of not less than 3 years&rdquo;. Paragraph (d) states: &ldquo;is in a marriage recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (e) reads: &ldquo;and that citizen are living together as husband and wife and that citizen submits to the Minister an affidavit in the prescribed form to that effect&rdquo;. What will the Department expect in relation to the definition &ldquo;and that citizen are living together as husband and wife. . . . &rdquo;? Let us get those details.</P>
      <P>Let us suppose that an Irishman goes to Bahrain to work and marries a girl from there. He then returns to Ireland to work here for four or five months but finds himself out of a job. There is employment on offer in Bahrain so he decides to work there for six months. He returns here for six weeks. His wife is still here and he returns to Bahrain to work. This scenario goes on. It is not unusual. This is happening right across the board. People live here but work abroad and spend a long time apart. With regard to the definition of living together as husband and wife, let us get a clear clarification of that definition and what is expected by the Department. People will be excluded because of the way these matters will be defined.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (i) states:</P>
      <P>has made, either before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is a &ldquo;nation&rdquo;? As far as I am aware a nation is a group of people who share the same cultural experiences, language, music, song, religion and a variety of other matters. A nation can cross state borders. A state is a distinct geographic definition of an area of land governed by a government, a nation is a broad spectrum. The Irish nation spans <Col N="51" /> the world because there are people who share the same cultural traditions and language in Australia, the US and elsewhere. The Bill will expect someone from China, for example, to express fidelity to the nation. We need clarification of what is meant by &ldquo;fidelity to the nation&rdquo;. I do not know how someone from China or Japan could go to the District Court and swear fidelity to the nation. I understand how they could swear loyalty to the State but that is a different matter. We are asking the impossible in this paragraph and perhaps the Minister would clarify these points.</P>

      <P>In the film &ldquo;Green Card&rdquo;, Gerard Depardieu became involved in a fraudulent marriage to obtain US citizenship. I wish I had taken more notice of the film as it would have been useful for this debate to know the tricks he used. I would like to think that we would not introduce this section on the basis of anecdotal evidence as to the extent of the problem, but that is all we have been getting. Surely with the records in the courts and the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Minister's officials could discover just how extensive are the attempts to acquire citizenship by way of fraudulent marriages over a ten year period. I suggested the period from 1988 so that we exclude the 1987 episode in London. It would be worthwhile to know how many cases have been before the courts. The Department of Foreign Affairs should be asked about what its undercover agents discovered about the extent of this problem. This is a draconian measure which is being introduced with little evidence of what is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few rambling comments. I was interested in Senator Taylor-Quinn's comments on what constitutes a &ldquo;nation&rdquo;. This question is asked of Leopold Bloom in <i>Ulysses.</i> He says that a nation constitutes the same people living in the same place. Another character then says that he is a nation as he has been living in the same place for ten years. Bloom amends his definition by saying that a nation constitutes people living in different places. A different character, who is constantly on the move, then says that that covers him. This is a difficult grey area with the shifting boundaries suggested by Senator Taylor-Quinn.</P>
      <P>There is also the issue of what constitutes a real marriage and a danger that we will start snooping and prying into people's relationships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen that film but there is an incitement to look into private areas of relationships in a way which is unacceptable. One must accept that marriages which are properly contracted are real marriages. However, throughout Europe there is a phenomenon whereby people contract marriages for the sake of acquir<Col N="52" /> ing passports. I would suggest that marriages be regarded as invalid if proof can be produced of the involvement of a monetary consideration. It is unacceptable that people sell themselves and I would be happy to prevent that happening. However, apart from this test, we should be very careful.</P>
      <P>There are notable examples in which people married in order to obtain a passport on very moral grounds. For example, in 1938 the poet W. H. Auden married the daughter of the great German novelist Thomas Mann so that she would be able to escape from Germany. Auden was homosexual and did not have the slightest interest in this woman sexually, but it was a decent thing to do and it saved her life. I do not see why we should get rid of such arrangements.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (d) refers to people being &ldquo;in a marriage recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting&rdquo;. This is highly discriminatory against gay people because, as yet, there is no recognition of stable gay relationships in Ireland as there is in many European countries. This may be a step too far at the moment but it seems reasonable to consider the issue. I have not promoted gay marriages or that kind of thing because they are so easily pilloried. Instead, I have tried to look at circumstances where the non-recognition of relationships has a significant negative impact on citizens of this State.</P>
      <P>I was heartened to receive support from all sides of the House when I drew to the attention of the Minister for Finance the anomalous situation of a couple who had been living together for 50 years in west Cork. The older partner put the house in the name of the younger partner because he was ill with Parkinson's disease. However, the younger fellow died of cancer and the original partner was stuck with a bill of £200,000 for the privilege of living in his own house. This is the kind of situation which results from the non-recognition of stable gay relationships. I have been in a relationship with a citizen of another country for the past 25 years, which is at least as good as some of my colleagues can maintain within marriage. It seems that consideration should be given to this situation.</P>
      <P>I am concerned by the issue of absolute discretion. Senators Ryan, Henry and Taylor-Quinn are correct.</P>

I doubt if the Minister or his advisers would consciously wish to abuse this power but one cannot predict for all circumstances. As legislators we are required to examine matters which may be problematic in the future and to try to exclude them from legislation.</P>
      <P>There is also the issue dealt with in paragraph (e) which states: &ldquo;. . .  and that citizen are living together as husband and wife and that citizen submits to the Minister an affidavit in the prescribed form to that effect,&rdquo;.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann condemns the Government for its failure to address the crises of supply of and access to childcare services; and demands that the issue be dealt with immediately in the Social Partnership talks and in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>This is an important issue which is frequently debated in this House. I and other Senators from both sides have raised the issue on more than one occasion because there is a child care crisis, identified last year by a committee established by the Minister's Department, which produced a fine report, the National Childcare Strategy. In the introduction to that report, the chairperson of the group, Sylda Langford, said what we have all known for a long time &ndash; that there was a virtual crisis in child care supply. We know from our experience and the anecdotal evidence of friends and parents that this crisis has worsened.</P>
      <P>We thought the child care issue had finally made it to the top of the Government agenda in time for it to be dealt with in the budget. There was a widespread expectation that a major initiative would be announced in the budget &ndash; a set of packages designed to meet the extraordinary increase in demand for child care because of the increase in the number of women, particularly married women, and parents participating in the workforce. Media reports clearly indicated the major disappointment at the lack of provision for child care in the budget. We have tabled this motion to bring attention to the child care crisis.</P>
      <P>It is a time of unprecedented growth. I am not the first to say that &ndash; it is becoming a cliché at this stage. Someone on the other side will ask why we did not do something when we were in Government. I am sick and tired of listening to that argument which the following statistics will dispel. In 1996, the budget surplus was £15 million. We considered ourselves extremely lucky to have a budget surplus of that size. Three years later the comparable figure which is available to the Government to spend is £1,850 million. I do not want the Government telling me this issue cannot be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Childcare 2000 group, a broad umbrella group representing those in the child care industry and those requiring child care, asked the Government to spend £500 million on child care &ndash; this is now overdue and badly needed. We got £46 million &ndash; an £8 increase in child benefit for the first two children, £10 for the third and capital allowances for those providing child care places, a system which only benefits large employers capable of generating large child care provision rather than small child care providers. In the past few months, I have heard of community crèches, especially on housing estates, closing down or <Col N="54" /><Col N="55" /> doubling their fees, creating an even greater problem for parents as the crisis grows.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the Government has failed to deliver. It has produced a budget which has benefited employers instead of what we need, which is a massive increase in places where children can be cared for, which parents can afford and which are staffed by trained, well-paid staff, located in the community and the workplace, along with a flexible approach to working time for both parents and adequate child benefit to help the lower paid, large families and single parents. I will not be entirely negative. I acknowledge that a provision of £46 million was announced in the budget, with an expectation of more. I am also aware that a considerable sum of money is being targeted at the provision of child care in the community, through the health boards and the partnerships. There appears to be a vague sense of what can, should and will be done. A lack of clear vision and policy is evident.</P>
    <P>This Government defined itself very well in this budget, particularly as regards child care. It defined itself as a Government which has effectively abandoned the needs of the children of working parents by forcing their mothers into the workforce with a tax system which rewards those who go to work, not those who choose to stay at home. This Government will be known as one which has put the demands of employers and the labour force first and the needs of children last. I hope this Government will not be known as one which missed a unique opportunity to finally put in place, at a time when we can afford it, a system of child care based in the community and built around the needs of parents and the community in which they live, rather than the labour force where they are seen as unit.</P>
    <P>The National Childcare Strategy recognises that the past two decades have seen a preponderance of reports on this issue, of which I think the strategy is probably one of the best. Enough recommendations have been made &ndash; this document is full of them. Considering the size of the working group, one must congratulate it for reaching agreement in a diverse range of sensible provisions, some with which I would not entirely agree. There have been enough task forces, subcommittees and working groups, particularly expert working groups. Action now needs to be taken and money spent. We are calling for the issue to be dealt with in the context of the social partnership model and hope that the partnership will not break down as a result of the pay issue. Considering the range of recommendations and issues that need to be addressed, it is our belief that it is within the social partnership model that one can get agreement on the wide range of actions necessary. I appeal to the Minister to ensure when putting in place a child care strategy that we use it, particularly at this point in our history, to generate very high quality child care in the community, particularly for those who cannot afford to invest in child care by virtue of being <Col N="56" /> low paid or parents who are not in the workplace, but whose children would derive such enormous benefit from a good quality child care system based on their needs and the needs of the community. We know from research carried out elsewhere that investment in good quality and accessible child care in the community, particularly in disadvantaged areas, yields huge gains down the road. Studies carried out in poorer communities in America have shown that investment in early education and good quality child care has paid off, particularly in reduced crime rates. I am sure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has taken this evidence on board and I hope he will implement it.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something about how child care has become centred around the needs of the labour force. For the last two decades many groups have attempted to put child care on top of the political agenda and, in general, have failed to do so. It is only now that the demands of employers and the needs of the labour force are paramount that we are looking for ways of getting women into the workforce. Employers are on their knees, begging the Government to do something to get women into the workforce rather than looking at the needs of children and parents. Side by side with any child care strategy must be the introduction of a system of flexible working. We are just now discovering that the other side of the Celtic tiger is a reduced quality of life for families in particular. The high level of stress involved in travelling to work, competing in the workforce, returning home, barely seeing the children, leaving the children possibly in child care facilities with which parents are not entirely happy, has raised for many parents the question of whether they should continue to work.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to take a leadership role on flexible working and introduce it on a statutory basis outside of the public service. I am aware it is available in the public service. It is extremely popular and is used, as was expected and is the experience in other countries, by over 90% of women who have children of schoolgoing age. I appeal to the Minister to look at flexible working for parents, together with a series of initiatives on child care.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his latitude and look forward with great expectation to a proper initiative on the needs of children, their parents and the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. As I look around at the Members of the Seanad I realise that this is not predominantly a women's issue, it is a family issue. The fact that the issue is articulated by women is perhaps a commentary on role models and the way in which people have fulfilled their role. However limited my fulfilment of that obligation has been, I have been married for over 20 years, both of us have been out working since then and, to my great delight, my wife is better paid than I am. I have never had this problem that men are supposed to have; in fact, I wish she <Col N="57" /> earned twice as much because then I could give up work altogether. I will come back to the issue of income later.</P>
      <P>This is an issue about family and the way in which we organise ourselves, and there are two routes to go. As the Leader of the Labour Party has said on many occasions, we are at a point of making a choice &ndash; do we follow the civilised route or do we follow the ruthless route of the United States? We either use the power and resources available to the State to facilitate civilised living by families, parents and children or we go the other route and assume that the acquisition of more and more material goods, centred around eternally reducing tax rates, is an alternative to which we aspire. The evidence of most countries is that that route has brought women in particular, because of the unequal roles, very little satisfaction. The evidence is that women in particular in successful careers are stressed out and exhausted as a result of the burden of carrying two responsibilities. This is a reproach to men but it is also a reproach to society. We may not be able to reform men as easily as we can reform society, nevertheless, we can address the issue. We all have rights but some of them, in the case of women in particular, were suppressed for many thousands of years and we have only in the last 30 or 40 years begun to address them. Among our rights is the right to marry and have children. We also have a right to a chosen career and to work inside or outside the home. This right applies to both partners in a relationship. It should not be perceived as one against the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue is not just about services for child care; it is also about those who make demands for more and more in the labour force, particularly the employer organisations who keep saying that the State should provide tax breaks for them and for parents. Has it not dawned on them that perhaps they should provide family friendly work? In desperation, many of them are now offering part-time hours and so on but that will only last as long as there is a labour shortage. Employers do not accept that they have an obligation in society to facilitate their workforce to have decent careers and a family life as well; family needs are not their concern. Every minuscule progress made by people at work in terms of their right to time off with their family, whether it be unpaid paternal leave for fathers and so on, produces a whinge from IBEC about the undermining of our half-mythological competitiveness. Competitiveness as defined by them is a myth because it has as much to do with quality as with price. The civilised countries of Europe, mainly the Nordic countries, have a seamless relationship between work and family. This facilitates parents to take long periods off work as they need it, with generous support from the State. It facilitates fathers to take time off work to support mothers during the difficult period immediately before and after childbirth. This facilitates families in dealing with the most difficult issue of all, which is that children, God bless them, are <Col N="58" /> entirely unpredictable. What is one to do the morning one wants to go to work if one's children are all sick? What does one do? A flexible, intelligent employer will recognise that their employees have family responsibilities, but there are many employers who would not accept it is their problem if children suddenly get sick. There is nothing more distressing for a parent than the enormous pressure that arises at 8.30 a.m. when both parents are going to work and there are sick children at home.</P>
    <P>Unless this is built into the structure of child care in the State, simple gestures like better child care and tax allowances will not get to the nub of the issue, which is, as Senator O'Meara said, the flexibility of employers in recognising that their employees have lives separate from their jobs. The real issue is family friendly work and that is a matter of definition of our values. Of course it involves proper provision of child care, but we will not do that with £46 million. A proper system of State-funded child care of the kind that civilised European countries operate will cost us about £0.5 billion and having such a system is a correct and admirable aspiration. However, that in itself will not solve the problem, nor will it eliminate the stress and hassle for parents. There will have to be a succession of back-up facilities together with flexibility in work written into workers' protection legislation so that they cannot be penalised for looking after their children. It is not just about money. There must be a clear recognition of people's conflicting loyalties between family and work. If we do not do that, we can have the most elaborate system of child care but we will not eliminate the stress factor.</P>
    <P>There is a subsidiary issue which relates to the present system of child care. To the extent to which it exists it seems to be based on the <i>de facto </i>impoverishment of a section of women in Irish society. Even if they are on social welfare, most of us would regard the combination of social welfare payments and payments for child care they receive as profoundly inadequate and that is not the solution either. The solution is a deliberate decision to have work and family responsibilities recognised as two sides of civilised living. Most men and women today have no desire to stay full-time in the home. Most of them have an equal desire to have a decent and satisfying family life. That requires money to provide child care resources. It also requires laws and a statement of values that recognise that people's humanity is as important in the economy as gross domestic product. That is one of the issues that arises in child care. We have moved from being a country that was obsessed with growth to a country which must now become obsessed with the use of growth to give our people a worthwhile quality of life. The way the children of those at work are looked after is central to that.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" />&ldquo;commends the priority given to child care in the National Development Plan, the substantially increased funding provided in the budget for child care and the measures being taken to co-ordinate the delivery of child care services.</P>
    <P>I reserve my right to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the need for quality child care provision in Ireland today and the Government has demonstrated its commitment to developing quality child care services nationally through a range of measures, including substantially increased funding supports, facilitating consultation with representatives of all of the stakeholders involved to inform policy development and facilitating co-ordination of child care service delivery.</P>
      <P>A particular feature of Ireland's booming economy has been the increasing participation of women in the labour force and this has led to increased demand for child care services. The historical system of child care provision in Ireland, in which the mother or close family relative was the principal child care provider, no longer applies to the same extent as previously. As more women take up employment, training and educational opportunities, the pool of people willing to mind children shrinks, leading to difficulties for parents in marrying their working lives with their family responsibilities. It is with this in mind that the Government has been working towards developing child care which will meet diverse child care needs.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that in many ways Ireland is less advanced than some of our European neighbours in this area but would point out that the developments undertaken in those countries also occurred during their periods of economic growth. The Government recognises that child care is a complex issue and has responded by facilitating consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders in order to develop a national child care strategy. My Department chaired the Partnership 2000 expert working group on child care which comprised over 70 members representing relevant Departments, statutory bodies, social partners, non-governmental organisations, providers, parents and individuals with expertise and interest in the area of child care. They met over 18 months and commissioned research to assist them with their deliberations. On 3 February 1999 I launched the group's report, which set out 27 recommendations covering financial supports for providers and parents, regulations, planning, training, qualifications, employment and co-ordination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group's recommendations have since been evaluated, costed and prioritised by the interdepartmental committee on child care which was also chaired by my Department. The committee also considered the child care proposals in the Government's Action Programme for the Millen<Col N="60" /> nium and the reports of the Commission on the Family and the National Forum for Early Childhood Education. The committee has reported back to Government and its recommendations are currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>My Department has had a role in funding the development of child care facilities since 1994 within its remit for equality. Funding supports were initially provided through a pilot child care initiative targeted at services in disadvantaged areas which could provide low cost child care to parents, particularly women, facilitating them to access employment, training and education opportunities. The initiative was evaluated in 1997, leading to the development of the equal opportunities programme in 1998 which has supported a large number of services nationally. In July 1998 I announced funding of over £6 million, combining EU and Exchequer moneys, for the operation of the programme for the two year period 1998 and 1999. The programme provided funds from an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective under a broader range of initiatives than its predecessor, including capital grants for the establishment, upgrading and enhancement of facilities which I approved for 106 community based child care projects, grants towards the cost of two senior child care personnel in each of 25 flagship community based projects, funding for an employer demonstration initiative which was developed in conjunction with IBEC to stimulate employer involvement and interest in developing child care services for their employees &ndash; to date funding has been approved for eight consortia involving 21 employers &ndash; and the development of a national child care census and database providing information in relation to child population and the level of supply of child care in group based facilities on a county by county basis. The database will inform future policy development.</P>
    <P>In June 1999, my Department succeeded in obtaining additional funding from the European Social Fund under the Human Resources Development Operational Programme which, including Exchequer funding, increased the programme's budget by a further £5 million. This funding was secured to enhance the equal opportunities child care programme by assisting training and development for community support and capital projects already receiving funding under the programme, partnerships and community groups supported by the Local Urban and Rural Development Operational Programme, supporting the development of national voluntary child care organisations, such as Barnardos, An Comhchoiste Reamhscolaíochta Teoranta, St. Nicholas Montessori Society, the Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association, the National Childminding Association of Ireland and the National Children's Nursery Association, research into the development of family friendly policies for small and medium enterprises, the enhancement of the national child care database and child care train<Col N="61" /> ing for staff in crèche facilities in drug treatment centres.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that investment in the development of child care services must be addressed as a priority. This is particularly true in disadvantaged areas if parents in those areas wish to avail of opportunities to access employment, training and education to break the cycle of disadvantage. Child care was identified as a priority area for investment under the national development plan resulting in an allocation of £250 million to my Department over the course of the plan, 2000 to 2006. Never before has there been such a significant investment in child care service provision which acknowledges the need to create more child care places and improve the quality of services.</P>
    <P>The substantial funding planned for the next seven years will pave the way to building up child care service provision which will benefit children, parents, communities and society in general. Last December I announced the framework for implementing supports over the period the national development plan, which includes expansion of the equal opportunities child care programme including funding for capital grants for community based child care facilities, grants towards staffing costs for community based child care services, training supports, supports to enhance the national voluntary child care organisations, building on previous initiatives, for example, further development of the national child care census and database; innovative flexible initiatives, which promote the development of child care facilities for children with special needs and services in areas of particular disadvantage, grants towards the development of local child care network initiatives, which will provide training, support and advice to providers who would otherwise operate in isolation and a new capital grant scheme for child care providers caring for up to 30 child care places.</P>
    <P>The plan will enable my Department to provide for the further development and expansion of child care facilitates, which addresses the needs of men and women in reconciling their child care needs with their participation in employment, training and education. It will support objectives such as the provision of diverse child care which meets the needs of the child, increase the number of trained personnel working in child care and improve co-ordination and deliver of child care.</P>
    <P>Other Departments are also involved in funding the development of child care. As announced by my colleague the Minister for Finance in budget 2000, funding of more than £11 million has been allocated to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for the development of community based out of school hours services, the Department of Education and Science for grants to school managements to develop after school care and the Department of Health and Children for advisory services for child care service providers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> It should also be noted that the Department of Education and Science also has a budget of more than £2 million comprising ESF and Exchequer funding for a scheme which supports the child care costs of participants in VTOS, Youthreach and senior Traveller programmes. FÁS is also involved in the provision of child care training at community level for people working in a voluntary or paid capacity and it works closely with my Department on the provision of training to personnel in child care projects funded by the Department. In addition, my Department is represented on the FÁS-social partners steering group which is developing a traineeship for child care workers.</P>
    <P>Changes announced in the budget mean that the child care sector can also benefit from tax relief on capital expenditure by availing of 100% accelerated capital allowances in the first year as opposed to spreading the allowance over seven years as was previously the case. The relief applies to all child care facilities whether provided by employers or commercial child care operators. They can also be availed of by investors who wish to invest by way of leasing arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Government is conscious that child care has developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to date and that changing circumstances require a more co-ordinated approach that will benefit from the wealth of information gained from recent research and reports in the area. Last December, therefore, the Government assigned responsibility for co-ordinating child care services delivery to my Department. The structures that have been established or are in the process of being established to meet these needs include an interdepartmental committee at assistant secretary level to focus on child care policy which will be chaired by my Department and a national co-ordinating child care committee to oversee the development of a child care infrastructure in an integrated manner throughout the country. The committee has been established with effect from 17 December 1999 and has had two meetings to date. It is chaired by my Department and members comprise representatives of the statutory and non-statutory sectors, including the social partners. Another structure is the county child care committees, which will advance the provision of child care facilities within the local areas. The committees will be led by the relevant health boards and membership will comprise local representatives of the statutory and non-statutory sectors.</P>
    <P>The roles and responsibilities of each element of the structure will evolve over time and local needs should dictate what structures are most appropriate at local level. The structures will provide a means for effective planning and targeting of resources where they are most needed. In addition to the co-ordinating child care service delivery, we are working with other Departments on specific issues that are relevant to the development of services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> Planning permission for child care service provision has been identified as an area of concern for child care service development in some cases. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has established a committee to produce planning guidelines which will assist developers, builders, child care service providers and the planning authorities in their efforts to make suitable provision for child care in their development plans. My Department is represented on the committee which also includes representation from the planning authorities, health boards and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The future development of our child care services will benefit from this co-ordinated approach and these structures will be instrumental in facilitating child care provision in Ireland for the life of the national development plan. It should also enable Ireland to meet its commitments to child care in the context of the national employment action plan and the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The overriding objectives of the initiatives I outlined are to increase the number of child care places in private and community sectors and to improve the quality of child care available across the country over the term of the national development plan. I am confident initiatives being put into place will achieve these objectives and that the next seven years will see the development of a diverse child care system within Ireland that will meet the needs and expectations of parents.</P>
    <P>It is important to underline that quality child care provision plays a major part in the development of our children. The changes in child care provision required in the new economic reality of our country must protect and enhance our children's future. The Government is committed to ensuring all the developments in child care over the course of the national development plan will have, at their heart, the interests of our children.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the Minister has been in the House for a long time, I hope he will listen to what I have to say. I speak on child care from the perspective of my experience as a teacher of early childhood education and a former chairperson of the National Playgroups Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> the other day states that the fledgling administration in the North has provided £38 million for preschools in Northern Ireland. The heading of the article reads &ldquo;£38 million for preschools in Northern Ireland&rdquo;. The article states that the £38 million sterling cash grant will secure 9,000 free new preschool education places in the North. It states the allocation will bring the number of free nursery places to almost 19,000 in the statutory, voluntary and private school sectors. It also states that this means that by next year 85% of preschool children will be able to take up a free place. This is a fledgling administration. While I appreciate there <Col N="64" /> will be many cross-Border initiatives and we will exchange views and learn from each other, I hope a rapid learning process will take place on the provision of child care.</P>
    <P>I also refer the Minister to the latest National Economic and Social Council publication in December 1999, entitled Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice. It states on page 288 that the council is placing emphasis on the provision of child care as a means of increasing labour market adaptability and employability. I acknowledge that was one of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy's hopes, but I do not know if he listened to the people because he did not go about it the right way.</P>
    <P>All Members are aware &ndash; I am sure the Minister is tired hearing about it &ndash; of problems in relation to the supply of child care. Members are lobbied constantly because of the shortages. The 1996 Act decreased the number of places, although that was in the main for the best possible reason of the provision of better physical facilities. I am sure the Minister is aware of another problem with regard to the provision of child care facilities. It does not appear that a definitive guideline has been issued to local authorities regarding smaller facilities, some of which are attached to houses &ndash; some people are getting permission for them while others are not . There does not appear to be any particular rule on why some are getting it. I am not referring to the need for a fire officer's report, etc., but it involves a loss in terms of the number of places for the people using such facilities. In some cases, the facilities could continue in operation.</P>
    <P>On the cost of child care, the NESC report states that costs in Ireland are the fifth highest in Europe. If one was a mother in France or Belgium, one would not pay anything. One will not have to pay anything in Northern Ireland but I checked this morning and some crèches in Blackrock charge £120 a week for full day, comprehensive care for each child. Some people charge £50 a week but it is obvious that it would not be worthwhile for some women to re-enter the workforce. Their family income would fall if they returned to work because of these costs.</P>
    <P>I have a certain sympathy with the cost factor inasmuch as it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit trained, thoughtful and responsible child care workers. Many of those who are trained are married women, but they are encountering the same cul-de-sac in that they cannot put their children into child care facilities because they do not exist.</P>
    <P>The position is similar to the annual school report which states that one is good but must do better. Nobody is criticising anybody personally but Ireland has a burgeoning economy and many extra jobs, but a decreasing number of child care places. The equation will not balance. With regard to young, single mothers, the Minister emphasised FÁS programmes. There is always provision for children on such courses which is great because it means people can participate in <Col N="65" /> them. However, once the course is finished, the women find themselves back in the same position.</P>
    <P>It would be desirable for many young mothers with one child to re-enter the workforce. However, they cannot do so because the lists for free nursery facilities are miles long in areas of urban deprivation. There is no way one will access it under any circumstances. A barrier is being created by not having the facilities to ensure re-entry to the workforce at several different levels. This barrier affects mothers who want to re-enter the workforce, single people and others who cannot afford child care under any circumstances because it is too expensive.</P>
    <P>Another problem is highlighted in the <i>Family Observer,</i> which is a European publication. It is a matter for some thought because it states that fertility rates are likely to drop. The thesis is that Europe will be short of children in the next century. Our child care crisis could be solved by not having children at all. The mean age of Europe is currently 39.3 years and it is likely to reach a mean of 45 years by 2030. One of the main reasons for this is the drop in the fertility rate and the publication states that influencing fertility rates is a possible way for Governments to curb ageing populations.</P>
    <P>We have all thought about how our older citizens &ndash; hopefully we will all be one at some stage &ndash; will be supported when there is a greatly reduced workforce. One example is not to support families or provide the necessary facilities for people to have and rear children properly. In Austria the Government abolished a payment for families and there was a subsequent 10% decrease in the fertility rate. It is obvious that public policy can affect fertility levels. One might think it is odd of me to raise this aspect when there are obvious signs of fertility in Ireland, and even, happily, in this Chamber, but it would be bad for the country. We read about comely or handsome maidens dancing at the crossroads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>We will all be too old to dance, although we may be shuffling around nursing homes, and there may be a small young population. Such a development would be undesirable. It is another possible off-shoot of not putting money into supporting child care facilities which are necessary given the enormous distances people must travel to work. It is an unreal existence to take a child out at 6.30 a.m. and return home at 8 p.m. It is bad for families and couples. It is also extremely bad for children and we should be able to do better locally. Perhaps the answer lies with local authorities and the provision in any major building development of a child care facility on site when houses are built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is great at commissioning reports but it is also great at ignoring the advice given in them. The Commission on the Family, which was established initially by the former Minister, Proinsias De Rossa, and continued by the Minister for <Col N="66" /> Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was greatly welcomed. I attended the launch and everything was to be done for families. It was stated:</P>
    <P>Principal to the unique and essential family function is that of caring and nurturing for all its members. It is in the family context that a person's basic needs for security, belonging, support and intimacy are satisfied. These are especially important for children.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I know that many children are not having that experience. Good child care would assist them greatly in their development as adults.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party for giving us this opportunity to discuss once again the issue of child care. I agree with Senator Ryan that it is not only a women's issue, although that is occasionally the perception. It is a family issue and also an issue for business and society. The attendance of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who has overall responsibility in his Department for this matter, is indicative of the Government's commitment to addressing the issue of child care.</P>
      <P>I do not suggest that we have done it all, got it right and everything is perfect. As Members of the Opposition are aware, that is not my opinion. However, I am honest enough to say that we are making moves in a direction that will lead us on the path we all want to follow. These moves will ensure family friendly work practices and that child centred child care facilities are available to all those, whether they are mothers or fathers, who choose to use them. It will also ensure that proper facilities, stimulation and encouragement are provided to future generations to enable them to continue to move forward and maintain our economic growth. Without continued economic growth and performance we will not be in a position to pay for the care and supports needed for the less well off in society.</P>
      <P>What annoys me about the Labour Party is its pretence that its cares about child care. Its members condemn the Government for its failure to address the crisis of supply and access to child care services. They sniffle at the £250 million in the national development plan and say it does not show commitment. They laugh at the £46 million provided in the budget for a number of initiatives which I will address later. They laugh at the idea that an increase in child benefit, which is not means tested or taxed, is paid directly to the person looking after the child, be it the mother or the father but generally the mother. Irrespective of their status it is increased by £8 per month for the first and second child and by £10 per month for the third and subsequent children. For a family of four children the increase amounts to £197 per month or £2,364 per annum paid, tax free. I am not suggesting that is enough but it is an indication of the Government's commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> We speak about access to crèche facilities. Everybody here knows you can flood a problem with money and still not solve it. The Government takes the view that if the number of child care places can be increased through the involvement of the private sector, employers and the Government, that is the way to address the issue. We must address not only the physical space, the room and facilities which the children will use but provide adequately trained personnel to work in this area. We are taking the issue seriously and working down that particular route. Training is vitally important. Continued development of facilities is vitally important. A grant scheme of £10 million for capital upgrading of facilities is a commitment in that area and it is not only for the big rich employers or the big child care facilities but for child care facilities for up to 20 children. There is a belief that, if there are more than 20 children in a child care facility, out of the profit one may make in running it one should be able to provide the capital expenditure. A sum of £46 million has been allocated to increase supply, £23 million to expand the equal opportunities child care programme, the £10 million grant scheme already mentioned, £2 million for local child care network initiatives &ndash; focusing on the community and the value it has to offer in the development of society, our children and future generations &ndash; £5 million to schools to run and provide afterschool child care services, £5 million to community groups to provide the same type of services and £1.4 million to health boards which play a role in advising and co-ordinating services within their areas.</P>
    <P>We recognise this problem will not be solved by the Government alone. No problem can be solved in that way. The Minister has provided for 100% capital allowances in year one expended on construction or refurbishment of premises. Some people may say that is not enough. I have experience of putting together a cashflow plan and a building plan for developing a child care facility as an employer. When I looked at the seven year pay back on capital allowances it did not make sense. Irrespective of how one might condemn businesses, because they are not interested in being family run and family friendly, if they do not make money to pay their employees there is not much point in having a business because they have no jobs to go to. A 100% capital allowance on the first year of capital allowances makes is feasible for small and medium sized organisations to think about providing child care facilities for their employees near the place of work. That type of initiative should be applauded. We need more of it and we need encouragement from employers. That is the way forward.</P>
    <P>When I speak of the hypocrisy of the Labour Party, I refer to Deputy Michael Higgins who had the audacity on a national programme to speak about and compare child care facilities to carparks and carpark allowances.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and if it is acceptable to say you park your children at 7 a.m. and pick them up at 7 p.m? Is it acceptable for someone to cast such a slur on working parents who, as Senator O'Meara rightly said, have the stress of taking their children to work and collecting them and wondering if one is doing the right thing? It is hypocritical to use children as pawns in this political game. I regret that that happens time and again. I do not say Fianna Fáil has not been similarly guilty in the past. We have been, and I accept it.</P>
      <P>One good thing about this debate is that it makes us think about proactive things we can do and proactive suggestions we can make to the Department. The issue is the reconciliation of work and family life and an acceptance that family life is one of the most important aspects of the community and without it we are going nowhere. Child friendly work hours are vital. We must seek statutory requirements, as stated by Senator O'Meara, to ensure job-sharing, flexible work hours, mother friendly or parent friendly work. Perhaps we should look towards payment for parental leave. When the parental leave legislation was being debated there were calls for paid parental leave. I defended the fact that it was not paid on the basis that it should be introduced and found to work and that employers would have an opportunity to see how it works in practice. We can then move slowly towards ensuring that down the road people will not lose financially by taking time off.  </P>
      <P>There should be more expenditure on infrastructure. I refer to the £250 million available under the national development plan. It would be marvellous if in the next budget the Minister for Finance could provide computers for women at home, whose children are at school, and ISDN lines to every house in country. This would enable people to work from home while the children are at school, contribute to the economy and be at home for their children when they return from school. A little imagination would go a long way. If the key focus is not child centred and family based it does not matter how much money is put into it. I agree with the Opposition that this is not just an issue for women, the Government or employers but for all of us.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Cox that this is not just an issue for women. Not for one instant do I blame the Minister for leaving the House and leaving us in the excellent hands of his Minister of State, Deputy Wallace. There are three women on this side, three women on the Government side and a woman taking the debate. I am grateful that one of the officials is a man &ndash; I hope the ushers will stay &ndash; but this matter is looked on as a women's issue. No matter what one says we will have token men say things about it. I hope Senator Ryan will forgive me for saying that. Often I have heard that it is not just a women's issue, yet I find that the running must be made by women.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, will remember she and I spent a great deal of time trying to do something about getting a crèche in the House. Does she remember when we were tramping all over the place, going from location to location, trying to get a crèche established? I would be interested to know if there will be a crèche in the new block. At the time there was demand for a crèche and it was not just women who worked within the Leinster House complex who were looking for facilities for their children; it was also men who worked here. Until we set our own house in order in this regard, we should be careful about castigating other employers on not having done as much as we feel they should do. How careful are we about flexi-time and being agreeable if people have sick children, etc.? Often I do not think we are the very best. I would like to see us putting our own house in order before we tell people in other businesses what they should do.</P>
      <P>Senator Ridge is correct that there have been incredible changes in the demography of Europe in the past generation, but the changes in Ireland have been nothing short of staggering. Until 1972, married women could not work within the public service; they had to resign. Here we are beseeching them to come back into every form of employment so we can run the country. A few weeks ago I wrote on this topic in <i>The Irish Times</i> and I was fascinated to get a letter from a childless constituent asking why childless people should have to support child care with their taxes. What on earth did he think would happen in his old age? Who was going to drive the buses and who would be the nurses? Who would run the services, not to mind generate the economic growth?</P>
      <P>This is an issue which concerns everybody here. I feel so sympathetic to young married women nowadays because we used to have a situation just 20 years ago where about 25% of them worked outside the home and now 50% do so. The percentage of young married mothers who are working is much higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a huge change of course in the family size. The average family size is about two, which is just about the replacement rate. Indeed, the total fertility rate of women in Ireland has <Col N="70" /> fallen to just under two from about four one generation ago. It is a staggering change. We are having to catch up with the infrastructural needs which these changes have brought about because unlike in the past we do not have extended families to mind children if women were going out to work. There are huge changes which have taken place and we must insist on a change within the infrastructure so that they can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>The last budget made an attempt to address the issue. I applaud the support given for training, in particular. Senator Ridge spoke of the need for quality child care. It is no good if it is just a child-parking service. I will not go into the details of that but I would not be in favour of any sort of child-parking service. It must be quality child care and, unless there are trained personnel, it will not be very useful.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that child benefit was increased in the budget, but I would like to have seen it greatly increased. For many poorly paid women &ndash; many women are very poorly paid &ndash; the only way they will be in a position to pay for quality child care is by getting decent child benefit. Many of them are working in the services industries, which are not well paid but which are essential. They are also working in some of our burgeoning industries which require the input of a great deal of labour but which again are not highly paid. Unless there is an adequate amount of money to make it worth their while to go out to work after they have paid for child care, it will not do any good.</P>
    <P>I am delighted of course to see the support for training, as I said, but I wonder if we could not go a little further in elevating the status of those who work in the child care industry. Unfortunately, as somebody said to me recently, people in Ireland should go around with their salaries stencilled on their foreheads because nowadays the main source of kudos is what one is paid, not the social responsibility one has in one's job or the contribution one makes to the community. Child care workers are not well paid. It is a labour intensive industry. I think the regulations require one to have one worker per three children under six months and then the ratio increases to one per six older children and eventually to about one per ten.</P>
    <P>The setting up of crèches, as Senator Cox obviously discovered, is very costly. The budget concentrated on the bricks and mortar of setting up these crèches rather than also looking at the personnel within the crèches and how they could be helped. I would like to see tax relief in this area. I could get tax relief for employing a chauffeur because he would be my employee but if one employs somebody to mind one's children, one cannot avail of tax relief. This seems a little odd. If the person pays PRSI and levies and is in the tax net, would it not raise the stature of the job and encourage people to pay the person a little more if they could get tax relief on it or on the fees paid to registered crèches? I cannot see why this seems such a hot potato for the Government <Col N="71" /> because these are people who are genuinely working within the workforce. They deserve better recognition for the work they are doing and those who employ them should be entitled to tax relief.</P>
    <P>I agree that more flexible work practices would be a great help. Last year we enacted useful legislation for parental leave and <i>force majeure</i> leave. However, women in particular, because it is always the woman who must take the time off work, are very reluctant because they see their jobs in danger. I had my children even before there was maternity leave. Having worked until the day before one was born and gone back eight days later, I think the improvements which have been made have been more than worthwhile but there would be a better workforce if one made even better conditions of employment. I would suggest this is the sort of area at which we must look next. We should try to make it an acceptable feature of life that one has these two unfortunate children, as most people only have two nowadays. Surely if we are to bring up a generation of Irish citizens who are worthwhile for the State, we must concentrate on the early part of their career.</P>

      <P>I would like to respond but since I have only eight minutes I will not do so. In the context of this debate, I am particularly pleased the Minister of State is here. Since her appoint<Col N="72" /> ment she has devoted an enormous amount of time, effort and expertise to developing her equal opportunities brief. Child care is a key element in the equal opportunities agenda.</P>
      <P>It is far from true to claim, as this motion does, that the Government has failed to tackle the issue of child care. It is true, however, that Ireland is regrettably far behind other European countries in providing a proper child care system. Until now we have had an informal system of child care that has largely developed in an unregulated way and which is inadequate to meet present day demands. The executive summary of the report of the expert working group on child care, which was published only last year, states that &ldquo;there is now a virtual crisis in child care supply&rdquo;. That was the base from which the Government had to build a system of child care. The report of the interdepartmental committee said the most urgent need was to increase the number of child care places. It was not the only need but it was the most urgent one. I wanted to make that point for Senator Henry who said there was too much emphasis on bricks and mortar in the budget provisions. I assume that was because this was identified as the most urgent need.</P>
      <P>The Minister &ndash; no doubt with an input from the Minister of State &ndash; responded by announcing a £46 million package to deal with the supply of child care. The details of that package have already been outlined by Senator Cox in what I felt was a very thoughtful contribution and one from which I benefited. The £46 million package lays a fairly firm foundation for addressing the infrastructural deficit that existed until now. I am confident that it will be a major factor in helping us to build a sustainable, affordable and accessible child care system.</P>
      <P>The requirement to dramatically increase the availability of such facilities in the community and in the workplace will need much more money. As well as that, it will need much more innovation in the years ahead. It requires new thinking as well as extra resources to tackle this very real problem on our doorsteps. The Leader of my party, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, in her role as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has more than once set out to encourage employers to see greater provision of child care facilities &ldquo;as a crucial investment in their workforce&rdquo;. That is the beginning of right thinking, the kind of thinking that will have to take root. In many ways we need cultural changes as well as economic provision if proper, accessible child care is to become available. The Tánaiste is correct when she says it is an important element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently there is much emphasis on human resources but the employee must be seen as a member of a family. In making provision for a person's well-being at a human level one must see them as part of a family. The well-being of the total family is important to the well-being of the individual. The Tánaiste is correct when she says so and I hope those listening to her will respond. Employers must see child care facilities not as an <Col N="73" /> extra cost but as a key ingredient in the workplace of the 21st century in which everyone's needs, no matter how diverse, will be taken fully into account.</P>
    <P>Tax incentives in the past two budgets contain measures to encourage companies to provide on-site child care facilities. That shows that there is new thinking and a firm commitment on the part of my party to make that contribution to the totality of initiatives that must be taken to provide proper child care. We should have a national strategy and I am glad that measures are in train to put such a strategy in place. A national strategy has to be implemented at local level, however. I am glad that county and, hopefully, city committees will be set up so that the national strategy will be put in place locally. That is the best way to look after the delivery of such services.</P>
    <P>From now on crèches should be provided in housing estates as an in-built part of such developments. We are beginning to realise that in building estates we ought to be building neighbourhoods and thinking in terms of putting in branch libraries, health care centres and child care facilities. That would avoid the ridiculous spectacle of women driving their children miles to a crèche near their workplace. That involves time and hardship, and it contributes to traffic congestion. There is no justification for it.</P>
    <P>Training for child care workers is as important as the provision of places for children. Child care workers do not have a recognised status in the community because of the informal way in which the system has developed here. We need to set up a national qualifications framework to establish standards for accreditation so that child care workers would have a recognised professional status, education, skills and a qualification which would give them access to proper remuneration. Such a qualification would enable them to work in child care services here or elsewhere. That is fundamentally important. I ask the Minister of State to ensure, in the context of the money available under the national plan, that proper and systematic training is put in place.</P>
    <P>The people with whom young children are in contact in their early years are shaping the next generation and our nation. We put a great deal of resources into giving teachers skills because we believe their contact with young people is fundamentally important for the nation's health. We must put equal emphasis on the proper training of child care workers.</P>
    <P>I have a question for the Minister of State in regard to the £46 million. There is a number of community child care service groups in my area, some of which were funded under EU URBAN pilot schemes which have now ended. Those groups are in limbo and are unclear about how to access this new money and the channels it will come through. Will it come through the ADMs? How will it percolate down to groups of that nature? I ask the Minister of State to address that in her reply.</P>

      <P>&mdash;but I felt I had to make the point about the need for global thinking on this issue. That was my reasoning. I took seriously the decision to call a quorum. I would never be flippant about anything I do in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I commend her and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on their work to date. We are talking here about a very complex issue. The child care programme and the quality of child care services in the future must be processed very carefully.</P>
      <P>The motion tabled by the Labour Party has provided us with a golden opportunity to show in our amendment what is being done. They can trust us to produce a quality programme for child care services. The debate on this motion has clarified that there has been no failure on the part of the Government and that we are going to put forward a plan that will work. This complex issue must be addressed slowly. We are talking here about how to shape the future of our society. This is the way to go forward. There is increased funding in the national development plan for the co-ordination of the delivery of child care services.</P>
      <P>The expert interdepartmental working group on child care, which was chaired by the Department, produced 27 recommendations. I do not have time to discuss of them but the global feeling is that there should be financial support for providers and parents availing of child care services, support for those in employment, an examination of qualifications and planning and a co-ordination of services.</P>
      <P>This is a huge issue and we should not rush through it. To get it right, there must be an integrated strategy involving several Departments. We all know how long it takes to produce any report on the examination of available services. I welcome that this is being taken slowly because I would never want a rushed system of child care services.</P>
      <P>The system is not right at the moment. We do not have proper planning. There is a lack of after school child care services for the children of working parents. There are no proper advisory services in the health area. That must be worked through. We will not be at the races in relation to quality child care unless we get an integrated plan. The national development plan has allocated over £250 million, which will expand the equal opportunities programme and includes funding for community based child care facilities, staffing, training and the national voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> I always understood that child care facilities were out there somewhere and that people dropped their children to them but I never knew what went on inside these facilities or whether there was proper training for the staff. We need proper training and qualifications for child care staff, otherwise they will not stay. I hope the new courses in the regional colleges will be endorsed as the criteria for assessing the training of child care supervisors and workers, otherwise the present haphazard,<i> ad hoc </i>arrangement will continue. I worry about that. At the moment, there is a huge turnover of staff in child care services. It is very confusing for young children and babies if the staff of a child care facility are replaced after two weeks by other young people. I would be terrified to leave young babies in a crèche with such a high turnover of staff. We will only get that right if we have proper training facilities, qualifications and structures, otherwise we will not have a respected child care organisation and the community will not feel happy and confident about leaving their babies in its care. Unless we get that right, there will always be an &ldquo;iffyness&rdquo; about child care services.</P>
    <P>The initiative in the national development plan to co-ordinate Departments is the way forward. Planning is very important. The planning guidelines must involve builders, developers and local communities. Any new scheme must include a crèche. We need a community based infrastructure. We do not want a society where people are stressed out of their minds, getting up at 6.30 a.m., leaving their children in a child care facility, collecting them in the evening and then going home. That is not the quality of life we want for the future.</P>
    <P>Employers must be involved in this. We need flexi-time working and job sharing. This cannot be done in isolation. There must be a co-ordinated national plan involving voluntary groups, employers and Departments. If we establish that co-ordinated network we will have a first class child care service in future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the process we are going through and the slow approach. I have always believed we should work slowly in order to get this right. We are talking here about the future of our society. Those children will remember that we spoke here tonight about the need for proper child care facilities. I have great confidence in the Minister and the Minister of State to bring forward a co-ordinated strategy which will be implemented in the future and will give us first-class child care services.</P>

      <P>This is an important debate. There was much talk about child care problems prior to the budget and there is no harm revisiting the issue. I listened with interest to Senator O'Meara say she was fed up listening to the Government side say that when the Labour Party was in Government, it did nothing. I am fed up listening to the Labour Party continually whinge<Col N="76" /> ing that no matter what we do, it is never enough and using that as an excuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a problem with child care, which we all recognise. I am sure Senator O'Meara will agree it has developed further, particularly in recent years, probably as a result of the boom in our economy. It would be wrong to imply that couples were deciding not to have children possibly because of the problem of child care. It is a fact of life not only in this country but throughout Europe that the birth rate is dropping. Couples are making a conscious decision to have fewer children due to their careers or otherwise. It is a problem. I recognise extra stress is placed on couples trying to avail of whatever child care facilities are available.</P>
      <P>The debate which took place following the budget was probably one of the most divisive which could have taken place. It pitted families against families, double income families against single income ones. It was unhelpful and hurtful to parents who go out to work. They were made to feel they were almost neglecting their children in that they were parking them in the morning and collecting them in the evening. I respect those who go out to work and the mother or father who stays at home. The problem is we do not have enough choices.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Senator Ridge who said that when we grow old, we will be shuffling around nursing homes with nobody to look after us. It is a very sombre thought. I wonder whether it would be worse to be a lone parent trying to manage child care on my own or to be an elderly person with nobody to look after me. I have not decided which would be worse but perhaps I will decide before the end of the debate.</P>
      <P>We all acknowledge there has been a problem with child care but we must also acknowledge what the Minister has done to date. It is a complex issue and we only have to listen to parents who go out to work, those who choose to stay at home and the employers. It was a difficult issue for the Minister to try to grasp. He has tried on all counts to take the first steps to deal with the problem. I welcome the £46 million announced in the budget and the £250 million set aside in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>There is no point talking about what was done in the past. We acknowledge there have been problems. The Minister in his efforts to date has tried to deal with them. I welcome the suggestion of a forum to discuss the issue. The Labour Party motion referred to the social partnership talks. We should create a partnership among employers, the voluntary sector and Departments to try to come up with strategies to deal with this £250 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crux of the problem is that we must recognise that society demands greater appreciation or recognition of couples who chose to go out to work, greater co-operation between employers <Col N="77" /> and employees and a recognition that people have a family life as well as work.</P>
    <P>I come from a nursing background and ten years ago a number of my colleagues sought job sharing or part-time work because they had young families at home. They were unable to avail of that facility at the time, because it was a no go area as far as employers in nursing were concerned, and many of them left the profession. Unfortunately, we are seeing the other side of the coin now with the problems there are recruiting nurses. If employers had been a little more farsighted, they would have seen that one benefits most from workers if they under less stress in their home life because they are probably able to contribute more to their work life.</P>
    <P>We had problems in the past which we acknowledge. The Minister has done his bit in the budget to start to get the ball rolling in terms of where we go from here on the child care problem. I hope there will be greater co-operation between the employers, Government strategists and the voluntary sector when deciding the direction we take in the years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to contribute briefly to what is a useful debate on the question of child care, lack of same or a full recognition the issue. The problem has increased substantially in recent times due to various factors, including the increasing number of women working outside the home, some by choice, others of necessity, and it is a point which should not be lost. In my practice I see people taking out substantial mortgages which would take two salaries to fund, and they will not have much surplus income.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Family reported in 1998. It undertook a national survey of child care arrangements. The main findings of the survey were as follows. About one in three children not yet attending primary school experienced periods of care outside their own home and away from parents for some part of the week. This can arise in various ways and does not necessarily mean the child is away from home all day. Some people have temporary or part-time jobs or work for a couple of hours each day. The care can take various forms. There are some very qualified people looking after children. There are arrangements where a granny or an aunt looks after the child for a couple of hours and there are full time crèches. There must be a debate on the quality of care available, although much of it is of a high standard. I know some of the people in my area running child care facilities who are very dedicated and thorough, but there are areas in which improvements can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking as a local authority member, the question of child care facilities in certain residential areas has come up recently in the Dún Laoghaire. There is much to be said in this regard. As Senator Ridge said, if the travel arrangements could be kept to a minimum or if the child could be looked after a couple of hundred yards from their home, it would cut down <Col N="78" /> on traffic problems and the child would not have to get up at 6 a.m. and be driven a number of miles causing further problems. Local authorities look at this issue and take a sympathetic and realistic approach. If there is a certain increase in need in an area and if the traffic problem is not too bad, these facilities should be allowed. A common sense approach should be taken in addressing this problem.</P>
    <P>Our party held a forum on this issue some time ago. The variety of speakers who attended show that it is a crucial issue. I support the comments made by Senators O'Meara, Ridge and others, including the Members opposite. We must accept that there is a need for further cross-party action on this issue, particularly when one considers the horrendous amounts of money people must spend from their household budgets in respect of child care. I support the motion and I welcome this debate.</P>

      <P>I will be brief. I wish to correct people's perception that we men were not interested in this debate. As my party's spokesperson on Justice, Equality and Law Reform, at out group meeting earlier today I decided to bow to the greater knowledge of Senators Cox and Ormonde who have expressed a keen personal interest in this issue for a long period. I stated that I would give way to them instead of assuming my usual position as front bench spokesperson. I must point out, however, that as a married man with a family I have a keen interest in this issue.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights discussed child care and related matters at some length on at least two occasions with various groups. The issue of child care has been in the public domain for upwards of 20 years; it is not a new phenomenon. What came across during the joint committee's meetings was that successive Governments, including those in which my party has been involved, have neglected the debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>The current Administration and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be congratulated for taking the initiative and providing funds. I accept that £46 million does not sound like much but it is a start. The Government has acknowledged that this issue must be dealt with and a great deal of funding will have to be invested in providing crèches and child care facilities, educating personnel, setting up databases, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that £250 million is being provided in the national development plan in respect of this area. It is important to record that fact because people who are in now Opposition tend to criticise the Government and forget that when they were in power they did little more than talk about this matter. The Government has <Col N="79" /> grasped the nettle. It is providing a substantial amount of money to kick-start developments in this area. For the first time in the history of the State, child care is being funded by Government. That is an important development. It may be a small step but it is certainly a step in the right direction. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be congratulated on his efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that a great deal more must be done. As already stated, this area has been neglected for many years. My youngest child is nearly 11 years old and access to child care is of particular benefit to me. In recent years, many women have re-entered the workforce because of our booming economy and there is a great demand for them to return to work immediately after maternity leave. The Government recognises the problems people face. There has been a great deal of discussion and action has finally been taken.</P>
    <P>During the next four to five years, under the national development plan, child care services will improve dramatically. For the first time in the history of the State, the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat coalition Government has put in place a financial framework in respect of child care. I welcome this and I expect to see greater financial support and increased capital grants to aid the development of crèches and other such facilities. The general position in relation to child care will improve year by year but at least we have made a start. That is very significant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the amendment to this motion. As a parent, I realise the great importance of child care in the future development of children. I support the Government's consideration of child care, its planning in respect of it and the investment it has made in it. We face a major challenge in this area because our method of managing it will have a tremendous bearing on the society in which our children will live, on their quality of life and on their personal development.</P>
      <P>In the past, because of the type of society in which we lived, there were many family support structures in place which greatly aided the upbringing of children. However, we must take into consideration the fact that our society is changing. We each have new roles to play because the structures which obtain in the workplace are constantly changing. That is the reality with which we must deal.</P>
      <P>In the negotiations for a new national agreement taking place between the social partners, child care will assume a place of priority and importance. In my opinion a great deal of emphasis will be placed on how the £250 million for child care provided under the national development plan will be spent. Perhaps it should be given to the health boards to distribute in co-operation with the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> To date, a number of small groups and organisations have done very constructive work in terms of caring for children, stimulating and educating them and encouraging their personal development. However, we must now plan for the care of substantial numbers of young people in a co-ordinated way. Between 12 to 15 years ago I visited the first crèche in Brussels while on a trip to Belgium. I was amazed by it because we did not have those types of facilities in Ireland at that stage. To me it provided an indication of where Ireland stood in terms of its economic development because in Britain and elsewhere substantial numbers of mothers, fathers and single parents were out at work.</P>
    <P>The Government is setting out a structure to deal with problems relating to child care. It is a new initiative in which we must all participate. The greatest challenge we face involves the quality of child care service we put in place. If we put in place good structures at local level, we will make better provision for the future care of our children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that this debate is being taken by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am aware that it is responsible for co-ordinating the national child care strategy and implementing the report of the expert group on child care. However, even the decision to place the Department in charge of that group is questionable because in the normal course of events it does not have responsibility for the delivery of child care services, other than in extreme circumstances involving conflict with the law.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy with the wording of the amendment. The Government has tabled a woolly amendment which commends the priority given to child care in the national development plan but it could not commend the priority it was given in the budget. The Minister for Finance has produced three budgets but the Government has not shown any sense of urgency in making child care a priority. It seeks to make it a priority in the national development plan but it will not be in power to implement most of it. It is a case of live horse and you will get grass. The Government has not given a commitment to do anything in this amendment. This must be compared with the specific promise and commitment given in the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1997, with which I am sure the Chathaoirleach is intimately acquainted, that a £2,000 tax relief for married couples would be given to allow them to access services or to facilitate one spouse to stay at home to engage in child care. It was estimated that this measure would benefit 181,000 families. That was a specific commitment but nothing has been delivered on it in three budgets. The Minister for Finance has taken the exact opposite position and has discriminated against stay at home spouses in financial terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increase in child benefit of £2 per week for the first and second child and £2.50 for the third <Col N="81" /> and subsequent children was granted in the budget. That is not a colossal amount to assist in child care or make provision for child care services.</P>
    <P>The Government has offered to assist in co-ordinating existing voluntary organisations and community activities to deliver services. Schools and community groups who run after school and child care services received a budget allocation of £5 million. How does the Government intend to make provision for any substantial after school or community based service? Even if it makes provision, who will run it? Will it run on hot air? It will not. It is a totally impracticable scheme.</P>
    <P>The one substantial thing the Government did was provide a 100% capital allowance for investment in child care facilities. In other words, any money given out is given to the private sector to provide bricks and mortar to build crèches and pre-school facilities. It is like saying we will provide the private sector with money to build parks, like car parks, to park children. Who will pay for it? The parents will pay for it. There is no tax rebate for this service. Parents will not be provided with any help and the private sector is supposed to carry the can for the Government.</P>
    <P>The opposite position has been adopted by Minister for Education in Northern Ireland. Last week he announced that he would provide funding for a free pre-school system of education. This system extends only to three to four year olds but this age group will now be brought into the State system of education. We have not begun to consider this approach. Why can we not have a pre-school system, properly financed with facilities, rather than paying out capital allowances to the private sector to provide premises? Let us get down to the real child care services that are required, their supply and access.</P>
    <P>We will not be able to provide an adequate system if we do not provide one that is State run. The first major announcement by the new administration in Northern Ireland has been about support for children. If it can be done in Northern Ireland then the least we can do with all our new found wealth is to respond in kind to child care.</P>
    <P>A constitutional case would be worthwhile in relation to the commitment to provide free primary education for our children. That commitment has never been met. A provision catering for children between the ages of four and 12 years is not free primary education. The first stage of education that children benefit from should be financed by the State.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposal is modest. As the budget did not address this matter in its earliest manifestation I ask that the new Finance Bill, with all the amendments that we are expecting, should address it. The partnership talks are taking place and that would be the ideal forum for putting together suitable amendments to the Finance Bill. This would enable us to deal with the matter adequately now rather than at a future stage in the national development plan. </P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and all Senators, male and female, who contributed to this debate for their thought-provoking, wide ranging and worthwhile contributions. This motion has been worthwhile and there has been a broad measure of agreement that, not only do we have a problem, but that we have to come up with solutions. However, there is no agreement on the range of solutions and the fundamental issue clearly outlined by Senator Ryan as to where we are, the choices we have, the manner in which we build our community and the kind of society we create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from the Minister's response, the budget and comments made by several Ministers that this Administration still sees child care as a problem for parents. The Minister spoke about a range of initiatives, particularly supports for community groups and voluntary organisations. These initiatives are very welcome, particularly in the context of the equality agenda, but they do not deal with the major problem &ndash; the thousands <Col N="84" /> of families who face into work every day and the issue of who is minding their young children. It is clear the Government is not going to deal with this issue in a comprehensive manner and that it sees it as an issue for employers, hence the introduction of capital allowances.</P>
    <P>I wish to respond to some sharp remarks, particularly those made by Senator Cox. The Government views the building of crèches in the same way as it views the building of car parks &ndash; if one wants them built one provides tax incentives to employers and those with money to invest. I am sorry that Senator Cox is not in the House to hear my response, but once one has built the facility how are parents to pay for a crèche place, how does one ensure a standard of care, that staff are well paid and that there is quality training for staff? What of those who want to have their children cared for at home, whether by their relations or another woman from the community? One is dealing with this issue on a bricks and mortar basis by solely providing capital tax allowances. This is very disappointing.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that the Government is going to stand by and hope that employers come forward with a solution. I hope our prosperity does not come to an end reducing demands on the labour force, but if that arises we will not have put in place a permanent structure which will have to be taken apart.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox described this as a business issue in addition to being a family issue. It is clear that the Government sees it as a business issue and, regrettably, as a labour force issue which is only a problem because we need women in the workforce. This is an issue of how we organise our community and our society. Given the resources available, we have a unique opportunity to put in place a high quality, high standard, affordable and accessible child care system which will be of fundamental value to children, their parents and the communities in which they live. This system would not just be for the children of parents engaged full-time in the workforce. It would be for children of parents who choose not to work and to everyone in the wider community. It would be highly regrettable if this opportunity was not grasped. The coming weeks will tell us if this is going to happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am seeking information in order to determine the policy of his Department in relation to ultra rapid opiate detoxification in which opiate addicts are detoxified through use of the drug Naltrexone. The effect is that under general anaesthetic the drug has the effect of supplanting the narcotics in the brain and nervous system. This brings the addiction to an end in four to six or seven hours. This results in a lot of misery and withdrawal symptoms which means people may not be able to continue to be detoxified or to kick the habit. The first-long term study conducted in October 1988 by the American Psychiatric Association on 120 patients over a six month period found that 55% remained drug free after the treatment. This compares sharply with the normal course of treatment of physeptone or other substitute, such as cold turkey, used under the present system which has in the region of a 10% to 20% success rate.</P>
      <P>This issue concerns a number of community groups in the north side of the city, particularly the Dublin 7 against drugs group which organised a major conference at the end of last year. It invited speakers from Britain, the Department of Health and Children and so on and tried to establish the policy of the Eastern Health Board and other health boards in relation to the use of the drugs and whether the drug Naltrexone would be developed on a pilot basis. A number of countries, including Britain, Spain, Switzerland, the United States and Canada are using the drug.</P>
      <P>The drug seems to have considerable benefits for pregnant women in particular. The unborn child would benefit from the treatment because, as I understand it, the mother would, as a whole person, be detoxified under the influence of the drug. It seems to me that one of our clinics, perhaps Cherry Orchard or elsewhere, would be a suitable place for conducting a pilot scheme to see whether the drug would be successful. It could be a test period for Ireland. There have been developments since the last conference took place but I want to determine whether the Government is looking seriously at this option. If so, in what capacity and, if not, why not, given that it is operating on a fairly regular basis in other countries that have stringent health regulations and would not do so without having carried out tests and surveys.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to clarify the position with regard to Naltrexone.</P>
      <P>Government policy in relation to drug misuse is that a wide range of drug treatment options should be provided, including methadone maintenance, detoxification and other programmes aimed at those addicted to drugs, especially people who are addicted to heroin. The overall aim is to restore people to a drug free lifestyle. Although it is recognised that this may not be a realistic goal for some hardened drug users, particularly in the short-term, this remains our primary objective. As the Senator will appreciate, decisions regarding the best treatment option for patients rest with those medical consultants specialising in this area.</P>
      <P>Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist. It blocks the actions of opioids such as heroin and precipitates withdrawal symptoms in opioid dependent subjects. Since the euphoric action of the opioid agonists is blocked by Naltrexone, it is given to former addicts as an aid to relapse prevention, that is, when a recovering addict takes heroin while on Naltrexone he or she will no longer experience a buzz. However, there is a great temptation for opioid dependent patients, particularly unstable patients or patients experiencing withdrawal, to increase their normal street dose of heroin in an attempt to overcome this Naltrexone block. Patients need to be warned that an attempt to overcome this block could result in opioid intoxification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naltrexone is, therefore, only suitable for use in a small number of highly motivated and reliable patients who are supported by a good home and community environment. Treatment must be initiated in a specialised clinic. I understand that the medical consultants working in this area are currently using Naltrexone on a trial <Col N="87" /> basis in some treatment centres in the Eastern Health Board region. New research has suggested that supervised ingestion of Naltrexone provides for a more effective treatment. Supervised administration by family members is one of the aspects that is being researched by these consultants. I, therefore, assure the Senator that under current <Col N="88" /> policy all treatment options are under consideration and should the value of Naltrexone be established in this area, it, too, will be made available for use.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 January 2000.</P>
