      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the progress to date made by the Dublin Institute of Technology towards acquiring the health board site at Grangegorman, Dublin 7; and, further, to outline the uses for which the site is intended.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Caffrey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to outline whether consideration has been given to the question of providing spur lines from the main transmission line of An Bord Gáis from Pollatomish to Galway to the major towns in Mayo that are within a reasonable distance of the main line from the Corrib Field.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to ensure that adequate training and educational outlets are provided for young people wishing to pursue a career in agriculture.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Costello's and Senator Caffrey's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Ross may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the House, I express our deepest sympathy to the Deputy Leader, Senator Dardis, on the death of his mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Order of Business for today is No. 1, Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 2, statements on <Col N="666" /> the clinical vaccine trials report to be taken at 4.30 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Members may share time; and No. 15, motion No. 25.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of this side of the House, I join the Leader of the House in expressing sympathy to Senator Dardis on the death of his mother.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree to the Order of the Business. I ask the Leader of the House to allow spokespersons more time on No. 2, an issue of great importance. Children were used as guinea pigs, operated on and treated without respect by virtue of the fact that they had no one to defend them or to say whether this should have happened. The Leader of the House should consider allocating 20 minutes to each spokesperson.</P>
      <P>On the rolling stock of CIE, an issue on which I agree with Senator Burke and which he has raised on a number of occasions, will the Minister for Public Enterprise come into the House and tell us why there has been an undue delay in the provision of rolling stock which can be utilised by those who are less able physically than the rest of us? People in wheelchairs have to use the dining room. I heard today about a young lady who had to use the goods wagon. That is not the way we treat our citizens; we treat them equally. When exactly is it intended to make provision for the people concerned? The position in the west, where the need is greatest, should be looked at first, rather than the Dublin-Belfast line, to ensure we do not have a two tier system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The case that the time allocated for spokespersons be extended beyond 15 minutes has merit. Some Senators have much to say about the issue. I therefore recommend the amendment to the Leader of the House.</P>
      <P>Last week we had a good discussion on a number of issues arising from the Olympic Games. Another issue has emerged in the meantime with which the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation might deal. He should look into the report in today's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner </i>about the undemocratic and unrepresentative nature of the Irish Olympic Council which is supported by huge amounts of State funds. It is not appropriate that we are supporting that type of structure and it is time we spoke out about the issue. It is unfortunate that we did not know about it last week. I am not suggesting that we should have another long debate on sport &ndash; that is not what I am calling for &ndash; but there should be an appropriate response from the Minister on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue raised by Senator Coogan, we also had a long debate on the Paralympics and people with disabilities. The Centres for Independent Living have made a pre-budget submission on behalf of those with a handicap and those who need support to live independently. It would be appropriate, in the context of the budget, for this <Col N="667" /> House to look very carefully at what they are asking for. In a society where we need equality and in the month when the Equal Status Bill was passed, it would be appropriate for us to show our support for an injection of greater resources into the centres of independent living. I would like a debate on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour group, I extend our sympathies to Senator Dardis on the death of his mother.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the issue of sport. On a different aspect, I welcome the recommendation made at the inquest yesterday into the death of a young basketball player from Limerick that research should be conducted into the ingredients of the stimulant drinks that are in widespread use throughout the country. They were initially available in clubs but are now part of the drinks consumed by sports people on a widespread basis. That should be looked into very carefully.</P>
      <P>Last week I called for a debate on the teachers' industrial action. Given that air and rail services ground to a halt over the past couple of days and the industrial action that has been taken by the teachers will continue for another week, we should have a widespread debate on the whole area of industrial relations and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>We should look specifically at the issue of a trade union body such as the ASTI, which is not part of the PPF, being asked by the Minister for Education and Science to conduct its negotiations in the context of an agreement which it did not sign and to which it is not party. We should also look at the threat to deduct pay from a body which is giving voluntary supervision, as if that were part of its normal duties. These serious matters should be addressed in this House rather than by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Education and Science using the newspapers to do so, without a proper industrial relations forum to address these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party, I wish to express our sympathy to our colleague, Senator Dardis, on the death of his mother.</P>
      <P>I remind the Leader that last week we asked for a day long debate on education. We specifically wanted to debate the Cromien report on the Department of Education and Science. I also asked for provision to be made to discuss the issue of teacher education and training. I ask the Leader not to long-finger that request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the fact that the capital city of the west ground to a halt yesterday because pickets were placed on the train station, preventing Bus Éireann buses and Iarnród Éireann trains from leaving the station, I must support the call for a debate on industrial relations. It is not fair that the blunt instrument of striking can be used against ordinary people in such a manner. If our industrial relations mechan<Col N="668" /> isms are that poor, the Government must do something about it. I would welcome such a debate.</P>
      <P>I also second the call for a debate on stimulant drinks. It is very sad to see young people, and some not so young people, going out nightly and using these drinks to rev themselves up to continue until the early hours of the morning. That cannot be good for their health. I support the call to have this investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we arrived at the stage in the South that we need General de Chastelain to come here to decommission weapons? Is the House aware that 60 or more weapons were recovered in Limerick? It appears that at least one person will be murdered every week in Dublin, which will probably be reported on page seven of the newspapers. I am reluctant to use the term &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; but I must bring it into use again and ask the Leader to ask the Minister to come to the House to tell us what he proposes to do about lawlessness.</P>
      <P>It appears that the paramilitaries have sold out and sold on. In a neighbourhood in my constituency, people were stopped one Saturday night by a gentleman wearing a balaclava and carrying a gun. Is the city becoming like Chicago in the 1930s? The Minister owes it to the people to come to the House and explain what he intends to do about the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on education. I also support the call for a discussion on industrial relations, with particular regard to the teaching profession and its conditions of employment. It is time to bring everything into the open and there is no better place for such a discussion than the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I asked that time be allocated for statements on the role of An Bord Pleanála. In the course of my work I frequently hear derogatory reports about An Bord Pleanála. Now that we are in the process of introducing local government reform and given that this is an important agency in the planning system, it is appropriate before the legislation is introduced that we should be given an opportunity to discuss An Bord Pleanála and, indeed, the brief of the National Roads Authority and the Dublin Transport Office in the context of traffic procedures and how they link into the local authorities in Dublin. These are important issues on which there should be an opportunity to make statements. The statements could contribute to the broad concept of how agencies should link with local authorities in the context of local government reform.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House and outline what plans he has to protect non-EU doctors and their families from racist attacks? I have previously brought this matter to the attention of the House. Given that the Department has <Col N="669" /> taken the unprecedented step of going to the Indian subcontinent to recruit doctors to work in this country, it might well have a legal as well as a moral obligation to look after their safety. I get complaints almost every week about people being attacked, even though we depend on these doctors to staff the hospitals outside our major centres. The Minister needs to take a more energetic approach to protecting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's comments about the Olympic Council of Ireland. The House would benefit from such a debate. In the Minister's defence, he has been shouting this message for many months. The athletics body is not represented on the executive council of the OCI, even though two thirds of Olympic activity is about track and field events.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate when the Broadcasting Bill will be before the House? It has been wending a tortuous path through the Lower House and is now at the end of Committee Stage. Will it be before the Seanad before Christmas? In that context, I commend the Minister on her comments in the Dáil last night with regard to an increase in the television licence fee for RTÉ. She indicated that she will set up a system for outside evaluation. Could the Minister be afforded the opportunity of clarifying what she means by that? Television viewers and radio listeners should be included in the evaluation. Unfortunately, Governments traditionally seek the views of economists, think tanks, consultants and so forth. In this instance the people who matter most are the television viewers and radio listeners. The general perception of RTÉ &ndash; I am not sure that it is correct &ndash; is that it has not listened to the general public when planning its programming.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister to expand on her comments last night in the context of the Broadcasting Bill or invite her to come to the House to make a statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my condolences to Senator Dardis on the death of his mother.</P>
      <P>I also seek a debate on child care, which is now at a crisis point. There is an extreme lack of supply of child care services but great demand for them. As many women are aware, the focus is on this issue now because of the current economic situation, not as a result of any great concern about child care itself. That is most unfortunate. Notwithstanding that, this is an issue we must debate in this House.</P>
      <P>I also support, as I did last week, the call for a debate on education, which would be timely. We heard about the Cromien report last week. We must stress the difficulties faced by children who fall between the cracks, who do not benefit from what is generally a good education system and who are the deprived children of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in calling for a debate on the unfortunate situation that has arisen in 600 schools across the nation. I regret it <Col N="670" /> has taken this to provoke calls for a lengthy debate in this House, which the situation warrants. It is evident that work practices are outdated. I was staggered to realise that supervision in school yards is still done on a voluntary basis without payment. From the perspective of examination students particularly, whose career prospects are being put at risk, this warrants not only an immediate resolution but a full debate in this House.</P>
      <P>I also join my colleagues who raised the question of the undemocratic structures of the Olympic Council. For the Minister to come here to answer questions would be very worthwhile. I have no doubt he would welcome the opportunity. This issue was touched upon in a recent debate here and I raised the matter in the context of the generally undemocratic nature of the Olympic Council. I was not as aware as I am now, as a result of the report in today's <i>Irish Examiner</i>, that we have a 19th century structure which is utterly undemocratic and which is in receipt of significant amounts of State funds. It is the custodian of the dreams of many of our young people and it warrants a full debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like further clarification on the proposal to have statements today on vaccine trials. The Leader of the House said they would start at 4.30 p.m. but he did not give a closing time. Are they to end at 6 p.m. or will they go on after that? Will they go into another day? Many people will want to make statements on this very significant issue involving questions of ethics from which we can certainly learn. I am not sure whether Senator Coogan proposed an amendment to the Order of Business. If not, I will be proposing that we amend it to set a time limit of 20 minutes on contributions. I would prefer an open-ended debate, but 20 minutes would be reasonable. I am making a formal proposal, and I will put it to a vote if it is not agreed.</P>
      <P>Does the Government have plans to reform legislation dealing with the &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; verdict in courts? I ask because in the past few days we have been again chastised by a senior member of the Bench for not amending this legislation which hamstrings them in certain cases. It is our duty as legislators to do this.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on Red Bull. If advertisements are to be believed, it has a very serious stimulant effect. A friend of mine was attacked in his house last year and tied up with his wife, and one of the defence arguments was that the person who did it was behaving out of character because he had been drinking Red Bull. That opens up an area that we should consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with my colleagues that we should have a debate on the subject of teachers and their remuneration. One of the reasons this country is doing so well is because of teachers. I sympathise with them with regard to their pay structures. I heard a teacher saying yesterday that she was being derided by colleagues from university who had gone into other professions and who <Col N="671" /> regarded the remuneration of teachers as derisory and ludicrous. I would remind the House that teachers' salaries, as quoted, are slightly in excess of what we in this House get. Perhaps we should look for parity with teachers following a successful claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>A recent article in <i>The Guardian</i> written by a member of the Patten Commission on policing was significant and worrying. The author of the article accused the British Government of gutting the proposals of the Patten report. As we know from Northern Ireland history, it is particularly important that a new police force should enjoy the full confidence and support of the Nationalist community. That is fundamental to the peace process. Fundamental also to the Good Friday Agreement are the cross-Border bodies. We have a stalemate there. It is evident the process is in very troubled waters. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate at a very early stage to discuss this, as it is unacceptable that the process is drifting, as it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with the message of sympathy to Senator Dardis on the death of his mother.</P>
      <P>I support my colleague, Senator Coogan, on the state of our rail and bus services. It is time the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, did something about it. She has been in office for the past three and a half years and the service is getting worse. She should make a public apology to the woman from Westport who had to spend 40 minutes in a wheelchair in a goods wagon of a train on arrival at its destination before she was taken off the train last Sunday. That was deplorable. The rail service from the west was faster in the 1800s when it was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot go into this type of detail on the Order of Business, as it is neither appropriate nor relevant to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of that incident last weekend, I ask the Leader of the House as a matter of urgency to request the Minister for Public Enterprise to come into the House to give the up-to-date position on what she is doing to improve rail and bus services from Dublin to rural parts of the country. They are in chaos. Urgent action is required. I and many people think the Minister has lost it, that she is not in command. If she is not, something will have to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to come into the House to debate the issues of law reform and law and order. Such a debate would enable him to lay before this House the large volume of legislation he has introduced since he became Minister. It would also be an opportunity for him to outline the number of pri<Col N="672" /> son spaces he has provided, thus ensuring all those who commit a serious crime will spend hard time. It would be encouraging if Members supported the concept of CCTV, as it has proved to be of great assistance for those who enforce law and order.</P>
      <P>In relation to unprovoked attacks, a number of which took place in Mullingar, I commend the local gardaí for the proactive measures they took to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ormonde's points regarding An Bord Pleanála. Today I received a letter from a man who has received planning permission for a house, but an appeal has been made to An Bord Pleanála. It has written to him informing him it will not be able to deal with the appeal before the middle of next year. The objection to that application was lodged by a crank. It is unacceptable that people should have to wait that length of time before they can commence work on the building of their homes and should have to endure the cost involved.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to come into the House to debate the issue of the large number of women who stayed at home to rear their families who cannot get on to FÁS retraining programmes as they are not on the live register. There is a great demand for such retraining programmes. Those women are anxious to return to the workplace.</P>
      <P>I ask for a debate on this matter as it is important to point out to the Minister the needs of this large number of people. Nobody is standing up for them. They have given a lot to society and are prepared to go back into the workforce at a time when they are badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible for the Minister for Public Enterprise or the Minister for Finance to inform the House of the steps the Government is taking to object in the strongest possible terms to the proposals from the UK Chancellor? Mr. Brown intends, in his forthcoming budget, to impose additional taxes on Irish freight &ndash; ordinary or articulated lorries &ndash; when they use the roads in Her Majesty's jurisdiction. My county exports most of the fish produced and processed there through Northern Ireland and Britain and on to the Continent. We know of the difficulties they are having due to oil costs but if this additional tax were to be imposed it would put most of these operators out of business and indirectly affect the fishing industry greatly. One of these Ministers should come to the House to debate this, as now is the time to object at European Commission level. There is no doubt this measure is against European law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister for the Environment and Local Government intervene in any way with An Bord Pleanála regarding its draconian requirements for the forthcoming oral appeal hearing in <Col N="673" /> Donegal which involves the anti-pylon campaign? I am not making an issue on behalf of that campaign but on behalf of the people of the Donegal Gaeltacht. They have been asked to furnish to An Bord Pleanála before the hearings take place copies of any contributions they wish to make in Irish. It is the right of every citizen in the State to make a case in their native language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>It was over the top to make such a request and I urge the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to intervene to ensure people are allowed to make a case as they are entitled to do under the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I seldom speak on the Order of Business but RTÉ is looking for a rise of approximately 50% in television licence fees, which Senator Mooney mentioned. If this is to be considered we should have a debate on the quality of RTÉ's programmes. It is disgraceful, particularly the treatment it gives sport. There should be a live sports programme at the weekend on either Saturday or Sunday. There is an important race in Ireland at the weekend &ndash; John Taylor might say it is in the United Kingdom but I think it is in Ireland &ndash; which is being televised live by Channel 4 and a French television channel. It is a disgrace that RTÉ cannot televise it.</P>
      <P>I am not specifically speaking about racing but also about other sports. Those who are old or housebound deserve better. We should debate this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in relation to No. 2 that I proposed 15 minutes for spokespersons, ten minutes for all other speakers and that Senators could share time. There will be a motion on the clinical vaccine trials report before the House soon &ndash; probably next week &ndash; but I have no difficulty in extending the speaking time for principal spokespersons to 20 minutes.</P>
      <P>Senators Coogan, Norris, O'Toole, Burke and Mooney expressed views regarding the poor rail facilities in the west. I will forward those views to the Minister, who is a hardworking and dedicated individual intent on trying to improve the very difficult situation she inherited from her various predecessors. I will also highlight the incident involving the lady in the wheelchair. That was a regrettable occurrence and no one should have to experience such treatment. I join Members in expressing my shock and horror at what occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to the day when all areas are served equally by our rail network. The affluence which has resulted from the Celtic tiger should be spread across the country, not concentrated on two or three heavily populated areas. I support calls that the Border, midlands and west of <Col N="674" /> Ireland region should be well served by the rail network.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns of various Members <i>vis-à-vis </i>the activities of the Olympic Council of Ireland. I will make the Minister, with whom we had a full and lengthy debate some weeks ago, aware of those concerns. If another debate is needed to deal with this specific issue, I will make time available for it.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer to the unfortunate death of a young student at the weekend. It is appalling to see someone die at such a young age and if the ingredients of certain drinks were to blame there should be an immediate investigation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators' requests for a debate on industrial relations. I will endeavour to arrange such a debate during the next two to three weeks and I look forward to lengthy contributions by the various Members who expressed their concerns in respect of this issue.</P>
    <P>Senators Ridge and Glynn requested that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should come before the House to outline Government policy for the future in respect of the area of justice. As stated on many occasions on the Order of Business, the Minister is hardworking and dedicated. In the first two years of the Government's term of office, 32% and 27% of all legislation processed by the Dáil and Seanad, respectively, emanated from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I spoke to the Minister at lunch and he informed me that he intends to bring further Bills before the Houses, a number of which will be initiated in the Seanad. I agree with the views expressed by Senator Glynn in respect of this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge expressed a number of views regarding law and order on our streets, a matter of extreme importance which involves protecting the basic freedom of every citizen to walk or drive where they please. The Garda Síochána is doing everything possible to protect people's rights in this regard. However, if additional resources are needed they should be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Senators Ormonde, Tom Hayes and Bonner called for statements on An Bord Pleanála. The Senators inquired whether it should be allowed to continue in existence or be replaced by an alternative, perhaps a court style system of appeal that can deal more efficiently and directly with matters and be more answerable to the public. An Bord Pleanála appears to many elected representatives and members of the public to be a law unto itself and people who appeal planning decisions never feel they have been given a fair hearing. Many unexplained decisions have been made in recent years. On the other hand, An Bord Pleanála has been obliged to deal with an unprecedented level of work. This matter is worthy of a lengthy debate, perhaps in conjunction with the debate on local government reform. I will make time available for such a debate.</P>
    <P>I will pass on Senator Henry's views on non-EU hospital doctors. Senators Mooney and Rory Kiely requested a debate on the increase in tele<Col N="675" /> vision licence fees sought by RTÉ. I have no difficulty with arranging such a debate. As I have often stated, RTÉ is a place of excellence and has always produced the goods when a challenge has been laid before it. However, there is always room for improvement and there is a need to consider the position from the perspective of viewers. If customers do not like what they see in a shop window, they will not buy it. Likewise, in this case they will switch to another channel. It would be healthy to allow Senators to express their opinions while the Minister is evaluating the request from the RTÉ authority. I fully agree with Senator Mooney that RTÉ viewers and listeners should be included in the procedure. The Committee Stage debate on the Broadcasting Bill is taking place in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On Senator Costello's request for a debate on child care, time can be made available for this. I will pass on to the Minister for Justice Senator Norris's views on the &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; plea, which has been referred to a considerable number of times by justices. Senator Ó Murchú called for a debate on the report of the Patten Commission on policing. Time can also be made available for this.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes called for FÁS to expand its training programmes to cater for the many men and women who wish to return to the workplace. These people, particularly females, have much expertise and are fully committed to the areas in which they reside. I will raise this excellent idea with the Minister and it may be possible to debate it during this session.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner called on the Minister for Finance to contact the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, as a matter of urgency, to discuss the serious plight facing many companies if an additional tax is imposed on Irish freight. A high percentage of industries, for example, the fishing industry in Donegal, export their products by freight. This issue is of serious concern to all exporters and following the conclusion of the Order of Business I will immediately raise it with the Minister for Finance's office.</P>

      <P>Who are &ldquo;authorised officers&rdquo; under this section? Are they bailiffs on a river or members of the Garda? Gardaí have powers when they are accompanied by bailiffs. There is no provision to punish an authorised officer for committing an offence. I do not wish to go over old ground but Members will recall during the last Seanad there was complete co-operation in the House to pass legislation which dealt with authorised officers who had abused their position on a certain regional fisheries board.</P>
      <P>Without going into detail on that issue, it created a problem for the Department of the Marine for a long time. An officer had to be appointed to the board in question and it was then disbanded. I hope this issue is relevant under this section. Who are authorised officers? Must they be accompanied by gardaí? If gardaí witness the commission of a fishery offence they may have powers.</P>
      <P>There is no provision for the punishment of an authorised officer. Fishery offences, including the catching and confiscation of salmon, are possibly open to abuse by a lone authorised officer. I know many such officers and they are top of the list in my book. Section 2 provides for punishments for offences but in the case of an authorised officer such punishments do not apply. I would like the Minister to clarify this issue.</P>
      <P>We all co-operated with the former Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, when he introduced legislation dealing with authorised officers. The problem has been sorted out and the Minister knows what I am talking about.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzgerald has made a good point. We had a lengthy debate during the passage of previous legislation through the House in regard to the members of a regional fisheries board who had abused their powers and privileges. The Minister should spell out that the law <Col N="677" /> applies evenly to everyone, be they an officer, a member of the public, a fisherman or whoever. Who or what is an authorised officer?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain how the procedure for collecting on the spot fines will work in practice? Will a person have a docket book with which to issue £50 fines or whatever fine is provided for and will he stick the fine in the offender's top pocket, or what will be done? There may be slight confusion about this. Senator Fitzgerald made a very good point about authorised officers. Who is an authorised officer and how do they work? The last thing needed is ambiguity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">

      <P>Senators Fitzgerald and Burke referred to authorised officers in the context of inshore fishermen and primary anglers. I take it the legislation also applies to drift net fishermen as they are in receipt of salmon licences. Will officers of the Naval Service be regarded as authorised officers? Like others, these men go out to sea in boats. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke asked what mechanism will be in place to collect fines. If one is speeding, the Garda has use of speed guns and tracking cars to identify that. Gardaí spend two years training in Templemore. Many authorised officers, however, may not have formal training when appointed. Grudges against bailiffs may be held in local communities because of what might have happened before and an overly enthusiastic authorised officer could then be appointed. Perhaps the Minister could clarify matters in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also concerned about on the spot fines. Detection and punishment of a crime or offence usually involves a fine and media exposure. The exposure is often a greater deterrent than the monetary fine. We are dealing with big business. Illegally caught salmon may be worth thousands of pounds. If media exposure does not exist with on the spot fines, it may be worth people's while just to pay the fines. If they are 20, 30 or 40 miles out on the high seas, they pay their money and that is the end of it. Will the Minister clarify that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the issue of who guards the guards when they implement the law but do not believe it applies to them. I do not know how the Minister will solve that problem, but the law should extend to every citizen, including those charged with its execution. An amendment dealing with this should be included, if possible, because circumstances have arisen where those charged with implementing the law have abused it.</P>
      <P>The on the spot fine is not really such because it can be paid within a period of 21 days. However, the principle that a fine is imposed is good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know the difference between an authorising officer and an authorising agent, which is referred to in the next section. We <Col N="678" /> already have a system of on the spot fines for traffic offences, but many such penalties have been discredited. This is either because they are not being followed up or because insufficient resources have been made available to ensure that where offences of a relatively minor nature are committed they will be prosecuted. For example, literally tens of thousands of offences concerning dog licences are not being prosecuted. In addition, many traffic offences are not being followed up or are being prosecuted in a very lethargic fashion from one end of the country to the other. Who will be responsible for ensuring that the offences will be chased up and the money collected? </P>
    <P>There is no doubt about the point made by Senator Caffrey, that there is a relatively small number of major culprits upon whom the authorities should focus their efforts. They should be brought into the glare of publicity. An annual report could publish a list of such offenders who have been abusing the law by poaching salmon and other fish. Where people commit more than one offence their names should be made public. That is the best way to avoid a recurrence. What extra resources will the Minister make available to ensure the legislation is properly implemented? </P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey) Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Authorised officers for the tagging scheme and on the spot fines will be the staff of regional fisheries boards or the Central Fisheries Board, as well as the Minister's departmental officers, BIM staff, or inspectors. The Garda Síochána are not authorised officers for those two purposes and they cannot become involved in such on the spot fines. However, the gardaí are authorised officers for other purposes within the Act. As for the type of documentation that will be used in on the spot fines, I am not sure what kind of documentation we might go for in County Mayo but, generally speaking, it will be similar to on the spot fines for traffic offences, where officers have a booklet to indicate the level of parking or speeding fines that are applicable. A person who is caught and given an on the spot fine has the choice of paying that fine or risking prosecution. If he wishes to stop the prosecution process, he can pay the fine. We are starting with an on the spot fine of £50 to see what impact that will have. If we find it does not have the necessary impact, we have the power to increase the fine by regulation.</P>
      <P>Authorised officers can include a person or persons who are not officers of the fisheries boards but who are appointed in writing by the regional board to be an authorised officer for the purposes of the said section. We have left ourselves room to ensure that we have an adequate number of officers in place. It is my intention, certainly during the spring salmon season and at other times, to appoint additional fisheries officers to tighten controls and stop illegal fishing and poaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> We have 29 types of criminal offences within the Act and they deal with the tagging section. They also deal with other areas such as the by-laws which prohibit various activities. I am satisfied that we have covered this area in great detail in legislation and I hope it will work effectively.   </P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant to ask this question earlier but Senator Caffrey touched on this matter.</P>
      <P>In relation to the £50 on the spot fine, there could be major breaches of the regulations. If you are caught doing 70 mph in a 60 mph area you would be fined £50. I am sure if you are caught doing 110 mph it would be a more serious offence.</P>
      <P>If an authorised officer comes across someone with a boatful of illegally caught salmon a £50 fine would not be very reasonable. Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether an officer can increase the first fine or whether it must remain at £50.</P>
      <P>Is it envisaged in this legislation that a person can pay the fine on the spot to the authorised officer? I was caught speeding &ndash; I will not mention the county but it was not County Donegal. I was given a ticket and I paid the £50 on the spot fine. About a month later I got a letter from the superintendent in the area seeking £50. Luckily I had the receipt written on the back of an envelope. I forwarded my receipt and received another letter stating that the fine had been paid. I am not insinuating that the garda in question held on to the money or that there was maladministration. Will this legislation provide for the £50 fine being paid on the spot? If it does there would need to be strict regulations in place for the authorised officers.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister about the authorised officers' relationship with drift net fishermen. The Naval Service can board pelagic and white fish boats. Are Naval Service officers regarded as authorised officers? If he cannot answer my question now perhaps he can do so at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I mentioned how frivolous it seemed to me &ndash; and I am only giving this as an example &ndash; to bring large fishing boats 200 miles to port to face minor offences. Sometimes these offences do not reach the courts. They then go back out to sea again. This is all done at a huge cost to themselves.</P>
      <P>It seems fairly heavy handed that if a person cannot produce a licence when they are asked for it they will be fined on the spot. I thought that it would be the same as when the gardaí stop a person on the road and you cannot produce a driving licence. In the past you had ten days to report to your local Garda station. If someone went fishing but forgot to bring their licence with them and was not able to produce it could they be asked, rather than giving them an on the spot fine, to produce it at an office within so many days?   </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am looking at this matter in two ways. I want to be easy on small offences but lean heavily on <Col N="680" /> greater offences. The Minister is not leaning very heavily on offenders, an issue which has been touched upon. A regular offender over a period, and definitely after a second offence, should be barred or not given a licence again for rod, net or whatever.</P>
    <P>We bring in laws. I do not want to raise this matter because it happened recently. At present there is a great scheme around the coast for lobsters. The Department and BIM are helping it in a big way. Recently someone was caught with 36 small undersized lobsters. He went to court and his solicitor said he was poor. The judge imposed the minimum fine of £100 and let him off even though he had destroyed thousands of pounds worth of young lobsters. Will the person who genuinely forgets to carry their licence be fined? Will serial offenders or people who commit a few offences over a short period be dealt with in a more severe manner? </P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Caffrey made a very good point earlier about the guy who catches a boatload of salmon but may only be fined £50. Perhaps there should be a sliding scale of offences. A points system could be introduced like the one for driving offences.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald also made an excellent point. There are a lot of genuine people. A person could lose his licence. His jacket could fall into a river or out of his boat for some unknown reason. It would be unfair to this type of person to impose an on the spot fine. As Senator Fitzgerald has said, it should possible to produce your licence somewhere. As I have said, the vast majority of fishermen and people involved in the fishing business are genuine people. They do not want to commit offences. They are law abiding people. We cannot tar everyone with the one brush. I support some of the comments that have been made by Senators earlier.</P>
      <P>With regard to a sliding scale for offences, a person who would get a big reward from their crime does not mind paying a £50 fine. He will go out and commit the same offence every week.   </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I agree with the comments made by Senators Fitzgerald, Caffrey and Bonner on this matter. The Minister probably has the power to introduce a system apart from doing so through legislation, perhaps through a ministerial order. The problem could be solved if an amendment was brought forward which dealt with the production of a licence and introduced a sliding scale of penalties for offences.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister responded to any of the issues raised in my initial contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Angling from a river bank where you might catch a trout or a salmon and taking a boatful of fish from the sea are different types of offences. This legislation does not seem to address this at <Col N="681" /> all. In this context, there is probably a small number of culprits who are involved big time to make a killing. If this is considered to be a minor offence in respect of which an on the spot fine will be payable, obviously it will not be a deterrent. If there is a racket, the concept of multiple offences by the same person or persons should be contemplated by the Minister. He should also contemplate the compilation of an end of year report on the types of offences committed, be it at sea or on lakes and rivers, indicating the areas in which the greatest numbers of on the spot fines have been imposed.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the final section of the legislation that it is not expected that any costs will be incurred. Given the huge backlogs in so many other areas from litter and dog licences to traffic offences, is the Minister satisfied that there are sufficient personnel to ensure efficiency in initiating prosecutions to ensure extra costs will not be incurred in urgently executing the legislation which provides for on the spot fines?</P>

      <P>Fines will be payable at offices of regional fisheries boards. Payment may be made within a period of 21 days. To answer Senator Burke's question, section 3 provides for a sliding scale of penalties for tagging offences. The maximum fine for a first offence will be £500, for a second offence, £750, and for a third offence, £1,000. In the case of serious offences, the maximum fine will be £1,500 and-or three months imprisonment. If a more serious offence is committed of the type to which Senator Caffrey referred, a fisheries officer will have the option of seeking a conviction rather than imposing an on the spot fine. It will be, therefore, an extra weapon in his or her hand. Because of the bureaucracy involved in pursuing prosecutions, to which Senator Costello referred, we regard the on the spot fine as a significant way of dealing immediately with offences of a minor nature. The person <Col N="682" /> concerned will be given a notice of fine and will have 21 days in which to pay. I am happy, therefore, that we will not have a bureaucratic structure which will cause further work and delays. In the case of repeat and more serious offences, the fisheries officer will have discretion to initiate a prosecution as opposed to imposing an on the spot fine.</P>
      <P>It is an offence under the Fisheries Act, 1959, not to have in one's possession when fishing a salmon fishing licence. In genuine cases a caution rather than an on the spot fine will be issued by the fisheries officer. Fisheries officers are both sensible and reasonable and the intention is&mdash;</P>

In the case of certain specific offences in the case of salmon and eel fishing, under the Fisheries Acts a court may disqualify a person with two convictions within a period of 12 months. All in all, we are providing for a good, common sense system. While I have taken on board the comments of Senator Burke about a scale of offences, the variety of actions that will be available to fisheries officers is such that they will be in a strong position to deal with illegality in the fishing sector. If not, what the Senator has proposed can be reconsidered.</P>

It is clear from this that payment may not be made to the authorised officer, rather it will have to be made at the specified office of the regional board. Under the legislation dealing with motoring offences, payment may be made to the garda who imposes the on the spot fine. Will the Minister clarify that those who are caught should not pay the £50 on the spot fine to the authorised officer? Knowing how the fishing industry operates, those involved could quite easily pay the £50 without documentation into the wrong hands. I take it that we should advise them not to pay on the spot.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the tagging of salmon and sea trout for the purpose of establishing real time data on actual catches. The relevant regulations have a commencement date of 1 January 2001. Will the scheme of tagging of salmon be operated directly by the Central Fisheries Board and regional fisheries boards which are doing good work? Where will the tagging be done? Will it be done at specified hatcheries in the same way that in years gone by the ESB had hatcheries on the Shannon and in Mayo?</P>
      <P>A Member of the House regularly receives his nomination to the Seanad from the Central Fisheries Board. He beat me to it.

      <P>Many people felt initially that the purpose of the tagging was to prevent illegal fishing and so on. However, I know the Department is stressing that it is being done for statistical purposes.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion that every licensee would be issued with a certain number of tags, based on their historical fishing record. Many people were disillusioned by the difficulties with salmon fishing in recent years due to the lack of salmon in the sea and did not work to the extent they did in earlier years. They will be penalised if the number of tags issued is based on the previous year's records.

      <P>I will let the Minister explain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The fisherman himself will simply tag the salmon. A log book will be kept so that there will be an account of the number of wild salmon caught. We want to establish the number of wild salmon caught for the purpose of research and conservation. There will be constant monitoring and checking of that. It will then form part of a whole research and information gathering exercise.</P>
      <P>In regard to the number of tags, people will be given tags but not for the purpose of limiting fishing, as such. A certain number of tags will be given which will limit the number of fish that can be caught. We do not intend to have any quotas in respect of river or recreational angling. I have given assurances on that to FISTA and some of the other angling organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>However, that may be necessary in a particular river catchment where there is a very serious decline in the salmon stock and where fishermen agree there is obviously a need to curtail the amount of angling. Generally speaking, I have given a guarantee that this is not about quotas for river or recreational angling.</P>
      <P>We do not have a proper database on wild salmon and one of the first requirements is to put such a database in place. We also want to stop the illegal selling of wild salmon and this database will allow us some control over that. For example, wild salmon should be tagged and traceable. That will enable us to stop some of the illegal activity that is taking place. Our salmon stocks and the value of our angling resources have reduced considerably as a result of illegal activity.</P>
      <P>The whole point of this exercise is to conserve our salmon stocks and to become knowledgeable about them. If it is then necessary, which I emphasise, we will put some controls on commercial fishing, whether by a quota system, a lay aside system or a buy-out system. The idea is to bring more salmon up the rivers to improve the whole breeding process and the amount of salmon in our rivers for recreational angling. The most economically significant way to catch salmon is on the rod, which is what we want to encourage.</P>
      <P>It puzzles me that some of the angling fraternity are the people who are most opposed to this. I cannot understand why they are because they will benefit most from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might have already answered my question in the latter part of his contribution. However, he referred mainly to recreational and river salmon fishing. Can I take it <Col N="685" /> that there will also be no quota on tags available to commercial drift net fishermen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for the moment, but there is a possibility that a quota may be imposed as time goes by. There is no doubt that that may be necessary as we proceed. Drift net and draft net fishermen have seen the resource decrease considerably over the past few years. If we do not take proper action now to conserve and increase the wild salmon stock, the people the Senator is talking about will lose out most of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I now welcome this Bill more than ever. The earlier legislation was very watery in regard to the purchase of salmon by individuals, restaurants and so on. Is the Minister saying that a log book will have to be kept by the purchaser as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to require restaurants, for example, to keep a record of their salmon purchases. I am talking here about people who purchase far more salmon than Members here would, who would just purchase part of a salmon. There should be a log kept of the licence numbers which could be inspected. Otherwise, fishery inspectors will have to visit restaurants and hotels at all times of the day and night to check for salmon tags.</P>
      <P>The Bill appeals to me much more now than it did when I first read it. I have no problem with quotas being set on rivers where stocks are declining. I was a member of the regional board when the Central Fisheries Board bought eight miles of the River Moy in Senator Caffrey's constituency. To the best of my knowledge the amount of money paid for each salmon caught in that river is far above that paid for a salmon caught by a commercial fisherman.</P>
      <P>Having heard the Minister's explanation, I welcome the legislation more than ever. There will probably be teething troubles with the follow up and the number of inspectors that will be required. The Minister might have to take another look at that. There are approximately 80 restaurants in Dingle and there is salmon to be found in each of them. There is no way a fisheries inspector could inspect all of them in one night.</P>

They should be surrendered to the authorised officer when requested by the authorised officer. All restaurants in Dingle will be required&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to the purchase of the Moy and the value of the angling salmon. The ratio is approximately 10:1 or 11:1 against what is caught commercially. That gives one an idea of the value of that stretch of river. Incidentally, that was the last ministerial act of the then Minister, Paddy O'Toole, before he lost his seat in the Dáil. So much for meddling with the fisheries.</P>

Apart from the visit of an authorised officer to a restaurant, hotel, fish processing factory or an agent who sells salmon, do people have any other responsibility with regard to the tags if they are not requested by the officer to produce them?

In other words, this will not happen again. It will take place every five years in future. There was dissatisfaction this year that the boards had continued <Col N="687" /> for a year or two because of the delay in the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the staff and members of the Central Fisheries Board who were actively involved in framing this Bill. Mr. Paddy Byrne, a member of the board and of the fisheries protection staff, was here last week when the Bill was being discussed on Second Stage. They are happy with this legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House. Great strides have been made in the fisheries sector in recent years and to good effect. The fisheries are a great national asset and the people involved, both board members and the staff of the various boards, are to be complimented. When credit is due it should be given. They do tremendous work throughout the country, as one can see when one visits our rivers and lakes. They welcome this legislation as it will help them to protect those assets.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the revenue from the fines would be ring fenced, but there is nothing in the legislation which specifies how the revenue will reach the coffers of either the central board or the regional boards. Will the revenue collected through fines go to the regional board or the central board and what procedure will be followed? Where is it stated in the Bill that the revenue is ring fenced? It is not stated in any of the sections. The great fear is that the revenue, some of which will be collected through the courts, will go to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for bringing this important legislation before the House. Senator Burke pointed out that the fisheries boards welcome it. In the long term, the fishermen, particularly commercial fishermen, will also welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may take time for the effect of the legislation to increase our salmon stocks and bring us back to the situation that obtained years ago. Conservation is most important, particularly for the fishermen who rely on the short period in which they can fish the wild Atlantic salmon. In the long term they will welcome this legislation. From the consumer's point of view, it would be a disgrace if our wild salmon stocks were depleted. Despite <Col N="688" /> the improvement in farmed salmon over the last two or three years, anybody who knows anything about salmon will always be able to identify a wild salmon from a farmed salmon. As a delicacy, wild Atlantic salmon is streets ahead of farmed salmon. I hope this legislation will improve matters in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a number of items on which he has asked the salmon commission to report in relation to predation, water quality and so forth. I hope that with the commission's advice there will be a huge improvement in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred previously to the statutory review group to be set up in relation to eel fisheries. I raised it when I spoke here on the 1999 legislation, particularly with reference to the development of the eel fishery on the Erne. Many fishermen on the lower Erne, around the Ballyshannon and Belleek area, had gone into black eels and suffered huge financial losses. I hope that when the Minister is appointing the review board, he will consider appointing somebody from the upper Shannon area as a member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for bringing in this legislation. It is a welcome addition to the legislation already in place. It will help the industry. If the tagging system is effective it will be a great step forward in providing a record of our salmon stocks and the future of the industry will be in safer hands as a result of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their constructive approach to this Bill. Senator Caffrey's comment is probably the most significant in this debate. We all agree that the tagging system will be successful if anglers and fishermen behave responsibly so that it will not be necessary to levy fines and penalties to make those who will benefit most from this scheme realise that the responsibility for the future of our wild salmon stocks is theirs and that they can either destroy or protect and conserve them. This legislation is a mechanism whereby it can be protected and conserved.</P>
      <P>At the end of this debate in the Seanad, I appeal to the commercial fishing community and to the recreational angling community to respect these new regulations and ensure they are obeyed. I have no doubt that we will see a significant increase in our salmon stocks if that happens. The thrust of the legislation will assist us in pursuing that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question but that there are some very greedy people along our coastline whose only interest is in cleaning out as much wild salmon as they can. They are in the minority, but they are there. I appeal to them to stop. The level of our salmon stocks is precarious at the moment and will become worse. I have no doubt, however, that this new scheme and the whole thrust of the commission in bringing everybody together is the way forward in order to ensure a growing stock of wild salmon which will benefit commercial fishermen in the long run, be of much <Col N="689" /> more significance to the recreational angler and make a much greater contribution to tourism angling than we have had here in the past.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators who have contributed, the officials in the Department, and particularly Pat McHale who has been instrumental in all of this. I thank the Chair and his staff for their co-operation.</P>

    <Title>Clinical Vaccine Trials Report: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children into certain clinical trials involving residents of children's homes was laid before both Houses last week.</P>
      <P>The three clinical trials &ndash; all of them involving vaccines &ndash; happened in the 1960s and 1970s. Questions of ethical propriety, consent and responsibility have been raised. These children were in the care of the State and it is important to establish if the State fulfilled its obligations to them. The report does not and could not provide answers to all the questions raised and it cannot be the end of our interrogation of this issue.</P>
      <P>I will provide Senators with some background information on the three trials. Trial No. 1, published in 1962, examined what would happen if four vaccines, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus and polio, were combined in one. At the time, the standard approach was to administer tetanus vaccine and polio vaccine separately at different times and at different injection sites.</P>
      <P>Trial No. 2, published in 1971, was to find out if German measles vaccine, administered intranasally, could spread to susceptible contacts. If it did, serious consequences could ensue, particularly for pregnant women.</P>
      <P>Trial No. 3 was carried out during 1973, but not published. It compared the propensity of a commercially available DPT vaccine to produce adverse reactions as against the capacity of a modified vaccine to produce the same reactions. The modified vaccine had fewer organisms per dose.</P>
      <P>Concern about this matter first surfaced almost a decade ago when raised by former residents of children's homes where the vaccination trials appear to have been conducted. The then Minister for Health first answered questions in the Dáil on this matter in 1991. In 1993, there was correspondence between the then Minister and a former resident in a Dublin children's home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997, my predecessor as Minister, Deputy Cowen, promised the Dáil that he would have inquiries made into the matter following which he would consider what was the most appropriate action to take. The Minister asked Dr. James <Col N="690" /> Kiely, chief medical officer of the Department, to make the promised inquiries.</P>
    <P>From the moment I became Minister for Health and Children, I have been aware of this issue. I have met a representative of past residents of a number of children's homes who believe they might have been involved in these trials.</P>
    <P>Even though there does not seem to have been any negative medical outcome for any of these children, the story has made many of them extremely anxious. I arranged with the chief executive officers of the relevant boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Southern Health Board, that where supporting documentary evidence is available, former residents can be informed immediately whether they were part of any of these three trials. For former residents of the homes in Dublin area, the Eastern Regional Health Authority's customer service telephone number is 1800 520 520 and for former residents of Bessboro in Cork the relevant Southern Health Board's telephone number is 021 486 1260. In addition, I have ensured a counselling service for any former resident of a children's home involved in such trials, which is also available from the relevant health boards.</P>
    <P>Before submitting his report to me, Dr. Kiely sent draft copies to anybody named in it who might be affected by its publication. That afforded them the opportunity to comment on the contents. All those comments were considered fully.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, the trials appear to have had no medically negative consequences for any of the children involved. In some cases, the vaccine used was somewhat weaker than the alternative, but when this emerged, booster doses were given to many of the children involved. We have no evidence that any child contracted a serious illness as a result of the trials.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the report makes no suggestion that any child was directly harmed by these trials and that two of them were published in prestigious medical publications, it might be expected that, as Minister for Health and Children, I should now be saying that this is the end of the story, but I want to make it clear that is not what I am saying.</P>
    <P>The chief medical officer's report is a good report, but it is incomplete. It raises as many questions as it answers. Some of those questions go to the heart of our attitudes to children and their rights. The report is incomplete because in some areas, the most rigorous interrogation of the system failed to produce documentary records of the trials. While we must remember that the trials were not recent, this lack of documentation is at best puzzling. It is certainly unsatisfactory and it is my hope that perhaps the publication of this report will help us to fill in the missing bits in the jigsaw by stimulating memories or helping to locate lost files.</P>
    <P>I have read and reread this report. I have discussed it with the chief medical officer in detail. <Col N="691" /> In spite of the information gaps and the indications that no child was medically harmed, each reading made me more sure that his work must be regarded as the beginning and not the end of the matter. When a child comes into the care of the State, the State must fight fiercely for all of that child's rights, rights such as bodily integrity. The State does not have the right to view children in care as lesser citizens. Their bodily integrity is a basic human right, which can never be watered down or infringed.</P>
    <P>When we consider vaccination trials, the issue of consent is involved immediately. I am not satisfied that the chief medical officer has been able to find solid, informed consent on the record, given by the people who were entitled to give it. Let me put this in context, the history of drug trials includes some ghastly case studies where the rights of individuals were grievously ignored.</P>
    <P>The vaccine trials covered in this report are in a different league, a different country and a different time. In addressing them, we must be careful of the reputations of the highly regarded professionals involved. We must remember that, in many cases, we are looking at marginal degrees of difference in the vaccines administered, not at experimental, unproven or dangerous medications. We must take into account that the protocols of 30 years ago are not necessarily the protocols applied today.</P>
    <P>The key issue, that of consent, cannot be fudged because it is fundamental. Children in care have the same rights as other children. The vindication of those rights is the constant responsibility of the State. We need to find out if we cared for the children the way we, as a nation, should have cared for them. If we did not, we need to find out why the failure happened and we need to apply what we learn to the future. That is our responsibility, as legislators, to the general good.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my responsibility goes further. It goes to the individual children involved and it means I must ask questions this report cannot answer. For instance, if one group of children was given the more experimental vaccine, why did the children in care get that one? What rationale led to the decision that children not in the State's care got the regular vaccine while children in care got the variant? Was the end result from each trial for the public good or for the commercial advantage of a manufacturer? Why were some medications given to children who were outside the age group and which of these medications were known to be effective? Above all, why are the records of some of the trial so woefully inadequate at almost every point?</P>
    <P>All those questions must be asked irrespective of the overall intent of the trials and the indications that no child suffered medically as a result. Not only must they be asked but they must be asked in a context which offers the competence to carry out investigative and therapeutic trawls. <Col N="692" /> For that reason this report has been sent to Justice Laffoy so that the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse may consider it as part of its wide-ranging investigation. This decision is based on the rights of those involved, who are entitled to a thorough, wide-ranging and public investigation of the ethical issues involved. The Laffoy Commission offers a comprehensive vehicle for dealing expeditiously and rigorously with the totality of the issues. Contrary to what some people have alleged, this would include an examination of the role of my Department in the matter.</P>
    <P>The commission's terms of reference are broad and it has the full gamut of powers and personnel needed, an experienced secretariat, a strong panel of experts with the requisite qualifications and an investigative and legal infrastructure. That combination offers an unrivalled capacity for ruthless thoroughness and appropriate speed. Much of what the Laffoy Commission has been investigating runs parallel to this, so the search methods for documents going back to the 1950s is already in place. There is a clear synergy between investigating this matter and the other matters being addressed by the Laffoy Commission. The full gamut of powers at its disposal means that we do not have to reinvent the wheel, the instrument for comprehensive investigation exists.</P>
    <P>In that context, arising from exchanges in the Dáil yesterday on the Order of Business we sought further clarification in terms of the legal situation from the Attorney General and we will be tabling a motion sometime next week regarding referral of the report to the Joint Committee on Health and Children for its consideration. We have a motion on the Dáil Order Paper referring the report to that committee for its consideration but we will have full clarity on that tomorrow morning.</P>
    <P>Not only does that instrument for investigation exist but there is provision for compellability and it has the capacity to provide for confidentiality for witnesses. This route is the ultimate guarantee against a cover-up or whitewash. Justice Laffoy has indicated her willingness and competence to take this on. I am grateful to her and my Department will of course co-operate fully with her.</P>
    <P>We believe that entering this process makes a clear and unambiguous statement to those involved in the trials: &ldquo;We do not know whether your rights were protected all those years ago, we just do not know, but we believe it is important for you and for the wider society to move heaven and earth to find out and we want to do it in a forum which has the power to investigate, to compel witnesses and to publish its findings without fear or favour to ensure compensation is made if that is required.&rdquo;  I recognise the keen interest of Members in the report and that is why it is going before the Joint Committee on Health and Children for its consideration.</P>
    <P>A desperately simple question comes out of this report. Reading it one finds oneself wondering out loud, who was minding the rights of <Col N="693" /> the child? We do not know the full answer to that but we can answer the second question as to who is now endeavouring to mind the rights of those who were participants in the trials. Through the information and counselling services arranged with the health boards, publication of this report and its proper referral to the Laffoy Commission, it is clear that we are determined to vindicate the rights of the adults who participated in these trials as children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate. What disturbs me is that, welcome though this report is, it seems to have been sat upon in the Department for two years. I am not criticising the Minister too much, as he is relatively new to this portfolio, but we have known that the report was complete since early 1999. We should recognise the distress of those who were children in the orphanages and homes where these trials were carried out. This delay leads to even more distress. When one considers that the first we heard of this matter was in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 28 October 1990, it has taken a long time to reach this stage. I am glad we now have the opportunity to debate the matter in the open, but it is incredible to be reminded of how long ago this came to public knowledge.</P>
      <P>I was reading that edition of <i>The Sunday Tribune </i>report when preparing for this debate and one pithy remark in it struck me forcefully when the Minister mentioned children's rights. The article mentioned the fact that trials took place, and Dr. Patrick Meenan is quoted as saying:</P>
      <P>In those days there was almost a tradition of doing testing in orphanages. You went to where the material was, to put it crudely.</P>
      <P>At least we have now gone beyond that, a fact he also recognised.</P>
      <P>As the Minister may know, I have personal knowledge of two of the homes involved. The Cottage Home for Little Children and Mrs. Smylie's Home, or the Bird's Nest, are both in Dún Laoghaire. I acknowledge the pain and distress of those who were children in those homes, some of whom are friends of mine. The Minister will be aware that Councillor Victor Boyhan has been very involved in this matter, having been in the Bird's Nest home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Mrs. Smylie's Home, while the chief medical officer indicated he was aware a trial was taking place, he stated that he believed that the children in this home were being given the standard vaccines and were being used for comparison with other children being given the vaccines prepared for the trial elsewhere. In the case of the Cottage Home, the chairman of the committee of management stated that he was satisfied that at no time were trials carried out on children in this home and that only standard vaccines in routine use were administered to these children. He subsequently clarified his statement saying that it was based on information supplied to the home by Dr. Webb and Professor Hillery and was not arrived at by reference to any <Col N="694" /> independent source. The documentation provided by Wellcome shows that the vaccines prepared for the trial were administered to the children in these two homes in the context of a clinical trial. The report says it is unclear whether effective consent was obtained in relation to the participation of children in these two homes in the trial.</P>
    <P>It is strange how these matters hit one locally. In my constituency there are particular concerns about the report and what happened to those children in the 1960s and 1970s. As we know, the report deals with three sets of vaccine trials which were carried out at that time. The first trial was of 58 infants in five children's homes and it compared polio vaccination given separately to the three in one &ndash; diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough &ndash; and the quadruple vaccine where all four were given together. The second trial involved 69 children in children's homes in Dublin and 23 children living at home who were given the same vaccine for rubella. The third trial was of 53 children in mother and baby and children's homes in Dublin. There were five of those and 65 children were given different sets of vaccines &ndash; those children were at home.</P>
    <P>As I said, the children's institutions administered the modified three in one vaccine, while the children at home got the usual vaccine available through the Eastern Health Board. I have been told that the board instigated the third trial in 1973 because of objections to the three in one vaccines in use at the time. As we know, the Department of Health at the time, through the agency of the National Drugs Advisory Board, did not object to any of the trials going ahead.</P>
    <P>That must raise questions about the role of the Department of Health and Children, a matter raised by Deputy Gay Mitchell. He stated that an expert group was set up in 1977 by the Minister for Health to examine people who, it was claimed, at the time had been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination in the 1960s and 1970s. That group found that in 16 of the 93 cases presented to it there was a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible. An <i>ex gratia</i> payment was offered to each of the 16 to the sum of £16,000 and 15 of them took the payment. In 1992 the Supreme Court found in favour of the 16th person, Mr. Kenneth Best.</P>
    <P>According to the research seen by Deputy Mitchell, the vaccine was administered to at least 243 children in 1968 and 1969. The clinical vaccine trials were obviously taking place in the homes during the same period. The Deputy, not unreasonably, makes the connection between the suspicion about the bad batch of whooping cough vaccination and the reaction to it by so many children throughout the country and the trial tests subsequently carried out on children. He asks questions about the role of the Department of Health and Children and its agencies in this regard. That is one of the many questions which must be answered as a result of this report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> The report is unsatisfactory because, as the Minister said, it raises as many questions as it answers. That is unfortunate. In terms of getting at the truth about what happened, the option preferred by the adults who were the children in question in these homes was to have an independent tribunal of inquiry. Having been persuaded by the Minister they now accept that the report should be sent to the Laffoy Commission on Child Abuse. The people in question wanted a tribunal of inquiry to investigate this matter because it would be able to deal specifically and solely with drug trials. Their main concern was that their case would be appended to the work being carried out by the Laffoy Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not wish, in any sense, to take away from Ms Justice Laffoy and the work she is doing. However, people must understand the fears of people who have already experienced delay. In the estimation of these individuals, this matter has been ongoing since 1990.</P>
    <P>As Members know, the Laffoy Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse covers physical and sexual abuse without distinction. However, there is a belief that the matter in question is a separate and distinct case. One can understand people's concerns in that regard and I would query the timeframe it is intended to impose in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that it is proposed that the report be referred to the Laffoy Commission, the Minister stated that it would also be referred to the Joint Committee on Health and Children for its consideration. I await the proposals he will produce tomorrow on foot of the recommendation of the Attorney General. My colleagues certainly believe that the joint committee should be empowered to investigate this matter, particularly in terms of the role played by the Department of Health and Children in authorising or approving vaccine tests on children in institutions and any other questions which might arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of and sensitive to the need to listen to those people who have been affected. As he stated, we do not believe they were affected physically by what happened in the 1960s and 1970s but there is no doubt that they were psychologically affected. We must learn from the other investigations that took place and listen to the stories told by victims of abuse. It is important that we know what questions they want to have answered before the Laffoy Commission commences its work.</P>
    <P>The people to whom I refer want to see the terms of reference which will apply; they want to ask questions about the relationship between the Department of Health, University College Dublin and the Eastern Health Board; they need to know if there is a register of all the children who were involved; and they are intent on discovering whether the Minister has all the information he requires. They also want to be informed about the help and support that has been given to the <Col N="696" /> children affected by these trials in the 1960s and 1970s.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that these people can contact an 1850 number. That number should be advertised in the national press. I accept that the number of those involved is not huge, but there is a need to reach out to all of them. The Minister also referred to counselling services. If we want to give support to the people involved, we should make it as easy as possible for them to access that support. We should not make life more difficult for them. It is at the time when people feel vulnerable and hurt that we must reach out to them. They must not be obliged to make requests for help. The people involved feel they suffered, and we must offer them our support, not wait for them to beseech us for help.</P>
    <P>Another crucial issue for the people to whom I refer is the information that will be made available to them. For example, will their personal files or medical files be made available to them? If not, will their medical files be made available to their family doctors? I do not believe that is an unreasonable request. These are the types of questions which must be answered because it is vitally important that we learn lessons from this matter and ensure that the necessary safeguards are put in place.</P>
    <P>There must be a speedy response to the demands of everyone involved. Answers must be given to questions the report failed to answer. The Minister alluded to those questions earlier but there is no harm in reiterating them. Why were the children in care exposed to the more experimental vaccine? What was the rationale behind this? Were the trials held for the public good or for the commercial advantage of the manufacturer? The fact that some of the medication was given to children outside the age group at which the vaccines were known to be effective raises serious questions. Why are the records not full and complete?</P>
    <P>The Minister identified these questions as those which require answers but he must also listen and ensure that the terms of reference cover all aspects of the fears and concerns of those who see themselves as victims. We must remember that the report states that, theoretically, vaccines did not leave children open to adverse effects and there is no evidence that any occurred. However, the inadequacy of records must come under extra scrutiny because of that statement. There is no doubt, as the report points out, that there are breaches of the Nuremberg code of 1947 and the Declaration of Helsinki of 1964 in relation to consent. There are other questions that need to be asked, specifically in respect of the role of the Department of Health and Children and those of its agencies to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Department decided who should investigate this matter was challenged by many of those involved. I ask the Minister to confirm that the fact that the Laffoy Commission is investigating this report will not inhibit the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Chil<Col N="697" /> dren in its deliberations. In that context, it must be borne in mind that the Minister is due to come before the Lower House to outline the advice he has received.</P>
    <P>When all things are considered, it is important that we vindicate the rights of children. We must ensure that the Laffoy Commission is given appropriate terms of reference. We must also ensure there is a speedy resolution to any investigation so that those affected will be guaranteed that their rights will be vindicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on his excellent contribution which was open, forthright, honest and courageous. If the follow-through is on a par with his speech, we will get to the bottom of this matter in a quick and efficient way. Whether any Minister, doctor or other individual can address everyone's fears or deal with the trauma which has resulted from those fears is another day's work.</P>
      <P>I wish to highlight a number of points which struck me during the Minister's contribution. The trials in question were conducted in an era when the culture of authoritarianism was rampant throughout Ireland. Anyone who lived during that period will know that our society has changed completely. There is a danger of using the standards of today to judge the standards of yesterday.</P>
      <P>Another point which emerged from the Minister's contribution &ndash; he did not refer to it directly, but it is contained in the sub-text &ndash; is the danger of too close a relationship between the medical profession and drug companies. That is one of the dangers of too close a relationship between the medical profession and drug companies. The medical profession's agenda is supposed to be the disinterested pursuit of its patients' health and well-being, while drug companies, no matter how ethical, have a different agenda, that is, to make money.</P>
      <P>To put the matter in context, it is important to remember that these trials were carried out at a time when we had come through the worst polio epidemic ever seen. The Minister's home county suffered more than other county from this epidemic. Dublin escaped relatively lightly, but Cork was in an emergency situation for many months.</P>
      <P>This matter raises three major issues, the first of which is the ethics of using humans in clinical trials no matter how well meaning the testers and people pursuing the trials are. Second is the issue of informed consent. While adults may be able to give informed consent, children definitely cannot do so as they do not have the necessary power or understanding of the issues in terms of their health. I may be accused of being authoritarian, but no person under 18 years should be allowed to partake in these trials. I have grave doubts about using humans in such trials, but there are strong arguments for using people who have been properly informed about the risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, there must be statutory control over trials. At the time these trials were carried out there <Col N="698" /> was either none or very little statutory control over their conduct. The people involved were mainly children in care and obviously blanket consent was given by people who were not their parents. If I was asked to allow one of my children to take part in a clinical trial which had a million to one chance of endangering their health my answer would be &ldquo;no&rdquo;. I do not think any Member of the Seanad would agree to such a request today.</P>
    <P>As late as 1973 a senior medical figure in the House of Lords, in response to a proposal to legislate for the introduction of ethics committees to supervise research in the national health service, stated:</P>
    <P>The provision of these ethical committees is not a suitable subject for legislation. We should leave things as they are and trust in the good sense and responsibility of the doctors.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Henry, I have been involved in the medical profession for a long time and doctors, like everyone else, are prone to making mistakes or misjudgments. The person who made that statement would not get away with making it now in this or any other House.</P>
    <P>At that time ethical considerations were not of primary importance. My ethics lectures in college dealt with sex, human relationships, procreation, etc., but to the best of my knowledge &ndash; I may be wrong &ndash; no reference was made to the ethics of conducting trials into medication. During the 1960s and 1970s, ethics was not a very serious subject in medical school. Researchers generally did not query ethical standards or have them to the forefront when considering trials.</P>
    <P>There was little statutory control over these trials and, unlike the Flood and Moriarty tribunals, there does not appear to be a paper trial. Very few notes seem to have been taken and there is minimal documentation on these trials in terms of the people involved, their names, ages and addresses. We know the medications used, one of which was of a weaker strength than that used by the Department of Health and health boards or, as they were known then, the county medical boards. I am talking about DPT, which is used every day. I do not know why one of the medications used in the trial should have been of a weaker consistency.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the rights of children and their right to know what was done and why it was done. These trials were small. They would not be considered adequate by today's standards as the numbers were too small to give proper results. In fact, Burroughs Wellcome did not use the results. The results were published in the <i>British Medical Journal, </i>probably the most reputable medical journal in the English language. It published the article but did not carry out an in-depth inquiry into the ethics of using these medications or vaccines on these children who were in care.</P>
    <P>It is correct that the Minister referred the matter to the Laffoy Commission, which has the proper background, experience and staff. It also has <Col N="699" /> the necessary trained bureaucracy in place &ndash; I do not use this as a pejorative term. It has done an excellent job in the hepatitis C investigation and if that standard is maintained in this investigation then we will get answers quickly and efficiently.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his statement. I also listened to his statement in the Dáil last week. I know both the first and second authors of the trials and the chief medical officer. I am glad the Minister recognised in the Dáil that these people's professional reputations are also of importance.</P>
      <P>It is of the utmost importance that those involved in the trials, especially those who lived in homes, should get their medical records. It is ridiculous that it has taken nearly ten years to get to this position. There seems to be a paucity of records and in this context I was very much taken by one letter to Dr. Kiley which stated: &ldquo;Lack of records could be due to the fact that the files you are seeking are quite likely in the category of no longer existing.&rdquo; This is a nice way of saying the files had been destroyed. The fact that these records no longer exist has nothing to do with malice. One person who wrote in said that prior to the Archives Act, 1987, records were not so carefully kept. It is important to make this point.</P>
      <P>Dr. Irene Hillery and Professor Patrick Meenan are two of the most important people to have ever been involved in virology and microbiology. It is important to remember that Professor Meenan was a barrister as well as a doctor. It is extraordinarily difficult to think that they would do anything which was outside what they considered to be proper and legal at the time. I cannot comment on how the Department of Health should have defended the rights of the children in care. However, given that Professor Meenan was the holder of a licence under the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932, he would have been extremely careful about the importation of vaccines. I do not think anyone has queried this point.</P>
      <P>The Department must have examined whatever work they were doing because a trial was turned down in 1962. The reasons were not given in the report. The Department must have known trials were taking place and it could hardly have thought they were being carried out at UCD. The Minister stated in the Dáil that the Department did not know whether it was legal for people to carry out trials outside UCD. It would be impossible for people to carry out such trials in UCD. The Department must have had a certain involvement in this. It is important to stress that no one involved on the medical side of these trials gained monetarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> The third person I know who was mentioned in the report is Dr. Pearl Dunleavy, who was the assistant chief medical officer of the Eastern Health Board at the time. Her sole concern in getting the third trial under way was to try to avoid local reactions in small children so that their arms would not be sore. She was concerned that mothers refrained from bringing their children for second and third uptakes of the vaccination because of sore arms.</P>
    <P>This is a look back exercise and it is important for us to recall Ireland 50 years ago. Communicable diseases accounted for 25% of deaths at that time. These disease included diphtheria, influenza, polio, measles and whooping cough. Improved socio-economic conditions and the development of new drugs were important but the immunisation programmes were also extremely important. Immunisation against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus was introduced in 1952/53 and against polio in 1957 following a terrible epidemic. The number of cases of these diseases rapidly declined to a fraction of pre-immunisation levels.</P>
    <P>We had become complacent about the seriousness of these conditions until there was a measles epidemic this year. It is important to recall the two deaths from measles in 2000. I do not know if there were deaths in any other European country. Hundreds of thousands of children die throughout the world from measles. These are serious conditions and the trials were not conducted in regard to something trivial.</P>
    <P>The focus nowadays has rightly shifted to vaccine safety but these trials were designed to ascertain a good antibody result with a minimum of adverse affects. Two of the vaccine trials were entirely benevolent. They sought to try to find out if one could reduce the number of injections given to children. The triple vaccine was normally injected in one arm of the child and the polio vaccine in the other. The report refers to other trials carried out in Canada at the same time and I am aware that the Medical Research Council was carrying out similar trials in Cardiff and Bristol which are not mentioned in the report.</P>
    <P>An English company did not descend on Ireland to try to experiment on children. Similar trials were taking place in England to try to establish whether the antibody result would be as good if a quadruple vaccine, one injection only, was given to the child in one arm rather than two injections, which meant two sore arms instead of one. That trial discovered that the antibody result from both types of injection was not satisfactory and booster doses had to be given subsequently. The trial was of value to the children and to society in general.</P>
    <P>The trial on the other vaccine for DPT was conducted at the instigation of Dr. Pearl Dunleavy because of sore arms. She wanted to establish if the weaker variant could produce as good an antibody result without sore arms which children had developed. This could be described as an experimental vaccine but it certainly was ben<Col N="701" /> evolent. The children in the homes were given the weaker vaccine because they could be better observed. That was not done as a diminution of the rights of the children.</P>
    <P>The trial on German measles or rubella was of extraordinary importance. This vaccination was introduced in Ireland in 1971. German measles causes a 50% increase in the rate of spontaneous abortion in women who contract the disease in the first three months of pregnancy. If the pregnancies continue, 70% of babies will suffer from congenital rubella syndrome and will be born with permanent disabilities such as blindness, deafness, brain damage and/or heart defects. Before rubella vaccinations one in 1,000 children in Ireland was born with congenital rubella syndrome.</P>
    <P>This trial was conducted to establish whether the vaccine could be given intranasally to avoid having to inject the children. It was successful, but internationally it was found easier for doctors and nurses to vaccinate children with an injection than to give it intranasally. That method of administration never caught on but it could hardly be described as doing down the children.</P>
    <P>I totally understand the frustration of those who were in homes and the difficulties they have in obtaining their medical histories and other information to which they are entitled, but I hope they will not want our already weak vaccination programme worsened by anything that might come out of this investigation.</P>
    <P>Sometimes attempts are made to link conditions of unknown etiology with vaccination but no one has made suggestions that this has happened in this case. Why did the Minister refer to these adults as &ldquo;survivors&rdquo; in his contribution in the Dáil? It was an odd word to use and he did not use it in his contribution today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The children involved are wondering about their inclusion in these trials. There were no ethics committees in those days, although there should have been. There was no legislation covering clinical trials until 1987. The Medical Council's guidelines and the Helsinki Declaration on human rights were followed by Irish doctors. Two of the trials, as the Minister said, were published in prestigious journals and that would not have happened if anything unethical was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> Deputy McGennis stated in the Dáil that the rights of single mothers and their children were ill-considered by society in the 1960s. As the president of Cherish, the organisation established for single mothers by single mothers in the 1960s, I recall how little account was taken of its views. I am also sorry Cherish was not thanked in the report because it would have been nice if its co-operation had been acknowledged.</P>
    <P>The doctor who vaccinated these children had to have had received consent from someone to go into those homes. She was not attached to the homes. I do not know if the medical practitioners whom she says gave consent for her to do so were entitled to give such consent but someone had to say she could enter the homes. She did not break down the door. She was not a local general practitioner or public health doctor who could have been involved in routine vaccinations. Her presence must have been known to people.</P>
    <P>I have read the Department's guidelines on childhood immunisation carefully and it is essential that the uptake of vaccinations is improved. I am sure all Ministers would support the Minister's policy on this.</P>
    <P>Mr. Madden of the Southern Health Board in his 1997 report on the trial which took place in Bessboro stated:</P>
    <P>The trial was a modification of an existing schedule. No new drugs were on trial, therefore, it was not experimental. Infants would have received vaccination as part of the routine immunisation schedule. All vaccines were approved. No serious reactions were recorded. The study was carried out in accordance with the then ethical guidelines. Consent of the medical officers, and in Bessboro's case according to the home authorities, with the knowledge of the mothers was given.</P>
    <P>Professor Hillery has said in a public statement that she will go anywhere to answer any questions. While sympathising with the people involved in the trial who have been frustrated for so long in getting information, I hope people will take account of the Minister's words that the professional reputation of those involved is also important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Senator Henry, for giving me this time for which we fought on the Order of Business. We managed to get it extended because we realised how important a debate it is. I am glad Senator Henry has dealt with the medical issues in the professional way to which we have been accustomed when hearing her speak in the House.</P>
      <P>There are things which concern me as a layman. I remember the polio vaccinations which were quite nasty because there were strong adverse reactions to some of them. I know because I was one of those people who had a very strong reaction to the polio vaccine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of issues. I agree it is a mistake to be ahistorical and to look back 40 <Col N="703" /> years and introduce criteria which may not have been current at the time. It is true that Professor Hillery did not receive remuneration apart from travelling expenses and so forth and that the <i>British Medical Journal</i> published these experiments apparently with no qualms. However, I have concerns specifically in the ethical area and some signals were raised earlier than these trials. It is important to put the context for the debate to take place in.</P>
    <P>Whoever produced the larger of the two reports given to us clearly did not anticipate that the House would take them seriously. They are appalling. Much of the correspondence is completely illegible. On some occasions it has been photocopied in such a way that half the material has gone off the page. We are not being taken seriously when we get this type of material as briefing documents. It was produced with a digest which made things a little more accessible.</P>
    <P>From this defective document, I would like to put on record what I see as the context. We are dealing with vulnerable people. There may have been methodological reasons groups in orphanages were chosen, such as it being easier to monitor them, but we should be clear that these were also among the most vulnerable citizens in the State. I think back to my good friend, Dr. Noel Browne, who had a brother who was deformed. To the end of his days Noel was agonised by the fact that he had survived because he was an attractive, nice young kid who was taken up by the Chance family, whereas his brother was subjected to clinical trials of various kinds and eventually died. Noel felt very hard about this.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Nuremberg Code is put on record. It emerged from the fact that the Nazis had been conducting medical experiments. I do not draw any parallel but this was the ethical context created after the Second World War. The first protocol is very important:</P>
    <P>The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision.</P>
    <P>I will not read the rest of it, partly because this is one of the pages where I have had to imagine the words at the ends of the sentences.</P>
    <P>A distinction is also drawn between different types of experiments or trials &ndash; those which have as their goal the ultimate good of society and those which have as their goal the individual's good and medical treatment. Significant points were made in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> It is important to note that, in some of the reports dealing with those resident in homes, namely, orphans of a very tender age who obviously could not give consent, no real indication of consent is given in the report and it appears that consent was not established. Senator Henry said they did not kick in the doors or barge in, but that does not imply consent. I cannot say definitively that consent was given and I compare this with material in the same report which says that the mothers in the controlled sample out in the wider community were asked for and gave their consent. Some of the other mothers were given the opportunity either to give or withhold their consent. It is this issue of consent which is paramount.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the mentally and physically handicapped children included in these trials. The impression is given that one must include these people because they are part of the general situation and that they cannot be excluded. There is no evidence that anything of specific value to people who are mentally or physically handicapped was produced by these. It was not an experiment which was calculated to deal with the specific problems of these people. They were just dosed and excuses were found afterwards. That is what concerns me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

      <P>The language often concerns me. If I look through the files dealing with Glaxo Wellcome, there is an interesting use of language relating to when documentation was being sought. In light of the inquiries we have had, the lack of clear documentation is concerning. One encounters this type of dubious statement: &ldquo;What I am basically saying is that the files you are seeking are at this stage quite likely to be in the category of no longer existing.&rdquo;  Apparently Senator Henry has also found this. There are numerous examples.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it extraordinary. The language is a type of obfuscation. My main concern is the selection of the group for the convenience of the scientific inquiry. Less than complete sensitivity was shown towards these children. I do not say this in a wish to tar any of the scientists involved. I know some of them and I worked with Dr. Irene Hillery on the board of the AIDS fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must learn lessons from this, one of which is that scientific intellect can become detached from a feeling of absolute sympathy with the subject of the trial, and this seems to have happened in this instance. It may well be part of an histori<Col N="705" /> cal period but it is still something from which we need to learn.</P>
    <P>I have a number of questions arising from the main document. In trial two:</P>
    <P>...sixty nine children resident in a childrens' home in Dublin had blood taken of whom twelve were subsequently administered intranasal rubella vaccine. In the same trial, twenty three children living at home were administered this vaccine.</P>
    <P>It does not say whether they were administered it intranasally. These types of gaps mean I am not in a position after reading this document to know whether the children were disadvantaged because they came from the orphanage group. Apparently not, but it is not in this document.</P>
    <P>In trial three:</P>
    <P>In this trial in which fifty three children in Mother and Baby homes and childrens' homes in Dublin and sixty five children living at home in Dublin were administered vaccine to compare the reactogenicity of the commercially available batches of Trivax vaccine and Trivax AD vaccine, with a vaccine of equivalent efficacy but of lesser potency.</P>
    <P>It does not say which group got which. Both got them, but again it is not clear which was involved.</P>
    <P>Issues for consideration are listed in this document, as are legal issues, such as the 1932 Act and the fact that it apparently did not extend to cover some of these trials. Issues which need to be clarified are also listed. First is the statutory controls relating to the importation and use of vaccines; second is the statutory controls relating to the conduct of clinical trials; third is the ethical standards which governed such trials; and fourth is whether the participants were exposed to any or any additional risk by the administration of these vaccines. In my opinion, that is quite the wrong order. Question No. 3 regarding the ethical standards should be first. Question No. 2 should be whether there was any risk. Only after that should we come back to the legalistic questions. We are dealing with the most vulnerable element in the community and we should really have their interests at heart.</P>
    <P>With regard to the three in one vaccine, the reports states:</P>
    <P>. an examination of the Department's records in this regard reveals that none of the children on whose behalf claims were made received their vaccinations in any of these trials.</P>
    <P>However, it does not show that none of those vaccinated was affected. It only says they have checked out a group who have made claims. In other words, there is a grey area about which we still know nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this very serious matter and I thank the Minister for his remarks pertaining to what he intends to do about it. My colleague, Senator <Col N="706" /> Fitzpatrick, correctly said that at that time ethics were not a high priority. I know, however, that the Senator, as a medical doctor, will agree with me that in the interim period it was a very serious matter for those involved in the clinical trials. If it took place almost 30 years ago, in 1961, there would be a period of 20 years or more during which the people who received those vaccines were concerned. I applaud the Minister for the proactive manner in which he has dealt with this matter.</P>
      <P>In his statement, the Minister said he found no evidence that the State had given the necessary imprimatur. Having worked in a hospital for many years, including times when things were not as good as they are now, I know that in the old days when nurses were administering prescriptions there was no such thing as a medical chart. Nowadays, one has to sign for every item one administers, and rightly so. It is in the interests of good record keeping and, thus, medical and nursing staff will know exactly what a patient has received.</P>
      <P>I find it somewhat difficult to understand the suggestion that no adequate records were kept of a vaccine, whether it was administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously. I find that inexplicable, even given the conditions obtaining in those times. I am not trying to apply modern standards retrospectively over 30 years, but I am concerned for the people who have worried about these matters for some 20 or 25 years. They have been assured that no real harm will come to them, but it is a bit like cutting off someone's head and handing them an elastoplast. We must be concerned about the victims of these circumstances.</P>
      <P>While we take cognisance of the words of the 1916 Proclamation &ldquo;cherishing all the children of the nation equally&rdquo;, it is obvious that the children in institutions at that time, 40 years ago, were not cherished equally, and that has been proven. I am not trying to denigrate or castigate any member of the medical profession, but I am making these points because I am concerned for the recipients of those vaccines.</P>
      <P>The Minister is on the right track in having referred this report to the Laffoy Commission. In his statement, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>In 1993, there was correspondence between the then Minister and a former resident in a Dublin children's home. In 1997, my predecessor as Minister, Deputy Cowen, promised the Dáil that he would have inquiries made into the matter following which he would consider what was the most appropriate action to take. The Minister asked Dr. James Kiely, Chief Medical Officer of the Department, to make the promised inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has taken a very proactive role in this matter and I commend him for it. He has also ensured that a counselling service will be provided by the relevant health boards to those who were resident in the said children's homes and <Col N="707" /> who received vaccines pertaining to those trials. That is very important.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the report makes no suggestion that any child was directly harmed by these trials [they did not know that for quite a number of years, but at least something is being done about it now] and that two of them were published in prestigious medical publications, it might be expected that, as Minister for Health and Children, I should now be saying that this is the end of the story, but I want to make it clear that is not what I am saying.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, the Minister is saying that it is not the end of the story and that is very comforting for the victims.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that the State does not have the right to view children in care as lesser citizens. To the observer, however, regrettably and unfortunately, that would appear to be the case that obtained at the time. While it is not fact, it was and remains a perception.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the history of drug trials includes some ghastly case studies where the rights of individuals were grievously ignored. We are not saying that anybody involved deliberately set out to fudge the issue, but it must have been a living hell for the people who received those vaccines and who had to wait for many years to be assured there was nothing injurious in them and to learn that they would receive counselling, where necessary. The Minister was born around the time these trials took place, so no blame can be apportioned to him. I congratulate him on the proactive measures he has taken in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister also states that the key issue, that of consent, cannot be fudged because it is fundamental. Of course it is fundamental. The issue of whether or not consent was given is the cornerstone of the whole story. While I have no knowledge of those children's social or legal status, if they were orphans it was the responsibility of the State to give consent. Was consent received? Even going back to the dim and distant past in medical and nursing practice, where vaccines were being administered it was always the practice to prescribe them in written form. Otherwise, in four or five years time, who could say that the same procedures would not be carried out again? I am a little sceptical of that one.</P>
    <P>The Minister has posed a number of questions which are already written into the record, so I will not repeat them. However, I will comment on the first one which is centrally important. The Minister asked:</P>
    <P>If one group of children was given the more experimental vaccine, why did the children in care get that one? What rationale led to the decision that children not in the State's care got the regular vaccine while children in care got the variant?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> Questions remain to be answered and I know that the Minister is seeking those answers. He has said that this report has been sent to Justice Laffoy so that the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse may consider it as part of its wide-ranging investigation. That is another very correct step on the Minister's part.</P>
    <P>Much of what I wished to say was said earlier in the debate, especially by Senators Henry and Fitzpatrick. The Minister commented:</P>
    <P>A desperately simple question comes out of this report. Reading it one finds oneself wondering out loud, who was minding the rights of the child?</P>
    <P>Who was minding the rights of the children? That is the question.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has made this a crusade. Hopefully it will not be discovered that anyone did wrong to those children, but if someone has done wrong to those children and injured their rights there can be no hiding place for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I thank him for this report and I support the action he proposes to take.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Research Ethical Committee in the Belfast Medical School. Today this research would not get past first base but today is not 1972. There is a real danger of projecting back the standards and expectations of today to 1972. I do not know any of the people concerned in this case except by reputation. I know the reputation of Dr. Hillery as a researcher and a medical person of great probity who has brought great advantage to the health of the population of this country, particularly children. I was very taken by Senator Henry's sensitive reference to that.</P>
      <P>We can blow this out of proportion by talking about crusades and victims. This was not Dr. Mengele. This was highly egalitarian research according to the temper of the times. All of us who were about at that time know the scourge of child and infant mortality in this society, particularly the scourge of polio, measles and whooping cough. These vaccines were intended to counteract these diseases. We know about the pressure that society placed on researchers and everyone else to find answers. They were told to find a way of giving this to children which they could accept and which was more palatable than what was being done and did not cause them to refuse it. It was not an exotic form of research. It was an attempt to find out whether you could give four in one or two in one injections and whether the adverse effects could be held back.</P>
      <P>There are two forms of accountability and ethical responsibility and we should distinguish between them. Consent is important. It seems to me that the researchers believed they had consent. By today's standards they would not have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also take the point that it is significant that the controls were in the community but the experiments were being carried out on children who were in care. This element needs to be con<Col N="709" /> centrated on. Did the people responsible for those children in care feel they had the right to do this? Did they make any efforts to check things out? </P>
    <P>To put this in the context of the time, in terms of the things that were done in children's homes, of which we are all ashamed and deeply concerned about, this would rank very low on the scale of impropriety and ill treatment. People need to know that this could not happen now. It would be helpful if we could be told in any report that might come of this how ethical committees work today. How effective are they? Who appoints them? Do they report in any particular way? </P>
    <P>The Clinical Trials Act, 1987 is an important Act but there are vaguenesses in it. The Minister could look at it. There is no point in doing that until after Ms Justice Laffoy reports to him. It may be sensible to see whether it needs to be amplified or strengthened in any way. In particular it could be brought up to date to cope with today's pattern of multi-centre trials which are taking place all over the world at the same time. Irish doctors participate in these trials and they must do so in order to keep up. It is important that we know there are controls and that these ethical issues are taken account of.</P>
    <P>Consent is the crucial ethical issue in all of this, even consent from children. Most children know whether you are going to stick something in them or not and will tell you whether they want it or not. If they are totally incapable, then the consent of the nearest relative should be sought.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the action that he is taking. I hope that this inquiry can go on and that debate can proceed as a search for the truth rather than a witch hunt. I hope then that the Minister will bring forward proposals which will assure society, not only the people who have been involved in tests, that their ethical, human and medical rights are all being protected.      </P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for an interesting debate that was free of rancour. This debate endeavoured to throw some light and give different perspectives on the issue, which is about balance. It is about balancing what happened with the standards of the time, the context in which this happened and the issues that I raised in my speech.</P>
      <P>In terms of Senator Keogh's point, it was important over the past months that the people who were mentioned in the report were given full opportunity to see the report before publication, make corrections or make their views known to the author or the chief medical officer. That happened but it took time. Before we brought it to the House it was again necessary to send a copy to the principal people so that they could comment and that their views would be considered in the totality of documentation that was laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Senator's point about the need to be more proactive about the broadcasting of the <Col N="710" /> number of people concerned. I undertake to do that in terms of the number of people who want counselling and who contact the health boards.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to prohibit the Oireachtas committee but it is pointless to conduct two investigations simultaneously. Once it is referred to the Oireachtas committee for its consideration it is not the tradition of the House to be over dictatorial in terms of how it deliberates.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick had some very telling questions. He asked if parents would be willing to allow their children go forward for a vaccine trial. That is a simple but very telling question. I think we all know what our answer would be. I know what my answer would be.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised other very important issues. Nowadays we, as a society, are very complacent about vaccination. To a large extent people have forgotten the ravages of polio. I was born in the 1960s towards the end of the problem and I heard stories about it occurring in Cork city as folklore. I saw all the infrastructure which had to be put in place to help those who contracted polio. The same applied to measles and diphtheria.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, there is a new debate. The Oireachtas committee is holding a public hearing on vaccination, particularly the MMR. It is a huge issue which will not go away. It is affecting uptake levels. We cannot put our heads in the sand, it is a reality of modern life. It is important, therefore, that we debate the issue fully and provide the reassurance required. I have initiated a number of vaccination programmes. We continue to promote the MMR, a source of particular concern in Dublin because of the low uptake rate and where two children died last year from measles. This can be related to significant under-participation in the vaccination programme. There is also the issue of autism in respect of which many parental groups are arguing. It is welcome that the Oireachtas committee will hear such groups.</P>
    <P>As a Department, we need to do more in terms of holding significant conferences at which international experts can present the findings of their research reaffirming the value of vaccination. The medical community needs to do likewise. There is a debate developing. To take Senator Henry's point, some are questioning the value of vaccination. All sorts of questions are being asked about the meningitis vaccination programme. As a parent, when I heard about a new vaccine for meningitis, in one sense I could not wait for it to come on the market because for any parent the modern terror is the fear that one's child might develop meningitis. It is important, therefore, that we do not try to bury the issue by saying that vaccination is great, we need to argue the issues fully, openly and transparently. The Oireachtas committee is beginning this process. It is important to state that the vaccination programme has had a huge impact in eliminating disease, saving many lives and improving quality of life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> I apologise if some of the reports are defective, an issue raised by Senator Norris. I was not aware of this. It may account for some of the contribution if he could not read some of the paragraphs. He raised similar issues.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes made a very important point, that the referral of this issue to the Laffoy Commission is a search for the truth and nothing else. That is what an inquiry is about. It cannot prejudge, its purpose is to establish the truth. The Laffoy Commission is an independent institution established by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Therein lies its value. It has the necessary apparatus in terms of a therapeutic forum where people can be heard in confidence and counselling is available. Many of those who spent time in the institutions concerned require counselling before they give evidence.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that the Oireachtas committee is the ideal forum for an inquiry of this kind. That is the reason the Laffoy Commission offers the best vehicle and the best option for finding the answers to some of the questions raised in both Houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the failure of the Government to offer adequate support to carers in our community and proposes that a non-means tested continuous care grant be introduced; the ban on social welfare recipients also receiving carer's allowance be lifted; and the means threshold for carer's allowance be doubled.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is in total agreement with this proposal and I am amazed the Government has tabled an amendment to the motion. The Carers Association has lobbied with partial success since that excellent association was founded in 1987. It has some paid workers now, but the genesis of the association was the voluntary work of people who encountered dreadful difficulties associated with caring. I acknowledge and applaud the work of this association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The informal caring system that was part of our culture has disappeared. When I was a child in Dublin there was a built-in caring system in neighbourhoods. However, to be honest, that arose largely due to large families and housing proximity in the old tenement houses, where up to ten families lived in one large house and there was also someone there to mind the granny. I remember the first time I saw Sean O'Casey's famous Dublin play, <i>The Plough and the Stars</i>. In that play, Mrs. Grigson's daughter, who was always called poor little Mollser and suffered from tuberculosis, was cared for by practically the <Col N="712" /> whole cast, who played the residents of the tenement house.</P>
    <P>Happily, Dublin is no longer a city of teeming tenements. I have discovered, however, as I have become older and more experienced, although I do not know if I am any wiser, that solving problems usually has a minus aspect, no matter how good we are at solving the initial problem. In solving the housing and hygiene problems of the tenements, we created a new problem of isolation and lack of access to services. Inevitably, with the arrival of smaller families, society now has a higher dependence on State services.</P>
    <P>The typical carer, even 20 years ago, would have been usually the daughter of the house.</P>

      <P>The daughter's duty was to care for both or one elderly parent. This system worked on the very noble premise that virtue brought its own reward. However, unfortunately, this was never in a tangible form and many men and women lost contact with their friends and communities because of their unselfish and largely unrewarded sacrifices and dutifully awaited their reward in heaven. How times have changed.</P>
      <P>One of the most unequal and unfair practices was when a worker who gave up his or her job to care for a parent lost his or her income, colleagues and lifestyle. I am not blaming the Minister for this quite callous situation that pertained because I do not think we knew how to cope with this transition. However, these people lost their income, colleagues and lifestyle and ended up saving the State the cost of nursing home care.</P>
      <P>The cost to the carer was enormous. These people became non-persons. A relative of mine officially did not exist because she was not in receipt of any payment from the State and could not work, but she was saving the State an enormous amount of money by caring for her parent for a number of years. She never returned to work because she was too long away from it. People like that got a very raw deal and were not given even a crumb from the national cake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their unhappy lot has changed for the better. Carers, however, particularly the Carers Association, will remind us that they are saving the State £1.5 billion a year. I am sure the Minister has read <Col N="713" /> about this and I acknowledge he must be swamped with pre-budget submissions. I know every group can claim it has the greatest need. However, given the history of carers in our society, their pre-budget submission should be read very carefully. There has to be an improvement in their lot.</P>
    <P>The Carers Association says that the number of carers is so high that only one in 15 is in receipt of the allowance. I acknowledge the efforts made by various Governments, particularly the improvements in last year's budget. The Carers Association successfully lobbied for the introduction of the original allowance, the respite fund for voluntary organisations and free travel passes for some carers. Will the Minister give some thought to the fact that carers in some rural areas never get to use their travel passes because there is no public transport in their areas? I was at a meeting of the South Eastern Health Board yesterday in Carnew, County Wicklow where I was told there is only one bus per week from some towns. That is not this Minister's fault but having a travel pass is not an advantage if only one bus per week leaves one's home town.</P>
    <P>Relaxation of the rules regarding living under the same roof was a positive step and it could be broadened. Allowance is made for neighbours and so forth but the fact that one is not living in close proximity does not mean one will not be there to look after the person. Time off for carers on allowance for study, training, respite, volunteering and paid employment are other issues.</P>
    <P>I am not disingenuous and I acknowledge the improvements in last year's budget. The main subject of the motion is the means test. I read last year's and this year's pre-budget submissions from the Carers Association. They are my main guide, aside from my practical experience, as to how carers feel they are being treated. The association considers the means test to be a mean test. No Government likes to hear that description applied to it. However, it is mean in some ways, probably due to the complexity of how the State pays people rather than to a desire not to treat carers equally. The means test for the carer's allowance should be abolished. The rate of payment should be increased to £120 per week from 1 April 2001.</P>
    <P>Like other people who experience ongoing difficulties in their daily lives, carers feel they must fight every day in addition to coping with the prolonged battle of caring for the person who is ill or in need of physical care. They feel they are being passed from Billy to Jack in terms of the number of Departments which must be consulted at various stages. The Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Finance, and Health and Children must clarify whether the carer's allowance is income for the job as carer in the home or a social assistance payment. This is where the injustices are experienced.</P>
    <P>These injustices include the following. Although over 78% of carers are women, the means test is carried out on their partners' <Col N="714" /> income in many cases, with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs insisting on the antiquated notion that a woman &ldquo;enjoys&rdquo; half her husband's income. That is not a meaningful way to deal with this. The Department insists that the carer's allowance is a social assistance payment, not a payment in recognition of the value of the carer's work. However, the Revenue Commissioners tax the carer's allowance as income. Some health boards deprive people of medical cards, cut rent allowance and deny carers supplementary welfare allowances for special diets and heating because they treat the allowance as income. Families lose the back to school allowance for clothing and books if the carer is in receipt of the carer's allowance. Some local authorities deny carers the benefit of the differential rent scheme because they treat the allowance as income.</P>
    <P>Even though carers work the longest hours of any group of workers, they are never classed as workers under the legislation. Other changes to the carer's allowance should include the treatment of the carer as a person in his or her own right. Equality dictates that only the means of the carer should be assessed. Given the fact that caring is a 24 hour, 365 day per year job, I ask the Minister to take on board the carefully researched proposals of the Carers Association. I will not list the proposals here. Despite the introduction of equality legislation, carers are still not having their needs met.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I do not have time to comment on the social welfare aspects of the allowance but I trust my colleagues will do so. I hope the Minister did not find my delivery too rapid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I am a little disappointed that the House must divide over this motion because we are certainly at one on much of it. Given the manner in which carers have been treated over the years, successive Governments have been slow to move their cause along. The Minister has done a certain amount but I am sure he will be the first to admit that he would like to have done more. Some of his predecessors probably did less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Member recognises the role of the carer and the need to get allowances to a realistic level, having regard to the original low threshold. Since its foundation in 1987, the Carers Association has done a huge amount of work. It has presented pre-budget submissions to various Governments with a view to improving the situation of the carer. It is important that we do all we can to support this group working on the carers' behalf. I support the Minister's fight in Cabinet to get everything he can for his Department. There are many needy people, particularly the carers and old age pensioners. The Minister will admit that he could spend every penny and more of his budget on them. There is not the same big lobby on behalf of carers that there might be for more demanding and pressing groups who have more muscle, as it were, but I am aware that the Mini<Col N="715" /> ster is committed to ensuring that the carers' case is kept high on the agenda.</P>
    <P>We all know people who fall into this category. They have looked after their relatives for years, be they parents, aunts, uncles or other elderly relatives. This is not an issue on which we should indulge in point scoring. Successive Governments and Ministers would like to have done more over the years. It is important now, however, when the State has an extra few bob, that the Minister should bring allowances to a realistic level. The budget will be announced on this day three weeks. I am sure the Minister had a shopping list as long as his arm&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;for various schemes. I urge him to give particular consideration to the carers. For years they were far down the list of priorities of successive Governments, probably because they did not have an effective lobby group.</P>
      <P>My party has advocated various measures, including increasing income to be disregarded, introducing a fair system of assessment of income and savings and relaxing residency rules. There must be give and take. In relation to appeals I urge the Minister to take a realistic approach &ndash; things must be checked out, but if carers are not available, it will cost health boards more, and more people will have to go into nursing homes. Some people, if they get a certain amount of care, will not have to go into a nursing home. Having visited a few nursing homes recently I am aware that, while there are some very good ones, we should be vigilant about how others are run to ensure they are not run totally for profit and that adequate professional help is available so that people have basic care in their latter days.</P>
      <P>Let me sum up by seconding the motion. I ask the Minister to do the best he can in the weeks ahead for a group that deserve our respect and regard. Some of us will, if we live long enough, have a carer looking after us. I hope the Minister, with the Members of this House, will think ahead.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members of the House for giving me this opportunity to speak on this motion. The Government is strongly committed to supporting carers. Without being overly political about it, I am prepared to stand on my record and on the record of this Government which, on any examination of the changes that have taken place in relation to the carer's allowance, is second to none. Any objective analysis of the improvements that have taken place in this area will show that they took place during the Government's tenure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter we are addressing cuts across the remit of a number of Departments. It encompasses the provision of income support, tax initiatives for people who care for people in the home or who employ a carer, the provision of <Col N="716" /> respite care and other community services supported by the health boards, and the provision of housing supports to assist people in adapting their homes.</P>
    <P>A co-ordinated approach is necessary if we are to support care in the community. We are delivering that co-ordinated approach. We must, of course, provide appropriate support to carers through the tax and social welfare systems. The carer's allowance is a means-tested payment administered by my Department for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
    <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit, and to increasing the value of the allowance in real terms. As part of that commitment I published an overall review of the carer's allowance in October 1998. The submissions and proposals of all organisations representing carers were considered as part of the review process and are comprehensively addressed in this report.</P>
    <P>Based on the research carried out in the review, the current number of full-time carers is estimated to be 50,000, covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities. At the end of October 2000, there were 16,176 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. These figures indicate that 32% of full-time carers are in receipt of the carer's allowance payment which is an increase of 75% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since the Government took office. It is important to repeat that when I became Minister the number of people in receipt of the carer's allowance was 9,000, while it is now upwards of 16,200. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £78.3 million this year, representing an increase of 115%. No other allowance or benefit paid out by my Department has increased by so much. These facts clearly demonstrate the good work and progress which has been made by the Government over the past three years.</P>
    <P>Arising from the review, I introduced major improvements to the carer's allowance scheme in both the 1999 and 2000 budgets. In addition to increases in the weekly income support payments, I have also put in place many other supports for carers in receipt of carer's allowance or carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. These include the free travel pass for all qualified carers. I take on board Senator Ridge's point in relation to free travel. This is a broader issue and something my Department has started to address. In the review of the free schemes, we indicated in relation to free travel that a social transport fund should be set up in conjunction with my Department and a number of other Departments, local authorities and county development boards to provide transport services in areas where there is no public transport. Supports also include free <Col N="717" /> telephone rental allowance, free electricity allowance and free television licence schemes for all qualified carers. All these improvements have been implemented since I became Minister.</P>
    <P>An annual payment of £300 towards respite care is payable to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to other qualified carers to use in whatever way they choose. The feedback on this payment in enabling carers to have a break from their caring duties has been very good. I have introduced flexibility into the scheme by relaxing the &ldquo;full-time care and attention&rdquo; rule to allow carers in receipt of carer's allowance to take up paid employment of up to ten hours per week. I have abolished the residency conditions that required carers to be resident with the care recipient. Instead, each non-resident claim for carer's allowance will now be assessed on a case by case basis. I made this change very recently, doing away with the rule in relation to close proximity.</P>
    <P>Other improvements mean that qualified carers are no longer required to satisfy the requirement to have 13 paid contributions when claiming disability benefit. All other carers are credited with PRSI contributions. Carers who have ceased their caring responsibilities are eligible for the back to education allowance scheme and the back to work allowance scheme. More recently I introduced the new carer's benefit scheme. This scheme will be extremely beneficial for those carers who experience the tremendous difficulties involved in caring and working full time. The scheme allows carers to leave the workforce for up to 15 months and receive a non-means-tested payment. In addition, a unique feature of this new scheme will be the retention of the carer's employment rights for that period. This scheme was introduced last month.</P>
    <P>As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his or her partner is assessable is applied to the carer's allowance to ensure resources are directed to those in greatest need. The means test has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources. The review of the carer's allowance recommended that a disregard of £75 per week should be applied to the income of a single carer and a disregard of £150 per week should be applied to the joint means of a married couple. This measure was implemented in August 1999. The effect of these changes mean that a couple with two children could have a joint annual income of £9,152 and qualify for the maximum carer's allowance while a couple with up to £19,500 could qualify for a minimum carer's allowance and also receive an annual respite care grant and benefit under the free schemes.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of abolishing the means test and extending the carer's allowance at existing levels to all full-time carers would be in the region of £179 million annually. To the Senators who raised this, I would nearly guarantee that a Minister from any other political party would not <Col N="718" /> do away with the means test. The strong recommendation from within the Department is that the means test cannot be abolished. I wager there would be no change in that, even if there was a change in Government.</P>
    <P>The review noted that the carer's allowance is an income support payment, not a payment for caring. It examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting resources towards those most in need. A wide range of services, including community care and respite care, are required to support carers in their caring role. It is doubtful if a payment to all carers, regardless of their income, could be considered to be the best use of resources. However, the position in regard to the means test and the disregard will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual. The review of the carer's allowance examined the question of paying the carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. It noted that the allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. The practice of paying only one allowance is a feature, with very few exceptions, of all social welfare payments and is designed to ensure that resources available are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. The review concluded that this practice should continue. A person qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which he or she is entitled.</P>
    <P>The review proposes the introduction of a non-means tested continual care payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It envisaged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency.</P>
    <P>To differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced and that a continual care payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that the needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care.</P>
    <P>Establishing a pilot scheme of needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme. My Department is represented on a working group, which was set up under the chairmanship of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt &ndash; who will speak later in this debate &ndash; to examine the feasibility of introducing a new approach focusing on the total needs of the carer and the person in need of care. I understand that the Western Health Board has undertaken a pilot project in <Col N="719" /> its area and the results of that study are being considered by the working group. The Eastern Regional Health Authority is also doing work in this area.</P>
    <P>We are also committed to improving the range of essential community supports to carers. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, will outline the significant improvements that have taken place in that area.</P>
    <P>The review group also examined the issue of a cost of care allowance and considered it to be within the remit of the Department of Health and Children. It is similar to the requests for a cost of disability payment, which the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended should be introduced by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The details of a range of new social inclusion measures were included in the Government's review of its action programme only a year ago. I take this opportunity to reiterate a point that building an inclusive society &ndash; one in which everyone feels he or she belongs &ndash; is a key objective of the Government. Following from the NESC's call for an increased emphasis on social inclusion, the review of the action programme sets out a range of specific commitments to improve the position of all our people.</P>
    <P>One of the key commitments is that a co-ordinated approach addressing the needs of carers should be established, including a new partnership model to meet the needs of long-term care and a pilot scheme of needs assessment for carers and people needing care.</P>
    <P>To this end, one of the remaining proposals arising from the review of the carer's allowance will be examined. A consultancy study will be undertaken to examine issues relating to long-term care, in terms of cost and possible partnership approaches and the possible role of the PRSI system in this regard. The study will examine possible future schemes, the effects on the social insurance fund and estimate the number of people who might qualify. It is expected this study will commence before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>All the measures I outlined are useless if people do not know of their existence. This year I have undertaken a massive information campaign throughout my Department, which has issued more than 350,000 newsletters to pensioners. More than 100,000 people with disabilities have received an information booklet outlining the support available, not only from my Department but from the various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Only last week I published an information booklet, which has been sent to more than 16,000 carers. I am delighted a number of Members have a copy of it with them. The objective of this information booklet is to advise carers and care recipients of the main social welfare and other entitlements available to them. It also contains information about employment and educational supports that my Department has introduced and a range of services provided by other agencies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> I am delighted to have this opportunity to outline what the Government has done and is doing in this vital area. The facts I presented to Members prove without doubt that the Government has taken many positive and innovative steps towards improving the situation of carers during its term of office.</P>
    <P>As Members will have heard, mine is not the only Department that has introduced much needed measures. My colleagues, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have also brought forward proposals of assistance to carers. The Government is conscious that such a cross-cutting approach is required to successfully tackle the issues facing carers.</P>
    <P>We recognise the need to do more and I welcome the responsible proposals that have been put forward in this House and elsewhere to improve the position of carers. As a Government, we are committed to supporting care in the community to the maximum extent possible. People want to live in their own homes with their families. Families want to be able to care for their loved ones at home. We have a great tradition of family support. Public services can never replace the vital work carried out by families and communities. As Minister with responsibility for family affairs, I believe the Government must work in partnership with families. It was with that in mind that I introduced the extensive range of measures in support of carers during my time in office.</P>
    <P>The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for myself and my colleagues in other Departments and, building on the foundations now in place, we can continue to develop the types of services that recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life of others.</P>
    <P>Senators can rest assured that the Government will give careful consideration to all reasonable proposals made in this and the other House and by parliamentary parties in the coming budget and during the remainder of its term of office.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members concerned for tabling this motion, as it has given me the opportunity to outline the position up to now. I will bear in mind the proposals they make in this regard in the forthcoming budget, but, as Senator Cosgrave said, the reality is the list I have is much longer than my arm. At a recent pre-budget forum 28 lobby groups, including the Carers Association and Care Alliance &ndash; there could have been many more if there had been room to facilitate them &ndash; made their demands. The cost of implementing the major proposals put forward amounted to approximately £4.5 billion. I remind Senators that the budgetary increase introduced in my Department last year &ndash; the total package amounted to £432 million &ndash; was the highest in the history of this State. The position in which I am in reminds me of the story of the loaves and the fishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am not surprised he said he welcomed the opportunity to place things on the record because he has placed a certain number of fairly positive things on the record.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that a completely adversarial atmosphere is the best way to address these sensitive issues regarding carers. Despite the fact that I will probably vote with this side of the House, there is a certain charming disingenuousness about Senator Ridge saying she is surprised at the Government seeking to amend the motion. When one puts down a motion that contains the words &ldquo;this House condemns the failure of the Government&rdquo;, one would need to be a little bit starry eyed to imagine it would not be amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to find ways around that. That is perhaps why I am on the Independent benches and not in one of the parties. I will not give a full-hearted condemnation regarding this, but we can use this debate to do something useful.</P>
      <P>The Minister has fired a question at the Fine Gael Party and the other Opposition party. He has said he does not intend to remove the means test. I did not believe he would remove it. Let us have an answer on that from members of the different parties here tonight. Would they remove it? Would Fine Gael remove it? Would the Labour Party remove it? The answer would provide a very useful focus for our debate. I would remove it. I do not mind what it would cost. I do not believe it would cost £4 billion. I would remove it because it is very difficult to maintain the position of being a carer, particularly a full-time carer. There is no doubt that if those carers removed their services the bill to the State would be considerably greater, so there would be a saving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was something Dickensian about the Minister saying that as in all other social assistance schemes a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his or her partner as acceptable is applied to carer's allowance to ensure that resources are directed to those in greatest need. What about those who have made the greatest contribution? Carers make an enormous contribution &ndash; sometimes it is because they are members of a family and there is a little social blackmail involved. Often in rural areas one person, usually a daughter, is left behind to look after old people. Why should they not be <Col N="722" /> paid? If they sacrifice lives, careers or education why should they not be paid a comparatively small amount? I would get rid of the means test and would not care about the cost.</P>
    <P>A mistake the Government frequently makes, often by people in the seat the Minister now occupies, is to spend the Order of Business explaining to us how, thanks to the Government's success, the country is awash with money. A good deal more of that money should wash in the direction of the carers. From the campaign of the Centre for Independent Living we knew how vital it is for people to have carers as it opens up all the possibilities of life for them. I would spend as much money as possible on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister congratulated himself on his booklet and I go along with that. It is very good and the foreword states that supporting those who support people with disabilities and the elderly is one of the Government's key objectives. That sounds as if it has a ring of cash about it. If it is an objective, let us see where the money is. Something I cannot congratulate him on, however, is the grammar. The fourth paragraph spells &ldquo;the principle&rdquo; incorrectly. &ldquo;Principal&rdquo; means the main reason, while &ldquo;principle&rdquo; means an ethical principle. This is followed by a split infinitive, which is most regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Minister's booklet lists the many things that have been done, and a certain number of things have been done &ndash; there is an additional increase for parents over 66, free travel pass, an additional payment of £200 towards respite care, extension of free telephone rental, the annual respite grant to be increased by £100, free electricity and television and so on. This is to be welcomed, as is the booklet's most practical feature, the list of addresses and contacts. The Minister was right when he said these services are of no use if people cannot access the information that will enable them to take up the services.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not the only person who produces booklets. The Carers Association has also produced a booklet and I am sure he has read it in detail. It is a slight document in bullet points, most of which are fairly convincing. The Minister stated that 32% of full-time carers receive a carer's allowance. That may be an improvement, but it should be 100%. Only one third of carers receive this allowance and the Minister is saying this as if it is a good thing. It is shameful and I would not gloat about it. The Minister is very honest to admit this and I include it to balance positives such as the abolition of the residency condition.</P>
    <P>The Carers Association booklet states that regarding 24 hour care, we should allow more than one carer's allowance per carer per person when a person needs more than 40 hours care per week. Why should we limit this to just one? We should make it as practical as possible. I have already said that means tests should be abolished and the booklet calls for individualisation so that the means test should apply to the carer's income only before it is abolished completely. This seems <Col N="723" /> indecent. If someone is giving full-time care why should he or she be penalised if their husband or wife is earning money? I do not see the morality of that.</P>
    <P>The booklet also mentions pay in addition to other social welfare payments such as widow's pension or lone parent allowance. Again, why have this penny-paring attitude, taking money away from a widow and disadvantaging her further? The booklet proposes that the full cost of medical costs be met and that, with regard to carer's benefit, the rate should be a proper one &ndash; at least £120 per week for up to three years. There should also be a spousal entitlement swap so that benefits could be paid to the partner of an eligible person if the partner is the carer and if the couple so requests and there should be full credited PRSI contributions while on carer's benefit and all other benefits.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there have been improvements and it would be mean-spirited of me not to say so but I would extend this further. We are talking about vulnerable people who have given the State enormous service. That service will be more necessary than ever in our changing social circumstances. The family is changing &ndash; we no longer have the extended family and we can no longer rely on people to look after the elderly. That is a wonderful privilege.</P>
    <P>I spent time looking after an aunt of mine who died a couple of months ago and it was one of the most enlightening and uplifting experiences of my life. It was a privilege but it also ties one down. My aunt in turn looked after her elderly parents in the country and it spoilt her opportunities for a career in university. I am aware of the costs involved in this. We must acknowledge that family structures are changing and we will not get this kind of person any more. Young people will not sacrifice their own self-realisation to look after a relative, even though that may be a pity.</P>
    <P>Despite their occasionally blemished records, many of the institutions of the Roman Catholic church have evaporated in the past ten years. The nuns and brothers may have behaved badly in certain circumstances but they also fulfilled an extraordinary role. That support network has now gone and we have people who are professional and who need to be paid properly. I will see if I get an answer to the question I have helped the Minister to put. Would the Opposition parties abolish the means test?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;commends the Government on its efforts to provide supports to carers, in particular for the very significant increase in the number of carers entitled to a carer's allowance, which has increased by 75% since this Government <Col N="724" /> came into office and now stands at 16,176; the fact that expenditure has increased by 115% over this period; the increase in the level of respite care and other community based supports to carers and the introduction of the new carer's benefit; and notes that the Government plans to build on this progress in the forthcoming budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We all value the contribution carers make to society in enabling people to stay in a homely environment with a carer or in their own homes. I agree with Senator Norris it is disappointing the Opposition used the word &ldquo;condemn&rdquo; in its motion, particularly when one hears the Minister describe the improvements in the carer's allowance. We should compliment him on what he has done since taking over in the Department.</P>
    <P>The motion condemns the failure of the Government to offer adequate support to carers in our community but the Minister mentioned the changes that have supported carers. There has been a 75% increase in the number of people entitled to carer's allowance. The Carers Association can give one set of figures and, depending on who one speaks to, there are 50,000 or 100,000 carers &ndash; the figure can change dramatically but a huge number of people have been brought into the net as a result of the Minister's changes.</P>
    <P>In addition, in September 1998 free travel was given to carers who were in receipt of carer's allowance, in 1999 the free telephone allowance was extended to these people and in October of this year they became eligible for the free electricity allowance and TV licences. These are the basic structures, in terms of community supports, that have been improved in recent years by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, the House discussed a relaxation of the residency rule. A number of people provide care to elderly parents and relatives who live nearby and who were excluded from the scheme as a result of the very strict residency rule. The Social Welfare Act, 1999, relaxed the residency rule and this has made a major difference for those who wish to remain in their own homes and for carers who prefer if their elderly relatives can remain there in order that they can retain some independence. That was a welcome development.</P>
    <P>The respite care grant was introduced in 1999 and it was increased to £300 this year. Carers and those for whom they care need a break from each other. As the saying goes, &ldquo;A change is as good as a rest&rdquo;, and when one is providing care 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year there is no doubt that one needs a break. Not only do carers need a break, those for whom they care need it also. The respite care grant is particularly beneficial to carers. In the run-up to the budget we should consider how it can be improved even more, particularly given that the cost of placing someone in a nursing home has increased dramatically in recent years.</P>
    <P>Other Members referred to the abolition of the means test. Senator Norris asked who would be <Col N="725" /> responsible for doing that. I am totally opposed to the abolition of the means test. Is the Senator seriously saying that a person who earns between £50,000 and £60,000 per year is not able to provide care for a loved one? The Senator is equating a person who earns £20,000 per year with someone who earns £50,000. The carer's allowance is not a payment for the care of the individual, it is an income support for the carer. A person earning £50,000 or £60,000 does not need the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, whose Department has established a working group to assess the needs of carers and those for whom they care. That is a more beneficial route to take rather than calling for a complete abolition of the means test. We must look at the individual needs of those who require care. I accept that it is difficult to assess and gauge the type of care people need, but it is more beneficial to consider the needs of those requiring care rather than merely throwing money at them. I am in favour of giving a payment to assist in the care of those most in need of it. Such a payment would go to the person being cared for rather than be used as an income support by the carer. I am totally opposed to abolishing the means test but I am in favour of increasing the respite care grant.</P>
    <P>When one is in Opposition it is easy to criticise, condemn and state what should be done. However, the bottom line &ndash; I agree with many of Senator Ridge's comments in this regard &ndash; is that 20 years ago a member of the family would remain at home to care for elderly parents or relatives. Society has changed in the interim. Families are smaller and many more people have chosen to pursue careers outside the home. In any event, it is not as beneficial to remain at home even if one is on a low income and entitled to receive the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has taken on board a great deal of what has been said by the Carers Association. That organisation is not the only one involved in caring and the Minister has taken on board the concerns, etc., of many of the other people involved in this area. He has done a huge amount in a short period to improve their lot. No one believes that matters will ever be right for carers. No amount of money will compensate a person who cares for someone in the home. However, with the exception of the abolition of the means test, the Minister has done more than anyone could have anticipated to try to improve the lot of carers.</P>
    <P>Carer's benefit was introduced in the last budget and, to all intents and purposes, this has been overlooked. Carer's benefit is of huge value to people who care for someone at home who is suffering from either a short-term or terminal illness. Such carers give up full-time employment for a period to care for sick relatives. In cases <Col N="726" /> where the illnesses are terminal or it is expected that their rehabilitation period will be short &ndash; perhaps one year &ndash; it is extremely beneficial to allow a person to remain at home to care for an elderly parent or relative. In addition, the person's employment rights are protected. This change has been particularly beneficial.</P>
    <P>This is an opportune time to debate carers and the carer's allowance. I wish to make a plea to the Minister. I am completely opposed to the abolition of the means test. However, as the Minister stated, 16,176 people are now in receipt of carer's allowance and we should aim to try to increase the income disregard in the forthcoming budget. At present, the income disregard for a single person is £75 while for a married couple it is £150. In order to allow people on lower incomes to qualify for carer's allowance, we should consider increasing the income disregard. I would not go so far as to state that the threshold should be doubled but it should be increased substantially in the budget.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Opposition felt it necessary to condemn the Government in respect of this issue. Anyone who considers this matter realistically will recognise that many changes have taken place which have benefited carers immensely. However, we can always do better and I hope the respite care grant and the income disregard will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget. We must make it easier for those on lower incomes to care for sick relatives. I do not agree with Opposition calls for the abolition of the means test because this will only benefit the more wealthy in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no issue that has come before the House in respect of which the Fine Gael motion would not have 100% public support. With regard to the changing society to which Senator Norris referred, I accept that the State has saved £1.5 billion thanks to the selflessness of carers, individuals who have put disabled or elderly people before themselves. That has not been the trend in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland the Soroptimists have done a great deal to raise awareness of this issue in the mid-west, particularly the Soroptimist club in Ennis which was the first to devise the idea of giving carers a break under its caring for the carers initiative. It won European group of the year for its innovative idea to provide respite for carers. The EU had not previously come across such a caring response by any group which had gone that route and the blueprint was adopted by other countries where there is not the same emphasis on providing care at home for the elderly and physically and mentally disabled. It is important to acknowledge the contribution of this small group of women who knew that carers in remote parts of County Clare never got one minute's break, let alone a day off to meet other carers. The time off <Col N="727" /> has been extended to a weekend. Carers are so thankful for this time off that we can only guess the sacrifices made by them when they make this specific commitment to their loved ones.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, we should not be talking about means testing. A figure of £1.5 billion was given as the figure carers save the State. It costs between £600 and £1,000 to care for an elderly person in a nursing home, not to mention the cost of looking after a person with an intellectual disability in a State institution. If one quantified the costs incurred in running a nursing home or institution, the figure would run to many billions of pounds.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion is a response to the needs of the most selfless and least rewarded group in society. Regardless of whether we like it, we will all be elderly some day, while some of us may be dependent on a member of our family who selflessly gives up a career to look after us. I am thinking in particular of women who account for 78% of carers. No reference has been made to a woman who gives up a challenging and successful career to stay at home to care for her elderly mother or father or distant relative. It does not matter if her husband earns £50,000 or £60,000, the point is that she may have forfeited a salary of £30,000, £40,000 or £50,000. She is an individual in her own right and her husband's income should not be taken into account in the means test. We have equality laws and there should be no assessment of her husband's income.</P>
    <P>Many women carers have given up a lucrative career and this must be taken into consideration when talking about incomes. Many carers have not married, while others have moved to another area. The social sacrifices made by these women cannot be quantified in money terms. This may also be the case for some male carers. We are dealing with a service which cannot be quantified in pounds, shillings and pence and which should be made a priority so that the needs of carers are met. Carers are unselfish people who will not scream and demand extraordinary bonanzas. What they are looking for are very basic rights.</P>
    <P>On the issue of residency, I am not sure about the distance involved. The Minister said the issue would be dealt with on a case by case basis. Will there be a cut off point of five or ten miles? What is meant by &ldquo;adjacency&rdquo;? When talking about third level grants there can be a huge difference in cost depending on whether one lives within or outside an area. I am very interested in this issue and ask the Minister to spell out the proposal in detail. The fact that a woman has to get up at 6 a.m. to travel a certain number of miles to look after her mother or father for the day must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>On the cost of care allowance, carers are asking for £45 per week to meet the additional costs of <Col N="728" /> caring at home. The Minister said that this issue comes within the health and children portfolio, not the social, community and family affairs portfolio. I am very anxious that the Minister for Health and Children takes this point into consideration in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that people would be allowed to leave the workforce for up to 15 months to act as carers and they would receive a non-means-tested payment. What will happen when the 15 month period expires? Who will take over? This proposal is ambiguous. If nobody is available to take the place of the carer will she be able to look for another 15 months off or will the person who needs care be left high and dry and have no option but to go into a nursing home? This point needs to be fully fleshed out.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong but I saw no reference in the booklet to the abolition of VAT on care items. This applies not only in cases where the person is cared for at home, it also applies in cases where they are cared for in a nursing home. On top of the basic very high nursing home costs, there are other expensive items an individual may have to buy. VAT on necessary care items, such as incontinence pads, should be abolished. If this is not possible, additional weekly grants should be paid to carers to defray the costs of caring for someone at home.</P>
    <P>On a positive note, I compliment the Minister on producing his booklet. However, there are many gaps in it. I hope that, with our support, he will fill these gaps in the budget and give proper recognition to carers and those they care for. Nobody will contradict me when I say they are the most deserving group in society. If they are not treated accordingly, the State will incur a high cost in providing alternative facilities in institutions and nursing homes. The family unit is changing rapidly and we may be without the unselfish services of carers in the future. If this happens we will bemoan the fact that we did not cherish them when they were prepared to care for their elderly relatives at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased this debate is taking place. This issue should be debated regularly. The concept of State-assisted care within the home and community is a good one and that is the correct way to proceed. It will be more important in coming years as the number of elderly people in the population increases. It is fitting that we should discuss this issue in a comprehensive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is indisputable that significant and substantial improvements have taken place in regard to provision for carers, including the carer's allowance, since the Government came to power. That cannot be denied and must rightly be acknowledged but more needs to be done. I hope and I am optimistic that the steady progress made over the past three years will be consolidated, built on <Col N="729" /> and enhanced in the upcoming budget. While much has been done, there is a need to do more and I am hopeful that will happen.</P>
    <P>The concept of making provision for carers is relatively new. As Senator Ridge stated, the contribution of carers in the community was taken for granted until quite recently. Often the single woman was kept at home or stayed at home to look after elderly parents or disabled members of the family at enormous cost and sacrifice in terms of her personal and economic life. In rural areas the farm was always given to the son. We are more enlightened now and that is how it ought to be.</P>
    <P>The provision made for care of the elderly, the frail and the disabled in the community is the hallmark of a civilised society. However, I want to be fair and I commend the Minister for introducing a number of badly needed improvements during the Government's term of office. For example, the abolition of the residency rule was important, although a question was raised earlier which must be answered on the extent to which it has been abolished. What does examination on a case by case basis mean? I trust that will be explained to the House when the Minister of State replies. I was delighted when I heard it was to be abolished but I am not sure whether that has been qualified. Abolition of the residency rule is the correct course of action.</P>
    <P>I was pleased at the introduction of the carer's benefit scheme over the past two budgets. It is terribly important. Throwing money at an issue and thinking it has been addressed is a mistake that is often made when, sometimes, if the issue was examined additional entitlements which would benefit people indirectly could be of much greater assistance and could enable a great deal more to happen. The carer's benefit scheme is good and has a great deal of potential.</P>
    <P>I was aghast to discover that only 32% of full-time carers are in receipt of the carer's allowance. I had hoped the figure would be much higher. That raises questions about the threshold for eligibility and how low it may be set. I will refer to them when I address means testing. While I was aghast that only 32% of carers were in receipt of the allowance, I was shocked to discover there was a 75% increase in the number since the Government took office. My capacity to do arithmetic is so retarded that I cannot translate that percentage into the number of people who were in receipt of the allowance when the Government took office but it must have been pitifully low and that is to nobody's credit. There has been a substantial improvement in the number in receipt of the allowance.</P>
    <P>Means testing is a live, important issue for everybody but it is a key issue for the Carers Association, to which I pay full tribute for the work it has done to heighten the profile of these worthy citizens who do valuable work which is <Col N="730" /> often not valued by the community. I compliment the association which makes a strong case for the abolition of the means test but I do not agree with that. However, the average industrial wage, for example, could be used as the criterion for a decent, reasonable threshold for eligibility. We might seek to raise the threshold to that level as soon as possible with a view to increasing it in due course.</P>
    <P>There are people who can afford to pay huge sums for bricks and mortar, mechanical gadgets and four or five top of the range cars outside their houses but who, at the same time, are not willing to pay for this service. That amounts to a false sense of values. I am not in favour of using taxpayers' money to fund such individuals and, therefore, I do not favour total abolition of the means test. However, there is enormous scope to raise the threshold for eligibility. There must be a reason that only 32% of carers being in receipt of the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Perhaps individualisation in the social welfare code similar to that in the tax code should be examined so that a carer's income would be assessed in its own right and the allowance would be based on that. The respite fund needs to be doubled. Nobody will ever tell me that anybody can care for an elderly relative at home on £300. It would pay for one weekend in a Ryan hotel. At a minimum carers should receive two breaks on everything. It is the least we should offer to people who do this tough, valuable work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They often are in need of care themselves as many, for example, are ageing women looking after older husbands.</P>
    <P>We must demonstrate to them that they are valued. I am proud that the leader of my party, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, first introduced the concept of making a carer's allowance available. We have a long way to go but I am satisfied we are going in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. However, I am disappointed that the Minister did not refer to the home help service. Much of what I would have said about carers has been said already. If the home help service was promoted many carers would be able to remain in employment for longer, which would result in social and economic benefits for them and support for their ageing or disabled relatives in their own homes. Our aim is to try to keep people in their homes for as long as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the increase in the home help payment, which had been ridiculous, to at least the minimum wage has been important over the past year, much greater emphasis must be put on estab<Col N="731" /> lishing a proper home help service so that perhaps the home help can manage to be the mainstay during the day and the person who comes home in the evening can take over again. It is an important part of this debate which has not been mentioned to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for the points she made about home helps and also for sharing her time with me. As others have said, this is an important debate. As Senator Quill pointed out, it is a debate we should have regularly because the issue of caring is very important. The backdrop against which it operates is also changing. Senator Ridge in her opening remarks made the point of which we are all well aware that the availability of unpaid caring in the community cannot be taken for granted as it once was. Until relatively recently there was an assumption that there was an unpaid female workforce, in effect, which cared for children, elderly relatives or disabled members of the family. As the economic picture has changed, so also has that issue.</P>
      <P>It appears to me, and I am sure others would also recognise, that we would never have got around to recognising properly the position of those unpaid carers until two things happened. One was that carers began to demand recognition and acknowledgement for what they do on behalf of the community and the other was that the economic position changed so much that it demanded we as legislators and the Government of whatever political colour should pay some attention.</P>
      <P>At the heart of this debate, and the Minister of State referred to this twice if not three times, is the fact that the carer's allowance is not a payment for caring but an income support. Senator Leonard also referred to that. That is the context in which it operates. However, the question is whether the context is still correct. I agree that this and previous Governments have made considerable advances in the area of the carer's allowance and supports for the carer. While such advances on the part of the current Government are to be applauded, the resources available to it are such that, had it not made such advances, it would have been nothing short of a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must now ask ourselves the question, which is applicable in other contexts and not just caring, whether we will go the road of recognising the role of caring in the community and whether we need to examine the issue of a payment for caring rather than an income support. As the Minister of State put it regarding the income support, a couple with two children and a joint annual income of £9,152 qualify for a full carer's allowance. A couple on a maximum of £19,500 receive the minimum carer's allowance. Such figures speak for themselves in the current context. The <Col N="732" /> last I heard, the average industrial wage was around £14,000. It used to be £11,000, but that was a few years ago. My assumption is that it significantly exceeds that now. If the average industrial income is around £14,000 or £15,000, which is not a high income by any standards, and the income at which one qualifies for the full carer's allowance is £9,000, how can one be expected to cope on such an income? Those are the issues constantly raised with us as public representatives.</P>
    <P>Until we face up to the issue of giving a payment for caring and affording proper recognition and acknowledgement of caring in the community, we will not move forward. I am sure everyone in the House will have had contact of varying degrees, either in their constituencies or at national level, with carers' groups or even with individual carers. There is a growing demand among those individuals and groups for recognition by the community of their central role. If we continue to stay within the context of the carer's allowance as an income support, we will always have that dissatisfaction on the part of carers. We will also have to ask ourselves whether our response to the issue is adequate.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, the era has changed. I made some inquiries this afternoon about the issue of means testing with economists and people more <i>au fait</i> with costs, figures and analyses, and I am told that there is no agreed figure at present for what it would cost to abolish the means test for all carers. As Senator Quill pointed out, slightly more than 32% of carers, barely a third, qualify for the carer's allowance. In the first instance, we should ask what the real cost would be and not pull figures out of the air, be they £150 million or a few billion. We should find out in the first instance what the real cost would be of abolishing the means test for carers, of establishing a payment for carers and what its cost would be and whether it would be related to tax paid and so on. At the heart, we must ask ourselves as a major policy question whether we will put in place a payment for caring.</P>
    <P>Other points I would like to have made have already been made, such as the point about the carer's benefit which, on the face of it, appears to be a very good idea. However, what happens at the end of the 15 months? A person is not eligible if he or she is self-employed or if he or she was a carer before the benefit was introduced. It appears to be a good idea where a person in a family is seriously ill for a short period. Considering the payment gained would be £88.50 a week, it is likely that a family receiving the payment would suffer a major loss of income were they to avail of it. That also needs to be examined. My main point at the heart of the argument is that we should definitely examine the issue of a payment for caring because it is the only proper <Col N="733" /> recognition of the role of caring in its many manifestations in the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that carers are the most selfless group of people in society. Carers work instinctively to care for relatives and friends in the community and have given up careers or family life or may attempt to juggle them to carry out their caring responsibilities. They do this voluntarily and, in doing so, make a huge difference to the people for whom they care. We all know that there can be stress and that carers experience social isolation both within their families and communities. However, we should not forget that caring is based on close and intimate relationships and that many carers experience great joy and personal satisfaction in caring for their nearest and dearest. Those who have cared unselfishly for loved ones for many years will say that a great void exists in their lives when the people for whom they have cared pass on to their eternal reward.</P>
      <P>The Government could not and should not interfere in those personal relationships. What it can and must do is support carers in the areas which matter most to them and which make their caring duties easier to bear. These areas range from financial support, if necessary, to community care services, respite care and clear and accessible information. The underlying philosophy of Government policy is that people should be allowed to live with dignity in their own homes and that they must be supported by the provision of services for themselves and their carers. This, of course, removes the old concept, which I have never supported, that care can best be provided in institutions.</P>
      <P>No one has done more than the Minister to provide for carers and the people for whom they care. The facts supporting this are very clear. To augment the argument, the respite care grant has been introduced. The review of the carer's allowance, which was published by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, considered that respite care is one of the most important services required by carers, to provide the carer with regular breaks and emergency cover. If respite care was not available carers would be in need of care. We can all imagine how desperately a carer, whose life centres on the needs of the person requiring care, would need a break. In response to this need the Government introduced the innovative respite care grant which is payable with a carer's allowance. In last year's budget, the Government increased that amount by £100 to £300. I accept that this grant should be increased but the Minister has taken a very proactive stance regarding the carer's allowance and I am confident he will continue to do so. Carers have warmly welcomed this measure, although I am sure they will be lobbying to have the amount increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> The residency rule is another matter that has received close attention from the Minister. The original residency requirement that the carer must live with the care recipient was put in place to safeguard the interests of the recipient, but this rule was found to be restrictive. Carers were providing a high level of care but those who were not living with the person requiring care were not eligible for the allowance. This requirement was examined as part of the review of the carer's allowance and it was proposed that it should be relaxed to introduce greater flexibility to the scheme. The Government acted swiftly on that proposal and in August 1999 the residency requirements were relaxed to allow carers living in close proximity to the care recipient to qualify for the allowances. The Government acted swiftly when difficulties arose and, most recently, has abolished the close proximity requirement altogether so that each non-resident claim for the carer's allowance will be assessed on a case by case basis. The examination of claims on such a basis must be extended on an even broader scale. This has been called for by many carers' organisations and it serves to introduce greater flexibility into the scheme while safeguarding the needs and interests of the care recipients.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has also made provision for the full-time care and attention rule to be relaxed to allow carers to work for up to ten hours per week. This measure is important for carers, not only for the additional income it provides but also for the therapeutic value it generates to the individual carer.</P>
    <P>An extension of the carer's allowance will include more categories of care recipient. When the carer's allowance was introduced it was initially confined to those providing care for certain people in receipt of social welfare payments. It was subsequently extended to include all persons over the age of 66, regardless of their source of income. The Government has extended the allowance to carers of children who receive a domiciliary care allowance from the health boards and carers of people over the age of 16, regardless of their source of income.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to remind Members of the carer's benefit scheme, an important measure which the Minister has recently introduced. The scheme recognises that leaving employment to provide care is broadly similar to other contingencies under the social welfare code and, as such, the benefit will fill the gap in the social insurance system. The new carer's benefit scheme, which will be of 50 months duration, is specifically intended to support those who leave the workforce to care for people in need of full-time care and attention. The scheme involves two central elements. The first is a weekly income support payment to be operated by the Department. This will be based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer and came into effect on 26 October. The second element is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with special responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, is currently drawing up carer's leave legislation to reflect the employment rights of the carer. The success of these and many other measures introduced by the Government can be gauged by the growth in the number of carers receiving the increased expenditure on the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>I support the concept that the carer's allowance needs to be improved, but I was amused to hear members of the Opposition saying so. This is because when the Government took office in 1997, 9,216 carers were in receipt of the carer's allowance, but this number has been increased by 75% to 16,126. There has always been a need for carers but only this Government has dealt with it in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the number of religious carers and I have never neglected to draw attention to those religious who dedicated their lives to providing such a service on a voluntary basis. There were black sheep but, equally, there were black sheep among doctors, nurses, dentists, solicitors and all the professions. Carers are no different. We should thank the many religious carers who, over the years, dedicated their lives to caring for those who were unable to care for themselves. I commend the Minister on doing a great job. One of the great luxuries of being in opposition is that one can say what one likes because one does not have to deliver.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate, I am slightly concerned that there is a complacency within the Government parties with regard to the health services being provided at present. I would remind the Government parties, however, of the results of a poll organised by TG4 in recent days in the Galway West constituency. Many questions were posed, including how politicians were performing and what the major issues were. We were informed, however, that people believe that the major issue in the next general election will be health care or rather the lack of it. The Government might be complacent and think it is doing a wonderful job, but I am afraid that people are deeply concerned and dissatisfied with what is being done. Whoever takes power at the next election, we will need a Government that really cares, that says everyone counts and that is willing to tackle the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great work carers have been doing has been elaborated upon by other speakers and there is no need for me to do so. They are saving the State millions of pounds, but the work they do is not recognised. One of the great problems is the obstacle of the means test. For example, a husband and wife, both pensioners in their 80s, are living outside the town of Athenry and because the husband is very ill, he decided he would have to be committed to an institution. His wife, however, said she would care for him at <Col N="736" /> home. She was in receipt of the old age pension and received an extra £20 by way of carer's allowance to look after her 80 year old husband. Is that an incentive? Is it progress? What would it cost if this poor man had to be taken into care and looked after for many years?</P>
    <P>The personal touch is vital. One of the great problems facing old people is loneliness. They need somebody to be there. It reminds me of a poem I learned in school many years ago, which is about a young Donegal fellow coming to Dublin: &ldquo;Thousands of faces, not one that I know, but the cold of the wind in my face as I go&rdquo;. If that is the way a young lad felt, how do these people feel who are left on their own in old age, isolated in homes and with nobody to care for them?</P>
    <P>On a broader issue, I am very familiar with two cases of people who have been paralysed after injury. I am sure everyone in the House knows about Shane Broderick, the famous jockey. He was paralysed two and a half years ago on the day of the Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse when he fell from a horse called Another Deadly. He was rehabilitated in the Dún Laoghaire institute. When he left the care in that institute he was faced with an offer of £70 per week and perhaps two butter vouchers. There would have been nothing else for him were it not for the goodwill and support he received from his friends and the many people in the racing confraternity, who responded in such a magnanimous and generous way. They raised £1.3 million so that he would have a good way of life. There was no other Government funded support mechanism for him.</P>
    <P>The second case concerns a young girl&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes. A young girl in my parish in Galway, who would be known by people in Galway, was very badly injured in a car crash. She suffered similar injuries to Shane Broderick. She will leave the Dún Laoghaire institute very soon and what will happen to her? She will be interrogated with regard to social welfare entitlements and means tested. In the end she may be offered £70 per week. There is no policy in place nor finance provided for independent living centres. These people must rely on the support, commitment and dedication of fund-raising committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I salute the people who are trying to raise funds for the young Galway girl. They are working hard and knocking on doors so that this girl might have a meaningful way of life. They are faced with a huge task. They must raise £1 million to ensure that this girl's needs will be looked after into the future. A wheelchair for the people with the injuries I am speaking about can cost between <Col N="737" /> £5,000 and £50,000. There is no mechanism to provide such funding or funding for a van with a hoist. The plight of the people I have referred to is typical of the prevails approach.</P>
    <P>I am not being critical. I put forward these two cases as typical examples. These are two young people who were left high and dry, and who would be left like vegetables were it not for the goodwill of wonderful people who are prepared to knock on doors, canvass and raise funds so that they might have a better way of life.</P>
    <P>A commission should be put in place to examine the care needed by people who are paralysed or seriously injured. I am not being critical. We all appreciate what I am talking about. It is a serious position when people cannot care for themselves and there is no mechanism that will provide substantial funding and care for these people so that they will be looked after for the rest of their lives. I would like an all-party commission set up to examine the matter and consider what can be done to help people in the same position as the two people I mentioned. The State should set up a support mechanism for them so that they can have some quality of life. It is grossly unfair that they must rely on the goodwill and support of their friends.</P>
    <P>If the Minister established such a committee it would be a great development and I would be the first to commend him. We are talking about a very serious matter which should be examined on an all-party basis. I hope that we will do something to care for people who are less fortunate than the rest of us.</P>

      <P>I reject completely the assertion made by Senator McDonagh when he said that he perceived a sense of complacency on this side of the House. Anyone who has been party to Fianna Fáil parliamentary meetings in the past two and a half years, since we came back into Government, would realise that the one issue that is raised constantly with the Minister of State and any Minister who deals with the matter, is carers, our treatment of them and the need to continually improve the support we give them. They do a fine and wonderful job of caring in the home. It is often a thankless job and for many people it is a 24 hours a day, seven days a week job.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came into office, as the Minister outlined earlier, it has significantly improved the position of carers. We significantly improved the benefits available to carers and the way they are able to perform their jobs by giving them additional resources and supports in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one is saying that it is enough and that is acknowledged. Will we ever be able to give enough? We cannot value the work done by carers 24 hours a day and seven days a week. What we cannot value we cannot pay for. We must state <Col N="738" /> that clearly &ndash; we cannot possibly put a price on the work done by people caring for their loved ones. Until we accept that principle no one will be happy with what any Government chooses to do. It would be unrealistic to try to reach a position where we give carers the value or pay them for the work that they do. An earlier speaker referred to a lady giving up a £60,000 job and career. How could we compensate someone for doing that? We could never compensate them for it.</P>
    <P>One of the tremendous things about Irish society is that we believed it was based around the family unit. We were a society that accepted responsibility for our families, children, parents, loved ones and members of our community who were disabled or suffered terrible accidents.</P>
    <P>We should accept one principle this evening. That is the principle that while we need to continue to improve the lot of carers, we cannot possibly satisfy whatever it is that they deserve. If we accept this principle we can move forward in a proactive manner, continue the work that we have been doing and ensure that we try to make life a little bit easier for them.</P>
    <P>Support is an area that needs to be examined. It is not so much a question of the payment for the hours worked from Monday to Friday or Sunday, but the support available. We have situations &ndash; and this is not within this Minister's brief but it must be put on record this evening &ndash; where health boards throughout the country are rationing basic items such as incontinence wear for old people or people with a disability. We cannot allow that. If we can alleviate some of the concerns and frustrations that people have and prevent them from spending the little money that they have on information and goods like that, then we would be doing something that will make their lot easier. I acknowledge the funding that was ring-fenced for health boards for aids and appliances. I hope to see more money going in that direction.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the work that he has done so far. No one knows better than he does the work that is in front of him, the Government and all future Governments in terms of tackling this issue. We must accept the basic principle that we cannot put a value on the work that is being done. We cannot possibly expect, therefore, to compensate it at the level at which it deserves to be compensated. No country could afford to do so.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing her time with me. I share her view on the suggestions of complacency on the part of the Government parties. In the brief time I have been a Member of this House, I have been most impressed by the priority given to this topic at parliamentary party level and, from listening to him, by the Minister whom I welcome to the House and congratulate on the progress made in his Department on all areas, particularly carer's allowance. I also congratulate him &ndash; I am sur<Col N="739" /> prised this has not been mentioned &ndash; on the professional manner in which he and his Department go about informing those eligible to receive allowances of their entitlements.</P>
      <P>There is an old saying that not only must justice be done, it must be seen to be done. If the social welfare code is to be of any benefit to those entitled to receive allowances, not only must the allowances be available, it must be known that they are available. In his time in the Department the Minister has placed huge emphasis on this aspect, and that is to be welcomed. Last week 16,000 copies of his booklet were distributed. It is interesting that in his absence he was congratulated from all sides of the House. That was entirely appropriate.</P>
      <P>While I will not condemn the wording, like some of my colleagues, I regret that the motion is adversarial in nature. It is not appropriate that the matter should be kicked around; we should be both compassionate and caring. It is important that the debate is conducted in such an atmosphere.</P>
      <P>The statistics speak for themselves. In three years the number eligible to receive carer's allowance has increased from 9,200 to 16,200 while the amount of money being spent has increased from £36.5 million to £78.3 million. This represents huge progress in anyone's language. Not only must we continue to make progress, it must be improved upon.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quill referred to the changing face of Irish society and the time when the eldest son always inherited the farm. I recall reading in the dim and distant past that the eldest son entered the priesthood, that it was the second son who inherited the farm and that invariably it was the youngest daughter who remained at home to care for her elderly parents. In this context, there were significant changes under the Succession Act, 1963. There were also significant and, probably, long overdue changes following the introduction of the carer's allowance in 1987. Unlike the Succession Act, which is written in stone, the carer's allowance requires annual review, not only in budgetary terms but also in terms of the rules of eligibility to allow for changes in society.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister. I regret the nature of the motion, the amendment to which speaks for itself. The statistics are there for all to see. I look forward to our complacency being justified in the next few weeks when a caring budget with provisions in this area is introduced.</P>

      <P>Lest Members opposite think that what we have said is disrespectful, what we have enunciated are the wishes of the Carers Association. There was not a bolt from the blue to enlighten me as to what exactly was needed. I read not only this year's, but last year's submission and would be the first to acknowledge that enormous strides have been made. While Senator Cox's input was very thoughtful in terms of how we will ever be able to substitute the things people have lost in becoming dependent on others, I stand over the submissions made by the Carers Association.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that a consultancy study will be undertaken to examine issues relating to long-term care, both in terms of cost and possible partnership approaches, and the possible role of the PRSI system in this regard. I look forward to the results of this study.</P>
      <P>I take on board what Senator Norris said. Carers have a right to demand the best possible treatment while providing the best possible treatment for those for whom they are caring. I am sorry that Senator Glynn is not present because he almost exploded in self-immolation in adulation of Fianna Fáil and all that it has done. There has never been a Government like this one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is of importance in relation to the progress to date by the Dublin Institute of Technology in acquiring a site for a new campus at the location of the old St. Brendan's Hospital in the Grangegorman area. I want to know what has happened to date and how it is intended to use the site.</P>
      <P>In 1991 the Dublin Institute of Technology was established through legislation. Having been established on a legislative footing, it proceeded to search for a new campus for its six colleges. Currently they are located in separate areas across Dublin &ndash; Mountjoy Square, Cathal Brugha Street, Bolton Street, Chatham Row, Kevin Street and Rathmines. All the colleges are located in a different campus and all are in very confined spaces totalling ten acres of land.</P>
      <P>A search of the city found a suitable site at Grangegorman which is adjacent to the heart of the city, to which the colleges could relocate, in so far as relocation could take place, and where playing fields, student buildings and so on could be provided. The institute negotiated with the Eastern Health Board, which agreed to sell it 70 acres of its 90 acres for its new campus. This happened five or six years ago. The final decision would have been taken later than that, but negotiations have been ongoing for that length of time.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology designed its plans, having met the local community in the general Oxmantown area, told them what was proposed, what type of structures and buildings would be put in place, that the recreational facilities &ndash; football fields, tennis courts and so on &ndash; would be open to the local community. Everybody thought it an excellent idea. A price was put on the site &ndash; in the region of £10 million at the time, and the Eastern Health Board agreed to dispose of the site to the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>Since then everything seems to have fallen into a strange kind of limbo. The project has been frozen in time. No progress has been made one way or another, and nobody seems to know exactly what is going on. Whenever one asks a question about it, the response is that the matter is proceeding. However, it has been going nowhere in recent years. I understand that now the fee for the land has been increased &ndash; property prices have increased enormously since the original fee was negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" />
      <Col N="744" /> Obviously, the Dublin Institute of Technology cannot proceed without funding from the Government. The Government is dragging its feet on providing that funding. I am surprised by that, given that the college and the site would be located in the Taoiseach's constituency, the National College of Ireland, which I would have thought had much more tenuous claims to third level status, was opened last month in the docklands and three of the Dublin Institute of Technology colleges are already located in the area on the north side of the city.</P>
    <P>I do not know, and nobody seems to know, what precisely is the situation. What is the reason for the hold-up? Are the plans still in existence? Is there a firm intention that the purchase will go through? If so, has the cost increased and by what amount has it increased? Are the same plans and designs going to hold good? Will there be a full transfer of functions and faculties to the site? Will the student accommodation, the music hall or the planned headquarters come on stream? Will the Minister of State put us out of our misery by indicating when this major public project will come on stream or if it will come on stream during the Government's term of office?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, I thank the Senator for raising this important question and thereby providing the opportunity for me to advise the House on the matter.</P>
      <P>On 14 December 1999, the Government approved the purchase by the Department of Education and Science of 65 acres of the Eastern Health Board's site at Grangegorman, Dublin 7, for the Dublin Institute of Technology and agreed to the development of the property on a phased basis to meet the needs of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children are in constant contact, as is the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Eastern Regional Health Authority on the acquisition of the site and the phased possession of the property. These negotiations are expected to be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>The site at Grangegorman will allow the Dublin Institute of Technology to provide modern quality facilities for its 21,000 students. It will facilitate the reorganisation of the institute on a faculty basis, bringing related programmes to a common site to avail of economies of scale and ensure efficiencies in operation and facilitate further development, address the demand for additional apprenticeship places in the Dublin area, provide a central library and information centre with 24 hour open access, provide office accommodation for academic and administrative staff to enable them provide a quality service to the student population and provide playing fields, sports and recreational facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DIT has recently undertaken a comprehensive internal review of its original plans for <Col N="745" /> the site and has augmented and developed its original proposal with a view to achieving maximum efficiency of use of the site consistent with the longer term strategic plan for the academic development of the institute. As part of the Government decision an assessment of the development of the Grangegorman site to meet the accommodation needs of the Dublin Institute of Technology as an appropriate public private partnership project or otherwise is under way. With the help of external expertise, Dublin Institute of Technology is progressing the drafting of a strategic brief in the context of a public private partnership development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent announcement by Enterprise Oil regarding the Corrib gas find is the most exciting and potentially challenging development that has happened in the history of County Mayo. There is great jubilation in the county about the find 50 miles of its north coast. As I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of the history of this matter, I will not to dwell on that aspect.</P>
      <P>The position is that a deal has been done between Enterprise Oil and Bord Gáis for a transmission line from Pollatomish on the north Mayo coast to Craughwell in Galway linking up with the national grid of Bord Gáis. There is great unease in the county that only two towns, Claremorris and Castlebar, to which he referred in the Dáil on 24 October, will be serviced initially by a spur line from the main transmission line. Several small and large towns in Mayo are within a reasonable distance of the main transmission line &ndash; I refer specifically to towns such as Crossmolina, Killala, Foxford and Ballina, which are within a radius of seven or eight miles of the main transmission line.</P>
      <P>The thinking in the area is that a mile of spur line would cost about £500,000, that is a ballpark figure. Servicing Ballina would involve an investment of approximately £4 million to £5 million. In the overall context of this development, which is expected to be in the region of £700 million or £800 million, maybe approaching £1 billion, an investment of another £7 million or £8 million is not very large. Given that Mayo is in the BMW region, some moneys should be provided for such connections. I eagerly await the Minister of State's reply to discover how the Government is exploring the possibility of connecting the towns adjacent to the main transmission line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current position could be compared to laying a water pipe in one's back garden to supply one's neighbour with water but not benefiting from that pipeline oneself. This is hard to accept. I am sure the Minister of State will agree it is extremely hard to sell the idea of connecting only two towns in Mayo to the main transmission line, especially when we have this great natural resource on our doorstep. It is the most exciting <Col N="746" /> announcement in the history of County Mayo and it has great commercial potential.</P>
    <P>Having spoken to the transmission manager of Bord Gáis, I am aware it is extremely interested in industry in the area. He said that Bord Gáis is not looking for ways not to connect a town to the main transmission line, but for ways to do so, although such a project must be commercially viable. That is what it is considering. The domestic market in those towns would possibly not be sufficient to justify a commercial connection but we want large industries to be taken into account in this overall project.</P>
    <P>If the provision of such connections do not come within the commercial remit of Bord Gáis, I exhort the Minister of State to consider favourably allocating money for such connections, as there must be other options to ensure that a small amount of money, £4 million to £5 million, can be made available to cover the cost of the necessary spur lines, which would add enormously to the potential of those towns in Mayo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter. I wish to make it clear that I have no function regarding the matter raised by the Senator. The question of which areas of the country or which towns will be connected to the natural gas network is a matter for pipeline developers, whether that is Bord Gáis Éireann or private sector developers.</P>
      <P>It is only after a developer has decided on a pipeline route and which areas and towns are to be served that the proposal is submitted to my Department for regulatory approval under the Gas Acts. In addition, in the case of proposals by Bord Gáis, I must also give approval for the expenditure in my capacity as shareholder. In approving pipeline proposals I can attach certain conditions in relation to safety and environmental considerations but I emphasise that I cannot determine what the route of a pipeline will be or what towns along its route are to be served by spur lines. This is a matter for the pipeline developers and the decision will be made by them on the basis of commercial criteria.</P>
      <P>Given recent announcements in the media, I understand the Senator's concerns and am happy to explain the current state of developments regarding extension of the natural gas network. The main development in the extension of the gas transmission network by BGE is its proposal to build a new pipeline from Dublin to Galway and onwards to Limerick. As gas demand increases and the Kinsale field comes to the end of its natural life over the next couple of years, there is a necessity to reinforce the gas transmission system to ensure that it is capable of meeting demand in the south of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The option of providing this extra capacity by building a pipeline to the west and on to the south has the added benefit of making gas available to areas in the midlands and the west as yet unserved by a gas supply. As many Senators will be aware, the Taoiseach recently announced a <Col N="747" /> joint venture between BGE and the consortium involved in the exploration of the Corrib field to build a pipeline from Pollatomish, County Mayo, to Galway to bring gas from the Corrib field to the main BGE onshore system in anticipation of a final decision on the commerciality of the field by the Corrib partners.</P>
    <P>In relation to this proposed pipeline, the House will be aware that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources announced recently that BGE has indicated that Castlebar, Claremorris, Tuam and Athenry will be among the towns along the route of the pipeline from Pollatomish to Galway that will receive a natural gas supply.</P>
    <P>BGE is committed to connecting the natural gas network to all major towns in the country provided this can be done in line with its commer<Col N="748" /> cial mandate under the Gas Acts. BGE has informed me that in addition to providing a gas supply to the towns mentioned earlier, the prospect of supplying gas to other centres of population in the west and north-west is under active review as part of a national study to determine centres that can be supplied with gas on an economic basis.</P>
    <P>The question of gas supply to other towns in the catchment area of the proposed pipelines is a matter for BGE to examine in assessing the economics of extending the transmission and distribution networks into the west or north-west. When this assessment has been completed BGE will have a fuller picture as to the viability of such extensions.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16 November 2000.</P>
