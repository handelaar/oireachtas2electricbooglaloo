      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 7. Nos. 2 and 3, motions re the moving of writs for the by-elections to be taken without debate; No. 4, motion re establishment of the Joint Committee on the Constitution, to be taken without debate; No. 5, motion re referral of issues relating to the management of the Shannon River to the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, to be taken without debate; No. 6, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken today; No. 8, Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 2000 &ndash; all Stages, to be taken today; No. 9, earlier signature motion to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 8; No. 7, Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, to be taken today with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Leader looking for some kind of productivity-based increase? The schedule issued late last Friday listed one item as ordered for today but the Leader comes into the House today with nine items on the agenda. I have no difficulty with Nos. 2 and 3 which are relatively straightforward. On No. 4, however, I strongly object to an item appearing on the Order Paper this morning which runs to almost two pages. It may be a very harmless item but we are at least due some explanation. I think that item can wait until the next session and I do not see any reason to take it today, unless the Leader is prepared to give us an explanation. Perhaps Senator Dardis, who is on that committee, might be able to do so. We should be told what it is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" /> With regard to No. 5, is the Leader joking?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>He can forget it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That item has come out of the blue and we are being asked to refer it to the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport. I absolutely object to that as we should be given the opportunity to have a debate on it. I propose that No. 5 should be deferred until the next session if the Leader is not prepared to give us time to have a debate on it today.</P>
      <P>Nos. 6 and 7 are fine and there is no problem with them. We are happy to co-operate with the Leader on No. 8 because we know it is important to conclude all Stages of that Bill today. However, we are exactly where we were at the end of the last session where a raft of items has been imposed on the Leader at the last minute. We will not be a party to making life easier for Departments that cannot get their act together in time and that arrive with matters on the last sitting day of the session.</P>
      <P>The Leader should take steps to have an urgent debate on the Registration of Lobbyists' Bill, which he and his colleagues in Government voted down when Senator Costello introduced it in the House last year. Will the Leader also provide an answer today, if he has one, concerning the Government's plans on libel and defamation legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with 99% of what Senator Manning has said concerning the way we do our business. It is the wrong way and the wrong day for people to try to pull political tricks here. Politics has had a bad press this morning and it is something that should be discussed because it is of relevance to all of us. The way we do our business is what determines how people judge us.</P>
      <P>As regards the items on the Order of Business, I will be opposing No. 5 because I am not in favour of taking it without debate. There has been no Whips' agreement or any other agreement on it. If the Leader wanted to pick a day to make a bad call for a political decision, this was the day on which to do so. The Leaders should cop themselves on a little bit and get their act together on how we do our business because it is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should, if necessary, decide how the Order of Business is to be done today, but the manner in which it has been proposed is not on. Therefore, I will be opposing the Order of Business in addition to each item as it arises. The business of the House is not going to be conducted in this way. Years ago, a similar situation arose when the then Government introduced two major Bills without prior notice and tried to push them through the House in one day. On that occasion, the Opposition Senators, including the Independents, withdrew from the House. That is how I feel about today's Order of Business, if we are to be treated in this way. There is no point in having <Col N="179" /> Whips or co-ordinators to organise the business of the House if we cannot get our act together and know what we are going to do.</P>
    <P>If everyone is discussing a single issue in party politics today, then we should be doing the same thing. People talk about the relevance and coverage of the House and what politicians are doing, but it is amazing that if there is such a lacuna in the business of the House, with nine additional items on the Order of Business, we cannot deal in any way with what everybody else in every media outlet, pub and living room is discussing &ndash; in other words, sleaze in political life. That is what we should be discussing today and it is on that I would like to hear the Leader outline his plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Order of Business as outlined by the Leader of the House. If this is the appropriate time, however, I wish to move No. 2, the motion in my name in relation to the vacancy in the membership of Seanad Éireann. Is it the appropriate time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Senator. We will dispose of the Order of Business first and we will come to that item in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are nine items on the Order of Business, two of which were referred to us earlier, and there has been no discussion about the others. The Whips have not been consulted and it is absolutely outrageous that the Leader should bring these items before us on the last sitting day of this session with no explanation as to their importance. I do not know what the implications are regarding the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. It may be appropriate but we have not received an explanation. Why should the River Shannon Bill be put back without some explanation and some discussion by the Leader?</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Financial Provisions Bill), 2000, is highly important and very controversial legislation. We are expected to deal with all Stages of a Bill which has huge implications in legal and political terms. We need to tease out its contents very carefully. It is an insult to this House that the Leader should expect us to deal with all Stages now without giving us even the courtesy of prior consultation relating to this matter. We will be opposing the Bill, the Order of Business and each of these items on which we have not been consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 18, that Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to introduce a register of political lobbyists, be taken prior to any other items. The entire country is agog with the scandal now emanating from the evidence given at the Flood tribunal and this is the mechanism for us to discuss it. It is appropriate when everybody else is discussing this and it is the subject of all the news items that we should have the opportunity of doing so. I suggest that all the other business of <Col N="180" /> the House be left aside so that this House would have an opportunity today to discuss the full ramifications of the political fallout from the corruption and sleaze in politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Leader is proposing a large number of items on the Order of Business, the time that the House will take to dispose of them will not be any greater than on an ordinary day. Senator Manning asked about No. 4 and I am in a position to clarify that. As a member of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, along with Senators O'Donovan, O'Dowd and O'Meara, the background to this is that it is an all-party Oireachtas committee. To avail of the facilities of the House, it needs temporarily to become a committee of the House. The Cathaoirleach and Committee on Procedure and Privileges very kindly allowed the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution to use the Seanad Chamber over the recess so that we can hear all the presentations regarding some of the submissions made to the committee on the issue of abortion.</P>
      <P>The motion needs to be taken today because otherwise the committee would not be able to avail of the facilities of the House over the Easter recess, which is what we wish to do. That is to clarify that point for Senator Manning and I hope, on the basis of that clarification, it will be possible to take this issue today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to No. 4, we have a difficulty in this part of the House because while that may be an all-party group, the Independents, to the best of my knowledge, are not represented. They have made a case to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but that has not been accepted. We have difficulty with that. I have looked at it and I do not see the Independents recognised.</P>
      <P>The point made by Senator Manning was one I made only last week. On 23 January, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Seamus Brennan, announced something like 19 Bills which the Government intended to publish before Easter. To the best of my knowledge, about half of them have been published. I am not concerned about that but what is happening today happens every year in June. I entered a website recently that gives a link into other Bills and I was amazed, when I looked back on Bills since 1997, at the number of Bills passed in the last days of June before the recess. This seems to be happening again here and it certainly is not the example to set today to suddenly introduce seven items on today's agenda on the last day before this recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is exactly the point I was trying to make last week about the end of June being the time when we suddenly have a pile of Bills to pass. We have often heard the example of the person waiting at the bus stop who says that they all come at the one time. This is happening here. I am not complaining at the lack of productivity on <Col N="181" /> the Government's part in not introducing the Bills. It is introducing them, but at the last minute. They are all coming along at the same time, just as happens when one is waiting at a bus stop &ndash; all the buses come at once. We cannot give them enough attention.</P>
    <P>I second Senator Costello's proposal to debate the Bill on lobbyists today. It is the event of the day and it has the attention of the country. It is the wrong day to debate these other items.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am nearly a senior citizen in the House at this stage and I am continually amazed at the way we manage to deal with what the public is not interested in while not talking about the issues of the day. We should be talking about the way all of us have been besmirched and about how we can ensure it never happens again rather than talking about issues that have been landed on us with no prior notice or discussion. That is not the way to do business. It is not the way many of the Leader's predecessors did business and I do not know whether he is being bullied by Government or this is his own style, but it does him no credit to land this much business on the House. We are being loaded with other issues when there is only one issue politicians should be talking about, that is an issue that affects me as much as anyone else. I have been almost 20 years in the House and I am tired of being told I am only here for the money. I am horrified when I discover how many people were in it for the money, and that is what we should be talking about.</P>

      <P>We cannot debate the matter now. Senator Costello has moved an amendment to the Order of Business which has been seconded. If agreed, that will provide Members with the opportunity to make the points the Senator is making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views of Senators Manning, Costello and others on both sides of the House regarding the urgent need for a Bill to deal with lobbyists. We will not be taken seriously but will be regarded as irrelevant until this issue is addressed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. There is no doubt that there is an urgent need for control and regulation in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello who called for a debate on lobbyists, we have a long list of business today, though most of it is to be taken without debate. No. 6 is Committee and Remaining Stages of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill, 2000, and No. 8, Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 2000, is emergency legislation, as the House knows, which was taken in the Dáil yesterday. No. 7 is the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill, 2000, Second Stage. In light of the requests made this morning, I propose to take statements on lobbyists from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and I look forward to contributions of Senators on this matter. I will be proposing an amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning asked about reform of the libel laws and I understand that a Bill dealing with this is to be published in late 2000. Senator Quinn pointed out that the Independents have no Member on the all-party committee, but the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has addressed this through the good offices of the Cathaoirleach and we will add our weight to ensure the matter is addressed. Senator O'Toole has been assured of this.</P>

      <P>There are two amendments to the Order of Business and I will deal with them in the order in which they were proposed. Senator Manning moved an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 5 be deleted. This amendment was not seconded in debate and consequently it falls. Senator Costello moved an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 22, motion 18, be <Col N="183" /> taken before No. 2. Is the amendment being pressed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Finneran)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related and may be discussed together by agreement. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole1 Mr. O'Toole1">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) the wilful, reckless or negligent infliction on a child of a fear of injury or failure to prevent such a fear, or failure to redress such a fear,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We all recognise that significant changes were made to the Bill as it went through the Dáil and most of those have significantly improved the legislation. I hope the Minister will be open to further amending the Bill today. I realise that demands are being made on the Minister to get this legislation through the House.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are reflective of the debate we held on the Statute of Limitations Bill. It concerned the threat of abuse. On that occasion I read into the record the sum of the elements that we were trying to address. I made the point that it is very hard to determine when abuse moves from being sexual abuse to physical abuse, or vice versa. It is important to recognise that it is not just a question of what is written there concerning the first determination of abuse. I am sure the Minister will be open to accepting this point. It, of course, means, as stated in section 1(1)(<i>a</i>), &ldquo;the wilful, reckless or negligent infliction of physical injury on, or failure to prevent such injury to, the child&rdquo;. That is definitely true and nobody could argue with that.</P>
      <P>What it must also deal with, however, is the case where the child has been frightened into agreeing to do something by threats or warnings that there will be a recurrence of a previous physical injury, abuse or misuse. That will also have to be dealt with if it is the case that a child has been afraid of something and, as stated in the amendment, there was a &ldquo;failure to prevent such a fear, or failure to redress such a fear&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In statements made by the victims in such situations, we have read about them becoming long-term bed-wetters. We do not need to wheel in a group of psychologists to tell us what that means. It is a fundamental internal response to fear of a threat of some description. It concerns a worry about tomorrow and that is the issue I am trying to address in this amendment. I do not want to rehearse the kind of debate we have already had. I ask the Minister to open his mind to this matter and to recognise that it is not simply about the &ldquo;the wilful, reckless or negligent infliction of physical injury&rdquo;, it is also about the threat of such <Col N="189" /><Col N="190" /> an injury. The Minister should keep that particular issue in mind.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 seeks to insert the words &ldquo;pain, distress or&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo;. I cannot imagine that the Minister will have any difficulty in accepting that. If the amendment was agreed to, section 1(1)(<i>a</i>) would read: &ldquo;the wilful, reckless or negligent infliction of pain, distress or physical injury on, or failure to prevent such injury to, the child&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In a sense the word &ldquo;distress&rdquo; would cover much of what I have been trying to deal with in amendment No. 1. I ask the Minister to look openly at both amendments. He will recognise that they do not create any offence to the integrity of the interpretation of the word &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; as it is outlined. It simply expands it slightly. It is completely within the spirit of the Bill and certainly should be in line with the contextual outline of the Bill, which the Minister provided on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not until I saw Senator O'Toole's amendment that I was reminded of the psychological damage of fear and distress. Every time one reads about a suicide, one thinks, &ldquo;If only somebody could have put their mind at rest.&rdquo;  It is usually a question of putting the mind at rest from a fear of psychological rather than physical damage. In that respect, Senator O'Toole's helpful amendment will add to the Bill and I urge the Minister to give due consideration to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Underlying all the horror of physical abuse, the thing that victims of such abuse talk about most is the continuous, 24-hour a day fear. That is what still haunts them and causes them greatest pain. The fact that people were frightened and bullied is what created the silence that lasted for so long. While it is not unique to this country, all of us who went through the primary and secondary school system over the last 40 or 50 years can cite chapter and verse about fear. This is so, even for people who, fortunately, were never physically abused but who knew full well the degree of terror that people could induce in others. I recall that in one class I was not able to write my own name because I was so frightened of the teacher. Consequently, it would be wrong to omit some reference to that sort of malicious threat of the possibility of violence.</P>
      <P>The commission uses language like &ldquo;emotional abuse&rdquo; which is as much a part of child abuse as the physical or sexual kind. It is also a part of the victims' need to tell their stories and be recognised, however late it might be. The Minister should give serious consideration to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by Members with regard to the effect that fear of injury can have on the mental health of people because of pressure they may have been subjected to at school. My understanding, <Col N="191" /> however, is that this matter is covered in the Bill. It has been well taken care of in the legislation and it will be a matter for the commission to address the issues that come before it. Perhaps the Minister could cover that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the concerns of Senators in this regard. I wish to assure them that pain, suffering and mental distress are covered fully in the Bill. As regards the point made by Senator Ryan, the commission will have to decide on that issue. The Senator said that all of us suffered fear at school at some time or other and I know that is true. However, we are not investigating that matter at this stage. We are investigating cases of serious physical and mental abuse, both of which are covered in the Bill. We are talking about whatever the commission regards as being serious and we will give it <i>carte blanche</i> on that matter. It is open to the commission to decide upon that and I have no doubt it will. To date, the commission has shown itself to be highly effective in the work it has done on a non-statutory basis.</P>
      <P>In preparing the Bill I was conscious of the need to provide a wide definition to cover physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect, as recommended by the commission in its report on its terms of reference. The approach we are taking is absolutely in line with what the commission asked us to do. The commission has studied the area, has worked on it and has put forward recommendations for legislation to establish it on a statutory basis, as it was asked to do. It is anxious to get on with the work and is ready to proceed.</P>
      <P>The commission wanted the broadest possible terms of reference which would be all inclusive. One of the dangers is that if we begin to break it down and mention one thing or another in particular, it could put a different aspect on a position to a greater or lesser extent. Essentially, therefore, we have left it open to the commission and we have covered all the aspects. It is important not to confuse this with matters going on in other fora such as the Statute of Limitations and the questions of sexual versus physical abuse. It has powers now to examine the issue of physical as well as sexual and mental abuse and has, in effect, a very wide brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be careful about extending the definition to such an extent that we sow seeds of doubt and confusion relating to the powers of the commission. This is likely to arise if we try to particularise any and every type of suffering inflicted on children. It would be almost impossible to avoid missing some form of abuse and it would be entirely impractical to list all those of which we could think. Of course the infliction of fear or injury on a child or failure to prevent or redress such fear is not acceptable. That can be very serious and it is open to the commission to decide on that issue. In so far as these abuses occurred, they are included either within the definition of <Col N="192" /> physical abuse or in paragraphs <i>(c)</i> and <i>(d)</i> of subsection (1). It is a matter for the commission, as I said, to decide. It will have advisers.</P>
    <P>These are the main points relating to this issue. The Senators need not be concerned about that. I understand Senator O'Toole's point in highlighting this issue but I assure him it is covered. It is put this way because the commission asked us to give it the widest possible brief which is why it is left in those wide terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about one aspect. I listened carefully to what the Minister said and I see the logic in much of what he is saying, but if I were to boil my two amendments down to one term, that would be the term &ldquo;distress&rdquo; or &ldquo;physical injury&rdquo;. It does not deal with that aspect of it. At least I cannot see it. I do not see that it is dealt with in paragraphs <i>(c)</i> or <i>(d)</i> of subsection (1) unless I am missing the point.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to put in the term &ldquo;distress&rdquo;. I have in the second amendment suggested the paragraph should read, &ldquo;the wilful, reckless or negligent infliction of distress or physical injury&rdquo;. In the context of what the Minister has said, that would meet my needs. I ask the Minister to explain again why the term &ldquo;distress&rdquo; could not be put in there and this question of the threat hanging over a child and the child suffering because of the fear of threatened abuse or punishment, whether it be sexual or physical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Distress is a mental disturbance or upset which is covered in the widest terms. If we start to break it down and parse it, we will get into legal difficulties ultimately. The purpose was to leave the terms as the commission requested on a broad basis but to make sure, and here there is a difference from other fora, that one is covering physical, sexual and mental distress and failure to care and other aspects. It is a very broad brush for the commission who will decide where these were serious or totally incidental or were not in effect serious. That is what we are trying to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's assurances that all I am seeking to have written in words can in fact be dealt with and he has said that. That is important. I am not fully convinced but I have to take his good offices on that. He tells me that these issues can be dealt with and I accept that it states physical, sexual and mental abuse. Therefore, he is saying that the mental abuse would cover issues such as threats and the fear of such. I accept his good offices on that, on which basis I will not press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody disputes the Minister's goodwill on this issue any more than they do their own, but I am a little concerned that there is an assumption that mental health covers emotional <Col N="193" /> distress. I am not sure that every doctor would agree. Perhaps this is because I am married to a psychiatrist. I am not persuaded by this assumption and this could end up in the High Court involving situations where people suffered profound emotional distress.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the commission used the phrase &ldquo;emotional abuse&rdquo; in terms of the definition of abuse in its report on the terms of reference. The term &ldquo;emotional abuse&rdquo; is missing whereas the terms &ldquo;physical abuse&rdquo; and &ldquo;sexual abuse&rdquo; are there. The term &ldquo;emotional abuse&rdquo; is left out, though I am sure there is much advice from the Attorney General about why it could not put in the term &ldquo;emotional abuse&rdquo;. I am not persuaded that emotional and mental mean the same thing, nor are they dealt with by the same branches of the medical profession. Mental health is generally dealt with by psychiatrists but many of these emotional problems will be dealt with by counsellors, therapists and other kinds of professionals.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to keep the House here indefinitely and I accept that the Minister is endeavouring to do what we all want done, but I am still not entirely convinced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the issue which I endeavoured to raise by way of an amendment. The point has been made in submissions, which everybody including the Minister has received, that the definition of 18 as the age of majority is quite recent. The age of majority 60 years ago when the current official terms of reference of this commission begin, and they can go back further, would have been 21. My concern is that a 19 year old in the 1940s would have had an attitude to authority which would be more like that of a 14 or 13 year old today. It is quite conceivable that a 19 year old could have been a victim of abuse in the period with a different system of authority than most of us cannot imagine now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that the commission recommended 18 but I know some of the victims of abuse have stories of people over 18 who were still in institutions being cared for and who did not have the <Col N="194" /> legal status of an adult say 40 years ago. I am also intrigued as to why changing 18 to 21 would impose a charge on the Revenue. That is not for me to argue about here but I can normally follow these matters. The reason why changing from 18 to 21 would impose a charge on the Revenue is a total mystery to me. I am not questioning the Cathaoirleach's ruling, I am simply recording my confusion.</P>

      <P>The Senator will be aware that the commission, in considering the terms of reference, recommended that 18 be the cut-off age. That was its proposal in the first instance. I am aware that prior to 1985 children did not reach the legal majority until they were 21. However, few if any young people remained in institutions such as reformatories, industrial schools or regular schools even before 1985.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I propose the Bill be left unamended and that the commission consider issues surrounding the abuse of children and young people up to the age of 18. While the legal definitions of a child have their place, they are ultimately somewhat artificial legal creations. I feel that the commission is concerned with children and young people who were at a particularly vulnerable age when abused. The commission considered the position and has opted for a cut-off of 18. I suggest this is a reasonable position. The Government accepted the report <i>in toto</i> and did not interfere with it in any way but took it as the commission recommended.</P>

      <P>I am assured, though I cannot find it, that the question of fostered children is covered by the Bill. I find it difficult to figure out how that issue is covered, but from what was done in the Dáil others have accepted it is covered. There was a genuine concern which everyone shared that children in institutions were fostered out and seriously abused. I have read the Bill and its definitions carefully, but I am still not clear how it extends the law to children who were fostered out, often for long periods, from insti<Col N="195" /> tutions. The Bill largely refers to children in institutions and there is a concern that children who went into institutions were sent to foster homes where they were abused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Those cases of children being sent out for fostering from institutions are covered. Section 1(2) states:</P>
      <P>References in this Act to abuse of children in institutions or which occurred in institutions include references to any case in which abuse of a child took place not in an institution, but while the child was residing or being cared for in, or attending, an institution and the abuse was committed or aided, abetted, counselled or procured by, or otherwise contributed to by an act or omission of, a person engaged in the management, administration, operation, supervision or regulation of the institution . . .</P>
      <P>The child would be under the care of the institution if he or she were fostered out from the institution for a short or long term or for work. That was amended in the Dáil to make it clearer that such cases were covered.</P>

If that stated, &ldquo;cared for by the institution&rdquo;, I could accept there is no ambiguity.

      <P>Section 3(4) states that the when the Minister is satisfied, after consultation with the chairperson, that the commission and the committees have completed the performance of their functions, he or she may by order dissolve the commission and the committees. The point was made to me that there should be no dissolution of the commission as it is a body corporate with perpetual succession and should therefore always exist on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what the precedent is for this and whether it is normal to include a provision, when setting up a commission, that that commission may be dissolved when its work is done, but this should be taken into account. This may be the normal language which is always used, but perhaps there is an explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that, once set up, the commission will be totally independent of the Government and will operate on its own under the terms of the statute. It will make an independent report at the end of the day, but that will not be a report to Government. It will be a report to the people &ndash; the independence is carried that far. An independent group will often report back to the Government when it completes its work, but in this case it will report to the people and presumably the Government will get a copy at the same time. This will be a report from the commission to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once it is set up the commission will have access to all the records required. Essentially, we <Col N="197" /> are giving it the powers of a court to carry out such an inquiry. During the Dáil debate on the Bill there was a suggestion that we include a requirement for an interim report. I was reluctant to interfere in any way with the commission in that regard but having discussed it, it was suggested there would be an interim report after six months. I finally agreed to an interim report at the end of one year, which I thought was reasonable because by that time the commission should be in a position to make an interim report. However, the commission may want to make an interim report after three, six or nine months, which is a matter for the commission itself. That is the only stricture. The Bill provides that if the commission wants to go beyond two years, it can apply for an extension.</P>
    <P>Once the Minister is satisfied the commission has completed its work, he or she may order its dissolution, but this will not be done without consulting the chairperson. A Committee Stage amendment in the Dáil also provided for parliamentary oversight in that area.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), line 45, after &ldquo;have&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These three amendments are similar. Amendment No. 4 proposes to insert &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; in order that section 4 (1)(<i>a</i>) would reads &ldquo;to provide, for persons who have allegedly suffered abuse&rdquo;. Amendment No. 7 proposes to insert &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; in section 4(6)(<i>a</i>). Amendment No. 18 proposes to insert &ldquo;ALLEGATIONS OF&rdquo; in the Title and it would read &ldquo;TO INQUIRE INTO ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD ABUSE&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for these amendments is simple and does not require a long argument. They are intended to prevent the commission having to establish there was actual child abuse before it investigates it. I want to ensure the commission can act on the basis of reports, affidavits or statements made by people without having to obtain evidence to prove the abuse, legally or otherwise. <Col N="198" /> There is a gap there about which I and others are concerned.</P>
    <P>If one does not include the word &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo;, abuse will have to proved before it is investigated. In most cases allegations of abuse are being made. On that basis, &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; should be included in the Bill in order that the work of the commission is not impeded in any way. It is an impossible burden on victims if they must prove what has happened to them before it is investigated. These amendments are clearly in line with the spirit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Other groups are concerned about this issue. The Catholic and Primary School Managers Association, which has welcomed the establishment of this commission, shares my concern that if we do not include &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; and &ldquo;allegations&rdquo;, the burden of proof is on the victims. This seems to me to put the cart before the horse.</P>

      <P>The Commission will have three primary functions. Firstly, to provide for people who suffered abuse in childhood in institutions a forum in which they can tell of that abuse. Secondly, to inquire into allegations of abuse and to determine its nature . . . </P>
      <P>It does not appear that this is covered in this section of the Bill. Perhaps it is covered elsewhere in the Bill but Senator O'Toole's amendment proposing that the Bill would read &ldquo;to provide, for persons who have allegedly suffered abuse&rdquo; seems to be in line with the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must register my dissent. I would be reluctant to tell people that they are talking about an alleged abuse. People know if they were abused. The allegations are made about other people, not about the abuse. Naming an individual as an abuser is an allegation but it is not correct to imply to someone who goes to a commission to describe their recollection of what happened to them as a child that it was an alleged abuse, when they are clear in their heads that it occurred.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator O'Toole's concern. It is correct to use the word &ldquo;allegation&rdquo; about someone accused of perpetrating abuse but to include it before the description of the stories of people who have suffered so much suggests to a degree that perhaps it is fantasy. I know that is not what Senator O'Toole intends. There may be another word which I cannot think of which could apply. However, to propose the wording &ldquo;to provide, for persons who have allegedly suffered abuse&rdquo; moves us backwards to a time when everyone spoke about people who had allegedly suffered abuse. I am not in favour of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan has highlighted an important aspect of the amendments. They <Col N="199" /> present some difficulty. On the one hand, it is true to say that accounts of abuse are allegations of abuse until they are proven. The commission will work through two committees, a confidential one where people will tell their stories and an investigative one which will investigate, in detail, the allegations of abuse. The amendments attempt to deal with that issue, that they are allegations until they are proven. However, we are concerned with the functions of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse &ndash; it is not the commission to inquire into alleged child abuse. This is the point highlighted by Senator Ryan. It is well established that there was abuse. We have some 40,000 files ready for the commission, detailing serious physical, sexual and mental abuse, which must be treated as such.</P>
      <P>I understand the unease of Senators about allegations but there are strong protections for those against whom allegations are made. The Bill provides strong protections, including natural justice and legal representation. Others have complained the protections we are providing are too strong but that is as it should be. The commission will be well able to deal with this.</P>
      <P>We know that child abuse occurred and the criminal courts are establishing this with horrifying regularity. This commission was set up to inquire into what we know occurred. We do not as yet know the extent, the circumstances or the causes of the abuse. The commission will give people who have suffered abuse an opportunity to speak about it, as that can have a therapeutic effect. While false accounts may be given to the commission, overwhelmingly the accounts given by people who were abused will be true. If a person gives a false account, protections are built into the legislation to ensure the rights of those accused will be duly protected under the normal procedures.</P>
      <P>For decades these people have been marginalised and their accounts, if listened to at all, were dismissed. It would be a mistake if the Bill explicitly reflected the view that people claiming to have been abused are mistaken or, worse still, lying. The commission ultimately will decide on the truth or otherwise of any account. Most of the proceedings of the commission relating to such personal issues will be held in private. The commission will publish a report in which it will name the institutions and abusers where the commission establishes abuse has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the perspective of people who are concerned that they will be accused, they will read the Bill as an implicit statement that all accounts of abuse will be believed. That view is taken in complete disregard of the substantial inquiry process built into the Bill and the unimpeachable constitutional rights such people have to due process and natural justice. I understand that such people may be upset at the implication, but I ask the House who is the stronger party, a former <Col N="200" /> resident of an institution who is claiming abuse as a child or his or her alleged abuser or the employer of that person?</P>
    <P>On balance, it would be a mistake to insert words which from a legal standpoint are not necessary, but which would be hurtful to people who are already vulnerable. It would be a mistake to insert the words proposed in amendment No. 18 in the Title.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the points made by Senator Ryan and the Minister. I accept the validity of many of the arguments. I accept they understand that the words I propose to insert are not meant to diminish the seriousness of this issue or to revert to the thinking, &ldquo;Let us not believe the victim&rdquo;, which unfortunately informed much of what we did here for decades.</P>
      <P>Another reason the word &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;ALLEGATIONS OF&rdquo; should be included is that it might be possible for a person to stop a process on the basis that if a person said he or she suffered abuse at the hands of another person, the named person could attempt to get an injunction to prevent the commission doing its work on the basis that such abuse was not proven but merely an allegation. That is the issue my amendments seek to address, but I accept the Minister's argument on who is the stronger party and that the balance should lie with the victim, provided that due process and constitutional rights are respected.</P>
      <P>The arguments the Minister and Senator Ryan made apply in particular to the amendments Nos. 4 and 7, but not to amendment No. 18. Amendment No. 18 is to the Title. The Long Title states &ldquo;. . .  AS AN COIMISIÚN CHUN DROCHÚSÁID LEANAÍ A FHIOSRÚ . . . &rdquo;. That is a clear statement of fact that the commission will investigate child abuse. That is not making a value judgment about victims along the lines Senator Ryan mentioned. The Title also states &ldquo;. . .  IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, THE COMMISSION TO INQUIRE INTO CHILD ABUSE, TO INVESTIGATE CHILD ABUSE IN INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE, TO ENABLE PERSONS WHO HAVE SUFFERED SUCH ABUSE TO GIVE EVIDENCE . . . &rdquo;. The victims are covered by that last clause without the qualitative use of the word &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; in the context of which Senator Ryan expressed reservations. If the Minister conceded to my amendment, the wording of the Long Title would read &ldquo;. . .  TO INQUIRE INTO ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD ABUSE . . . &rdquo;. That does not make a value judged about the person because the Title goes on to state that the commission will investigate child abuse and enable persons who have suffered such abuse to give evidence. Those clauses cover the aspects mentioned by the Minister and Senator Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of the Title gives the commission authority to investigate allegations. It deals with <Col N="201" /> allegations, child abuse and enables persons who have suffered such abuse to give evidence. That surely meets all the needs in this area and all the arguments, including the point made by Senator Ryan. On that basis I will withdraw amendments Nos. 4 and 7, but I ask the Minister to reconsider amendment No. 18 which proposes the inclusion of the words &ldquo;ALLEGATIONS OF&rdquo; in the Long Title.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great difficulty in this regard because this area is so painful, horrible and apparently extensive that one is inclined to forget that on some occasions in other countries it transpired that allegations made against people were untrue. That does not take from the fact that there was wholesale abuse of children in institutions. The problem with accepting amendment No. 18 is that the Long Title would include the words &ldquo;TO INQUIRE INTO ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD ABUSE&rdquo;, which would imply that the commission would not investigate situations where child abuse has been proven.</P>

      <P>I must be more careful about the way I say that word. There is no allegation intended in what I said. The Senator is proposing after the word &ldquo;INTO&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;ALLEGATIONS OF&rdquo;. The same argument applies to this amendment as applies to the other amendments. I am advised legally that the Senator need have no fear about what is being done in this regard. Everyone concerned accepted that the non-statutory body was the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and there has been no problem with that title. As the commission is <Col N="202" /> being established on a statutory basis, it is preferable that it should retain that title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of natural law and making sure that nobody is in a position of being considered guilty until they prove themselves innocent, and not just the other way around, nobody should be found guilty by accusation. A function of the commission is to assess whether and to what extent child abuse has occurred in the various institutions which come under the remit of the commission and then to determine how best to deal with the matter. The proposed legislation seems to indicate that findings that abuse occurred have already been made on the basis of unsubstantiated evidence. To ensure due process, it is imperative that findings should result from an evaluation of the evidence. It should be noted that if only those who have suffered abuse may recount their experiences, before such evidence is heard the committee must be satisfied that the abuse occurred.</P>
      <P>That brings us back to the point of being innocent until proven guilty. I understand exactly the point Senator Ryan and the Minister have made, that there has been such an horrific series of complaints &ndash; the Minister said there were about 40,000 files &ndash; but I would hate to think that anybody was accused and automatically found guilty on the basis of accusation only. We should be very careful to make sure that the innocent are protected. I want my mind to be put at rest on this issue and I believe Senator O'Toole's proposal of the word &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; would go a long way towards addressing the matter in that we would not assume that an accusation automatically implied guilt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn wants to ensure that the innocent are protected. That is a constitutional requirement and it underpins everything in the Bill. In terms of the handling of these cases, due process must apply. The rights of the individuals must be respected and the individuals will be given legal assistance to ensure that happens. From that point of view the Bill is quite generous in ensuring that the constitutional position is observed.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the 40,000 files but that does not necessarily mean 40,000 people were abused. A number of allegations are made every week &ndash; approximately 15 &ndash; but they are being provided to the independent tribunal which will investigate them. I want to make it clear that that does not mean there are 40,000 cases about which allegations have been made, because there are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here about the title of the commission. What we have been doing up to now is investigating the cases of abuse and I believe in that sense that the title is correct. It is the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. That is what <Col N="203" /> is has been up to this time and that is the reason for the commission, to inquire into child abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>To conclude on this matter I want to refer, in reverse order, to what is stated in the Long Title. I have noted the point the Minister just made, that allegations can be investigated. It is good to hear that but I cannot see how it arises out of the Bill. The Bill will enable persons who have suffered such abuse to give evidence to committees of the commission. That is a straightforward fact. It also states that it will investigate child abuse in institutions in the State. There is no doubt about that. It also states that it will inquire into allegations of child abuse. That means the commission will inquire into allegations of child abuse, and will enable persons who have suffered such abuse to give evidence, among other things. It does not prevent anything happening. It makes it quite clear that allegations can be investigated.</P>
      <P>I will not push this amendment to a vote. The Minister has said that the Bill allows the commission to investigate allegations. That was the purpose of my proposal in the first place. I am not convinced that somebody could not stop an investigation on the basis that it was an unproven allegation. If the word &ldquo;allegations&rdquo; were included, it would strengthen the power of the commission. The Minister has told us that allegations can be investigated and that that is the view of the Attorney General. If the Attorney General, the chief law officer of the land, tells me that allegations of child abuse can be investigated under the terms of the Bill, I will not press my amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 6, subsection (1)(b)(iii)(II), line 13, after &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the role of the State or any of its organs (including the <Col N="204" /> Minister, his or her Department and the courts)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a substantial issue and one which we cannot avoid. I want to read into the record of the House the particular rule of national schools which was in operation prior to 1982. Rule 130 states:</P>
    <P>
      <i>130.(1)Teachers should have a lively regard for the improvement and general welfare of their pupils, treat them with kindness combined with firmness and should aim at governing them through their affections and reason and not by harshness or severity. Ridicule, sarcasm or remarks likely to undermine a pupil's self-confidence should be avoided.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>(2)Corporal punishment should be administered only in cases of serious misbehaviour and should not be administered for mere failure at lessons.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>(3)Corporal punishment should be administered only by the principal teacher or other member of the school staff authorised by the manager for the purpose.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>(4)Any teacher who inflicts improper or excess punishment will be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and will be subject to severe disciplinary action.</i> [I have made that point regularly in the House.]</P>
    <P>That rule will govern many of the inquiries. It is a rule that came from the Department of Education and it affected the way members of my union, for instance, would have operated. That was the code of discipline at the time which allowed for corporal punishment to take place and it obviously informed judgments in a variety of ways. The management groups in schools and teachers themselves would be of the view that this rule is something which cannot be left out of the reckoning in any consideration.</P>
    <P>What I propose, therefore, is that on page 6, after &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and the role of the State or any of its organs (including the Minister, his or her Department and the courts)&rdquo;. I do not put this forward as a way of having a go at the Minister's Department or members of that Department. This is about ensuring that the decisions taken by the Department, in the rules it put in place and in the way it investigated any allegations made at that time, are examined.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 proposes that the term &ldquo;including the State and its Agencies&rdquo; be inserted after section 4(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii)(lll) which refers to &ldquo;the manner in which those functions were performed by the persons or bodies in whom they were vested&rdquo;. The State cannot distance itself from those &ndash; institutions, individuals etc. &ndash; to whom it devolved responsibility. In many cases of physical abuse, victims often state that they were dealt with by a number of people and that certain individuals had used corporal punishment, which was <Col N="205" /> part of schools' codes of discipline during the period in question, but that they never felt abused by said individuals. On the other hand, however, they felt they were abused by others.</P>
    <P>Those who operated within the rules and who did not abuse people should be in a position to believe that a distinction is being made. As stated earlier, we are discussing misuse and abuse as opposed to use. It is a fine distinction but as I have indicated on many occasions, the rule under which people were working was clear, namely, that anyone who inflicted improper or excessive punishment would be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher. The question then arises regarding what action was taken if the Department, its agents or its inspectors became aware of improper or excessive punishment during the period to which I refer. This matter must be considered in that context because there is no other way to proceed.</P>
    <P>If the approach I advocate is adopted, matters will be laid bare and the Minister's Department will not be in a position to exclude itself, in any way, from this investigation. I accept that the decisions to which I refer were taken in the past and that these must be considered in the context of the period in which they were taken. As the Minister is aware, the rule that I read into the record earlier is no longer in operation but it was in place until 1982. We must ensure that the matters to which I refer can be taken into consideration. We cannot be left with a situation where investigations literally stop with the institutions involved and where the Department is allowed to distance itself from the actions of those institutions. It must be remembered that all authority devolved from the Department in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Senator O'Toole's concerns in respect of this area. The Senator is seeking to ensure that the organs of the State &ndash; the Departments, the institutions and anyone who was involved in the supervision of those institutions &ndash; are properly included in this investigation. Hence, the wide terms used to define &ldquo;child abuse&rdquo; in the Title to the Bill.</P>
      <P>The matters to which the Senator refers were covered in the Bill, as initially drafted, in the provisions which deal with the supervision and regulation of institutions. However, during the debate in the Dáil I stated that we would elaborate on the definition provided in the Bill. I will now outline what has been done in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In proposing a commission to inquire into child abuse and in publishing this Bill, it was always the express intention of the Government that the investigative remit of the commission would extend to public bodies and this intention was included in the original definition. Some concern was expressed in the Lower House that this was not clear and an amendment was made which inserted subsection (3) into section 1. I am satis<Col N="206" /> fied that the matter has now been placed beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides, in effect, a definition for systems of management, as referred to in sections 4 and 12 of the Bill, and states specifically that these include Departments and other public bodies. The subsection states:</P>
    <P>References in this Act to the management, administration, operation, supervision and regulation of institutions include references to such management, administration, operation, supervision or regulation effected, supervised, funded or regulated, in whole or in part, by a Department of State, a vocational education committee established by the Vocational Education Act, 1930, a health board, a local authority for the purposes of the Local Government Act, 1941, or any other public body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reading from section 1(3). The amendment introduced in the Lower House was intended to make the section even more explicit. We were advised by the draftsman that this was not necessary because the issue in question was already covered.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific reference in the Senator's amendment to the courts, I am legally advised that it is constitutionally unacceptable that the commission should seek to review the decisions of courts in individual cases. I am satisfied, however, that the commission can consider the general system which led to the placing of children in care during the period covered by the terms of reference. The Bill, as amended by the Dáil, adequately meets the concerns underlying amendments Nos. 5 and 6.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's comprehensive reply and I accept some of the points he made. I accept those points in as much as they refer to section 4(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii)(ll) which refers &ldquo;the systems of management, administration, operation, supervision, inspection and regulation of such institutions&rdquo;. As the Minister indicated, section 1(3) states:</P>
      <P>References in this Act to the management, administration, operation, supervision and regulation of institutions include references to such management, administration, operation, supervision or regulation effected, supervised, funded or regulated, in whole or in part, by a Department of State.</P>
      <P>I accept that this covers the matters I set out to deal with in amendment No. 5. By virtue of the fact that words used in section 4(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii)(ll) are explained in section 1(3), I will, with the leave of the House, withdraw amendment No. 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 is a completely different kettle of fish and deals with section <Col N="207" /> 4(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii)(lll) which reads &ldquo;the manner in which those functions were performed by the persons or bodies in whom they were vested&rdquo;. A vesting of responsibility means that responsibility is transferred to somebody else. That does not, therefore, refer back to the Department involved. The Department has an inspectorate which had the responsibility and authority to do certain things but the provisions in section 4(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii)(lll) excludes the servants or officers of the Department because it focuses on the institutions themselves. As a result, the Department is distanced from the institutions.</P>
    <P>I am seeking to amend section 4(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii)(lll) to read &ldquo;the manner in which those functions were performed by the persons or bodies in whom they were vested including the State and its Agencies&rdquo;. That is extremely important because most of the vesting was done by the State or its agencies and they vested this authority in the institutions or those who owned or were responsible for operating them. The Minister should accept amendment No. 6.</P>

      <P>The functions to which section 4(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii)(lll) refers which could have &ldquo;contributed to the occurrence or incidence of such abuse&rdquo; include those outlined in section 4(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii)(ll), namely, &ldquo;the systems of management, administration, operation, supervision, inspection and regulation of such institutions&rdquo;. The definition covers what institutions they are and what the supervision was about. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

That is clear but it excludes the State and its agencies, unless it is found that it was something vested in the State and its agencies. However, that is not what happened. The vesting procedure is a clear legal function; it is a legally recognised device where authority and things such as ownership and responsibility are vested in a particular group or structure of management. I cannot see how it refers back to page 5.</P>

      <P>I am a little confused &ndash; it could be my fault &ndash; about paragraph (3)(<i>d</i>) which states that the report &ldquo;shall not contain findings in relation to particular instances of alleged abuse of children&rdquo;. How can that be reconciled with paragraph (a) which provides that the report can contain findings to that effect &ldquo;and may identify the institution and the persons who committed the abuse&rdquo;?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It essentially provides that the findings could name the institution and the abuser but not the person who was abused. One can say that a person or persons were abused but not give findings in relation to the instances of alleged abuse of children. In other words, if the incidences involving Pat Smith, Joe Ryan, Paddy Woods or whoever are being taken further, they will go either to the tribunal or the courts. However, the person who was abused would not be named in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something of concern on which the Minister might be able to put my mind at rest. The amendment which I had hoped to put down arises from the amendments to interpretations and from a desire to avoid the possibility of a constitutional challenge to the legislation. It relates to subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) which states: &ldquo;to alleviate or otherwise address the effects of the abuse referred to in <i>section 4</i> on those who suffered it. . . &rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The balance between the work of the confidential committee and that of the investigative committee would be compromised if uncorroborated evidence were to be referred to in the commission's report. The provisions of the Bill in section 10(6) would be breached. It states that a person may not be a member of both committees. Those giving evidence to the confidential committee cannot be cross-examined. There would, therefore, be great danger of contamination between corroborated evidence and unsubstantiated and untested evidence coming forward into the commission's report. The amendment I had hoped to put down suggested that instead of section 4, it should read section 4(1)(b) only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contamination that could occur with regard to the two committees could give rise to a constitutional challenge. It is suggested that section 5(2)(b) which reads &ldquo;to alleviate or other<Col N="209" /> wise address the effects of the abuse referred to in section 4 on those who suffered it&rdquo; should read &ldquo;to alleviate or otherwise address the effects of the abuse referred to in section 4(1)(b)&rdquo;. It would strengthen the Bill and ensure it is not open to constitutional challenge as a result of contamination between the two committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every confidence that the judge, in the first instance, would be conscious of how to handle such a situation. The confidential committee will not name any person or institution. It is a confidential committee. There will be a report to the commission from the confidential committee and the commission will decide how much of that report will be published. However, it will not name any institutions or people.</P>
      <P>With regard to contamination, there are explicit measures in the Bill to keep the two committees separate. As a result, the overall report of the commission will not necessarily be just the two reports from the committees. The commission will make its own report based on the evidence and information coming from the two separate committees. Obviously, the information from the confidential committee would be more limited. Its function is mainly healing. However, if somebody attending the confidential committee wishes to make specific allegations and have them investigated, they must go to the investigation committee and start from stage one with their allegation. In other words, it is a fresh process.</P>
      <P>Specific measures have been taken to keep the two separate. Ultimately, the judge will decide what will be published in the report, including what information should be included from the two committees and their reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 26 to 41, to delete subsections (2) and (3).</P>
      <P>There is a widely held view among many people who suffered abuse that it is inappropriate to have officials of the Department of Education and Science involved in staffing the commission. This is not meant to impugn the integrity of anyone working in that Department but it is a standard concern with all groups, including the Garda Complaints Board, that people who have an institutional link with a body which is the subject of the investigation should not be involved in the investigation. Senator O'Toole's amendment seeks to remove the two subsections which provide for secondment from either the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Health and Children. My amendment would have the same effect.</P>
      <P>This is of great concern and relates to my question on the independent function of the commission. Without implying even a scintilla of a lack of integrity on the part of individuals, in the eyes of victims the independent function of the commission will be compromised by the presence of people working for it who are staff of an institution, State body or public body which could be the subject of this investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other ways to deal with this issue. It is insensitive to suggest that staff of a Government Department which has, to put it mildly, a chequered record on this issue over the last 60 years should be involved. I do not think anyone can say it is fair and, unless the Minister can produce a compelling reason to show it is necessary, it should not be the case. This is quite baldly <Col N="212" /> stated and is a strange omission from an otherwise sensitively handled topic. This is a good attempt at an imaginative institutional response to people's pain.</P>
    <P>My former colleague, Pat Gallagher, pursued a case of child abuse in the midlands and did not find the Department of Education and Science open, transparent and helpful. It took considerable leverage and campaigning before he was allowed to see the Department's records. This was not out of concern for the children who had been abused, it was as a result of the institutional inclination to cover its own ass, if I may say so. That was the former Senator Gallagher's experience. This took place just a couple of years ago, therefore it is possible to envisage how it will seem if officials of the Minister's Department, who were engaged in making life as difficult as possible for people are now involved as staff of this commission. This is not right but it is still not too late to change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case made by Senator Ryan. This is not an attack on the officials in the Department, it is an attack on the record of the Department over a long period. I will not go into the historical facts of the matter but as far as the people who are affected by the Bill are concerned, the Department of Education and Science was one of the bodies which let them down over the years and in which they have very little trust.</P>
      <P>I know that the people who would be seconded would, certainly because of the publicity and debate that has surrounded this issue, bend over backwards to ensure that they are fair and impartial in everything they do. We are concerned here with sensitivities and perceptions with regard to what Senator Ryan has rightly called a very sensitive, good and comprehensive Bill. This point will stick in the craw of many of those who will be affected by it. In view of this I ask the Minister to reconsider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 provides for the appointment and secondment of members of staff to the commission. The secondment of any member of staff to the commission requires the consent of the commission, which may appoint its own staff, subject to the normal financial consents, which would be provided by the Department of Finance and, in this case, the Department of Education and Science. In addition, the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children may second members of staff to assist the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, theoretically, it may be said that there could be somebody in a Department who knows or is related to someone involved in this. It may also be the case that a Department may wish to, in the words of Senator Ryan, &ldquo;cover its ass&rdquo;. The case involving a communication from one secretary general of a Depart<Col N="213" /> ment to another, pointing out that if material was published it could be damaging, was publicised. That material was supplied by my Department to the commission. All the information has been and is being made available.</P>
    <P>The amendment has implications for the timescale in which the commission can begin its operations. The commission is running well and it has been very successful in what it has done, to the satisfaction of people on all sides. The people staffing it are the seconded staff. If we decide that seconded staff are not to be provided to the commission we will put an immediate and substantial break on its work. While that may be overcome in time, the commission does not want to break its proceedings. If it does, it can appoint its own staff. In view of this, the question does not arise because it is a matter for the commission. Regardless of who we say may be appointed, the commission will appoint the staff it considers to be appropriate. If it believes that members of staff are not co-operating, or whatever, it can, as an independent commission, let them go or, if seconded staff, send them back. It is necessary to consider the section as a whole. It gives the commission the power to appoint the staff it thinks will be most suitable for the job.</P>
    <P>There is concern about possible conflicts of interest because seconded staff belong to Departments which are under investigation. Such conflicts of interest do not arise. In the first instance, the staff concerned will be professional administrators and will be purely administrative staff. They will supply material and will not make decisions. Most of the material has now been supplied. All the files have been made open to the people, and their solicitors, who have allegations or concerns about abuse. Everything is open and transparent and that will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>The commission will continue to operate as it has done, except that it will now be statutorily independent in its operation. That is the main change here. It will also have the powers of a court, which it could not have without this statutory provision. Even in the case of inquiry officers appointed under section 23, these will do no more than record allegations, and the response to them, of persons against whom they are made. The documents will be given directly to the commission, which will then carry out the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The commission, or its legal representatives, will conduct the examination of witnesses. It will weigh up the evidence, reach conclusions and draft its report. It is inconceivable that members of the commission would allow themselves to be influenced in such matters by administrative staff.</P>
    <P>This issue is a matter for the commission. I have every confidence in it and in Ms Justice Laffoy, who has to date conducted this inquiry in an exemplary manner, and I have no doubt she will continue to do so. She wants us to get on with the job and I am anxious to facilitate the commission in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> Ultimately, it is for the commission to decide whether it wants to recruit its own staff or have seconded staff. It has worked so far with the seconded administrative staff. It will require a legal team, or whatever, to pursue the investigations. To date, the commission has been very satisfied with the staff working for it. They have done a very efficient and effective job.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the commission will be in a position to deal with any incident that could arise because this legislation will provide it with the power to select staff from wherever it wishes or to use seconded staff, as it has been doing to date. To change that would damage the work of the commission.</P>

It is important that the commission is made aware of the sensitivities, but I believe the Minister is right when he says we need to get on with this job and we should not delay it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Routine clauses should not be in legislation like this because this is the most non-routine Bill we could be dealing with. The clause was inserted because it is standard. Why does the Minister for Finance have to become involved in the staffing of the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That arises mainly because under the Constitution allocated funds are approved by the Minister for Finance. Anything paid for by the public purse must comply with this procedure. It is a standard clause and is part of everything the House does. The commission is under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science. Given this, both decide on what the commission does and how it expends moneys. Sanction would then be given to the commission. I have never heard of a commission that did not get the money it needed to do its work in this way. It is a routine procedure, but it is required because taxpayers' money is being spent and that is covered by constitutional provisions that apply to all Departments, especially the Department of Finance. It is a routine technicality.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the House but perhaps the Minister could tell me where in legislation Mr. Justice Flood is required to seek <Col N="215" /> the permission of the Minister for Finance to incur expenditure. I do not believe he is. I do not believe a tribunal of inquiry must seek the permission of the Minister for Finance to employ staff. I do not believe it is a universal application. This was probably included by mistake and should not be in the Bill. At most it should stipulate the Minister for Education and Science, and the Minister for Finance should have no say in the staffing of a commission of this nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not deal with the people involved. It is a routine provision. The Senator mentioned tribunals of inquiry and they come under the Attorney General's office, with finance provided by the Department of Finance through that agency. I can either research that for the Senator or he can inquire himself when justice legislation is being debated here. Either way, he will find that there must be accountability in every situation. There have been debates in this House about accountability on many occasions. It permeates all areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only reason the provision is included. The suggestion appears to be that there is some sinister reason why the provision has been included. There is none. We are dealing with a very sensitive and dangerous situation. We should not give ideas to people who do not understand the functioning, detail, intricacies and technicalities of the State, unless one is prepared to explain for hours how the State system works. That is the danger in this situation.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with people who have been seriously abused and hurt, as the Senator said. I have told him that, from the start, it was accepted by the other House and by the Opposition in the Seanad that we were setting up an independent commission to do the best job for those people. That is what we are doing. We are now going through the Bill line by line and discussing it in detail. This provision is a standard procedure in Bills and we will only confuse people if it is discussed in too much detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission is not confused. It has received what money it needs and is guaranteed any further funding it needs to do its job. Money must be disbursed through some agency. The commission is being established by the Bill which is the responsibility of my Department. Perhaps the Senator would like me to go away and to start again at square one with another Minister if it bothers him that I am bringing the Bill through the House. If he does not mind, then he should accept that the Department of Education and Science is responsible for the legislation and funding comes through that Department from the Department of Finance. In other cases the Senator raised, it may be the Attorney General <Col N="216" /> and the Department of Finance, and in others, it may be just the Department, such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. That is the way the system works. It does not create problems but it is a reflection of accountability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss because I liked neither the tone nor some of the content of what the Minister said. If I raise issues on legislation, I do it because they are serious. The issue of the staffing of the commission is one of considerable concern to many people. The one compelling argument the Minister makes is that the commission is happy to have seconded staff. However, the commission is not infallible, and many victims of abuse are less than happy with staff being seconded because some of them have had experiences of trying to get Departments to take their allegations or history seriously. Therefore, there is a sensitivity. I want to be sensitive and the Minister should be sensitive. However, it is not for me to decide whether amendment No. 8 is being pressed because it is in the name of Senator O'Toole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one flaw in the Minister's argument and that concerns the word &ldquo;such&rdquo;. I accept the point that public spending must be approved under the Ministers and Secretaries Act by the appropriate Minister and the Minister for Finance. The problem is the terminology where the Minister can decide about such and so many persons. That goes slightly against the run of the Minister's argument. I listened carefully to what he said, which was that the provision dealt with the spending of money, not with people. That was the basis of our concern. If the Minister gives a clear assurance on his honour that Ms Justice Laffoy is happy with this arrangement and that he will not interfere with the personnel the commission chooses to appoint, then I can do no more than accept that. The Minister is on record as having said it and, on that basis, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>However, I wish to be clear that I agree with Senator Ryan. I agree with the term &ldquo;so many persons&rdquo; as that is where spending is involved. It is the term &ldquo;such and so many&rdquo; which is the problem. The word &ldquo;such&rdquo; suggests approval is needed of the person employed and that is what bothered me in the first place. However, if the Minister states that the commission and Ms Justice Laffoy are happy with that arrangement and if he gives us an absolute commitment that he will not interfere with the determination of who will work for the commission, then I will withdraw the amendment and observe how the commission operates.</P>

Section 23(2)(<i>a</i>) states &ldquo;requesting the person at the option of the person to provide him or her with a statement in writing of the evidence that the person proposed to give to the investigating committee . . . &rdquo;  It seems that if a statement is required, it should be provided. The words &ldquo;at the option of the person&rdquo; could present a block to the committee's work. I do not want a situation to arise where the commission's work or the rights of the accused could be hindered in any way by the fact that a particular statement would <Col N="219" /> not be available.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of an inquiry officer under the Bill would be merely to sketch out the ground for the commission. The objective is that before the commission would hear evidence, it should have reasonable knowledge about what allegations could be made and how those would be responded to. This will limit the extent to which witnesses will have to undergo oral examinations and will also point the commission towards areas of inquiry which are likely to be most effective.</P>
      <P>The inquiry officer will not have power of compulsion over any witness; the process will be entirely voluntary. If a witness refuses to co-operate, the commission has a full array of powers to enable it to compel co-operation. In the context of voluntary co-operation with an inquiry officer, a witness may choose to provide a written statement or to provide an oral statement which will be written down. It should be borne in mind that many witnesses will, due to their backgrounds, have poor literacy skills. Overall, the intention of this provision is to assist such people.</P>

The fact that we have not pressed amendments this morning is a reflection of our belief that it is hugely important that the commission's work would get under way as soon as possible. The victims certainly want to see this happening. We have received assurances from the Minister and will hold him responsible for ensuring that those are met.

It states that where the High Court is satisfied that for the purposes of the exercise of its jurisdiction in relation to the commission or the investigation committee or on application to it in that behalf, it can require the disclosure of certain information where it believes the public interest would be met. Section 26(3) states: &ldquo;This section does not apply to information the disclosure of which, or the disclosure of which in certain circumstances is prohibited by, or in pursuance of, an act of an institution of the European Union.&rdquo;  Why is that provision included in the Bill?

      <P>Section 27 relates to the prohibition of the disclosure of information provided to the committee. Paragraph 9(6) of the commission's report on terms of reference requested that the legislation would expressly absolve the commission and its members, the inquiry officers and the staff of the commission from disclosing to the Garda Síochána or any other regulatory body any information obtained. This section clearly meets that request and includes the exceptions which the commission recommended in regard to the prevention of the continuation of ongoing offences. However, the commission also stated that to achieve this, the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, would require amendment. No reference is made in this Bill to the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act. Perhaps the Minister will explain why the commission's other recommendations are included in this section but why this specific recommendation in regard to the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act is not.</P>

None of this material should have become part of the archives. It should not have been covered by the 30 year rule as it is far too sensitive and personal.

      <P>Section 34(1), which is perfectly reasonable, states:</P>
      <P>A head may refuse to grant a request (including a request made before the passing of this Act) under section 7 of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (&ldquo;a request&rdquo;), if access to the record concerned could, in the opinion of the head, reasonably be expected to prejudice the effectiveness of the performance of its functions by the Commission or a Committee or the procedures or methods employed for such performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> While that is fair enough, I am concerned that the Freedom of Information Act does not make any provision for a second judgment at a later stage. If disclosure is refused, it is difficult to see how future provision can be made through the Freedom of Information Act, when the commission has finished its work. There is perfectly innocuous information, the disclosure of which might make it difficult for the commission to operate as efficiently as it should and which, therefore, could be delayed or withheld for reasons of looking after the efficiency of the commission. As this subsection is written, however, that information would be perpetually kept from being disclosed and I think that is a bad idea. The amendment seeks to make it clear that this exclusion of the Freedom of Information Act only applies for such length of time as the commission is working.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 34 is intended as a limited derogation from the Freedom of Information Act to the extent that access to records under the Act could prejudice the effectiveness of the performance by the commission of its functions or the methods or procedures employed by the commission. Obviously, once the commission has been dissolved there can be no question of access to records causing any prejudice whatsoever to its functions. The Senator is correct in saying that the derogation would fall once the commission has finished its work. After the dissolution of the commission the Freedom of Information Act will apply fully to the records of the commission, except for the records of the confidential committee as provided for in subsection (4). So the records of the confidential committee will be confidential <i>ad infinitum,</i> as was intended. The assurance sought is there.</P>

      <P>I draw the Senator's attention to section 7(6). This provides for the making of a record of the proceedings of the commission and its committees and for the disposal of their documents after dissolution. The issue of how to dispose of these records could be a difficult one depending on what they contain. I fully appreciate the Senator's concerns. On the other hand there has been strong criticism, repeated in the Lower House during the debate on the Bill, at the apparent absence of significant records relating to the Kennedy report. The requirements of history and students of our society require that the records be kept in a form which makes them appropriately accessible in time. I recommend to Senators that the detail be left to the commission, that we should trust in its good judgment and that this amendment be not made. The commission can make provisions in that regard.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for the detailed way in which they considered the Bill. I was glad to be able to give them assurances in relation to various sections. I thank you, Sir, and the staff of the House, as well as the officials who did all the work on the legislation They have put together excellent legislation which will do what we all wish by providing an independent commission to inquire into child abuse. I thank the commission and Ms Justice Laffoy for assisting us by preparing the reports and informing us of their wishes in relation to the statutory commission. They also consulted with us where necessary. I wish to thank everybody who has co-operated with my Department in this endeavour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This statutory commission will provide what is necessary for those people who have been <Col N="224" /> seriously abused. It will provide it to both the investigative section and the confidential listening committee. Once the Bill has been signed by the President and passed into law, I will proceed with urgency to sign the commencement order to put the legislation into practice.</P>
    <P>There are no hidden agendas of any sort. As the Taoiseach said on behalf of the people of Ireland, everyone is horrified at what has been discovered. We want to get to the bottom of it and see these issues being brought out and dealt with in a sensitive way. We want to see blame being placed where is should be, following a full and thorough investigation. In that sense, there are no holds barred. The legislation is totally in conformity with the Constitution and I look forward to the commission being in a position to get on with its work shortly.</P>

The legislation offers the hope of helping to heal some of the hurt. It is an imaginative institutional response. I suspect it is probably without precedent. The commission's report shows imagination and compassion, and that is the way in which we can learn to do better in the future. If we became a little tetchy, the Minister knows me long enough to know that these things do not last very long. It is good legislation.

    <Title>Order of Business. - Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace): This Bill has been introduced at short notice and I trust that the House will understand the good reason which prompted Government to take this approach. It is essential that we move quickly to address a legal doubt which has emerged relating to the powers of local authorities to make a charge for services which they are required or empowered to provide under current legislation. The basic objective of this short Bill is to put beyond doubt the commonly understood position regarding the powers currently available to local authorities to charge for services. Equally, it is designed to validate the making and recovery of any such charges made to date.</P>
    <P>The Bill is straightforward in underpinning what we all understood as the prevailing position &ndash; no new or additional powers are proposed relating to local authority charges. The prevailing position is grounded in the general provisions of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, which enables local authorities to levy charges in respect of services which they provide and is relied on where current legislation which requires or empowers the authorities to provide such services does not specifically address the question of charges.</P>
    <P>Doubt has arisen because of changes introduced under the Waste Management Act, 1996. In creating an up-to-date and comprehensive legislative framework for modern waste management, that Act repealed public health legislation dealing with waste and dating back to 1978 and 1907. At the time, it was clearly envisaged and understood that local authorities could and would continue to provide waste collection and disposal services and, accordingly, would continue to levy waste charges. However, because of the general <Col N="226" /> reliance on the 1983 financial provisions legislation, it was not considered necessary to make specific provision for charging in the 1996 Act. The responsibilities of local authorities for the collection of household waste are clearly set out in Part IV of the Waste Management Act. Subsequent to its enactment, the then Government referred in the December 1996 policy document Better Local Government to waste charges as, &ldquo;An important instrument in waste management policy&rdquo;, and stated that, &ldquo;The option must be retained to allow local authorities . . .  to delay . . .  costs through charges.&rdquo;  Use of economic instruments to address waste was also explicitly endorsed by Sustainable Development: A Strategy for Ireland, the Government policy on sustainable development, published in April 1997.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to waste charges remains clear-cut. In Changing our Ways, the October 1998 policy statement on waste management, we pointed out that by ensuring waste generators pay directly the full costs of waste collection, treatment and disposal, public attention can be focused on waste generation and an incentive provided towards waste reduction.</P>
    <P>For reasons of equity and to secure a direct reduction incentive, local authorities were encouraged to review their approach to charges with a view to introducing weight-related charging to the fullest extent possible. As I have already said, section 2 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, provides that where any existing enactment requires or enables a local authority to provide a service, but does not empower the authority to charge for that service, the enactment involved is deemed to empower the authority accordingly. An existing enactment is defined, under section 1 of the 1983 Act, in a manner which includes that enactment as amended or extended.</P>
    <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996, imposed provisions equivalent to those of the public health legislation, but updated them regarding local authority waste management functions. Accordingly, and taking account also of the provisions of section 20 of the Interpretation Act, 1937, dealing with the construction of references to repealed statutes and revoked instruments, it has been considered that local authorities are entitled to rely on the 1983 Act for the making of charges in respect of waste services, even though the relevant pre-1993 enactments were repealed.</P>
    <P>However, a view could be advanced which is contrary to this general understanding, which suggested that reliance on the 1983 Act to levy charges might be unsound, if the relevant subsequent legislation empowering or requiring the provision of a service does not explicitly purport to amend or replace pre-1983 legislation. This new Bill is intended to put this matter beyond doubt and validate relevant charges made to date.</P>
    <P>It must be appreciated that local authority charges, other than waste charges made under the <Col N="227" /> 1983 Act, may be affected. The Government, therefore, cannot allow uncertainty to prevail. The question may be asked why we are dealing with this matter by means of emergency legislation, when no apparent problem exists and no legal proceedings have been taken challenging the 1983 legislation on the matter in question.</P>
    <P>We are quite properly moving to address a legal doubt before any such legal proceedings are initiated, because of the potential implications for the revenue base of local authorities. Once a doubt arises over the validity of any charge levied by local authorities, there is the possibility that it could, in a broader sense, undermine the entire income local authorities have included in their estimates. Charges form a very important part of the income of local authorities. On the basis of the Estimates for 1999, it is estimated that charges for goods and services contributed £443 million to local authorities out of current expenditure of £1.6 billion. That is about 27% of their total income.</P>
    <P>Should a notion gain currency that any charge levied by a local authority is not founded in law, it could sow the seeds of uncertainty and doubt with regard to all charges and could, possibly, start a movement against the payment of all valid charges and payments which are critical to the local authorities. Such an outcome could undermine the financial position of local authorities and, therefore, their ability to provide necessary services to an acceptable standard. I am sure no Member would like to contemplate that scenario. Accordingly, it was important to act quickly.</P>
    <P>The substantive sections of this Bill are sections 2 to 4. Section 2 substitutes a revised definition for the definition of &ldquo;existing enactment&rdquo; in the 1983 Act. The effect of this is to ensure that an &ldquo;existing enactment&rdquo; will mean any enactment in force on, or at any time after, the commencement of the 1983 Act, up to the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 validates certain charges made by local authorities and provides that a relevant charge made by a local authority, by virtue of section 2 of the 1983 Act, is deemed to have been validly made and may be recovered as validly and effectively as if this Act had been in operation at the time of the making of the charge.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that this Act will not prejudice any proceedings that might have been initiated prior to the publication of the Bill in relation to the validity of a charge made by virtue of section 2 of the 1983 Act.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill does nothing more than to confirm the status quo as it is generally understood. We are neither extending nor changing in any way the current powers of local authorities to charge for services they provide under existing law, nor will this Bill make any provision which would enable local authorities to charge for services required or empowered to be provided under any future legislation. The Bill has no <Col N="228" /> effect in relation to any existing legislation which prohibits the imposition of charges for any local authority service. The sole intention behind this legislation is to provide legal certainty in regard to the powers of local authorities to rely on the Local Government (Financial Provisions)(No. 2) Act, 1983, to charge for services they provide.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary Bill. The speed with which it passed through the Dáil and with which it is intended to pass through the Seanad is extraordinary. It may not be the fastest Bill to clear both Houses, but it would be up there with other contenders for the Guinness Book of Records. I welcome the Minister of State, but I ask why he is here, as I found no validity for this legislation when studying the 1983 Act. It is a marvel the way his party has done an about face regarding that Act. I was in the Dáil when it was enacted and the then Opposition &ndash; the Minister of State's party &ndash; was very much against it. I am glad to see an about face and the possibility of change.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State spoke about doubts, possibilities and views that could be advanced, but he did not say that the 1983 Act was in doubt. Did someone challenge it? I asked colleagues and looked in the newspapers but I found no challenges to it. Where did the challenge come from? It would be wonderful to know on what basis it could be challenged and the Minister of State might tell us in detail why this change has been introduced when replying.</P>
      <P>We have missed the opportunity to examine the purpose of raising funds for local authorities through charges on waste. I have asked repeatedly for a debate on waste recycling, incineration, gasification and the other methods open to us to ensure the half ton of waste each individual in Ireland generates can be properly treated. I know the Government's aim is to increase the amount of recycled waste to 37%, with a long-term view to increasing that figure to 50%. However, we have only reached 4%, which indicates there is no genuine commitment from the Government to ensure that recycling takes its proper place as the best method for eliminating waste.</P>
      <P>It might be argued that if one takes a particular form of waste, such as paper or cardboard, market forces dictate whether there is any value in collecting and recycling it. However, the Government should think positively. If the market collapses or is reduced, there should be a Government input to ensure materials are collected and recycled. When profits are being made there is no need for such investment, but when profits are not being made the Government must intervene through a public-private partnership, perhaps, to ensure recycling works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we have had thus far is lip service to recycling. I have asked for a debate on this matter time and again and this was an ideal opportunity to debate waste management and its costs. We know there is a commitment to the polluter pay<Col N="229" /> ing, but what will that cost be? We should be able to give the public an idea at this stage of what they will be paying for and what will be expected of them in the future instead of having to see what it will cost every year and then announcing charges.</P>
    <P>I remember when charges were imposed. I remember trying to enter my local authority offices when there were hundreds of people outside. I became so good at dodging placards that I felt I could have been on any All-Ireland team. The people became very good at swinging placards also, as they got a lot of practice. They were protesting to local authorities all over the country against what they saw as a second form of taxation and in one case local authority workers in a van in the sunny southeast were terrified by the rocking the protesters gave the van. Those protests have not gone away. The Minister of State has resurrected them in this Bill and brought attention back to those issues, although other Senators will argue that matter.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should be able to generate some revenue themselves and they can decide where to spend that revenue. I have always held that view, but I also feel that people should know the level at which charges are set and what they are for. Recycling should be a priority and I reiterate that the Government has no commitment to recycling. For example, does any legislation deal with recycling cars? Even if a person does not want to scrap their car that car should be recycled, perhaps by the manufacturers, although I know attempts are being made to reduce the amount of non-recyclable material in cars. This principle should apply to other areas, such as electrical works. There is no genuine commitment to impose restrictions or penalties in this area if people do not recycle or produce recyclable material.</P>
    <P>An obvious example of this is the use of plastic bags in shops, an issue referred to in the recent debate on litter. That debate was extraordinarily well-attended and lasted longer than expected because many Members have strong views on litter. We feel strongly about the use of plastic bags by shops and it is possible to introduce strict penalties on the production and sale of these bags. Sales assistants in every supermarket one goes into shove out a plastic bag for almost every product one buys. It is easier for the sales assistant and housewives are often glad to use those bags as bin liners. However, it is time to halt this process and to look at genuine recycling. The Government must do more than pay lip service &ndash; it will have to introduce legislation which will impose penalties.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should explain in detail why the legislation is necessary and where it came from. He referred to &ldquo;doubt&rdquo; and &ldquo;possibilities&rdquo; about which I am curious.</P>
    <P>

    <P>Mr. Walsh: I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I doubt Senator Coogan was serious in inferring that the Bill is not necessary&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and that the Minister decided to bring another Bill before the House without reason. It is obvious that if there was no legal doubt, we would not be debating this Bill. I compliment the Minister on the speed with which he has moved to prevent circumstances which could undermine the viability of local authorities. As I said before, for decades there has been far too much interference at national level in the funding of local authorities. An effort has been made more recently to put local authorities on a firmer footing. It would fly in the face of that policy to allow a legal challenge undermine up to 25% of the revenue which underpins local authority expenditure. We must consider the benefits of this expenditure to local communities &ndash; in rural and urban areas the quality of lifestyle of many people depends on the proper utilisation of scarce resources at local government level. The Minister must be commended on introducing this Bill. I am not a lawyer but I have no doubt that we would not be debating this Bill if there was no legal question. The revenue involved is £443 million, which is a considerable sum.</P>
      <P>The polluter pays principle is recognised by the Department. The lack of logic of those who say there should not be charges for such a service is ludicrous. It is akin to someone arguing that electricity should be free or the television licence should be abolished, that State services should be paid from the Exchequer. I do not believe the public at large would accept this. In order to ensure the cost effectiveness of these services, it is good that many local authorities must secure funding to cover their provision. An anomaly arises in the case of waste. Many private operators are involved in the collection of waste and its transportation to dumps. They provide an excellent service and it would be unfair and probably in breach of the competition laws if local authorities put them out of business by deciding there should not be a charge for the service. Jobs would be lost as a consequence, which does not make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of the provision to allow one to charge the cost of waste disposal against one's tax liability. This makes sense and alleviates some of the effects on people. Most local authorities of which I am aware operate a waiver scheme which is effective in taking account of those who cannot pay because of hardship or whatever. However, the standard charge which applies in most local authorities is probably not conducive to an effective policy on waste disposal because it does not provide an incentive for people to reduce waste. Senator Coogan referred to recycling. Efforts are being made in this regard but successive Governments failed to adopt an enlightened approach to <Col N="231" /> waste disposal. The EU has categorically stated its position on the polluter pays principle. Some Cohesion Funds, particularly those for South Dublin County Council, may be in doubt because we are not complying with the polluter pays principle. Those who articulate differently are as ridiculous as Deputy Howlin when he abolished water charges in a failed attempt to save Joan Burton's seat from Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Coogan that the manner in which this legislation was introduced is extremely unsatisfactory. We have received an adequate explanation of why the legislation is necessary. The general explanatory memorandum states it is for the avoidance of doubt and to validate certain charges, but we are not told what the doubt is or what precisely is being referred to. The explanatory memorandum states that the Bill will not affect court proceedings concerning the validity of any relevant charge where such proceedings were commenced before 18 April 2000. There seems to be a presumption that some proceedings have taken place, which the Minister has not mentioned.</P>
      <P>Are we to be left in the dark as to why this legislation is so necessary that it must be rushed into the House without the Whips being consulted and without any Opposition Member being informed? We were not told this legislation would be before the House today. It is outrageous. The House has been insulted. We have not been consulted. That the Leader of the House should suddenly introduce this Bill and propose that all Stages of it be taken today without the slightest prior consultation undermines the credibility of the House and its procedures. For that reason alone this Bill should be thrown out of the House. As all Stages of the Bill must be taken today and the House is adjourning for the Easter recess today, Members on this side will not be able to debate amendments to the Bill &ndash; I intended to table a number of them &ndash; in a rational fashion with any possibility of their being considered in the other House. The way the House is being treated on this matter is a joke.</P>
      <P>We have always regarded as essential that the Second Stage of a Bill should be taken separately from Committee Stage, and that Stage should be taken separately from the remaining Stages. Yet the taking of all Stages of this Bill today is being forced down our throats without the House having an opportunity to consider the merits of the Bill. The House has not been given sufficient explanatory information on the urgency of taking all Stages of this Bill today, the legal doubt in this area and whether court proceedings are pending in this matter. It is dangerous to introduce retrospective legislation. It is suspect and it is questionable whether it will stand up constitutionally. I would like the Minister of State to clarify specifically the reasons for taking all Stages of the Bill today so that we will have the benefit of knowing on what we will be voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of the legal opinion sought by the Labour Party, this legislation is unnecessary. Any matters that might be covered under it are dealt with by the Interpretation Act. <Col N="233" /> It covers matters that might be the subject of this legislation. I would like the Minister of State to indicate his legal advice as to why this legislation is necessary. It seems to have been introduced on the basis that there is some legal doubt in this area. What is that legal doubt?</P>
    <P>This legislation deals with relevant charges imposed by local authorities. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government seems to be setting the scene for the introduction of new waste management charges. It seems he intends local authorities to impose a new service charge. The old water and service charges which the then Fianna Fáil Government irresponsibly disposed of in 1977 for pure political gain will be reintroduced as a new waste management charge and local authorities will be expected to impose waste management charges throughout the country. That will not happen.</P>

It is not intended that local authorities would go down the road again of having a very divisive campaign whereby some householders would pay service charges and others would not and where legal action would be taken. There is great confusion as to what is happening in this area.</P>
      <P>A divisive situation has arisen among local authorities since 1977 when a ridiculous decision was taken to remove from local authorities their major means of providing funds to enable them to carry out what they are obliged to do under law. That divisive situation will continue, irrespective of what is included in this legislation. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, fueled inflation by the manner in which he gave proportionately more in increases to those who were well off rather than to those on low incomes. The elderly, widows and widowers got a very small increase. A better approach would be for the Minister to give 2% off the top rate of tax to the local authorities in the form of a ring-fenced tranche of funds to resource them to deal with waste management rather than passing it back in tax relief to the PAYE workers. That is the only way to deal with this matter. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is washing his hands of this matter by saying that each local authority must make its own arrangements.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I also welcome the debate on this Bill, but I am disappointed it has fallen to this level. To go back to basics, there are lies, damn lies and statistics. To deal with the statistics on this matter and what happened in 1977 or 1983, in 1983 water charges were introduced by the then Tánaiste, who comes from my constituency. He <Col N="235" /> was embarrassed into abolishing them later because people in Dublin refused to pay service charges and a case was successfully brought against the Government in the High Court. It is amazing there is one law for one part of the country and another for another part.</P>
      <P>There was a picket outside these Houses yesterday when protesters shouted &ldquo;No way, no pay&rdquo;. Who will pay the charges? Somebody must pay for the service. Waste management presents a major problem to local authorities. There is talk of having regional waste disposal centres and incinerators in different areas, recycling etc. Who is to pay for that? Will it be the local authorities? Where will the money come from? Is everything to be free? Perhaps we will have a free Ireland.

If matters have to be tidied up, we must do that and get on with the running of the country on behalf of the people, whether they are our senior citizens or our young people. We must make sure that this country is progressive and if that means having waste incinerators or whatever, we will have to move forward in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who spoke on the Bill. This is important legislation and I appreciate the concerns that have been expressed about the procedures associated with this debate, as well as the willingness of Senators to co-operate in the passage of the Bill. While the opportunity that Senators have had to consider the proposals has been somewhat limited, I hope they understand the reasons immediate action is necessary in relation to this issue.</P>
      <P>Senators asked how this matter came to light. A question was raised by consultants engaged by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to advise on public private partnership arrangements for the purpose of implementing regional waste management plans. Shortly thereafter, and independently, advice to the same effect was received by Dublin Corporation, which is considering specific proposals for domestic waste charges as provided for in the Dublin region waste management plan.</P>
      <P>A judgment was then formed, and confirmed by the Attorney General, that a doubt could be held to apply in relation to the validity of charges. As I mentioned at the outset, I am not aware of any legal challenge in this matter, though as is clearly laid out in the Bill this legislation would not prejudice any such challenge. That is contained in section 4.</P>
      <P>Senators Coogan and Costello asked for a further explanation of the matter at issue. The immediate issue arose in relation to waste charges. Local authority waste management responsibilities were initially specified in the Public Health Acts of 1878 and 1907, and later under various regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996, subsequently placed local authority waste management functions on a modern footing. Relevant provisions of the Public Health Acts of 1878 and 1907 were repealed by section 6(1) of the 1996 Act, with effect from 1 July 1996. Effectively, these were replaced by a range of obligations regarding waste collection services and the provision and operation of waste recovery and disposal facilities. <i>De facto,</i> however, local authorities continued to provide these waste services as before and it was clearly understood that they would also continue to charge for such services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> Section 2 of the 1983 Act provides that where any existing enactment requires or enables a local authority to provide a service, but does not empower the authority to charge for that service, such enactment shall be deemed to so empower that authority. &ldquo;Existing enactment&rdquo; in this context includes that enactment as amended or extended. Having regard to this provision and to the provisions of section 20 of the Interpretation Act, 1937, it was considered that local authorities are entitled to rely on the 1983 Act for the making of charges in respect of the usual waste collection and disposal services which they continued to provide under the 1996 Act.</P>
    <P>Contrary to this general understanding, however, a view could be advanced that local authorities might not rely on the 1983 Act to levy waste charges, as the 1996 Act did not explicitly purport to replace the 1878 and 1907 provisions. The proposed Bill, among other things, puts this matter beyond doubt and validates waste charges made to date.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello completely misrepresented the position regarding waste charges. The fact is that there is a legal imperative underpinning the imposition of domestic waste charges. The European Commission has made it clear that there is a legal requirement upon EU member states to ensure that, in accordance with the polluter pays principle, there is a system of charges for waste disposal applicable to all waste producers. To the extent that Irish local authorities exempt householders from waste charges, the Commission considers itself justified in taking an infringement proceeding against Ireland under Article 169 of the treaty. The Commission has indicated that it is reviewing progress in relation to the introduction of household waste charges to determine whether to initiate proceedings against Ireland. Community funds cannot be used for any waste project if a system of waste charges consistent with the requirements of EU legislation is not in place. In this regard, the Commission has suspended and may, as Senator Walsh mentioned, revoke Cohesion Fund grant assistance of over £6.5 million in respect of South Dublin County Council's baling station at Ballymount.</P>
    <P>The issue of waivers has been raised. Local authorities are empowered under section 5 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions)(No. 2) Act, 1983, to waive all or part of a charge for the services they provide on the grounds of personal hardship. Decisions on whether to grant a waiver and the scale of such waivers are a matter for the local authority. Waivers have been in place for some years and have had regard to circulars issued by my Department recommending the adoption of a systematic approach in the assessment of applications and the provision of sufficient publicity regarding the operation of these schemes.</P>
    <P>I must revert to my opening statement. The Government considers it essential that we con<Col N="238" /> firm, without delay, the commonly understood position regarding the general powers currently available to local authorities to levy charges for the services they are statutorily empowered to provide. It is equally necessary to validate the making and recovery of any such charges made to date.</P>
    <P>Local authorities must have legal certainty in this regard. The Government would have been derelict in its duty if it had not acted. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, there could have been very serious implications for local authority revenues generally and therefore for their ability to provide services to the general public in the event of a successful challenge to the legislation as it currently stands.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that we are simply confirming the general understanding in relation to existing legislation. The Bill underwrites the <i>status quo.</i> It does not in any way extend the current powers of local authorities to charge for services they provide under existing law. It does not introduce any power to charge for services which local authorities might be required or empowered to provide under any future legislation, and it does not overturn or affect any existing legislation which prohibits the imposition of charges for any local authority services i.e. domestic water supply.</P>
    <P>As this legislation involves no change in current practice, and in the particular circumstances involved, I trust that Senators will accept my rationale. Once again, I acknowledge their co-operation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;The Minister shall make a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas within two months of the passing of this Act on the arrangements made for the imposition of relevant charges and the sufficiency of the waiver schemes applicable thereto.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to what the Minister of State said in respect of this matter on Second Stage. He indicated that part of the reason this legislation was brought before the House involved Dublin Corporation's consideration of a proposal for waste management charges. He also stated that there had been no legal challenge to this. The Bill <Col N="239" /> makes specific reference to legal proceedings which might be brought before 18 April 2000. Why make such a provision if such proceedings have not been initiated?</P>
    <P>As already stated, the Minister of State said that Dublin Corporation was considering the proposals and wanted to be sure of where it stood in that regard. He also said that there is a legal requirement under European Union statute, which is based on the tenet that the polluter pays, for a system of charges to be established. It is apparent that the Minister of State is clearing the decks for the introduction of waste management charges.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I made no reference to the Government imposing service charges similar to the old water charges. However, I did state that the Bill will give rise to a similar exercise. It is clear that service charges will be imposed in the form of waste management charges and that the Minister of State is intent on allowing the local authorities do his dirty work by obliging them to impose the charges. The Bill is being pushed through because he wants to ensure that they are in a position to do so. The Minister of State was concerned that local authorities might have encountered difficulties in applying a range of obligations instead of implementing the legislation. That is the impetus behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 proposes that &ldquo;The Minister shall make a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas within two months of the passing of this Act on the arrangements made for the imposition of relevant charges and the sufficiency of the waiver schemes applicable thereto.&rdquo;  Previous waiver schemes do not apply in this instance and there is a need for the Minister of State to exercise a degree of leadership by informing us what will happen.</P>
    <P>When local authority members throughout the country become aware of the implications of this legislation, all hell will break loose. My understanding of the European position is that we must deal with the problem of waste management. However, the way we tax our citizens in order to pay for waste management is a matter for ourselves to decide. There is no stipulation that a blanket local service charge should be imposed by local authorities. The Minister of State can be sure that the local authorities will not adopt a uniform approach to this matter. He is saying that he intends to pass the buck to the local authorities, allow them to fight among themselves and, if necessary, put them out of business if they refuse to agree a rate of payment.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should give proper direction regarding how waste management will be dealt with. The 1996 legislation provided for a waste management plan to be put in place but it is the responsibility of individual local authorities to develop such plans. I understand that only seven authorities have produced such plans, <Col N="240" /> despite the legal requirement that they should produce them within four years of the passing of the legislation. Given that those four years have elapsed, will the Minister of State explain why that is the case?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State indicate how the local authorities will impose the relevant charges to which my amendment refers? Will he also indicate how the waiver schemes which will be necessary if the legislation is passed will be implemented? The Minister of State's Department must exercise a degree of leadership. He cannot simply introduce what he perceives to be amending legislation which is designed not merely to enable but to direct local authorities to impose charges without illustrating how the waste management plan will work, indicating the level of resources which will be made available, stating how central Government intends to deal with this matter and explaining how he will deal with the fallout that will result from objections from members of the public and politicians when local authorities are obliged to implement these charges in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I am seeking leadership from the Minister of State in respect of this issue and I look forward to his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I had some sympathy with what I had thought was the motivation behind Senator Costello's amendment, namely, that a waiver scheme should be introduced to relieve the burden on people who are in financial difficulties. Most, if not all, local authorities already have such schemes in operation in respect of other service charges. Local authority members give careful consideration to and make decisions about this matter when discussing the annual estimates. That is as it should be.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello stated that he felt the Bill, in some way, will empower local authorities to introduce additional charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be wrong but I understand that the legislation merely validates any charges introduced on foot of previous legislation and ensures that they are not subject to legal challenges. This will safeguard the flow of funds to local government and ensure that this flow is not disrupted because of some technical defect. As the Minister of State indicated, a doubt has been cast on matters by the possible existence of such a defect in existing legislation. It seems eminently prudent that he and his Department should move with great haste to avoid difficulties in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State stated clearly that legislation would have to be introduced to facilitate the imposition of any new charges and that local authorities could not use this Bill as a means to introduce such charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="241" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify that point when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that is my understanding of the position. I wish to make a number of general points in respect of waiver schemes.</P>
      <P>I will nail my colours to the mast on this issue. In 1983 I supported the introduction of water charges across the country. It was an equitable charge and I strongly opposed its removal which was done for the wrong reason and undermined local government. Local authorities should be given more autonomy. There is a tendency on the part of Government to be over-prescriptive. The more discretion people are given at local level, the better democracy is served. We should go in that direction.</P>
      <P>Although I might be sympathetic to the thrust of what has been said with regard to a waiver scheme, that is commensurate with the needs of people. It is a matter for local authorities. If Dublin Corporation introduces charges in this area, it is its decision whether it will operate a waiver scheme, as indeed it is its decision whether to operate a charge in the first place. We should not be too ready to impose on local government.</P>
      <P>This is not about waste management. If we were debating that issue, I would be strongly of the view that rather than the current standard charge and waiver applying, people should be charged by the weight of their waste. The Minister was correct in that regard. It is a fairer way of dealing with it and would be a more sensible waste management policy in terms of effectiveness. It would get people to curtail, at source, the amount of waste they are producing. There should be segregation and minimisation at that level, as happens in other countries. Hopefully, that will happen under the Minister's guidance over time.</P>
      <P>This Bill simply safeguards the financial viability of local government. If we do not enact it, a doubt will linger. In so far as there is a doubt, the responsible course of action is to support the Bill's passage through the House. I hope that will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I spoke about the need for clarity. People must know what they are paying for. The vast majority of people recognise that they will have to pay waste charges because it is their waste. The proposal that paying by weight might be a more equitable way of dealing with waste is worthy of further debate. I would be happy to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment, if what the Minister said earlier is true, there is nothing in the amendment that runs contrary to it. If one reads the amendment rather than focusing on what has been implied or what might be in the amendment, one can see it is quite innocuous. It simply asks that the Minister report to the Houses of the Oireachtas within two months of the pass<Col N="242" /> ing of the Bill on the arrangements made for the imposition of relevant charges and the sufficiency of the waiver scheme.</P>
    <P>That is not saying that the Government will demand a 10% waiver, it simply ensures that the waiver schemes are equitable. That might be done through ministerial order to the local authority to the effect that, for example, three quarters of £200 is not enough, that some people simply cannot afford it. In other words, we seek a waiver scheme that is transparent. There is nothing in the amendment that the Government should find offensive. It will do no harm to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace): I cannot accept this amendment. It is not necessary. Furthermore, it would interfere with the proper operation of local government.</P>
    <P>I remind Members that an income tax allowance is available in respect of service charges paid in full and on time to local authorities for the provision of domestic refuse collection and to independent domestic refuse collection contractors. The allowance is payable at the standard rate. This was introduced by the previous Government and has been retained. As the allowances are at the standard rate, the better off on the higher tax rates will only benefit to the same extent as those on the standard rate. Waiver schemes are generally available for those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>A power already exists for local authorities to grant waiver of charges in cases of hardship. The power exists under section 5 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, to waive all or part of a charge for the services they provide on the grounds of personal hardship. Decisions on whether to grant a waiver or the scale of such waivers are matters for the local authorities. Waivers have been in place for some years and have had regard to circulars issued by my Department recommending the adoption of a sympathetic approach in the assessment of applications and provision of sufficient publicity regarding the operation of these schemes.</P>
    <P>It is entirely appropriate in terms of the principle of subsidiarity and promoting local democracy and local self-government that decisions in relation to waivers should be taken by local elected politicians. The Government does not propose to interfere with this principle by imposing unnecessary central control over issues which are properly dealt with locally.</P>
    <P>The Bill underwrites the <i>status quo.</i> It does not extend the current powers of local authorities to charge for services they provide under existing law. It does not introduce a power to charge for services which local authorities might be required or empowered to provide under any future legislation and it does not overturn or affect existing legislation which prohibits the imposition of <Col N="243" /> charges for any local authority service, such as domestic water supply.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello has repeatedly called for leadership by the Government. We are leading by responding urgently on this issue. The Senator's colleagues in the Dáil suggested that we should wait until there was a legal challenge. That is not leadership and the Government makes no apology for moving quickly on this matter. This is a matter of local government acting in relation to its responsibilities. Waiver schemes are in place throughout the country and 87% of the population is paying waste charges. That may not apply in the local authority in the Senator's area but it is not a reason to suggest that there will be upheaval throughout the country about something that simply confers legal status.</P>

      <P>That is what the Minister said, I took a note of it. He also said there was no legal challenge. Obviously, however, the local authority is concerned about its practices and that its regulations might not stand the test of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finding out that this is the justification for the <Col N="244" /> Bill was like extracting teeth. The action by the local authority in my area is the reason for this Bill. The local authority did not tell me or the other councillors that it was considering imposing waste management charges. We suspected it was and sought clarification, but the authority denied it. Obviously, it confirmed it to the Minister, and the Minister introduced legislation on foot of its request, even though it is on record as denying that it would introduce charges for waste management. This is a funny pickle. That is why legislation is rushed through the Houses without an opportunity to examine its implications. It is outrageous.</P>
    <P>The amendment does not interfere with anything that was said by Members on either side of the House today. Senator Coogan is correct. It is a <i>status quo</i> amendment. It provides that the Minister should indicate, within two months of the Bill being passed, what arrangements have been made for the imposition of relevant charges and the sufficiency of the waiver schemes applicable thereto. Waiver schemes are different throughout the country. This is why I refer to leadership. If there is to be leadership, let us see what the relevant charges will be and what the Minister says about them. The Minister of State has not indicated how he feels about this and he has said nothing about how the waiver schemes operate. There is a divergence in terms of the operation of the waiver schemes and the charges imposed by various local authorities. Leadership in this regard would be very welcome. This is a modest and reasonable amendment and I do not think the Minister of State's advisers believe it would undermine the Bill if accepted.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. - Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob): Ireland has long played an active role in international fora to further the cause of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The key to this has been the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT. A central provision of that treaty is the implementation of safeguards agreements between states and the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA. This Bill will transpose into domestic law a protocol signed by Ireland in September 1998 with the IAEA which will strengthen our existing safeguards agreement. Safeguards agreements are the means by which the IAEA verifies that states are acting in compliance with their international non-prolifer<Col N="245" /><Col N="246" /> ation obligations, primarily through the collection and reporting of information in relation to goods and materials related to the nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>In addition, IAEA inspectors regularly visit nuclear facilities to verify records that state authorities keep on the whereabouts of nuclear material under their control, to check IAEA-installed instruments and surveillance equipment and to confirm physical inventories of nuclear material. These measures provide independent international verification that governments are abiding by their commitments with respect to the peaceful use of nuclear technology.</P>
    <P>A precondition for the implementation of safeguards is a formal agreement with the state in which the inspection is to occur. The current safeguards agreement between the non-nuclear weapons states of the EU and the IAEA and between Ireland and the IAEA has direct operational implications for Ireland only in respect of certain insignificant quantities of fissionable material held in University College Dublin and University College Cork. In accordance with the existing agreement, these materials have undergone inspection by EU inspectors on behalf of the IAEA.</P>
    <P>Under existing safeguards agreements, the capability of the IAEA to detect undeclared nuclear activities is limited. IAEA inspectors are not permitted to carry out random searches for undeclared nuclear material or clandestine nuclear activities. Since the early 1990s, and especially since the Gulf War and the consequent revelations of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programme which the IAEA was not able to detect, the IAEA secretariat and its member states have been working to introduce a strengthened, more rigorous inspection and verification system.</P>
    <P>New measures have been implemented within the legal authority of existing safeguards agreements. In addition, a Model Protocol Additional to States' Safeguards Agreements was approved by the IAEA board of governors in May 1997. The supplementary measures, which include, <i>inter alia,</i> the obligation to provide additional information on nuclear and nuclear-related activities, additional access to locations not subject to safeguards and the use of new verification techniques, are designed to alert the international community more quickly and effectively to the possibility of undeclared nuclear activities and to improve the level of confidence about the absence of such activities.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to introduce these measures into domestic legislation. It is the Government's strong wish that Ireland ratify this agreement as soon as possible. Early ratification is in line not only with Ireland's long-standing position on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation but also with our position on nuclear safety. The IAEA plays a vital role in promoting nuclear safety worldwide. Over the years it has <Col N="247" /> developed common safety standards in regard to nuclear safety and radiation protection and has fostered information exchange between member states.</P>
    <P>In the IAEA, Ireland has been to the forefront in promoting international conventions on the management of radioactive waste and nuclear safety. Ireland strongly supports the agency's nuclear safety and radiological protection activities and is a firm advocate of the contribution which the agency can make to an enhanced nuclear safety culture worldwide. Ireland is due to take a seat on the board of governors in the latter part of this year.</P>
    <P>Safeguards agreements are a key element in the NPT. They are the mechanism by which the IAEA and, through it, the international community can be confident that states are fulfilling their obligations under the treaty which is the foundation stone of international nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. The treaty was inspired by a series of resolutions put to the UN General Assembly by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Frank Aiken, beginning in 1959. It was concluded in 1968 and, since then, the number of states party to it has steadily increased to the point where, today, only four states remain outside it &ndash; India, Pakistan, Israel and Cuba, although Cuba is party to other international nuclear non-proliferation agreements.</P>
    <P>In the treaty, the non-nuclear weapon states agree not to develop or otherwise obtain nuclear weapons, and the nuclear weapon states make an undertaking to engage in negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament. The treaty also includes guarantees of the right of states to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and the concomitant obligation to have a safeguards agreement with the IAEA.</P>
    <P>Initially concluded for a period of 25 years, the 1995 review and extension conference took the decision, as part of an overall package, to extend it indefinitely. Other elements of the 1995 package include a series of principles and objectives for nuclear disarmament, a strengthened review process and a resolution on achieving a nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>The first review conference since the indefinite extension of the treaty in 1995 will take place this year from 24 April to 19 May. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will lead the Irish delegation. The review conference will take place in a difficult international environment. Senators will be aware of the extremely dangerous developments in south Asia over the past few years and tensions over efforts to alter the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Delays in the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty are also a matter of concern.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the initiator of the New Agenda coalition which will present proposals to the conference in the hope of assisting progress. The <Col N="248" /> New Agenda was launched by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, along with the Foreign Ministers of seven other countries, in June 1998. Resolutions based on the initiative were approved by large majorities in the UN General Assembly in 1998 and 1999. The New Agenda seeks to capture the middle ground in the nuclear disarmament debate, thereby providing a strong platform to encourage nuclear weapons states to take steps to fulfil their obligations under Article VI of the NPT, which commits them to engage in negotiations in good faith leading to nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control.</P>
    <P>The current treaty structure &ndash; the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the treaty banning nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, outer space and under water &ndash; has had considerable success in limiting the number of nuclear weapons states. However, that structure left a clear gap by permitting the nuclear weapons states to continue testing new weapons underground. The solution to this problem was found in the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty which removed the anomaly by forbidding all nuclear weapons tests anywhere. For this reason, Ireland has long been a consistent and active supporter of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The treaty is a fundamental building block in the step-by-step approach to nuclear disarmament in the New Agenda initiative.</P>
    <P>States which are parties to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty are required to designate a national authority to ensure effective implementation of the treaty and to serve as a national focal point for liaison with the organisation and with other states' parties. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland will carry out Ireland's obligations under the treaty. It is important for countries such as Ireland to demonstrate full confidence in the NPT and its mechanisms. Therefore, early ratification and implementation of the strengthened safeguards agreement, which this Bill will enable us to do, is a priority of the Government. The Bill allocates responsibility for the implementation of our obligations under the strengthened safeguards agreement to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, which is the national authority for advising the Government on radiological protection and nuclear safety matters.</P>
    <P>The relevant Departments will support the RPII in the collection and reporting of material for relevant dual-use products, which are products which can be used for civil or military purposes. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be responsible for licensing and the reporting of relevant information with regard to products requiring an export licence. The Office of the Revenue Commissioners will conduct the monitoring and reporting with regard to information concerning the import of materials <Col N="249" /> and equipment coming within the scope of the protocol.</P>
    <P>This Bill will also provide for the granting of access to international inspectors, including as appropriate managed access to locations, facilities or sites to which the protocol applies. Verification arrangements are of course crucial to the IAEA safeguard system.</P>
    <P>Provision will also be made to give the RPII, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners powers to appoint inspectors and conduct inspections in conjunction with IAEA inspectors. There will also be a requirement on any person involved in areas to which the protocol applies to provide the prescribed information at the prescribed time and in the prescribed format. The Government also intends to make provision to regulate, by a system of prior licence, the manufacture, acquisition and use of all reportable material as listed in Article 2 and Annexes I and II of the protocol. The purpose of licensing is to facilitate full disclosure and assurance of the provision of relevant information under the protocol.</P>
    <P>The threat of nuclear weapons is still with us. If we are ever to rid the world of the threat of nuclear annihilation, we must build an international regime which can, with confidence, detect nuclear weapons development programmes and provide assurance about their absence. The strengthened safeguards which we are seeking to implement through this Bill will play a fundamental role in this.</P>
    <P>I propose to table some minor amendments concerning administrative arrangements under the Bill on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business. I have been informed by the Government that the ethics committee established under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1997, will consider the Labour Party Private Members' Bill on lobbyists which was defeated in this House. The committee will also consider proposals from the Government for legislative changes in the area of lobbying. It is expected that the committee will meet over the Easter break and it is likely that the Government's proposals will follow after that. In view of this and in view of the fact that this matter is before the Flood tribunal, it would not be appropriate to proceed with the matter by way of statements today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been brought to my attention that the Chair has consistently ruled that issues which are currently before tribunals of inquiry should not be discussed in the House and that the House <Col N="250" /> must not be seen to encroach on the functions of a tribunal or interfere in its proceedings in any way. Accordingly, I wish to propose that the Order of Business be amended by the deletion of statements ordered for 4 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I utterly oppose this unprecedented and brazen attempt to alter the Order of Business. What was sought this morning and willingly given by the Leader was agreement to discuss a motion in the names of Senators Ross, Costello and Norris in regard to the introduction of a register of political interests. That is exactly the same issue which was the subject of a Bill introduced by the Labour Party which was voted down. We simply wanted to discuss the matter again.</P>
      <P>Is the Leader saying that a committee takes precedence over a House of Parliament? Is he saying that because this issue is due to be referred to a committee which will meet in the near future, one of the two sovereign Houses of the Oireachtas is to defer to that committee? If that is what the Leader is saying, it is in contempt of this House and the decision taken here this morning. Will the Leader tell us the real reason behind this? Did somebody get at him and tell him that this matter could not be discussed? </P>
      <P>The debate was not an attempt to encroach upon the affairs of the Flood tribunal. There was no question of that. We merely sought to discuss a matter which has been on the Order Paper for the past five months. I do not accept the reasons being advanced by the Leader. There is some cover-up going on here, an inability or fear on the Government's part to come into this House and inform the public why it will not set up something as simple as a register of lobbyists' interests. I feel sorry for the Leader in regard to what he has to do here this afternoon, but the amendment is in contempt of this House and of a proposal which the Leader voluntarily advanced this morning. We will reject this and fight it to the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader's announcement undermines any trust or confidence we have in regard to this House's system of organising its business. We are witnessing the undermining of the constitutional role of this House and the requirement under the Constitution and under our Standing Orders for the Seanad to order its own business. The Leader received agreement from the House on a particular Order of Business but he now tells us that some Member or Members of Government interfered with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On what basis is the Government entitled to interfere with the manner in which this House orders its business? I believe that is unconstitutional and I ask the Leader to explain to us where the Government gets the authority to undermine the Order of Business of this House. It would have been something had the Leader come into the House of his own volition and <Col N="251" /> given us a reason for this amendment, but the reason he has advanced is that the Government does not agree with the statements being taken. We are witnessing the Shakespearean vista of cowards dying many times before their death. This is a nettle which must be grasped at some stage.</P>
    <P>This decision does not merely undermine the functions of this House, it also undermines the democratic process. We are being muzzled and gagged by an amendment tabled to the Order of Business in a manner which, in my experience, is quite uncommon. That is utterly unacceptable. Senators have prepared for a debate on this matter. This morning, the Leader walked away from an amendment to the Order of Business which would have required a division on the issue and it was decided to allow statements which would have allowed everyone to express their points of view without causing offence.</P>
    <P>If we are at the stage where this House is unable to order its business without external interference, that is an appalling affront to the democratic process as we understand it and as we abide by it from day to day. This was not an attempt to encroach on the work of any tribunal. We decided to discuss an issue which is on everyone's minds and which is being publicised in every organ of the media.</P>
    <P>At a time when we are attempting to provide some distinction to the role of public representatives, we let ourselves down once again. On a day which has seen the greatest assault on and diminution of the reputation of political representation in the history of the State, we decide to walk away from the central issue. That sends out a message that we have something to hide or that we are afraid. The message being conveyed from this House is that all politicians are the same. We are all tainted by this issue and we are entitled to put our positions on record. I am not taking any high moral ground here. There are good people in all political parties. This House is being steamrolled by a Government which is afraid of what it might hear or which fears embarrassment through this House doing its duty by the electorate. This is an appalling decision and we will oppose it all the way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader offered the alternative proposal of taking statements. We were not <Col N="252" /> happy with that because we wanted to vote on the matter. Now, without any consultation with Members of the House or the Whips, the Leader is proposing an amendment to the Order of Business agreed on this morning at a time when very few Members are present. The reason he advances is that it would not be proper to hold a debate on this matter while a sitting tribunal is dealing with it. I remind the Leader that we are merely proposing that a register of political lobbyists should be drawn up. Labour Party legislation on this precise matter was debated one year ago while the Flood tribunal was sitting and no suggestion was made that such a debate might have been inappropriate.</P>
      <P>This is a total camouflage. Somebody got at the Leader and told him not to hold this debate, obviously because somebody in the Government has something to hide. He is now trying to kick it to touch to a committee which has been set up and which has no bearing on the authority of this House, or the Lower House, to arrange its business or deal with matters which are of prime consideration and importance to it.</P>
      <P>I am disgusted that we should now be faced with this situation, when the debate was to take place at 4 o'clock and people were preparing themselves for it. It was to be an exceedingly important debate on a subject which is being discussed all over the country, yet none of us in the House can say a word about it. We are being muzzled by the Government of which the Leader of the House is a mouthpiece. He is not ordering the Business of the House in accordance with the rules or wishes of Members. He is doing it in accordance with somebody who has got to him, and that I am sure is at the highest level of Government, unless he is prepared to say the contrary.</P>

      <P>It is seldom that I have been assertive or aggressive in the House on an issue on which I feel so strongly, but I rise in anger. This is the eve of Good Friday. We waited and we prepared for a debate. This morning we were assured that we could discuss the register of lobbyists interests Bill and we were to have statements on the issue. The whole country is talking about this. When I return to Limerick this evening I will be asked in no uncertain terms what I am doing about it. I will have to explain that a debate was scheduled but was cancelled. I will then be asked what my role is in the Seanad and if such a thing can happen in the space of a few minutes. It was purely by chance that we realised at 3.30 p.m. that the debate was to be suspended. Until when is it suspended? It will not be taken because that Bill has already been voted down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel shocked and appalled. All our reputations are at stake on this issue and it has nothing to do with the tribunal. If we are waiting for the tribunal to finish, this matter will never be <Col N="253" /> discussed in the House. We are being held back. We could have been told the matter was out of order this morning. Who suddenly made the decision that it was so, when it was not deemed to be out of order this morning? This is a sad and sorry day for Seanad Éireann at a time when I thought we were moving towards reform and having a decent reputation as public representatives, not just here but as ordinary councillors also. I am very saddened by this and it is not the end of the matter as far as we are concerned on this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevance of the Seanad is in its capacity to respond immediately to issues of national importance. In agreeing with that sentiment this morning, the Leader allowed a debate on an issue that is on everybody's tongue. We should show leadership. We should be analytical and be able to say what we believe is going on and what should happen in future, but we are being stymied. I do not think it is the Leader's fault because his hands are tied. If any issue arises at a tribunal, whether it has the slightest relevance to an issue that is going on outside, we can be stymied and gagged by the argument that it is before the tribunal, even though it could be there for years. Such issues include planning and other matters. I am afraid that every time we may wish to raise an issue of importance we will be told that it has some relevance to a tribunal so we will be precluded from talking about it. This House is not subservient to a committee or any Minister.</P>

Having briefly touched on this subject on the Order of Business this morning and having subsequently voted the way I did, as a good democrat I accepted the will of the majority to order the business as they so choose. I stayed on here with my colleagues to speak on the business as ordered. As I understand it, both sides of the House are agreed on the need for a debate on this issue. I always fully respect your rulings, advice and guidance, a Chathaoirligh, but the House is well capable of focusing on the business as ordered and on the specific issue without encroaching on the work of any tribunal. The important thing is that we get to deal with it or we will be treated as irrelevant and not taken seriously. There is a need for the Executive and the Houses of the Oireachtas to deal firmly and fairly in banning lobbyists from making political contributions.</P>

I was proposing an amendment to the Order of Business because the Chair had consistently ruled that the issues which are currently before tribunals of inquiry should not be discussed in the House. Since I became Leader of this House, we have discussed over 80 Bills. There was no guillotine on any Bill. I try to be as accommodating as I can to facilitate all Members' requests in the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed everyone is leaving as I thought they would stay to hear my speech. I welcome the Minister of State and I compliment him on his activities in relation to this legislation and with regard to Sellafield. This Bill brings Ireland up to speed with an international agreement to which we have already agreed and which applies to all countries. Its provisions are clear and the policing body in Ireland will be the Radiological Protection Institute, which is a significant body that is politically independent and is up to date on the reality of this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the collapse of the Soviet Union there has been a continuing shift in international political relationships. It is similar to the 1814 Congress of Vienna and the following age of Metternich, although historians present may correct me. At that time there was a change in the European and world order similar to the change we are experiencing now. It is good in that countries which were not <Col N="257" /> democracies previously are now becoming democracies, but other countries, such as India and Pakistan frighten me, as do many others with the potential for nuclear weapons use in conflicts between them. It is important to have the steady hand of America on the world stage. We are concerned by issues in Chechnya as well as the instability in other states in that area, which seems corrupt in many ways. There seems to be increased stability in Russia of late and the main players in the field should agree to influence the smaller countries which have nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>The capacity of any nuclear weapon to fundamentally and utterly destroy life now and for future generations with radioactive fallout is very frightening and measures such as this need the support of all nations. We are playing our part with this Bill, although it is a small measure. We do not have a nuclear industry. There is some academic research in Cork which might theoretically fall under the sphere of influence of the Bill, but we are very much in agreement with the spirit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are military activities in the Sellafield complex. Obviously we are all opposed to reprocessing at Sellafield but I am also concerned about its military activities. We rely on the policing of this treaty to ensure that what is taking place there is fully understood and declared. I am not convinced this is the case but I do not know enough about it other than to express my concern. Last year we visited the Los Alamos research centre in San Francisco. There is also concern about what is taking place there. However, the reality is that the military complexes in Britain and America are effectively a law unto themselves. I am concerned about their activities. It is important that the Minister continues to raise these issues abroad and that they are discussed by this Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Minister not only referred to disarmament and to the proliferation of nuclear arms but also to our position on nuclear safety. While it is tangential to this Bill, I wish to raise Nirex and the proposed underground storage of nuclear waste near the Sellafield complex. This is a fundamental issue of nuclear safety involving Ireland and the protection of our environment. It is not an arms issue but it is a nuclear one. It is an issue of safety, not just for this generation or the next one but for those thousands of years in the future. Britain may have further proposals for the long-term storage of its nuclear waste. I am confident that the Minister, with the full support of the Opposition as well as the Government, will be up to date on this issue.</P>
    <P>Some of the press leaks and documents which have come into the public domain on the operation of Sellafield demonstrate that what is said and done by the Minister of the day, whether it is Deputy Stagg, Senator Avril Doyle or Deputy Jacob, is important and has an impact. That is why it is important that we continue to discuss these issues and take the same approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> This is important legislation. We are playing our part in the international arena. As I said, the Radiological Protection Institute will play an important role in this. Stable countries have access to nuclear weapons. However, I am concerned about countries such as Zimbabwe where, from what I can gather from media reports, Robert Mugabe seems to be starting a race war, having access to nuclear weapons. We do not know what nuclear weapons some of these countries have. We must be vigilant regarding the leaderships of countries on the periphery of the Middle East which are inherently unstable and have nuclear weapons. Ireland is clearly playing its part in the international arena, which I welcome. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill and join in welcoming the Minister to the House. This day last week, some of us had the opportunity to welcome him to Newcastle in County Down where he discussed BNFL and the contamination of the Irish Sea. The Minister was commended on his interest and commitment in ensuring the voice of Ireland is heard on these issues, particularly the health of our population, which is paramount. I compliment the Minister in this regard.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Dowd on the storage of waste and the cessation of reprocessing by BNFL. What happened at Sellafield was debated in this House and it is an absolute scandal. The Minister has rightly ensured that Ireland's view has been well articulated. This will hopefully encourage the British authorities to take a more enlightened approach and remove the risk to which we are all exposed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is in line with Ireland's policy on disarmament and arms control. This policy plays a central role in our foreign policy and is a key element in our contribution towards international security and the maintenance of peace. The excessive accumulation of arms is one of the major contributory causes to international tension and conflict. As anyone who remembers it or has watched programmes about it will know, the Cuban missile crisis is a good illustration of the trauma experienced when the world was on the brink of destruction. It highlighted the need to pursue policies which help us to avoid such crises in the future. As Senator O'Dowd said, the collapse of the eastern bloc has positively contributed to a better rapport between East and West and has significantly reduced the risk at which the world was placed on a number of occasions, particularly during the Cuban missile crisis when the world held its breath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an opportunity to compliment the post Second World War visionaries, such as Robert Schumann and Jean Monnet, and the contribution they made to the new Europe. The history of Europe in the past century has been difficult and one shudders to think what might have hap<Col N="259" /> pened if nuclear weapons had been available during the first half of the century. All one has to do is to look at the effects of the Chernobyl disaster on Belarus, the consequences of which will be with the current population as well as generations to come.</P>
    <P>Ireland's approach to disarmament and arms control is closely related to other aspects of our foreign policy. The prohibition of inhumane weapons, the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and control on arms exports are all issues with a strong human rights dimension. There are also close links with our policy for development in the Third World, where the diversion of scarce resources to arms procurement and the consequences of excessive accumulation of arms are important issues. The scarce funds available in the Third World are being misappropriated from the better cause of looking after its population. Greater disarmament and less investment in this area would result in considerable resources being released to reduce starvation in underdeveloped countries.</P>
    <P>The acquisition and deployment of military power has never been an instrument of Irish foreign policy, other than in the context of essential security needs and involvement in UN peacekeeping. Our Defence Forces maintain weapons at the minimum level necessary to ensure the security of the State and carry out their peacekeeping responsibilities. Historically, this level has been lower than that of most other European states. We have no indigenous arms industry and thus no economic dependence on arms export. Ireland has focused its disarmament efforts at the political level in the major multilateral fora where we can be more effective in advancing our views and winning support for concerted international action.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State pointed out that Ireland is well positioned to articulate this view. I compliment him on our being the initiator of the new agenda on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty at the conference in New York. It is a role Ireland is well equipped to play. We are well respected across the world by many of the states involved in the arms race and we are in a position to play a influential and positive role in that regard. The bodies primarily concerned are the UN General Assembly, the UN Disarmament Commission, conferences relating to specific international agreements and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, whose security forum has responsibilities in this area and it participates in the common foreign and security policy of the European Union. Our involvement in the work of bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency is closely linked to our disarmament objectives.</P>
    <P>The end of the Cold War has had major implications for disarmament and arms control. The abandonment of the nuclear arms race, the end<Col N="260" /> ing of superpower confrontation and the division of Europe have resulted in a far reaching reassessment of the need to maintain large arsenals. This has given a major impetus to multilateral disarmament in relation to weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons. However, we should not be complacent. There are many unstable areas of the world where national rivalries and tensions could spill over into conflict. If nuclear arsenals come into play there is always the threat of mass destruction. The recent hostility between India and Pakistan are dramatic examples of the potential threat that can manifest itself in regional confrontation. It is the challenge of international diplomacy to diffuse these areas of unrest. Measures such as those provided for in the Bill are the international community's best chance of preventing the spread of nuclear weapons because covert activities can be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to the House and with Senators Walsh and O'Dowd I compliment him on the consistency of his approach and the good work he has done on the nuclear issue prior to and since becoming Minister of State. He was very much to the forefront on this issue and, as Minister of State, he has taken the opportunity to use his powers to progress this important matter.</P>
      <P>This Bill is important. As a small non-nuclear island nation on the periphery of western Europe that is not aligned to others in terms of nuclear materials, one might think it is not essential for us to sign up to this international agreement, but it is important to do so. Having signed up to it, it is important that we take our place on the world stage and use our diplomatic skills to prick the conscience of countries that have misbehaved in the past and to ensure that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is fully adhered to. It is vital that happens.</P>
      <P>It is important that the structures set up under the IAEA are complied with fully, that the countries involved are strictly monitored and the inspectorate has responsibility to ensure these conditions are complied with. The Minister of State might elaborate in greater detail on how the inspectorate will conduct its work, as it must be independent in doing so. Where major investment is involved, undoubtedly there will be vested interests and desires on behalf of certain members states, governments, companies and individuals that certain actions be taken. It is important that the inspectorate is seen to operate in a transparent and independent manner and that spot checks can be carried out unannounced by people other than those specified to do the work. That is central to the success of this measure. Its success will ensure the generation of confidence in the global community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is major concern with regard to the four countries that are not prepared to sign up to this treaty. I refer to India and Pakistan, Israel and, <Col N="261" /> to a lesser extent, Cuba. The India-Pakistan conflict has a global dimension. That conflict has arisen twice in the past number of years and it has proven to be a source of international concern. Given that there have been good relations between Ireland and India, dating back to the time of Éamon de Valera and Frank Aiken, the Minister of State should use that tradition of good relations to try to coax the current Indian Government into adopting a more acceptable position on this issue and to encourage it to sign up to this treaty. That would enhance the reputation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and stabilise world security.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty posed to India by Pakistan. Our foreign ministry appears to have good access to the authorities in countries such as India. We could do the world a favour by using our influence at every opportunity to encourage those countries to sign up to the agreement. I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs to do that. There are difficulties regarding Israel. While it has domestic difficulties that are being resolved at present, given its location I am sure it could be easily coaxed into signing up to this agreement.</P>
    <P>Some of us may have concerns about countries that signed up to the agreement but are applying the regulations in their own fashion. Those countries need to be closely monitored. The European Union needs to monitor the supply of nuclear weapons and arms by member states to other countries, particularly the sale of weapons by France and England to countries in South America and Africa. That needs to be monitored more closely.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has been to the forefront in addressing the Sellafield issue, although that is not the subject of this debate. Figures were misrepresented and false information was submitted in relation to that nuclear plant. How can we be sure there will not be a misrepresentation in relation to nuclear weapons and armaments and other related matters? We need further reassurances in that regard. We need to be constantly on the alert and focused and keep these countries under tight scrutiny.</P>
    <P>It is important that the rights of states to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes are contained under the ambit of the IAEA. I welcome Ireland's strong support for the agency's nuclear safety and radiological protection activities and its encouragement of an enhanced nuclear safety culture worldwide. I compliment the Government on Ireland being to the forefront in this area in that it was the initiator of the coalition for the new agenda. The work done by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, on that issue also deserves credit. I am delighted approval for it has come from the UN General Assembly, that further support is expected and that the Government is actively pursuing various other countries to fulfil their <Col N="262" /> obligations under Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been an active and consistent supporter of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. That matter has been discussed repeatedly in this House and in the Dáil. I am delighted that progress has been made on the banning of underground and undersea tests and that the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty also includes tests carried out in the atmosphere and in outer space. Tests should be banned wherever they take place and I welcome that development.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of complimenting the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland on the work it has done over the years, the manner in which it has monitored the position and the good work in which it continues to engage. The former chairman, the board and the staff of the institute have done extraordinary work. I also compliment the Minister of State who has the full support of this side of the House in the work he has been doing. We wish him every success, which I am sure he will achieve with his competence and his ability to be stern or charming when necessary. He will manage to convince even the great powers of the world as he continues to do this work on behalf of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which is in keeping with Ireland's traditional position on nuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Ireland is a nuclear free country, not just in terms of weaponry but in terms of energy. It is important that we are to the forefront in articulating our concerns on this matter and promoting our position.</P>
      <P>That said, I wonder why we are discussing the Bill this afternoon. Why has it suddenly appeared out of nowhere on a day when there were many rows because, having been notified that there would be two items on the Order of Business, we found ourselves with seven further items? We do not have an explanation of the reason the Bill is before us.</P>
      <P>I note from the explanatory memorandum and the Minister's opening address that the protocol was signed by Ireland in September 1998 &ndash; 19 months ago. Why should we wait until the very last day of the sitting to complete Second Stage, leaving the other Stages to be taken at a future date? Why should we impose it on an already cluttered and overcrowded agenda for the last day of this sitting? Perhaps the Minister of State might address that issue when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise that question because this is an important matter and we have great concerns about the whole nuclear issue. Last week the largest consignment yet of food, equipment and materials was sent to Chernobyl by Adi Roche and the organisation which supports the people affected by radiation as a result of the Chernobyl disaster. I understand that in excess of £2 million <Col N="263" /> worth of goods was sent as a result of the generosity of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are interested in this issue for other reasons because we have taken the initiative in many other areas. Deputy David Andrews, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, took the initiative of bringing a group together to oppose the proliferation of nuclear weapons in nuclear and non-nuclear countries. That was two years ago and perhaps the Minister of State will tell us what has been happening since then in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's initiative in relation to Sellafield shows the extent of our concerns and the implications of having Sellafield on our doorstep. Why should we have to deal with Second Stage in such a peremptory fashion today when we know we cannot process the legislation beyond today? There will be adequate time after the Easter recess. I hope the Minister of State will clarify that matter. I would hate to think it is because, as indicated in his contribution, Ireland is due to take its seat on the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency in the latter part of this year. Did somebody discover that we have not fulfilled our commitments to international conventions without legislation such as this and that it would look rather embarrassing if Ireland is to become a governor of the IAEA, which has responsibility for monitoring and inspecting nuclear weaponry and ensuring that countries are in line with the necessary requirements in relation to radioactive waste and nuclear safety? It is difficult to detect undeclared nuclear activities. Perhaps that is why we have suddenly decided there is an urgency this Holy Thursday afternoon to give an indication of our commitment in this area.</P>
    <P>We should not be embarrassed about these matters. We should be to the forefront but our track record has not been good in recent times. My colleague, the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Howlin, instanced the large number of international conventions we have not ratified and it is about time we got our act together in that regard to ensure we are up to date in terms of our global responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not apply to Ireland in any meaningful fashion. As the Minister of State said, it does so only in respect of certain insignificant quantities of fissionable material held in University College Dublin and University College Cork. Why the urgency all of a sudden? That is the mystery I want resolved. Why has little Ireland to ensure its standing among the nations of the world now when the Bill is only relevant to Ireland in respect of this small matter of fissionable equipment or material in two colleges, which are already well inspected by the Radiological Protection Institute?</P>
    <P>Sellafield is our major concern. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is being facilitated under this legislation, has a responsi<Col N="264" /> bility to report on information concerning goods and materials related to the nuclear industry. This is a long-running saga in terms of our position on international nuclear safety. We have a nuclear industry on our doorstep. We have expressed concerns repeatedly and we have been told constantly by the Government that there was nothing we could do, that we could not put together a legal case because it would not stand up in court. Now, however, we have discovered that Sellafield has been guilty of abuses and malpractice in its reprocessing activities. The Minister of State initiated a liaison with Norway to get matters moving and we saw some high profile publicity shots. I expect a follow-up on that because, for the first time ever, we are in a position to take meaningful action in relation to the greatest threat to the health of this nation.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the Minister of State's bona fides on this matter but some years ago, when my colleague, Deputy Stagg, was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, with responsibility in this matter, he took it upon himself to attend the THORP inquiry and to state our position in the strongest terms. The Minister of State should make a high profile visit to the THORP reprocessing plant and make it clear that Ireland is seeking the closure of that facility, the operators of which have been completely negligent in relation to safety standards. It is unbelievable that those responsible for the plant's operation were prepared to allow it to operate, even in respect of the most dangerous material under its control, with only the minimum level of safety and inspection procedures in place. Now is the time to make a great deal of noise. The new information we have in our possession in respect of the abuse and malpractice to which I refer is what is required to close down Sellafield.</P>
    <P>My party will table amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. However, I have no difficulty with the Bill and I welcome its introduction. I would have preferred if it could have been introduced 18 months ago and I hope the Minister of State will indicate why it must be taken at this stage. However, I am sure his reasons are good.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair and Members for taking the Bill at this point. I also thank Senators O'Dowd, Walsh, Taylor-Quinn and Costello for their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must inform Senator Costello that, as far as I am concerned, there have been no constraints imposed in respect of the timing of the introduction of the legislation. I am pleased that the Seanad saw fit to take the Bill today. The duration of the debate is a matter for the House but I am prepared to stay for however long it takes in order to discuss this important matter. It is vital that we deal with this protocol and I am grateful to the House for allowing me to initiate the debate on the Bill. There is a hardened edge to <Col N="265" /> Ireland's activities on nuclear safety and it is vital that we are to the forefront in respect of ratifying this important protocolumn I am indebted to all concerned for allowing me to get this initiative off the ground.</P>
    <P>The spread of nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear arsenals is a highly emotive subject. There are many trouble spots throughout the world where, in the wrong hands, access to nuclear technology could be disastrous for mankind. Ireland is a small independent nation which has no pretensions to military might and which harbours no malice towards its neighbours. Anything we can do to make the world a safer place should be a high priority. Ireland's initiatives, which date back to the 1950s, have established a very proud tradition of encouraging the international community to take action to halt the threat of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>The Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT Treaty which will take place between 24 April and 19 May will hopefully allow the international community to make progress in reversing some of the adverse developments in the recent parts, particularly those in Asia. I anticipate that the Irish delegation, with the representatives of other like-minded countries, will work towards bringing about greater understanding of what should be done to overcome these problems so that effective steps can be taken to prevent future deployment of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent decision by the Russian Duma to approve the START ll Treaty. When fully implemented, this treaty will lead to large reductions in the numbers of strategic nuclear weapons in Russian and US arsenals. We hope that all ratification procedures can be completed in the shortest possible period in order to permit rapid entry into force.</P>
    <P>Members referred to Sellafield. Like other nuclear installations, Sellafield is subject to the new proliferation treaty. The UK is a key nuclear weapons state and is obliged to adhere to the provisions of that treaty.</P>

      <P>Senator-Taylor Quinn stated that she would like to hear more about the way the inspectorate will go about its work. I can inform her that this protocol will strengthen the transparency of nuclear safeguards. However, perhaps I should provide details in respect of the components of those safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Safeguards are applied most intensively at facilities containing materials &ndash; mostly plu<Col N="266" /> tonium and highly enriched uranium &ndash; that could be used to manufacture a nuclear explosive. Inspection goals, which take into account potential diversion paths and other technical criteria, are formulated to give top priority to such facilities and to verify the whereabouts of these materials.</P>
    <P>The IAEA uses nuclear material accountancy as its basic tool for safeguarding material declared by a state, pursuant to its safeguards agreement. This system establishes the quantities of nuclear material present in a nuclear facility and the changes in these quantities that take place over time and is comparable, in concept and procedure, to a financial accounting system. In addition, the IAEA receives and analyses reports on a regular basis from state authorities on the whereabouts of nuclear materials under their control. These reports cover stocks of nuclear fuel and the export/import of safeguarded materials and such equipment.</P>
    <P>At many nuclear installations, the IAEA uses surveillance cameras and other electronic techniques to complement accountancy and inspector activities by continuously and automatically recording activities in key places. Also used are specially designed small metal seals which are fixed to camera housings and other IAEA equipment to prevent undetected tampering or used at nuclear material storage areas or on containers to safeguard their contents.</P>
    <P>In some respects, the role of the IAEA inspectorate is analogous to that of an independent financial auditor. Both systems have the object of building confidence &ndash; the safeguards system builds confidence in the global community that states are complying with their non-proliferation commitments. The most visible components of the IAEA safeguards system are its inspectors. Under agreed rights of access, they regularly visit nuclear facilities to verify records, check instruments and surveillance equipment and confirm physical inventories of nuclear materials. They later prepare detailed reports for the IAEA and the states concerned.</P>
    <P>BNFL launched a huge public relations campaign on 18 April to offer its response to the reports that were published on 18 February. As far as we are concerned, an elaborate publicity campaign will not deflect us from our determination to see the cessation of activity at Sellafield. BNFL appears to be of the opinion that its response represents a comprehensive response to the major deficiencies at the Sellafield plant, including falsified documentation and unsafe management practices which were identified in the recent report of the UK's independent inspectorate. It is clear that BNFL is attempting to win back a measure of the public confidence it lost in the damning report of the NII.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue its campaign for the closure of Sellafield and I assure Senator Costello that every opportunity has been and will be used <Col N="267" /> to continue that campaign. The Danes have already given us their support and I am confident of further support from the other Nordic countries. I will meet with their representatives in the near future, following my recent meeting with my Danish colleague. The recent events at Sellafield as revealed by the two NII reports, are most disturbing. This Government has a duty to take the appropriate actions to protect its citizens within the scope of international law. I will not hesitate to undertake appropriate litigation against BNFL if I believe its operations are not complying with the provisions of international law. I have asked the Attorney General to re-open the examination of evidence for legal action concerning Sellafield with particular attention to the NII reports.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a technical measure to give effect <Col N="268" /> in Irish law to the provisions of an international protocol which will, if adopted worldwide, make it more difficult for rogue regimes to build up nuclear arsenals. I appreciate the cross-party support for this measure. In particular, I am resolved to see the early ratification of the protocol which this Bill will facilitate.</P>
