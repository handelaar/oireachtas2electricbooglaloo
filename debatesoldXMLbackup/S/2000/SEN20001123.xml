      <P>I have notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to clarify the future of Moneypoint generating station in light of recent ministerial statements relating to compliance with international environmental agreements, and the strategy, if any, that the Government is adopting to retain Moneypoint in operation.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Taoiseach to establish a population register forthwith.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes; No. 2, statements on Northern Ireland, to be taken not earlier than 3 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes. Senators may share time. Business to conclude no later than 6 p.m. Business shall be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a slight problem with the Order of Business as outlined by the Leader. I have another engagement at 3 p.m., as have most of the members of my party. I will talk to the Leader about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for his good wishes. I would miss the intellectual jousts I have with him here if I was not present. I will talk to him later to see if some arrangement can be made.</P>
      <P>One of the most fundamental rights in our Constitution is the right of Members of these Houses to come here unimpeded and without intimidation. Over the past few days we have seen intimidation and the impeding of Members coming here. We have seen action which is purely unconstitutional and it simply cannot be tolerated. We can look after ourselves in these Houses, we are strong enough to do so. What about the hundreds of people who are handicapped, the old, the young and people who are being impeded, intimidated or deprived of their right to travel due to what is happening? It is something which no civilised State can tolerate.</P>
      <P>I will not rehearse the arguments for or against what took place here yesterday. The Government has made an offer to talk to these people. Talking can only take place when there is no intimidation and an absence of the abusive behaviour and language that we have seen. The taxi people who may have a case have alienated the vast majority of public opinion. The longer they go on with their present activities the worse it is going to get. I call for sanity to be restored to this dispute so that talking can start.    </P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very long and detailed debate on that matter yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I must also crave the Cathaoirleach's indulgence. We must look at the Constitution. We are its guardians. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the right to assemble and protest, as Senator Manning has said, is a very precious right in any democracy. Article 40.6.1º.ii. of the Constitution is very clear and states in regard to the right of citizens to assemble: &ldquo;Provision may be made by law to prevent or control meetings which are . in the vicinity in either House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  We may pass legislation to deal with that.</P>
      <P>Section 28(1) of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, very clearly states: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any public meeting to be held . within one-half of a mile from any building in which both Houses . of the Oireachtas are .. sitting.&rdquo;, if it has been pointed out to any of the organisers that under section 28(1)(f2&gt;a) a chief superintendent has &ldquo;prohibited the holding of such meeting in or the passing of such procession along&rdquo; that vicinity. It is important to put that on the record of the House. Section 28(1)(f2&gt;b) provides that it shall not be lawful for a public meeting or procession to be held where a member of the Garda Síochána &ldquo;calls on the persons taking part in such meeting or procession to disperse&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening outside the House is an appalling image of democracy. It is like a Third <Col N="903" /> World country. I speak as someone who has organised major protests in this city. Every protest, whether by general trade unions, farmers, residents or whoever else, complies with the laws of the State, in consultation with the Garda, and by common consent is restricted to Molesworth Street or elsewhere. What is happening outside is wrong. We should value people's right to protest but we&mdash;</P>

      <P>We cannot reopen yesterday's debate on the Order of Business. I have given the Senator considerable latitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. However, I have not mentioned the topic of yesterday's debate. I am merely talking about the right of access to the Houses of Parliament, the law of the land and the Constitution of which we are guardians. What is happening outside is wrong. I do not want an over the top reaction. The right to protest is good. We have seen farmers, teachers, trade unionists, residents and many others make protests. That is what democracy is about. It is not about blocking participation in democracy.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform if a Garda superintendent or other member of the Garda asked the people who are blocking access to these Houses to disperse. If not, that should be done. These people are bringing into disrepute the right to protest and demonstrate which is&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday we called for a wide-ranging debate on industrial relations. There is a degree of industrial chaos abroad at present. This House and the airport are blockaded and besieged. There is an official and an unofficial way to protest. It is time for this House to have a full scale debate on taxis and many other matters.</P>
      <P>The trains are not running today. There was no air service yesterday. The teachers are on strike or, at least, are withdrawing their services. The Minister for Education and Science has reiterated that he will dock their pay. A range of industrial relations issues needs to be discussed.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House was kind enough to allow a debate on the taxi issue at short notice yesterday. We should have a similar debate today on the rest of the industrial chaos that is taking place.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan raised the issue of the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill yesterday. I think the Leader of the House stated it was no longer on the Order Paper. However, it is on the second page of the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>

      <P>The indication was that it was being taken off the Order Paper. It has been on the Order Paper for the past 18 months to two years. It is a very important Bill because it relates to acquiring rights over land to enable network operators to open and use public roads for the establishment and maintenance of telecommunications infrastructure and to provide for the sharing of such infrastructure. This is the time to deal with the telecommunications infrastructure in relation to public roads and sharing that infrastructure. I cannot understand why the Leader is not pressing ahead with this legislation. Will he clarify the matter? Are we getting alternative legislation or will this Bill be taken off the Order Paper?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>As you stated, a Chathaoirligh, we debated the taxi issue yesterday and I do not intend to reopen it. However, during the course of that debate I mentioned the aspect of people protesting outside the gates of the Houses. I am aware of the law Senator O'Toole quoted. However, that is not the most serious aspect. The disruption which means we find it difficult to get into the Houses is far less serious than the disruption caused to the commercial life of the country and the fact that people were unable to get to hospital or keep medical appointments. That is the aspect I would like to see dealt with.</P>
      <P>The Garda has dealt sensitively and correctly with these issues. It has been part of our tradition for farmers, teachers, trade unions and everybody else to come to the gates of these Houses and to disrupt traffic in the city. The last time I remember people being stopped from entering that zone was when the famous farmers' protest was stopped at the corner of Merrion Square. Procedures can be put in place, as they were at that time, to allow the through passage of essential services such as ambulances and other medical services.</P>
      <P>Yesterday Senator Tom Hayes raised the issue of the BSE crisis and what is happening in France. The Minister acted properly earlier in the week when the meeting was held in Brussels. It is good that testing will take place of cattle over 30 months that are under suspicion. However, it would be useful to debate the issue in its wider context in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to raise the issue of the BSE crisis and what has happened in France, but also the knock-on effect on our beef exports. A number of countries have talked about banning beef exports from certain counties in this country and others have threatened to ban beef exports from the entire country. That is a very serious issue. Last year there was a very serious protest about this issue and an agreement was reached between the beef processors and the beef pro<Col N="905" /> ducers, that is, the farmers, that a floor price would be paid for beef at abattoirs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for a debate. I want to elaborate slightly and I know you will indulge me, a Chathaoirligh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, Senator Tom Hayes made a very detailed case for a debate, which was supported by the other side of the House. I am allowing the Senator to support that but it is not in order for him to pre-empt that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In case the debate is confined to the BSE crisis and our exports, I would like it to focus on the effect this is having on beef producers' incomes. They have suddenly been very seriously affected at a crucial selling time for them. They are making huge financial losses. I want a prime focus of that debate, which I hope will take place next week, to be on that aspect of this crisis.</P>

      <P>The NUJ has responded in writing to the Seanad debate on standards in the media, particularly the article written by Mary Ellen Synon. It points out that she is not a member of the NUJ. However, does such a reputable and representative body not have influence on standards in general, particularly with management and editors?</P>
      <P>I wish to place on record that the Official Report of the House shows quite clearly that I made no reference at any time in this House to Mary Ellen Synon. On 11 October, I raised on the Order of Business the question of standards in the media. I focused on a very distasteful article on the Kilkenny tragedy but did not refer to Mary Ellen Synon. On 25 October, when other Members raised the question of Mary Ellen Synon, I spoke on the Kilkenny tragedy but made no reference to that issue. On 7 November, when a discussion took place in the House on the media in general, I spoke at length about the Kilkenny tragedy but made no reference whatsoever to Mary Ellen Synon. The only reference I made to the Paralympics was a single sentence in which I spoke of the Kilkenny tragedy and mentioned the other related question. It is very important that the NUJ sets the record straight.</P>
      <P>My respect for the profession of journalism is on the record and I repeat it here. I also repeat my admiration for journalists in general. In the absence of a press council, the NUJ has an important and pivotal role to play in maintaining standards in its profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past two years I have asked the Leader of the House for a debate on <Col N="906" /> the effects of radon gas and the Government's proposals to grant-aid people suffering from the effects of this. A recent report indicated that nearly 300 schools have over the acceptable level of radon gas. I ask the Leader to bring to the House the report of the radiation institute so that we can debate it and consider what can be done.</P>
      <P>I know, Sir, you are reluctant to have any further debate on the taxi dispute. Yesterday afternoon a friend had his car clamped at the back of the House. He had no objection to paying the release fee of £65, but as neither cash nor a cheque would be accepted by way of payment he asked if he could borrow my credit card. He could not understand why he could not drive up Kildare Street, which was blocked by taxis. Not only were they not clamped but the gardaí were standing around. There should be equality of treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>For the second day in a row thousands of rail commuters have been left stranded. They have missed work, medical and surgical appointments and planes at airports. Industrial relations are so bad in Iarnród Éireann it is like Mount Etna &ndash; there could be an eruption at any time. There is a long history of low pay and morale at the company. Will the Leader ask the relevant Minister to attend the House next week, preferably next Wednesday, to debate public relations in the company and the provision of a public transport service? I am sure she will find strong support in the House for any changes she may wish to bring about to improve matters and to provide a proper service for citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Quill's call for a debate on public transport. I am concerned about access to the House. When driving to the House today I was stopped by a garda at the junction of Nassau Street and Kildare Street and told I could not drive up Kildare Street. Another garda allowed me to proceed. As a Member of Seanad Éireann I say that is disgraceful. Last year a court injunction was placed on the farmers who were protesting outside the meat factories. They were fined for their illegal activities. What is happening with the taxis is also illegal. Why has equal treatment not been applied? The matter must be addressed.</P>
      <P>I support the call of Senators Dardis, Connor and Tom Hayes for a debate on the BSE crisis. The recent meeting on testing produced good results and will benefit Irish agriculture, especially the beef industry. With regard to the unrest among teachers, I compliment Nick Killeen who spoke as an elected member of an educational body when he called on children to attend school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to my call yesterday for a debate on the BSE crisis, I must emphasise to the Leader the vital importance of providing an assurance to consumers. Many people are concerned about BSE and the safety of our meat. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural <Col N="907" /> Development must give even greater assurances. It is vital that when the Minister attends the House to debate the issue he gives the assurance consumers need. I am confident he can provide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on the BSE crisis. Given the crisis in France and the knock-on effect on the beef industry here, farmers are unable to have their cattle slaughtered and they are being offered very poor prices. With Christmas approaching this is having a very serious effect on the beef farmers. No Member could understand the seriousness of the situation. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to attend the House to explain the consequences of the recent meeting with EU Ministers? I compliment the Minister on his stand and on the way he handled the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Members have spoken of the right to access and to travel. Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the right of the people of County Monaghan to acute hospital services? Following two reports by so-called expert working groups, commissioned by the North Eastern Health Board, the people of County Monaghan will be denied access to acute hospital services. Most importantly, this week alone they will be denied access to acute maternity services in Monaghan General Hospital. This has arisen because of the lack of investment by the health board in the hospital over the last 20 years. Will the Leader ask the Minister to look favourably on our case? As matters stand the people in County Monaghan will be denied the right to a health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the BSE crisis. It is important that the Minster outlines the present position and what he and his Department are doing to address the issue. There is a need to assure consumers within the Irish and European markets. The debate will also afford the Minister the opoportunity to outline the funding to be allocated to the CAP over the next six years.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Quill's call on the Minister for Public Enterprise to attend the House to outline the results of her discussions with Irish Rail, including the unions and the board. The Minister should also outline her plans for addressing the serious lack of public transport facilities. We in the west have had a disrupted service during the last seven to eight months, especially on the Westport railway line, because of strikes and repairs. Given the investment programme, it is important for the Minister to outline the up-to-date position and to indicate if and when the public will see improvements in the service.</P>

      <P>I call on members of the ASTI to come down off their high horse. They are adopting an attitude that they are superior to all other teachers. They should recognise that they are on a par with them, no better or no worse. They need to enter the real world and stop making pawns of the students. They should realise that the livelihood and future of leaving certificate students depend on how well they do in the examination. Yet these teachers are prepared to put the students at risk for their own selfish gains.</P>

      <P>I take it that in view of the Tánaiste's reaffirmation of the groceries order, for all of the reasons she outlined and with which this House concurred almost unanimously, the Minister will rely on his own judgment and past decisions and will not deviate from the Goodbody Consultants recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise, I was not in the House for the start of the Order of Business. My point is that the ills of Dublin should not be imposed on people in rural Ireland. The Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, included provisions for 9% stamp duty <Col N="909" /> and 2% tax on second homes. We foresee huge difficulties arising as a result of this, particularly in County Donegal where there has been huge investment in the building industry. Donegal does not have the same housing difficulties as Dublin and I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter prior to the forthcoming budget and to amend the legislation accordingly.</P>

      <P>We have all seen on our televisions in recent weeks the manner in which the Florida Supreme Court operates. The judges there do not sport the medieval garb and wigs which are in evidence in the Four Courts. The US system befits a republic far better than ours which is a throwback to colonial days. I ask the Leader to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We should have a legal system with which people can identify.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Dardis and Rory Kiely highlighted the difficulties experienced by Members in travelling to and from the Houses of the Oireachtas and I agree fully with the sentiments expressed. The Government has made an offer to the drivers and I call on everyone concerned to get around the table and start negotiating. To date, the taxi drivers have provided a very good service to the best of their ability in circumstances which were not ideal. However, the manner in which they are conducting their protest is not winning them support for their cause.</P>
      <P>They had an opportunity to protest yesterday but today it is time to negotiate. The drivers' case will be listened to at the negotiating table in the same way as the cases of other groups have been. Handicapped people, elderly people, business people and workers all have a right to go about their business and I believe the majority of drivers will recognise that a resolution can only be arrived at through negotiation. I will pass on Senators' views to the Minister after the Order of Business and look forward to the negotiations being concluded successfully.</P>
      <P>A debate on industrial relations has been sought on numerous occasions, with Senators Farrell and Costello making a particularly forceful call this morning. I am pleased to inform the House that I have allocated an entire day on 7 December for this debate and I am hopeful that the Minister will be present.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan asked me about the status of the telecommunications legislation yesterday. I informed him that I understood the Bill had been withdrawn but I will seek clarification on the matter and report to the House next Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Dardis, Connor, Rory Kiely, Tom Hayes, O'Brien and Chambers called for a debate on the beef industry and I will provide time for such a debate. This is an industry which exports 90% of its produce and is, therefore, extremely important to the Irish economy. I will provide <Col N="910" /> time for an all-day debate on BSE issues and the beef industry in general. We owe our thanks to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for the determined manner in which he conveyed the seriousness of the position in which Irish farmers and the Government find themselves in a recent television interview in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator Ó Murchú's clarification this morning with which I am in agreement. In the absence of a press council the NUJ is obliged to uphold standards in the industry. The NUJ felt very strongly about the article in question which appalled the entire country.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan called for a debate on radon gas and I will leave time for this. Senators Quill and Chambers called for the Minister for Public Enterprise to come into the House for a debate on transport in general and the rail service in particular. I will endeavour to meet this request.</P>
    <P>I will pass Senator Leonard's views in regard to the entitlement of the people of County Monaghan to a health service on to the Minister. Everybody is entitled to such a service and the people of County Monaghan are no exception.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan called for a debate on retail planning guidelines which are to be published shortly. I will leave time for such a debate. The Senator will be aware that the Minister has already taken action on the square footage to be allocated for such activity in the future in an attempt to protect long-standing family businesses.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner called on the Minister for Finance to review the 2% tax on second homes. I understand this was considered but could not be implemented as it would carry on to second, third and fourth homes. However, I will pass on the Senator's views to the Minister.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A momentous demographic transition is currently under way in most industrialised countries. Low fertility rates compared with those which prevailed in earlier decades combined with increasing life expectancy will soon lead to populations that are older and more dependent on transfers than ever before. At the same time lower rates of <Col N="911" /> population growth and declining productivity are likely to result in slower rates of economic growth. Maintaining the real level of pensions and other social transfers in these conditions holds out the unpalatable prospect of either substantially higher tax burdens on the economically active population, substantially worsened public finances, severe restrictions on non-pension expenditure, or some combination of all three unpalatable options.</P>
      <P>Awareness of the fiscal and economic risks implied by these developments has led to debate about the structure of the pension system in other countries. For example, Germany, which is set to experience a more immediate and severe demographic problem than Ireland, is currently considering plans for pension reform. Their plan includes a reduction of benefits from the pay as you go system, support for private pension funds and more support for company pensions. Other options which have been mooted internationally include raising the age of retirement, cutting back on pension entitlements and linking pensions to the age of retirement so that the older one retires the larger the pension received.</P>
      <P>Ireland is not immune from these trends. In common with other industrialised countries, we are set to experience a significant ageing of our population over the coming decades. The resulting increased dependency ratio will give rise to serious budgetary issues. In particular, it will put severe strain on the capacity of future Governments to continue to fund social welfare and public service pension liabilities on the current pay as you go basis. The purpose of the Bill before the House is to put in place a mechanism to address this issue. It aims to meet part of the escalating cost of pensions by providing for the establishment of a national pensions reserve fund. The Bill marks a radical departure in the management of the public finances and introduces a new strategic long-term element into budgetary planning.</P>
      <P>The position in Ireland is slightly better than elsewhere but the longer term trend towards an older population is similar to that in other countries. Almost uniquely in the industrialised world our age dependency ratio will actually decline a little over the next few years. Currently we have, and will continue to have for most of this decade, about five people of working age for each person over 65 years. However, the position will begin to change at the end of the decade. By 2016 it is projected that there will be about four persons of working age to support each pensioner. This trend will continue and by mid-century it is projected that there will be only two people of working age for every pensioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that this greying of the population will have profound implications for Exchequer spending on pensions, health care and other services. The social welfare pension issue was considered in National Pensions Policy Initiative, a report by the Pensions Board to the Minister for <Col N="912" /> Social, Community and Family Affairs in May 1998. That report recommended the partial prefunding of the projected growth in social welfare pensions.</P>
    <P>This issue and the wider budgetary issues posed by ageing were considered by a number of groups in my Department, principally the budget strategy for ageing group, BSTAG, whose report was published in July 1999. Taking the work of these groups together and updating conclusions to take account of the most recent data, the position in which we are likely to find ourselves can be summarised as follows. The current Exchequer cost of public service and social welfare pensions is 4.7% of GNP; by 2026 the Exchequer cost of broadly maintaining this level of pension provision will rise to 8.1% of GNP and by 2056 this cost will have risen to 12.4% of GNP. This increase is merely to maintain the existing level of service. Any relative improvements that might occur in pension provision would, of course, add further to the cost.</P>
    <P>The prospects of funding the increased expenditure which I have outlined from economic growth are not bright. As the population ages we will not be able to fuel growth through an expansion of the labour force as we have done over the last few years. In this changed scenario, growth will have to be sustained by productivity gains alone and levels are likely to converge to the norm for advanced industrial societies. I have tried to illustrate the magnitude of the task facing the country. Fortunately, because of our predominantly young population and the economic boom, we have both the time and the capacity to prepare for the burden. Indeed our young population and the resultant increase in the labour force has been a significant contributory factor to our current strong economic performance. These favourable conditions are set to continue into the next decade and we can expect to achieve significant budget surpluses over the next few years. The consolidation of our budgetary position through the running of surpluses and the consequent decline in our level of indebtedness will of themselves improve our capacity to deal with the issues posed by ageing. However, we have the opportunity to go further, to take advantage of these favourable economic conditions and to provide now for more normal circumstances as the growth in the economy tapers off when the bulge in the young population passes through.</P>
    <P>Up to now, the Exchequer costs of social welfare and public service pensions have been met as they arise &ndash; like many other countries Ireland operates a pay as you go approach to funding these costs. If a pay as you go system is to be stable, there must be sufficient workers, who are sufficiently productive, to finance the cost of pensions for those who have retired.</P>
    <P>In the past, this requirement has been met in this country and it will continue to be met in the medium term. However, we now know that it will not be met in the long term. If we do nothing to anticipate that development now, the con<Col N="913" /> sequence will be either that taxes will have to rise dramatically when that time arrives or the value of pensions in real terms will have to be reduced. The Government does not want to leave future generations of pensioners in a position where maintenance of the current level of pension cover could be put at risk.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is, therefore, to move from complete reliance on pay as you go and introduce part funding of our future liabilities. Put simply, the Bill involves setting aside some of the revenues generated by the strength of the economy and our favourable demographics, investing them and drawing them down in the future when growth rates are likely to be slower and the age dependency burden very much increased.</P>
    <P>Given the magnitude of the prospective costs involved and the many other competing demands on the State's finances it would be unrealistic to expect the Government to fully fund the increased costs of ageing in advance. The budget strategy for ageing group estimated that about 3.5% of GNP would have to be set aside annually to equalise the Exchequer burden of health and pension costs over the next 50 years. This is simply too much to expect of any generation. What I am proposing in the Bill is more modest but also more achievable. It involves the setting aside and investing of 1% of GNP annually to meet part of the cost of future pensions. The Bill will also allow the Government to make additional contributions to the fund. As Members are aware, we have already decided that the net proceeds of the sale of Telecom Éireann, now Eircom, are to be paid into the fund. This money has been lodged to the temporary holding fund for superannuation liabilities under the control of the NTMA. Once this legislation has been enacted, it will be paid into the reserve fund.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that drawdowns from the fund will commence in 2025 and will continue to at least 2055 in accordance with ministerial rules. These rules will require draw downs to be calculated by reference to the number of persons over 65 years of age in the population during the period from 2025 to 2055 or later, with the aim of avoiding extreme variations in the net Exchequer position from year to year. This will link withdrawals from the fund to increases in the pension bill while providing for a smoothing of the budgetary impact of ageing over the period. The extent to which the fund will contribute to the increased cost of pensions in the long term depends on a number of factors, principally the extent of the additional payments into the fund on top of the annual 1% of GNP and the return the fund achieves on its investments.</P>
    <P>While we know the contribution will be substantial, it is impossible to forecast exactly how large it will be. The Bill provides in section 6(1)(f2&gt;h) for the regular assessment of the State's long-term pension liabilities and of the capacity of the fund to meet these liabilities. It will be a <Col N="914" /> matter for future Governments to monitor this relationship and to take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>I should stress that in earmarking such substantial moneys for the fund, the Government is in no way neglecting the current needs of our society. Contributions to the fund are not being made at the expense of other goals and commitments. Because of our economic success we are in the happy position of being able to prefund, within a sustainable budgetary strategy which will also allow for substantial infrastructural and other capital investment under the national development plan, for continuing implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, for further improvements in public services and for ongoing reduction in the national debt. In short, the economic success which we have worked so hard to achieve allows us to make provision for future pension liabilities without compromising on our more immediate economic and societal goals.</P>
    <P>While making an annual 1% of GNP contribution to the fund poses no difficulties for the Exchequer at the moment, I recognise that Senators may have concerns that the contribution could cause problems in more adverse economic circumstances. However, it is the Government's opinion that any short-term difficulties that the payment may cause the Exchequer are more than offset by the long-term gain.</P>
    <P>To leave discretion in the making of the 1% contribution in times of economic difficulty would, I am convinced, undermine the whole basis of the fund. I do not need to remind the House of the straits in which prioritising short-term interests over the longer-term sustainability of the public finances has left us in the past. I believe that a 1% of GNP contribution is a prudent and sustainable commitment. Once built into the multi-annual budgetary structure it should not cause undue difficulty. To put it into perspective, the contribution is slightly less than our annual contribution to the EU budget and less than one third of the interest payment on the national debt.</P>
    <P>I wish to set out a few of the key principles which I have enshrined in the legislation establishing the fund. I am extremely conscious that it is the people's money that is being invested in the fund and I have, therefore, purposely structured the fund in a manner which will enable it match the returns achieved by private pension funds. This is reflected in three key features of the Bill.</P>
    <P>First, the fund will be managed by commissioners who will be independent of Government. They will control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund. Given the responsibilities to be placed upon the commissioners, it is essential to ensure that those appointed have the ability and expertise to make a constructive contribution to the management of the fund. To this end the legislation specifies that appointees must have acquired substantial experi<Col N="915" /> ence at senior management level in relevant areas.</P>
    <P>Second, this investment strategy will be based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long term subject to prudent risk management. On this point, I should state that given its large size in comparison to the size of the Irish market, it is inevitable that most of the fund will be invested abroad.</P>
    <P>In this connection, Senators may ask if the commissioners should be required to take other national objectives into account when determining an investment mandate for the fund. It is my firm view that any dilution of the commercial nature of the investment mandate, for example by requiring the commissioners to maintain a certain level of investment in the Irish economy, could seriously compromise the returns achieved by the fund. Placing a statutory obligation on the commission to give priority to investment in Ireland could expose the commission to pressure to make commercially sub-optimal decisions.</P>
    <P>It is worth repeating that the purpose of the fund and the justification for asking the taxpayer to make a contribution to it of 1% of GNP each year is to provide, as far as possible, for the costs of future pensions. I believe the State has a solemn duty to do everything it can in accordance with prudence to maximise the return on this investment. The use of fund moneys for any other objective, no matter how laudable, should not be countenanced. Such objectives, if worth achieving, can be attained in other ways.</P>
    <P>Third, in order to ensure that the fund cannot be raided by future Governments for any other purpose besides the meeting of pension costs, I have provided for a prohibition on drawdowns prior to 2025. As I have already said, drawdowns after that date will be determined under ministerial rules by reference to projected increases in the number of persons over 65 in the population.</P>
    <P>Having highlighted these key features I wish to set out the main provisions of the Bill. In summary the Bill provides for the establishment of the fund to provide towards the Exchequer cost of social welfare and public service pensions from 2025 onwards; a statutory obligation to pay a sum equivalent to 1% of gross national product from the Exchequer into the fund each year until at least 2055 &ndash; provision is also made for the payment of additional sums into the fund from time to time; the establishment of an independent commission to control and manage the fund &ndash; the commission will have discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund; a strictly commercial investment mandate for the fund with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term subject to prudent risk management; a prohibition on drawdowns from the fund prior to 2025 &ndash; drawdowns thereafter will be determined under ministerial rules by reference to projected increases in the number of persons over 65 and with a view to <Col N="916" /> avoiding large fluctuations in the net Exchequer balance; the appointment of the National Treasury Management Agency as manager of the fund to act as agent of the commission &ndash; the appointment of the agency will be for a period of ten years, following which there will be the option, at five yearly intervals, to extend this further or to appoint an alternative manager; the appointment by the commission of investment managers to invest and manage portions of the fund and custodians to ensure the safekeeping and security of the assets of the fund; accountability of the commission to the Minister for Finance and to the Dáil &ndash; this includes provision for detailed annual reports and for appearance of the commission chairperson and the chief executive or the manager before the Committee of Public Accounts; and the transfer of the £5 billion currently in the temporary holding fund to the reserve fund and the winding up of the temporary holding fund.</P>
    <P>It should be stressed that the fund is intended to be an instrument of long-term budgetary sustainability. It will lower the peak of pension payments to be met from the Exchequer in the second and third quarters of this century and thus bring about a smoother pattern of change in the Exchequer pension bill during those years. Starting now it enables us to set aside revenues from our favourable demographic position and our strong budgetary position.</P>
    <P>The fund does not provide a complete solution to the budgetary problems posed by population ageing but it makes a start. It will allow us to begin preparing on a systematic basis for longer-term budgetary problems facing us in an ageing society. It marks a radical departure in the management of the public finances by introducing a new strategic long-term element into budgetary planning and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The run-up to the budget must be a very demanding period for the Minister. I am pleased he has taken time off this morning to come into the House and present this Bill.</P>
      <P>Most European countries face serious concerns about the future funding of pensions for the ageing population. Given that the proportion of older people in Europe will increase dramatically in the near future, Governments must consider how they can continue to fund pensions, to say nothing of improving them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparation for this debate I requested from the Department of Finance a copy of the progress report to the ECOFIN Council on the impact of ageing population on public pension systems. I thank the officials in that Department for forwarding a copy of that report. The analysis of the working group on the implications of the ageing population suggested that the demographic developments will soon result in pressure on public expenditure. However, the intensity of these effects will vary across member states. These differences reflect both the different impact and tim<Col N="917" /> ing of demographic pressures and the significant difference of pension regimes in Europe.</P>
    <P>The report went on to recommend that member states should adopt appropriate measures to make sure that such pressures do not undermine the long-term sustainability of their public finances. I believe this Bill is endeavouring to do just that. It was interesting to read in the report what is happening in Europe. By 2050 the overall population in Europe will decline by over 3% and the number of people aged 65 and over in proportion to the working population will roughly go from 25% to 50% over 20 years.</P>
    <P>While we face these issues along with our European partners, we are in a more advantageous position for a number of reasons. First, our population, which is increasing, is one of the youngest in Europe. I read recently that we have the lowest death rate in Europe. We have also returning emigrants and refugees. A serious shift in the balance between the working and older population will not occur until approximately 2020. We have an advantage of 20 years over our European partners in this area. Second, we have a well constructed pension system. However, I have learned from the report that social welfare has three pillars, the first relates to the social welfare pensions, the second to pension funds originating in an agreement between employers and employees and the third pillar covers individual pension schemes.</P>
    <P>More importantly, the economic growth we are enjoying gives us the opportunity to put in place sound pension systems for the future. While the population is still comparatively young, it is just a matter of time before the age profile changes. The Actuarial Review of Social Welfare Pensions, published in 1997, highlights that a proportion of people over pension age will increase dramatically in this century. While there are now five people at work for every retired person, by the middle of the century there will be one pensioner for every two people at work. While at present there are approximately 400,000 people over the age of 65, it is estimated that this will double by the year 2031 and will go over the one million mark by 2056. This will lead to a major increase in the cost of funding these pensions if people are to enjoy a decent level of income in their old age.</P>
    <P>The traditional approach of Governments in Ireland and elsewhere to pensions has been a commitment to the PAYE arrangement. In the case of social welfare, this was achieved by successive Governments topping up the social insurance fund, which was always inadequate to meet the cost of social welfare benefits. I was pleased to discover recently that this fund has a surplus of £630 million which reflects the economic growth we are enjoying. More people are in employment and are contributing to the fund. Given the sharp fall in unemployment, there is less demand on the fund. I do not understand why the Minister has not made provision in the Bill <Col N="918" /> for the surplus in this fund to be included in the pension reserve fund.</P>
    <P>It is clear from demographic projections that the proportion of people aged 65 and over will rise significantly after the year 2020. For this reason, I believe it prudent that we should make provision for our pension schemes in the future. If we fail to do so in the years to come, people will have to pay higher taxes to meet the pensions of the aging population.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment, financing, investment and management of a reserve fund aimed at meeting part of the escalating Exchequer cost for social welfare and public service pensions up to the year 2025. The reserve fund will get a kick start with an investment of £3.6 billion raised through the privatisation of Telecom Éireann. In addition, it is proposed to add 1% of GNP until the year 2055. There will be a provision on any Government accessing the fund before the year 2025 when the first pensions will be drawn down. In his reply the Minister might explain what will happen after 2025, for what purpose will the drawdown be made on the fund and how will it be limited.</P>
    <P>While I support the principle of the Bill, I have some difficulty in supporting the concept that 1% of gross national product should be set aside each year for the fund. I understand this currently amounts to approximately £600 million per year. It is fine to set aside this kind of money when there are budget surpluses, but I am sure the day will come when we will be in deficit. It seems strange that we are committing ourselves and future Governments for a long period to such a generous commitment to this fund. Our economy is very strong at present. I am sure the Minister will agree that the weakness of the euro has led to our economic trading with England, America and other parts of the world being of great advantage to Irish producers. However, this wealth in the economy will not continue forever. Has the Minister considered any other mechanism for varying the rate of contribution to the fund, for example, a higher amount if the finances of the State are higher or a smaller amount if the finances of the State are weaker? It is all right to provide for a 1% contribution at a time of prosperity when the State can afford it.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the management of the fund as this is a crucial issue in relation to the legislation. The Minister in his wisdom has appointed the National Treasury Management Agency to be the first manager of the fund. It will manage the fund for the first ten years. The Bill also provides for the setting up of a commission to be comprised of people with great experience in financial and legal matters. I have some difficulty in understanding the function of the first manager of the fund and the commissioners. Will the first manager of the fund be the executive manager and will the commission, to use the analogy of a private pension fund, be the trustees of the fund? Will they have any function in the appointment of fund managers? Can the Minister <Col N="919" /> assure me that he is satisfied there will be no conflict between the role of the manager of the fund and the independence of the commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a strictly commercial investment mandate for the funds with the objective of securing the ultimate return over the long-term, subject to prudent risk management. While the Bill prohibits the commission or its fund managers from investing in Irish bonds, nevertheless, I hope some of the funds will be invested in the Irish economy with a view to improving our infrastructure. I realise the Irish economy is far too limited for a fund of this size. As a result the major portion of the fund will be invested abroad.</P>
    <P>The fund managers will have the responsibility of deciding to invest in funds that are actively or passively managed. I have read that passive fund managers who follow the index got a better return over a period than active fund managers. This was borne out by a study carried out by Chase de Vere, an independent financial adviser. They studied 474 funds investing in Britain, 109 in Europe, 110 in America and 19 in Japan over five years. It used the appropriate index in each country as the benchmark and compared returns before fees. Only two of the 474 British investment funds have consistently beaten the FTSE index in the past five years. According to the survey the overwhelming majority of unit trusts are seriously under-performing and investors are missing on thousands of pounds as a result.</P>
    <P>When investing overseas, active fund managers have a better record and the survey revealed that five of the 109 European funds beat the FTSE European index every year for the past five years. However, not a single American fund beat the index in that time but an impressive 80 of 110 funds managed to beat the Dow Jones in the past three years. The Japanese fund managers are the most consistent with the majority beating the index most of the time. The survey concluded that there are simply too many funds and too much dross but that active management will be better in the future.</P>
    <P>It is crucially important for the managers of this fund to get a good return. The return on the fund is crucial to its success. It must achieve a rate higher than the rate of interest being paid on the national debt. If the fund earns less than the rate which is being paid on the national debt it will fail because it would be better to pay off the national debt.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that more publicity has not been attached to the proposed measures in the legislation. I am pleased that one commentator described the measures proposed as a crucial new strategy. He stated that it is not just imaginative but in a way it is very brave, it represents a fundamental departure from the time honoured ways of providing State pensions and, critically, from traditional methods of Government accounting, which are often limited to very short-term views. Given the reservations I have expressed, I would have difficulty disagreeing with his comments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> I was reminded this morning by Senator Ross that I will not be a beneficiary of the fund. I had already realised this as I am unlikely to live until 2025. Nevertheless, it is important that we provide for the future and for that reason I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House during this busy time. I am sure we will see him in the House more frequently during the next month. I wish him well for his fourth budget and I hope no banana skins lie in his path, as happened last year. The more successful one is the more trouble one draws on oneself.</P>
      <P>This Bill represents the Minister's and the Government's delivery on the commitment made in July 1999 partially to prefund the Exchequer cost of social welfare and public service pensions. This is a major step forward from procedures operated by Governments in the past when all expenditure was provided on an annual basis from the income of that year. That procedure was described by the Minister as a pay as you go system. There was a continued liability and commitment that State employees and social welfare recipients would receive their pensions at retirement age. This Bill provides the process to provide partial funding now for expenditure in the future. The present system is based on the assumption that sufficient workers will be there with sufficient productivity to provide funding for the day to day running of the State and to finance the cost of pensions for those who are retiring. Demographic trends show this will not be the case in the future.</P>
      <P>The new national pensions reserve fund is probably one of the most important initiatives in economic policy undertaken by any Government in the history of the State. Few other countries have such a fund in place. The fact that we are able to embark on such a road is a reflection on our strong fiscal position which has come about through record economic success, unprecedented growth and prudent management of the economy leading to large budgetary surpluses over the last four years.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the steps he has taken to move away from providing for old age and public service pensions from current revenue, as has been the case in the past. It is a natural progression to regulate for such pensions, providing at least for partial funding and managing the situation by budgeting and projecting into the future. In the past many private companies provided for the pensions of their employees out of current revenue. Such companies got into financial difficulties and when liquidated, employee pension funds were denuded of funding. Were funding difficulties to arise because of a large increase in the pension payments for State employees and social welfare recipients in the future due to an ageing population, the State could provide for this by increased taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not wish to return to the old days of the 1970s and 1980s, now that we have succeeded in <Col N="921" /> reducing the standard and high rates of tax so spectacularly. The Government acted in relation to private pension schemes by the introduction of the 1991 Pensions Act and the setting up of the Pensions Board. Private pension schemes are regulated to ensure that employees' pensions are funded properly and not from current revenue. This Bill is an attempt to provide at least partial funding for future social welfare and public service pensions so that we do not face difficulties in the second quarter of this century.</P>
    <P>Despite the Pensions Act, there are difficulties regarding the fund management of private pension schemes. One of the main functions of the Pensions Board is to monitor the operation of pension schemes to make sure they comply with the requirements of the 1991 Pensions Act. In the last three years there have been difficulties in relation to compliance with the requirements of the Act. Shortcomings pinpointed include delays in registering schemes with the Pensions Board, delays in producing annual audited accounts and actuarial valuations and failure to notify members that documents, such as annual reports, are available.</P>
    <P>The widespread inability to comply with a ten year old law can hardly inspire confidence in the pensions industry or in its monitoring authority, the Pensions Board. The 1991 Act requires pension schemes to submit annual funding certificates showing they are investing enough money to cover the pension liability they have built up since 1991 and they have until 1 January 2001 to provide adequate funding to cover liabilities built up before 1991. While the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill provides only a partial funding of future State pensions, some lessons can be learned from private company pension schemes. Some aspects of the Bill may need to be improved on. The Government is committed to setting aside 1% of the gross national product each year. This figure is currently £600 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Last December interim legislation was passed to establish a temporary holding fund for these superannuation liabilities while the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill was awaited. While many of us purchased Telecom Éireann shares and felt aggrieved at their purchase, we see that the Government acted prudently by investing part of the proceeds of the sale of Telecom Éireann in that temporary fund. I congratulate Senator Ross on standing up for the ordinary investor. Shares in Eircom have recovered in value in the past few months and investors may recover their initial capital. A sum of £3 billion was invested in the interim fund before the end of 1999 and a further £1.8 billion has been lodged in the current year. This is made up from the proceeds of the sale of Telecom Éireann and £1.2 billion of Exchequer funding. The temporary holding fund is being managed in short term deposits and financial instruments by the National Treasury Management Agency until the national pensions reserve fund is established. Moneys in the holding fund <Col N="922" /> will be transferred to the new fund and the temporary fund will then be closed.</P>
    <P>Social welfare and public service pensions have increased dramatically in recent years. It is the Government's intention to provide this reserve fund with annual contributions, at least until 2055. From 2025 onwards the fund will partially assist in meeting the cost of State pensions. The legislation will enable the Government of the day to lodge additional sums to the fund from time to time, by resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill will allow for the establishment of an independent commission, to be known as the national pensions reserve fund commission, which will control and manage the fund. It is hoped this commission will adopt and implement an investment strategy based on good commercial principles. While adopting the objective of achieving maximum possible returns, the commission will also be prudent in its dealing with risk management decisions. The fund is structured to match returns in private pension funds. The National Treasury Management Agency will act as agents for the commission in managing the fund for the initial ten years. Matters will then be reviewed and other fund managers may be appointed. Detailed annual reports will ensure the commission is accountable to the Minister and to the Houses of the Oireachtas. Provision is also made for the chairperson of the commission to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. Given the events of the past year, this will, no doubt, encourage prudent management.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables the period for the provision of 1% of GDP for the fund to be extended beyond 2055 or for such payments to be tapered off after that date. Payments to the fund will be made in equal quarterly instalments. Drawdowns from the fund will be prohibited until 2025 and drawdowns after that will be determined with reference to the projected increase in our population over 65 years of age. Fluctuations in the net Exchequer balance from year to year will be avoided.</P>
    <P>It is a wise decision to provide funding now for future expenditure. We are going through a period of unprecedented economic growth, but this may not last indefinitely. The budget surplus of today may not last in the future and we could go back to the deficits which, in the past, required borrowing to provide for current expenditure such as social welfare and State pensions. Such expenditure in the 1970s and 1980s led to large increases in our national debt.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for a radical change in the management of public finances. The fruits of economic success enjoyed by the State in recent years and which will be enjoyed in the immediate future will contribute to the long-term well-being of our society, particularly our pensioners in the future. At present we have a ratio of 5:1 in terms of the number of pensioners to the number in the workforce. This is projected to rise to 2:1 by the middle of the century. Demographic population <Col N="923" /> trends show that we will face a significant ageing of our population in the coming decades.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be complimented on moving now with the windfall of funds at his disposal and for setting up this fund. Others would have used the funding to satisfy the many demands on Ministers for Finance or to increase public expenditure. The fund cannot be raided for other matters or demands. It is purely to meet the cost of pension provisions arising from the ageing of the population.</P>
    <P>Growth levels cannot be achieved in future through expansion of the labour force. Our present young population and sustained economic growth guarantee us the time and the capacity to provide the funding for future high levels of pensions. The present labour force has been a significant factor in the strong economic performance experienced over the last number of years which is projected to last at least in the short term. A reduction of the national debt has been tackled and this will ensure additional funding is available to provide funds for pensions in the future for both public service and contributory and non-contributory pensions. The Minister has gone further by providing funding to the pension reserve fund.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill are radical and innovative and the policy implications are significant with important consequences for future pensioners. Present pensions have been funded on an annual ongoing basis. Contributions to date by public servants towards their pensions have not gone into a pension fund and payment of pensions has been from general Exchequer funds. PRSI contributions have gone into a social welfare fund and, until recently, withdrawals from that fund exceeded the levels of contribution and excess payments had to be funded by the Exchequer. Many of us in the financial area have always regarded PRSI payments as an additional rate of income tax due to the set up in place.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister has not amalgamated the present £630 million surplus in this national pension reserve fund. He explained to the Dáil the reasons for this. Because of this, it will be necessary to draw on the social fund reserve before 2005, the date that drawdowns commence under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill may be divided into six parts which clearly outline the role of the national pension reserve fund commission and the administration of the actions of the national pension reserve fund. The Bill deals with the national pension reserve commission which will control and manage the pension fund. The primary function of the commission will be to determine an investment strategy. This will include decisions to be taken in relation to assets and allocations and will set appropriate benchmarks in regard to the overall performance of the fund and of particular assets in which the fund is to be invested.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the fund cannot be invested in Government securities. This restric<Col N="924" /> tion ensures that funds may not be used at some future date to support Government borrowing. The Minister said the Bill does not prevent the fund investing in infrastructural projects on a public private partnership basis. What the commissioners must do, however, before investing in any assets in this country or abroad is have regard to the commercial investment mandate of the fund. The mandate will prevent pressures being placed on the commissioners to make commercially devious investments, but time will tell.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the legislation is strong enough to insulate the fund from future improper demands. The manager of the fund must be given a clear mandate. Nobody wants the fund to hold totally speculative shares. If there are to be ethical constraints on investment policy, these should be specified from the start. To avoid the temptations to raid the fund on the part of future Ministers for Finance, it might be wise to have the law preclude the fund from investing in any Irish assets.</P>
    <P>Future generations will remember this Minister for Finance and, I am sure, pay tribute to him for what he has done in this Bill long after the rows and troubles in relation to individualisation and the credit unions have been forgotten. He has been able to provide £2 billion in tax cuts in his last three budgets. The PPF and tax cuts in next month's budget will highlight the prudent way he has managed the economy. The provision of this national pension reserve fund through budget surpluses and prudent investment of funds from the sale of State assets will ensure that the Minister will be remembered as the best Minister for Finance in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made many other changes during his term in office in relation to pensions and social welfare, particularly for the elderly. The Government has always supported the implementation of tax breaks to encourage people in the private and public sectors to invest in pension plans during their working life. Changes in the last two budgets in relation to the increased contribution rules, depending on age, and the freeing up of funds and maturities will be of great benefit to many professional and self-employed people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also made other changes in relation to pensions. I hope we will see the old age contributory pension increased to £105 in the next budget &ndash; £5 more than what was committed to when the Government came into office. I would like to see non-contributory pensions, which are lagging slightly behind, brought up to in excess of £100 per week as well. The Minister and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs have provided medical cards to all those over 75 years of age and many other improved social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>There are many other changes which could be made even to something simple like the fuel allowance for the elderly and the provision of better health care facilities for the elderly. I refer, in particular, to the carer's allowance. I know this is <Col N="925" /> a very difficult matter and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has made huge improvements in the carer's allowance, but we have to move away from the situation we have faced and plan for the future. We need to provide for carers more on the basis of need. Many of us come across very difficult and sad cases but due to means testing, etc., no additional help can be given. Each case should be looked at on its merits and on the basis of need and incapacity rather than on the basis of the structure in place today.</P>
    <P>Between now and 2056 there is likely to be a fall of approximately 5% in the working population and an increase of the order of 160% in the population over 65 years of age. The partial pre-funding of future pension liabilities through this national pension reserve fund is a prudent step which will go some way towards easing the budgetary burden for the next generation. What is perhaps unusual in this country is that our relatively favourable demographic position gives us a little more time than other countries to do something about the problem. A relatively favourable budgetary position also gives us the capacity to do something. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suspicious of unanimity and reluctant to joint in any unanimity about a financial Bill. I find the lack of criticism of this Bill from all sides of the House strange. I do not quite understand it. It is very sensible to be provident about the future, particularly given the demographics in this country and elsewhere. While the principle of providing for pensions in the future is good, the practice is flawed. I understand the reluctance of the Opposition to vote against it, although I am not sure what is the view of the Labour Party on it. The Bill, when one examines it, contains many flaws which should be considered and criticised.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Bonner's praise of the Minister for Finance. As a Minister, he has courage and guts. He has been prepared to stick to his ideology through thick and thin despite the barbs thrown at him by the media and others. It is time the country had a Minister for Finance with such courage who is prepared to pursue sometimes unpopular or temporarily unpopular measures through to their logical conclusion. In that regard, I refer to the reduction in capital gains tax, the reductions in income tax and other measures he took in the face of opposition which have not done him any good in terms of popular opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, with regard to the Bill, although the Minister's instincts are probably reasonably good, the practice is flawed. Senator Joe Doyle touched on the reason for this in his contribution. I do not understand how a huge fund can be set aside while there is still a national debt. It is simple, but it is totally questionable. It is similar to an individual, a Minister of State or I, having money <Col N="926" /> on deposit in the Bank of Ireland or AIB at 0.5% or 1%&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We all put money aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but borrowing the same amount at 11%. It does not make sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why the first priority of the Minister, although his instinct is to do it, was not to decide that 1% of GNP would be put aside every year because the country can afford it and that the money would be used to service the national debt. However, that did not happen.</P>
      <P>The national debt is approximately £30 billion. People say that is not a very large amount and that it is a tiny percentage of GNP compared to what it was in the past. They are correct, but it is a tiny percentage of GNP today. It was not a tiny percentage of GNP a few years ago&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and it could be a large percentage of GNP again in the future. We also have the advantage at present, although it is temporary due to the nature of economics and economic cycles, that the national debt costs much less to service than it did in the past because interest rates are so low. I am not making any foolish predictions because people who predict interest rates are inevitably wrong, but that will not last forever.</P>
      <P>Interest rates at some time, certainly within the period mentioned in the Bill up to 2025 before which money cannot be taken out, will rise to levels which are unacceptable today. We will find, if we do not pay off the national debt at some stage in that period &ndash; the Bill extends to 2055 &ndash; that interest rates are very high, the national debt has become a problem again and we will be forced to borrow again. Borrowing is out at present, but it was not out ten years ago. We lived on borrowing ten years ago but the global and mobile environment in which we are living now assumes that the current circumstances will last forever. However, that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is as sure as night follows day that if the national debt is not paid off, it will rise at some period in the next 20 years and the cost of servicing it will increase in the next 20 to 25 years, which is the period of the Bill. Before the Minister puts money into the reserve account, the first thing he should do is decide that the money should go towards servicing or paying off the national debt, if that is possible. The national debt will become a problem again unless we get rid of it. The idea that we will never borrow again for current or capital expenditure is unrealistic. It appears unrealistic now, but ten years ago it was <Col N="927" /> inconceivable that we would be living in the world of today.</P>
    <P>The first priority should have been to get rid of that millstone around our neck which we now pretend does not exist. To save money when one is borrowing money at the same time does not make any sense. If the national debt had been paid off, it would have been reasonable to decide to open this massive fund.</P>
    <P>How will the fund work? I am suspicious of the appointment of people known in the fund as commissioners. According to the Minister and the Bill, commissioners are independent of Government. I remind the House that there is no such thing as people who are independent of Government or Government appointees who are independent. That is nonsense. Various Ministers have introduced various Bills in the House to establish semi-State bodies or to appoint people to them or to set up Government agencies and I asked them &ndash; the Minister of State was one of them &ndash; if there would be any political appointees on the boards of the companies. The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and then I get assurances that these people will have no loyalty other than to the particular organisation to which they are appointed. However, who comes out of the raffle? The answer is people who have a coincidental loyalty to Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or the Progressive Democrats. There is coincidence after coincidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what happens; none of them is independent. I understand it in some incidences in the case of semi-State bodies because there is a very dishonourable tradition, which is exercised by all parties, that such bodies are filled with party hacks. This is what happens and we see the result of it in the semi-State sector which is a shambles. It is obvious in CIE and elsewhere. The sector is a shambles partly because political hacks are appointed to those boards and their loyalty is to a political party and not the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. That is how it operates and it is wrong. That is bad enough, but it is unacceptable that a body as responsible as this is supposed to be will have a board appointed in exactly the same way as all the old rotten semi-State bodies. I do not suggest any individual Minister has a weakness of that sort, but it is endemic in the political system and the culture of the country that the people appointed to these boards are seen to be &ldquo;safe&rdquo; by the Government in power. Safe means that they do what they are <Col N="928" /> told when the chips are down. This is a very serious charge, but it is a very serious problem.</P>

      <P>The point is well made because this is a serious fund. It will grow into billions and billions of pounds and it will be in charge of people's pensions. This is a serious business. I have no doubt that two things will emerge as a result. First, political hacks will be appointed as commissioners. Second, they will be under pressure from various Governments less scrupulous than our own to do certain things with those funds which are not, as the Minister said in his speech, in accordance with a strict commercial mandate. That is the problem. The Minister knows and I know that semi-State bodies in this State are called commercial semi-State bodies. That is the great misnomer of all time. They are not commercial; they are the opposite. They have been run like private fiefdoms by some Ministers in order to give jobs in the past decade to solve the unemployment problem. That is not commercial. It may be a very worthy social objective and it may have achieved that and it may be right, but they are not commercial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real danger here is that the commission and the commissioners appointed by various Governments will act in the interests of that particular Government and not in the interests of the underlying pensioners. I was shattered when I saw that there was no provision or attempt in this Bill to appoint truly independent commissioners. One day between now and 2055, and there cannot be drawings before 2025, there will be pressure for two things. There will be pressure to raid this <Col N="929" /> fund in some way at a time of economic crisis and that may mean a change in legislation. There will be a crisis between now and 2025. There will be a great temptation for the Minister or future Ministers to raid this lovely fund. It is in danger of becoming a slush fund for current expenditure. Even the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil's next partners in coalition&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;if it gets its way, has indicated that it thinks this fund is too big. What will the Government do about that? They already want some of that money back to spend on current expenditure and to buy votes. That is what they are looking at. They say the Government has given too much. They want to borrow it back to buy votes for a general election. That is what will happen in the future. Every party and politician seeking power will look at this little honey pot and think they have a whole pile of cash, we do not need it until 2055 so let us spend it on buying votes. This is very dangerous.</P>

      <P>The problem with the NTMA is this. It has organised the national debt. Perhaps the Minister could wait for my comment because it is an interesting point. He interrupted me and said it had done an outstanding job for Ireland. He could be right but he could be wrong. I do not know how he measures its performance. There is a problem with the NTMA. It is impossible to know whether it has done a good or bad job because it measures its own performance. Goodbye Minister, it has been nice seeing you.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I said goodbye to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Byrne. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, was very polite to wait for my reply and I am grateful to him for that.      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> The NTMA is the only judge of its own performance. It is an extraordinary organisation. I do not know about it and no one here knows about it. The NTMA is judged by a benchmark. It is the most complicated benchmark I have ever come across. I do not really understand it. A benchmark, as everyone will know in the next few weeks, is a means of measuring yourself against someone else in the world. That is what will happen in the private sector here.</P>
    <P>The NTMA which managed the national debt &ndash; I suggest not with the applause that it has been given but I give it the benefit of the doubt &ndash; is judged by one thing, a benchmark set by itself. Every year, since the NTMA was set up over ten years ago, it has beaten the benchmark and everyone believes, as the Minister does, that it has done very well. But anyone could beat a benchmark if they set it every year.</P>
    <P>The NTMA, which the Minister said had done so well, had to suspend the benchmark at one period because it got it wrong. It got devaluation wrong. This was an exceptional case and it was a difficult period but the NTMA got it wrong. The benchmark was suspended because its performance would have looked dire. That is what happened. The NTMA which is meant to be impartial, and presumably it is meant to be impartial in this case, was one of the foremost organisations leading the charge against devaluation at the time. Are we going to have the NTMA playing that sort of political role while at the same time being in charge of investments? It would have a clear conflict of interest. It will want Government decisions on things like the currency, and the currency will not have to be decided upon, to be made in the interests of those investments of which it is in charge. That is a clear conflict of interest. The NTMA has a great deal to lose or gain on this.</P>
    <P>Giving the NTMA the right to manage this fund for ten years is absurd. The real truth is that the NTMA does not have an awful lot to do anymore. The Government had to find it a toy to play with and it thought it might as well give the NTMA this reserve fund to look after as give it to anyone else. The NTMA will do this. The evidence that it is qualified to manage funds is very limited. I do not know whether the NTMA has ever managed equity funds which I presume is the main purpose of this fund. I do not see any evidence for it. The NTMA has been involved in international bonds and debt. It has not been involved in managing equities but it will suddenly become the overall supervisor of this fund. It is not qualified to do that. It is very convenient to give it to the NTMA because it has not enough to do. I am not sure that that is the right way to go about it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that at the time of devaluation&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Give me a minute to pick out my important points.</P>
      <P>Let me move on from the NTMA. They will sub-contract this investment to various investment managers. I was very interested in what Senator Doyle said about investment managers. He produced an extremely forensic examination of some of their records. I would put it much more strongly. Investment management is a completely bogus science. Investment managers have worse records on the whole than a blind monkey in beating the indices which they are expected to beat. Time and again, if you look at the record of investment managers in Ireland alone, they completely fail to beat the local index let alone anything else. They will not judge themselves by the local index. They refuse to use it as a benchmark for themselves. Do you know why? It is not just that they could not beat it but because they came in way under it. We have a fund which would be far better called a passive investment fund, as Senator Doyle referred to it. That is really to do nothing. It can be run by a computer. Consensus funds just invest all the other funds and charge, or should charge, far lesser fees.</P>
      <P>The idea that this massive fund will be given to selected investment managers at huge charges is ridiculous. These people do not know any more than you or I about how to invest funds. That is a matter of record, not a matter of projection. The NTMA is in the investment management loop of friends who move around Dublin and Ireland and look after each other. We should think very carefully before we allow these funds into the hands of these people, who have very little skill but earn huge amounts of money. They charge 1% or 2%. What size will this fund be? Massive amounts of commission will come to investment managers from these funds. This is pensioners' money.</P>
      <P>I do not like the sound in this Bill regarding the money coming from the Minister, to the commissioners, to the NTMA and then down to the investment managers. It is a layer of unsatisfactory peeling off of pensioners' money, with politicians getting kudos for it and investment managers getting undeserved cash.</P>

      <P>I was quite clear in my thinking on this issue yesterday but Senator Ross has created confusion this morning. I wonder if that is a good or bad thing. Perhaps he was playing the part of devil's advocate just to bring in an element of criticism. I did not see anything like that in the Bill. It is a visionary Bill and its concept is to plan for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on being so visionary in bringing forward this Bill. I wish him well with his forthcoming budget in two weeks' time. He is a Minister with guts and has <Col N="932" /> been subjected to ridicule during his term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope this budget will have a smooth transition. I also welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
      <P>In common with all industrial countries, the ageing of our population will become a major problem over the coming decades and will put huge strains on future Governments to fund social welfare and public service pension schemes on a pay as you go basis. The purpose of this Bill is to set up a mechanism and to establish a national pensions reserve fund. This is a radical departure from the traditional method of funding. The Bill will introduce a new strategy for long-term planning.</P>
      <P>With our present economic success, it is wise to prepare for the long-term well-being of our society. Better standards of living, increased life expectancy and declining birth rates will lead to an increase in the ageing population. This will have huge implications. The forecasts suggest that over the next decade there will be one person over 65 years for every five people of working age. By 2050, there will be one person aged 65 years for every two people of working age. That shows how important it is for us to plan for the future and to think of the implications of not putting a system in place to cater for such an elderly population.</P>
      <P>While we have an economic boom, we should cater for this trend. This is the time to put this mechanism in place and to prepare for the future. With the increase in our young population, the resulting increase in the labour force &ndash; which I hope will continue into the future &ndash; and significant budget surpluses, we must deal with the aged. We must set aside some of the revenue generated by our economic boom.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes in the Bill to set aside 1% of GNP to meet the cost of future pensions. The Bill also allows for the Government to make additional contributions to the fund. We already have an example of this, where the proceeds of the sale of Telecom Éireann are to be paid into the fund once the legislation is enacted. In this way, the fund will relieve the burden on the Exchequer, which is the traditional source of funding. The fund will be monitored very closely to ensure necessary reserves will always be available to meet the requirements.</P>
      <P>The Bill also points out that there will be no neglect of current needs. Concern has been expressed that we might dip into this fund if we had problems in adverse economic circumstances. We heard examples of that over the past two weeks, when our Labour colleagues said this will be a handy fund to dip into when we are in economic decline.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I was shocked that people over 65 years of age could have their fund and pension schemes threatened in this way.</P>
      <P>I am glad this fund will be managed by a commission which will be independent of the Government and that there will be a body of people with the ability and expertise to manage this effectively. They will ensure there will be optimum return on the investment and that it will not be raided.</P>
      <P>It worried me to hear Senator Ross talking about the composition of the board that will be set up to manage the funds. One sentence in the explanatory memorandum, which might alert the Minister to the need to look at this aspect again, states, &ldquo;The Bill contains two important safeguards to ensure that, short of amending legislation, the Fund may not be used for purposes other than meeting the cost of pension provision arising from such ageing.&rdquo;  I would like the Minister to look at that sentence again. I do not like that way of putting it &ndash; it is a bit soft. We need to tidy that up to ensure that this fund will not be raided. After 2025 it will become more flexible, but we must ensure it will not be in a vulnerable position between then and 2050. I would like the Minister to look at that aspect of it. I welcome the statement by Senator Ross that he had reservations about this. I also have reservations about that aspect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>A very important point is that there will be a prohibition on drawdowns prior to 2025. We are quite happy with it up to 2025. The Minister is also saying that after that date the composition of the fund&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. I will ask the Minister to look at that again. The whole arrangement is a bit loose for the years between 2025 and 2050. I would like the Minister to refer to that section of the Bill again on Committee Stage. It states that it will be determined by the Minister, whoever the Minister of the day is after 2025 &ndash; I do not know where we will be at that stage of our lives &ndash; and&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will still be around, although I do not know. We will do our best. It concerns me that the Minister of the day will determine it only with reference to the number of people over 65 years in the population. That is very loose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect we should take into account is that this should not be just about pensions. In approximately ten years the concept of retirement will require new thinking. We are already being asked to redefine the meaning of the word &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; and to raise the retirement age, which is becoming a feature in other industrialised countries. Other issues will have to come into <Col N="934" /> play in the years 2025-50. Other concepts will have to be analysed, in addition to the Minister's reference to the number of people who will be over the age of 65 years at that time.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minster on his vision for the future. This legislation will ensure an increase in the pension fund as the population ages. It will ease the burden on the taxpayer and will increase the capacity of future Governments to respond to other needs when they arise. The Minister rightly calls it a sensible Bill. It is also forward thinking.</P>
    <P>Nobody can determine the future, we can only plan for the care of society. In this regard, our party, Fianna Fáil, has always been to the forefront in expressing a caring approach. This vision for those aged over 65 years is another example of how we can deliver on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We all acknowledge the importance of this legislation. It is a bold move by the Minster for Finance to take an initiative on establishing a retirement fund. Successive Governments have expressed concern that pensions have been funded from Exchequer receipts rather than a specifically reserved pension fund. I support the proposal in the Bill in principle, although there may be problems affecting implementation and practice.</P>
      <P>The Minster's initiative in creating a temporary fund containing a substantial sum of money was the first movement in this direction. This legislation puts that fund on a statutory footing. It also looks a long way into the future &ndash; to 2055. It bypasses the next generation. Those retiring in the period 2000-25 will be contributors but not beneficiaries from the fund. The legislation also forbids the taking of money from the fund before 2025. I see the Minister's logic here because a study of the age profile of the population shows that it will remain relatively youthful until then. It could be said the Minister is preparing for the rainy day and is taking a practical approach to it. I congratulate him on the initiatives he has taken.</P>
      <P>In the broader context there will be a sense of security in that the present generation of working people will at least feel that with substantial money being invested on an annual basis there will be security when they become pensioners. Not long ago, in the 1980s, there was concern that public sector pensions would not be paid because the Exchequer was so deeply in debt. Thankfully we have gone beyond that. The Exchequer is flush with money.</P>
      <P>Other issues regarding the quality of life in society today must be considered before we start looking ahead to 2050. The health services have never been in more of a shambles. Waiting lists are going through the roof in every sector. Anybody attending casualty departments can expect to wait between six and 24 hours to receive medical attention, at a time when they are at their most vulnerable. The Government may have put money into addressing the problem, but the management needs to be reformed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> Last year there was an expectation that funding would be allocated to the child care services. Parents are under a huge burden to provide a decent pre-primary school and health service up to the age of four or five years because there is no State system of pre-school education, crèches or child care. The matter has not been addressed by the tax system or by any other mechanism.</P>
    <P>Again, the Government has approached this issue from the wrong direction. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform allocated £0.25 billion in capital investment, which the Taoiseach followed up with an allocation of £40 million. It was all directed to the capital investment side. As a result it has not been of much benefit to dealing with the problems and the costs experienced by parents who must still pay for their child care.</P>
    <P>We are not addressing outstanding problems correctly in terms of the Exchequer funding available. The transport system is in a total mess. The infrastructure is in bad shape. There is also chaos in terms of industrial disputes. The country is under siege because the workers feel they have been given short shrift in terms of the benefits of the booming economy. On the one hand it is proposed to set aside 1% of GNP every year for pensioners in the future while, on the other, we are not paying workers sufficiently. A small coterie of people are benefiting disproportionately from the booming economy. The benefits are not being spread equally. Air and rail transport has been affected. I will not elaborate on the taxi drivers. Teachers are in dispute; last year it was the nurses and the Garda. This sense of inequity must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is not much sense in trumpeting a booming economy while those who created it are totally dissatisfied with the manner in which it is being run and with the benefits they are receiving from it. While I am pleased to see the Minister providing for future liabilities, we must also deal with the present. I am pleased to note the Minster has returned to the House. He is looking into his crystal ball, seeing what is required for 2055 and is making provision for it.</P>
    <P>We have a very young population, which is getting younger by the day with the influx of ex-patriots who are returning and a youthful population from other countries coming here in search of work. The Minister's figures will be further out of line as the years go by. Ireland has a very strong age profile; we are ahead of Spain in terms of the numbers of families with children and Germany is further down the line. There is no point citing Germany as an example which we should follow because Ireland and Germany are not comparable. Germany has been industrialised for 150 years whereas Ireland has not been industrialised even for ten years.</P>
    <P>The national pensions policy initiative proposed the establishment of this fund to boost pensions. It was also suggested that people should be able to transfer their pensions from one job to another as this would ensure a stronger return <Col N="936" /> from pensions. I have not seen any progress being made on this idea which I believe could be very usefully explored and enshrined in legislation. We should debate this matter to see how we could introduce an automatic system of pension transfer from one type of employment to another. We hear of the huge movement within the economy and there should surely be equal scope for movement in terms of pension transferability.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Senior Citizens Parliament made a presentation on Tuesday to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family, Social and Community Affairs in which they stated that their members would like to be encouraged back into the workplace but that some incentive should be offered in order to facilitate this. There is not much sense in older people returning to the workforce if they will immediately be taxed on their incomes and pensions. It was suggested that a back to work allowance could be provided to older people returning to the workplace. A back to work allowance could be tailored to meet their specific needs and people should be assured that they will not lose any supplementary or ancillary benefits, such as medical cards, to which they are currently entitled by returning to work. Such measures would boost the income of people who have retired or are nearing retirement and it would also supplement the workforce. Many older people would welcome the opportunity to return to work.</P>
    <P>People's life expectancy has increased greatly in recent years. Not very long ago, people barely reached pension age and, if they did, they could only expect to live for another five or six years.</P>

      <P>We hope the Minister will retain his current life expectancy until 2002 and, in spite of my suspicions, I look forward to his introducing another budget in the autumn. Perhaps the Minister could meet with representatives of the Senior Citizens Parliament to discuss their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a suggestion to the Minister. Our national debt currently stands at approximately £30 billion. The debt is not increasing but neither is it decreasing. The Minister envisages contributions being made to the fund from now until 2055, with moneys being drawn down from 2025 onwards. I do not know exactly how much money will be put into the fund this year but I <Col N="937" /> believe it will be in the region of £650-£700 million on the basis of 1% of GNP. If we were to devote £1 billion to debt reduction each year from now until 2025, we would effectively eliminate the debt. The Exchequer take will obviously increase as the years go by. Our current interest payments are in the region of £2.5 to £3 billion. If we were to invest the interest saved on the debt each year, which will progressively decline as the premium reduces, into the fund, we would have a sizeable figure by 2025. On the one hand, we would eliminate our debt and on the other, the interest saved would supplement the fund. I am aware that the Minister is interested in finding a mechanism to eliminate the national debt and I believe this would be an excellent way to kill two birds with the one stone.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross waxed lyrical about bogus investment funds. He does not regard investment management as a proper science. Like economists, the funds invariably get it wrong and blame factors outside their control for their faults. What will be the channel for investment in regard to the fund? Will it be the National Treasury Management Agency or will it be a range of investment managers and funds? A lot of taxpayers' money will be stored away in some fashion, for better or for worse, and we do not know what kind of returns to expect or how the system will work. One might secure a fantastic deal by putting the money into the post office without touching it until 2025. That would probably provide a better yield than anything investment managers might offer.</P>
    <P>The money might be invested in companies such as Eircom, for example. Senator Ross lost a great deal of money in the recent past in this regard because he listened to the advice offered by the investment managers and believed the shares represented a good long-term investment strategy. There may be mechanisms whereby the fund could be used by the State and the private sector, or where public-private partnership arrangements could use the fund for infrastructural and development purposes at a reasonable rate. We could have some long-term investments in it as we would be keeping the fund intact.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposal in principle. However, it is necessary to more closely examine it and to review it as the years go by to ensure we are getting a good return on the money invested, to examine the profile of those we are dealing with and to ensure we are providing the necessary short-term services as well as preparing for the rainy day in the long term. I hope we do not have to draw on the fund too early, that the economy will continue to boom and that the proportion of young people to elderly will continue to grow. I hope we do not go down the road of some of the more industrialised nations which find they have a huge dependent population in relation to the working population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to address some of the general points made by Senators who will have another opportunity <Col N="938" /> on Committee Stage to give their views in more detail. Senator Doyle raised the issue of investment in Ireland. The Bill does not prevent investment in Ireland, but the commissioners, before investing in any asset in Ireland or abroad, must have regard to the commercial investment mandate of the fund. This mandate will prevent pressure being placed on the commissioners to make commercially dubious investments and provide capital to companies or projects which would otherwise have difficulty in attracting private sector investment. If one assumes a conservative return on the fund investment of 1% over the return on Government bonds, the fund is projected to reach 42% of GNP by 2025, the year drawdowns commence. In view of the magnitude of the fund relative to the limited outlets of the economy and the need for a well diversified portfolio of investments, it is clear that most of the fund will have to be invested abroad. However, this does not prevent investment in Ireland and I stress that any decision in this regard is totally a matter for the commissioners who will be appointed under the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senators Doyle and Bonner also raised the social insurance fund. I would like to set out why I decided not to add the assets of the social insurance fund to the fund. The social insurance fund holds the proceeds of employers' and employees' social insurance contributions and is used to pay all social insurance benefits, not just pensions. In previous years the fund income was not sufficient to cover the cost of these benefits and it had to be subvented by the Exchequer. Largely due to the remarkable increase in employment contributions, income has grown steadily in recent years to the point where there is currently a surplus in the fund. This surplus is projected to reach £630 million by the end of this year and should increase further over the medium term. Under the terms of the Social Welfare Act, 1993, the Minister for Finance is required to invest this surplus for the benefit of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Using some or all of the social insurance fund surplus to augment the national pensions reserve fund is an obvious possibility. However, I decided not to proceed in this way for two reasons. First, the liabilities of the social insurance fund are more short term in nature than those of the national pensions reserve fund. Hence, it is likely to become necessary to draw on the social insurance fund reserve long before 2025, when drawdowns commence from the national pensions reserve fund. Second, it will be necessary for the social insurance fund to meet all the social insurance contingencies, such as disability and unemployment benefit, as well as contributing to pensions. It would be impractical to try to apportion the surplus to these various demands. I made an attempt to do so in drawing up this Bill, but it became so complicated to arrive at what proportion of the social insurance surplus should go to the national pensions reserve fund and in deciding the amount left over for pensions as distinct from unemployment benefit, for <Col N="939" /> example, that I gave up on the idea. That does not preclude the matter being addressed at a future date.</P>
    <P>The 1% contribution was also raised, as were the drawdown arrangements. I do not want to go into too many details given the time available, but I have tried to take the money and place it as far as possible out of the hands of future Ministers for Finance and future Governments. It is not meant to be a jar in which one can dip one's hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite advice from across the floor of the House and from others, including those in my Department, that perhaps I should provide some escape, the Bill reflects my own thinking and I decided from the outset to go as far as possible to prevent any dipping into the jar, although I cannot preclude a future Parliament from amending the Bill.</P>
      <P>Members in the other House asked about what might happen if things go bad and suggested that we should not have to invest the 1%. This sums up one of the principal differences between myself and others in this regard. If a person knows a liability is accumulating in their personal or business life they should provide for it and it should become part of their normal budgetary strategy each year. We know we are building a future liability for pensions and consideration of this should form part of normal budgetary arithmetic. It is the same as deciding that we must make contributions towards repaying the national debt each year. I know people such as Deputy Joe Higgins have a difficulty with that as he would argue we should not pay off the national debt, but that is not realistic and most of us would not agree with that position.</P>
      <P>The 1% should become part of the normal budgetary arithmetic. I have opposed amendments which would allow me vary it at any time. It has been said that the good times will not always be as good as they are now, and that is true, but the 1% of GNP should still be put aside as part of normal budget arithmetic. I have precluded the discretion of lowering that amount, but the Minister can invest more by bringing an ordinary resolution before Dáil Éireann and having it passed. All figures show we should be investing considerably more than 1% of GNP to meet the expected liabilities in the future. That is why I have structured things in the way set out in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle also asked about the role of the NTMA and the commission. I know Senator Ross also raised the role of the NTMA and I have in the past read his comments on it. Senator Costello also asked about the management of the fund. For the first time in any legislation that I am aware of, I have set forth the type of persons who can become commissioners. This has not been done in any other Act&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there can be nominations to the board from representative bodies. In this Bill, the Minister for Finance can only draw people from certain listed areas of expertise. Therefore, while a Minister for Finance might like a particular person, they must adhere to the provisions of the Bill. On Report Stage, following a suggestion by Deputy Noonan on Committee Stage, I deleted the words &ldquo;in his or her opinion&rdquo; from the relevant section in the context of the Minister appointing commissioners as it could have been interpreted as the Minister having the right to appoint people who were not objectively from the areas of expertise specified. While the Minister for Finance might like to appoint a particular individual, the commissioners will readily be recognisable as experts in their own field.</P>
      <P>The commissioners will be appointed by the Minister, will be in charge of the fund and will have the functions assigned to commissioners. For the first ten years the manager of the fund will be the NTMA. It has expertise on the liability side of the balance sheet and I decided to avail of that body of expertise. The National Treasury Management Agency will not be managing the funds but has been described as the ring master in all of this. The commissioners will set the investment policy. I have given a strict commercial mandate about the investment policy, in that they must secure the optimal return. I have precluded amendments about taking into account other considerations, national interests, ethical investments. Various pressures were put on me to change that in the other House. It will be the same as any private investment fund in which Senator Ross has invested where there must be optimal return.</P>
      <P>The National Treasury Management Agency will invest the best part of £5 billion in this fund by the end of this year. It is being held by the NTMA in a normal reserve account and is accruing a small amount of interest. Following the setting up of the commission, the commissioners will decide the optimal policy. Presumably the NTMA will advertise not for people to be directly employed but for people to compete for slices of this fund. I envisage the NTMA as having 20 fund operations. At the end of the year an annual report will be presented to the Minister and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the commission chairman and the chief executive of the NTMA will have to come before the relevant committee to explain. The report will set out all the investments the fund managed or used throughout the year and people will have an opportunity to make any comments they wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As with every investment fund, not every year will be a plus. If the fund had been up and running earlier in the year and invested in the markets in, say, March there would probably have <Col N="941" /> been losses in these investments because the markets took a downturn for a period.</P>
    <P>The National Treasury Management Agency will be the first manager of the fund for a period of ten years. After that the position will be open to tender.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The NTMA envisages engaging only a small number of extra people of high ranking expertise. It will not make the investments. I envisage that the £5 billion will be parcelled out to Irish, UK, European and, probably, United States investment fund managers for the best rates of return. A small additional group of people will be taken on by the NTMA to manage that particular activity.</P>
      <P>The NTMA will probably also tender out the custodianship aspect of the fund. That is a monstrous operation. The NTMA will not set up a whole custodian department which could have hundreds of thousands of people working in it. Perhaps that will alleviate the concerns of Senator Ross. The extra expenses that relate to the NTMA will be charged against the funds but the amount will be fully transparent. The NTMA will not have an extra couple of hundred people working for it as a result of this Bill but it may have a small number in the low double digits who will be there as ring master and will parcel out a couple of hundred million pounds. We had better not name the funds around town or in Europe but that is what I envisage will happen. That should alleviate some of the concerns. It will not be an excuse for the NTMA to acquire a large number of additional staff.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello and Ross said we ought to run down the national debt faster. I am going to do that. This is the third consecutive year in which we will have an overall Exchequer surplus. The previous Exchequer surplus was 51 or 52 years before &ndash; nobody is quite sure when. An Exchequer surplus automatically goes to run down the national debt. The national debt is quantified every month and I could get the figure today if the Senators want it, but 31 December is usually when the figures are published. In recent years it has been around £30 or £31 billion, even though we had a surplus in the previous two years as well. I restructured the tradability of the debt in the past two years. That had a technical effect of putting up the nominal value of the debt in 1999, even though the market value was the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the year the exchange rate of the Irish pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> other currencies will be taken into account. I could check the figure but it is approximately 90% in euros. All German debt and French bonds are denominated in euros, a small percentage is left over in dollars and sterling. Therefore, all bonds denominated in Euro currencies are regarded as domestic and euro debt. Say, the surplus this year, as projected in last year's budget, is £1.6 billion, that surplus will automatically bring down the national debt. If <Col N="942" /> one thinks about it, the only way to reduce one's own indebtedness in business or personal life is when one's income for the year exceeds outgoings and one can either put it into savings or reduce some of one's debt. That is what most people do.</P>
    <P>If there is an overall Exchequer surplus it will automatically go to reduce the national debt. The Exchequer surplus this year will be in excess of the amount of £1.6 billion I prognosticated on budget day. That will automatically bring down the national debt. That £1.6 billion excess surplus is after putting aside £1.8 billion this year into the national pension reserve fund. Some £1,139 million of the £1,850 million going to the reserve fund was the money I received in January as the balance of Telecom money and the other sum of money was equivalent to 1% of GNP. Even though there was no legislation I provided for that in last year's temporary Bill which allowed me to put £1,150 million into it this year.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello and Doyle asked why not pay more off the national debt as against putting it into the fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

      <P>We will get a higher return on the investment fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point. If the cost of the debt to the Exchequer is, say, 5% or thereabouts, the rate of return from pension investment funds would be considerably greater than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister know it would be considerably greater than that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we can look at it in this way. If one takes a survey published every quarter by the pension fund over the past three years one will see the annualised return on pension investments has been in double digits for the past ten years or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am coming to. If after putting the 1% aside one wanted to do something with the rest of the surplus or whatever, a Minister would have to make a decision. If the cost of the debt had risen in the meantime due to higher interest rates and the rate of return on investments was lower, the sensible thing to do would be not to put any additional money into the pensions reserve fund but to pay off the debt. On the other hand if the position remained the same and there were specific surpluses, a Minister would prudently decide in relation to the 1% to put more in the national pensions reserve fund because he would get a better return. That is when a decision would be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>But the 1% is sacrosanct. The 1% of gross national product is statutorily being put aside. This is the additional money that a Minister might have in his coffers at the end of the year. He could then make a decision on the basis outlined in reply to Senators Costello and Doyle.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the independence of the commission. I was not present to hear Senator Ross. However, I can assure him that the structure I have set up is as far as it is possible for anyone to go to take the people's money and hand it over to somebody else and have no control by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I referred in the other House to a leader article in one newspaper after the Bill was published. Following the publication of the Bill, I held a press conference which was reported accurately. However, a leader writer wrote an article in a newspaper stating that this would come under the control of the Minister. I have tried to ensure in as far as is constitutionally possible that the Minister for Finance or the Government agency cannot deviate from the provisions in the Bill. I was advised to allow the Minister some leeway but I have done the opposite. If there is any ambiguity in this regard in the Bill I will change it. I have scrutinised the Bill to ensure this will not be possible.</P>
      <P>The commission will be completely independent as will be recognised from the members I appoint. They will probably include people from Ireland and abroad and their suitability will be readily recognised. They may have political affiliations, but they will not be friends because, under the Bill, I can only appoint members from seven categories. Neither I nor any future Minister will have flexibility in this regard. These people must come from professions such as investment management, actuarial backgrounds and so on.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross referred to the NTMA as being judge and jury in relation to the termination of the debt management benchmark and the measurement of the industry's performance against that benchmark. This is grossly unfair to the agency and wide of the mark. The debt management benchmark is approved by my Department on advice from an firm of investment bankers and the advisory committee of the NTMA, the members of which are appointed by the Minister for Finance. Furthermore, the measurement process against debt management benchmarking is independently audited by a major firm of commercial auditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the NTMA was set up, successive Ministers for Finance believe it has done an outstanding job in managing the national debt and the basis on which it has performed evaluations. Other countries, including major European countries which are ten times the size of Ireland, are investigating the possibility of having their debt <Col N="944" /> agency modelled on what this country has done. These are countries in which we would have considered investing in the past. These countries will now copy what we did more than 11 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you and the Members of the Seanad for providing me with the opportunity to participate in today's debate. Those of us who are engaged in the long and difficult process of implementing the Good Friday Agreement spend most of our time dealing with the most pressing and urgent issues. Too seldom are we given the opportunity to look up from this detailed work to review the broader picture.</P>
      <P>When President Clinton addressed the Oireachtas in 1995 he reminded us, in the words of George Bernard Shaw, that &ldquo;peace is not only better than war, but infinitely more arduous&rdquo;. He was absolutely right. At times it can seem as if implementing the Good Friday Agreement is like climbing a particularly frustrating mountain. Just as you think you are reaching the top, a new and steeper slope appears. There have been numerous occasions during the process when it seemed as if the hard work was finally done, only for new issues &ndash; or new variants of old issues &ndash; to appear. From this I draw two lessons. First, implementing a radical and complex agreement and emerging from a history of conflict and division will inevitably pose grave challenges. Second, and more important, even the most difficult problems can be overcome with the right mixture of determination, patience and goodwill. If we can surmount the problems we face now, a profoundly important step forward in ensuring the success of the Agreement will have been taken.</P>
      <P>Difficult questions now confront us. I will return in detail to the effective operation of the institutions on a fully inclusive basis, policing and the queston of arms. Of course we must focus on finding answers to these questions but, standing back, what is clear is not what remains to be done but how much has already been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In less than a single generation we have completely and irreversibly transformed the political landscape of this island. It is a mere 20 years since the hunger strikes brought many who were com<Col N="945" /> mitted to dialogue and to the peaceful resolution of our problems to the brink of despair. It is only 16 years since the seminal report of the New Ireland Forum set out nationalist Ireland's vision of an agreed future. Fifteen years ago this month the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed, formally recognising the Irish Government's role in relation to Northern Ireland. Ten years ago this month a British Secretary of State, for the first time, stated that Britain had no sefish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland. Seven years ago the two Governments formally set out their joint approach to the principles of self-determination and consent in the Downing Street Declaration, offering a route into talks to all parties committed to exclusively peaceful means. In the few years since 1993 we have seen ceasefires established, talks put in place, agreement achieved and comprehensive and inclusive institutions established.</P>
    <P>At last weekend's SDLP conference, John Hume rightly emphasised the role of his party in formulating a searching and comprehensive analysis of the Northern Ireland situation and in advocating a challenging but realistic way forward. Successive Irish Governments and all the democratic parties in this State can rightly take pride in our own contribution. The principles which underlie the Good Friday Agreement are, in very large measure, the principles which we collectively advanced over many years. The institutions reflect and express the three key relationships which we together identified.</P>
    <P>What has been accomplished is nothing less than a revolution, achieved not through violence but through the ending of violence, not through domination but through partnership. Let me recall in simple terms some of the most remarkable features of that revolution as embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. There is a solemn repudiation of the use or threat of force for any political purpose. There is agreement on how and in what circumstances a united Ireland may be brought about by the will of the people, North and South. There is a recognition of the constitutional legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. There is a recognition of the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose. For the first time, Unionists, Nationalists and republicans are working together as equals and as of right to serve all the people equally. For the first time unionists have fully recognised the legitimacy of the nationalist aspiration and the need for that aspiraton to be given institutional form. For the first time Ministers from North and South are working together in formal structures to achieve mutual social and economic benefit for the people of the island as a whole. There is a new understanding and a ready acceptance of the unique relationship between the British and Irish peoples. Equality, mutual respect and the protection of human <Col N="946" /> rights are acknowledged to be the indispensable basis of a fair and decent society.</P>
    <P>Not long ago it would have been unimaginable that any one of these fundamental elements of the Agreement could have secured sufficient consensus across the spectrum. Now they all have. Moreover &ndash; and it is something we as the servants of the people can never forget &ndash; the Agreement, unlike any previous settlement, enjoys a democratic mandate secured in referendums both North and South.</P>
    <P>The Agreement is precious and irreplaceable. It is also robust. We have made great progress towards ensuring that it is fully implemented. While difficulties remain, we will overcome them in a manner that is fully consistent with the principles of the Agreement. Healing the divisions which have developed over many decades will also take time. I accept that the institutions will eventually be judged not just by what they achieve in concrete terms but by how far they have advanced true reconciliaton and understanding. That aspect of the Agreement is inevitably a long-term project but the progress which has been made cannot and must not be rolled back. It must be built upon to achieve full implementation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In signing the Agreement all sides made commitments and took steps which they knew would cause them and the communities they represent great pain. However, they did so with courage and vision and for the greater good. They did so in a holistic and balanced way, not just issue by issue but in the full context of all the Agreement promised. That is why it has always been the view of the Government that the Agreement cannot be taken piecemeal or cherry picked. It must be implemented in full. That must remain our guiding principle. It is the only correct approach and the only practicable one.</P>
    <P>Our current difficulties will only be resolved if we continue to focus on the context of the full implementation of the Agreement in all its aspects. At Hillsborough in May, the two Governments set out how they would take forward the areas of the Agreement for which they have responsibility &ndash; including human rights, policing and security normalisation. The IRA responded with a positive and significant statement, indicating the context in which it would put its arms beyond use, agreeing to re-engage with the de Chastelain commission and, as a confidence building measure, opening some of its weapons dumps to independent inspection.</P>
    <P>The period since then has been enormously productive, with significant work being carried out in all of the institutions. A programme for Government and a budget have been brought forward by the Executive in the North, identifying and targeting its priorities for the period ahead.</P>
    <P>On the North-South front, the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council and the six related implementation bodies have transformed the nature of the relationship between both parts of the island. Since the institutions were restored, <Col N="947" /> the intensity of work carried out by the council has been highly impressive. The second full plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, held in Dublin in September, further advanced the ambitious work programme which has, to date, resulted in 19 sectoral meetings involving the relevant Ministers from both Administrations. This work agenda would not have been possible without the commitment of all my ministerial colleagues on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>The House will already be aware of the substance of the work in the North-South framework over the last year. However, I would like briefly to refer to a few illustrative examples. In the economic sphere, the Trade and Business Development Body, now called InterTrade Ireland, has made a very impressive debut. It has in recent weeks held a number of very successful and well attended road shows, highlighting the huge potential for increased trade and business activity between both parts of the island.</P>
    <P>On tourism, the North-South Ministerial Council recently established a new company &ndash; Tourism Ireland &ndash; which will be responsible for promoting the entire island as a single tourism destination in overseas markets. This will considerably enhance the cohesion, effectiveness and value for money of the island's collective marketing endeavours bringing immediate benefit to both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>I mention also the North-South work being done in regard to European Union Structural Funds. Under the direction of the two Ministers for Finance and their respective officials, the Special European Programmes Body has done outstanding work in preparing the next round of draft programmes which have a direct cross-Border impact. These include INTERREG III and PEACE II, the successor programme to the very successful EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. The Special European Programmes Body has been very involved in the preparation of these draft programmes and will have an even stronger role in their implementation and delivery when they come on stream early next year.</P>
    <P>Of course, North-South co-operation cannot, and should not, be the sole preserve of Government. Its transcending importance requires that we broaden its ownership across as wide a spectrum of society as possible. I am very supportive of the proposal in the Good Friday Agreement that a joint parliamentary forum be established. Similarly, given the clear benefits of structured engagement with the social partners in this jurisdiction and given the success of partnership boards in the North, this Government sees considerable merit in the establishment of an appropriate North-South consultative forum. The Agreement proposed that the matter be given consideration. A working group of officials is currently examining the question and will report back to the next plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in March 2001.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> Given the scale and substance of this progress, the decision taken by the Ulster Unionist Council, and David Trimble's subsequent refusal to nominate Sinn Féin Ministers to attend meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council is disappointing and, in my view, misconceived &ndash; misconceived because it is clear that the institutional and constitutional aspects of the Agreement are interlocking and interdependent. We have all pledged ourselves to working in good faith to ensure their success.</P>
    <P>Throughout this difficult process, if we have learnt anything it is that progress will only be achieved through consensus and through a shared willingness to address each other's difficulties. It will not be achieved through the advancement of one party's interpretation of the Agreement and through the satisfaction of one party's demands. The Agreement belongs to all the people of Ireland who voted for it. No one party is entitled to compromise the successful operation of the institutions and to put a block on progress to resolve difficulties that lie elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Let there be no doubt, I fully share the Ulster Unionist Party's desire &ndash; which is the desire not just of one community but of the people of the island as a whole &ndash; to see arms put fully and verifiably beyond use, but equally I fear that the tactics that have been adopted will not secure that outcome.</P>
    <P>That is not to ignore Unionist difficulties. It is simply to state that they can best be addressed in the context of fully working institutions, and that means Sinn Féin Ministers participating in meetings on exactly the same basis as their ministerial colleagues. We will work to overcome the present problems, but in doing so it must be absolutely clear that such tactics cannot and will not be deployed again further down the road. The UUP sitting in Government and working the institutions with Sinn Féin and the SDLP is no more than was promised in the Agreement and than was endorsed by the people of Ireland, North and South.</P>
    <P>The Agreement is a document of realistic compromise and balance, arising out of a particular set of circumstances and out of three tragic decades of violence. One of the most hard won lessons of this process has been the need for inclusivity if we are to move forward on an agreed basis. The Agreement gives parties their seats on the Executive as of right, not as the outcome of subsequent discussion and negotiation. All Ministers come to the table and operate as equals.</P>
    <P>While recognising current UUP difficulties, it is also worth recalling that others &ndash; including this Government &ndash; have had to take a sensitive and careful approach to the effective operation of the institutions. Parties in the North have had to deal with the DUP's refusal to take its seats around the table and, as a result of that party's position, it has not yet been possible for a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on transport to take place. Throughout, we have sought to reach <Col N="949" /> a resolution of these difficulties in a manner which respects the integrity of the institutions under the Agreement and which can contribute to their successful operation.</P>
    <P>It also has to be said republicans need to acknowledge that there is a deficit in Unionist confidence that must be addressed if they too are to achieve all that the Agreement offers them. The IRA statement of May was a vital part of securing the restoration of the institutions. It was a bold step forward. The subsequent inspections and reports from the two international inspectors have, likewise, been enormously helpful and reassuring. It is worth recalling that the inspectors reported the IRA has fully honoured its commitments with respect to the inspections and that the inspectors are convinced they will receive the same co-operation in future re-inspections.</P>
    <P>If the positive momentum created by the May statement is to be sustained, we need to see movement on all of the commitments the IRA made taking place alongside the progress in the broader political context on which those commitments were based. The IRA promised re-engagement with de Chastelain, and that took place, albeit in a limited way. But it also promised that the IRA would enter into discussions with the commission on the basis of the IRA leadership's commitment to resolving the issue of arms. We now need to see that level of truly meaningful engagement taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I readily acknowledge the positive aspects of the IRA statement of 25 October, in particular its reiteration of the IRA's commitment to a just and equitable peace settlement. The IRA said it will resume discussions with the commission only when it is satisfied that the peace process will be advanced by those discussions. However, it is clear to me that the process will always be advanced by such discussions.</P>
      <P>In our statement in May, the two Governments asked the independent commission to consider, in consultation with representatives of the paramilitary organisations, whether there are any further proposals for decommissioning schemes which offer the commission greater scope to proceed in more effective and satisfactory ways with the discharge of its basic mandate. This is clearly an area where substantial progress on resolving the question of arms can be made through dialogue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two Governments also have a vital role to play in creating the context in which progress can be made. Policing is a matter that goes to the very heart of the new dispensation envisaged in the Agreement. Success on policing is, not to overstate it, essential to the success of the Agreement as a whole. For Nationalists, it is a touchstone issue &ndash; a willingness to accept transformative change on this issue is a vital signal that the new beginning for society can be achieved. Policing was too difficult and too emotive an issue for the <Col N="950" /> parties to the Agreement to be able to resolve themselves. Therefore, they rightly left it to an independent commission to come forward with proposals that could embody the vision of the Agreement &ndash; a vision of a new transformed society with which Nationalists can identify and in which they can play a full, involved and active part, a vision where the differing identities and aspirations of the two communities are given equal respect and weight.</P>
    <P>Through its work, the Patten Commission sought to make that vision a reality and I again pay tribute to the distinguished role played by the commission &ndash; including the Members' colleague, Senator Maurice Hayes, who made an immense contribution to its work and who continues to bring his formidable talents to bear in this House &ndash; in bringing forward a comprehensive, balanced and achievable set of recommendations. The approach of the commission was right from the outset. As its report stated, the commission &ldquo;did not try to balance what may be politically acceptable to this group against what is reckoned to be acceptable to that&rdquo;. Rather, it brought forward proposals for a policing service which, in the words of the Agreement, &ldquo;can enjoy widespread support from, and is seen as an integral part of, the community as a whole&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill to give effect to the Patten recommendations brought forward by the British Government in May was, as I said at the time, deficient in many respects. Now that it has completed its passage through Westminster, it is only fair to acknowledge that efforts have been made to assuage Nationalist concerns in key areas and that the Bill has been improved in several important and significant respects. However, perhaps in part due to the adversarial nature of the legislative process, there is a fear among many Nationalists that the big picture, the vision in the Agreement and in Patten, has been lost sight of, a fear that seeking to weigh what is sought by one side against what is perceived to be unacceptable to the other could affect the transformative capacity of the project.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Nationalist parties continue to want to see the project as a whole succeed. At his party's conference, Seamus Mallon, for whom the question of policing has been a vital issue throughout his long and distinguished career, said that his party is willing to work the new arrangements if they are workable, but that the British Government must demonstrate this not just in the Bill, but also in the implementation plan and its wider attitudes. Sinn Féin also stated that it is prepared to withhold its definitive decision until the final version of all the various components is in place.</P>
    <P>The time has now come to study and to reflect, to assess objectively how far we have come and to see what remains to be done. We need to work to build on the improvements that have been achieved so that there is certainty and clarity about what will happen and when. Most of all, perhaps, we need to work to build confidence and <Col N="951" /> to provide reassurance that the vision and values of the Agreement and of the Patten Commission continue to lie at the heart of the policing project. Bringing a satisfactory conclusion to a number of well-known cases that have undermined Nationalist confidence in the administration of justice would also greatly help in creating a new context.</P>
    <P>We will continue to work constructively with the parties and with the British Government in the days ahead. In doing so, our priority should be clear. The policing project is too important, too central to the Agreement, to run the risk of failing. Without that Nationalist support, it simply cannot succeed. We must continue to work to ensure that it does.</P>
    <P>Throughout the peace process we have learnt that it takes co-operation to move forward, that the greatest progress is made when the two Governments work closely and co-operatively together. We have come to realise that neither community &ndash; Nationalist nor Unionist &ndash; can succeed in having its needs met without the co-operation of the other. Like the institutions, the futures of the two traditions on this island are interlocking and interdependent. The parties need to be conscious of each other's immediate needs and to be willing to help one another out so that full implementation of the Agreement in all its aspects can eventually be secured.</P>
    <P>Equally, the pace of our progress cannot be dictated by the forces of reaction on both sides. We need courageous leadership to ensure that respective political constituencies on both sides are led forward, not dragged backwards. We need to move on from the stop-start approach that impedes our progress and that threatens to undermine all we have achieved. We must avail of every opportunity to promote the benefits the Agreement offers us all. Economic opportunity and social inclusion measures are, after all, as important on the Shankill as they are on the Falls.</P>
    <P>The people need to reassert their sense of ownership of the Agreement and to make their voices heard. Being part of a political leadership team can be a lonely and somewhat isolating experience. Civic society needs to be vocal and active in its support for the Agreement to which the people of Ireland, North and South, gave their overwhelming endorsement. They need to stand four-square behind those who are struggling to see it implemented in full so that their public representatives get on with their real day to day business. That will create the necessary trust and confidence and it will also resolve the more difficult issues in an active and politically dynamic context.</P>
    <P>The Agreement provided us all with the opportunity for closure, to put an end to division, conflict and zero-sum gain. It offers us the chance to close the book on the tragedies of our past and to create a new and better future together. There are those, republican dissidents included, who continue to advocate the violent methods of the <Col N="952" /> past. They are doomed to fail. We will continue to be tireless in our efforts to bring those who resort to violence to justice, but equally we will defeat them by demonstrating that the Agreement has the potential to create a truly new beginning and that politics works for everyone's benefit.</P>
    <P>They are out of step with the people of Ireland, North and South, who have chosen another, better way. The people recognise that there is no credible or workable alternative to the Agreement. It is our future and there can be no turning back. We will continue to work with all of those who want the Agreement implemented in full. We will leave no stone unturned in our efforts and we will succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I compliment him on a speech that was positive and realistic. It was a comprehensive and insightful survey of where we are today. I compliment him on the great sense of energy and integrity he has brought to everything he has done, not only in relation to Northern Ireland but throughout his career.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the Minister's speech that this is a taking stock debate &ndash; we are considering what has happened since we last discussed Northern Ireland in the House. The Minister was correct to put where we are into context. It is easy to get bogged down in the day to day detail and to forget how far we have come and how much has been achieved in the past couple of years. It is easy to forget the sense of helplessness which enveloped almost everybody through much of the 1970s and 1980s when there was one attempt after another and it appeared impossible that real dialogue would get under way. In that sense, the context must always be stressed when people become pessimistic about Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>A phrase we increasingly hear in the economic arena these days is that we are suffering from the problems of success. To a certain extent, all the problems enumerated by the Minister are the result of the success of the past couple of years. Each problem can be tackled and resolved on its own. There might be trouble if they all arose at the same time, but each one can be tackled in turn. Given what has been achieved to date, each one is capable of being solved.</P>
      <P>Those of us who visit the North on a regular basis notice the sense of normality over most of Northern Ireland now. The sooner Northern Ireland politics assumes the same sense of normality and is concerned about the every day mundane issues of political life, the closer we will be to seeing the Northern Ireland problem as something that is of interest to historians but not in day to day life. It is very refreshing and encouraging, from a perspective of 80 years of stable democracy in this part of the country where we take a great deal for granted, to see how well the Ministers and many of the members of the new Assembly have taken to parliamentary politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Ministers, Sir Reg Empey <Col N="953" /> led a trade delegation to the US with all-party backing from the Assembly. We can rightly be impressed by the professionalism and the way he puts across the case for greater investment in Northern Ireland. In my dealings with Dr. Sean Farren on third level education I see someone almost born for the job. He loves what he is doing and he is very good at it. He could grace any ministry in any country. Martin McGuinness has impressed people who have dealt with him on questions of education. He has shown a good grasp of his brief and a great directness in stating his case. All of these things are extremely encouraging and show that these people are taking to parliamentary politics. This also applies to Assembly members.   </P>
    <P>I hope the problems on the North-South Ministerial Council can be resolved and it will be back in action soon. The decision of Mr. David Trimble may have given him a certain amount of short-term relief in a very difficult political situation but to continue with this serves no purpose. It has become a divisive issue. It is creating problems which are out of proportion to what is involved. I hope some way can be found to take this pointless and divisive issue off the agenda as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I was pleased the Minister mentioned in his speech that the time may now be right to look at the establishment of a North-South parliamentary body. I noticed that he said this was not a matter for Governments. He is right. This is a matter for parliaments. On an all-party basis in both Houses here and in consultation with the parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly we should start to look seriously at the establishment of a North-South body.</P>
    <P>We have seen from the success of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body that politicians across different divides have a great deal in common. We all deal with the same sort of problems and the same sort of people, constituents and the general public. We have a common language. We also have a great deal to learn from each other. We, in particular, with our long tradition of parliamentary democracy, would have a great deal to contribute in helping to solidify and confirm the members of the Assembly in their commitment to making their Assembly work. We could learn from them. They have begun a parliamentary life unencumbered by tradition. They can do things in a more businesslike and direct way without the need to reinvent things to have the appropriate circumstances. There is a great deal to be learned. We could have a very positive body. It would be a very positive move if steps could be taken. The Minister made the point that this was not a matter for Government. Perhaps it is a matter for the Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>We could easily be discouraged if we took the problems in Northern Ireland one by one on a day to day basis. It would be easy to be discouraged by the instability which is evident at times in the leadership of the Unionist Party and the constant sniping and attempts to undermine the <Col N="954" /> leader of that party. We see the unchanging nihilistic approach of the DUP, an utterly destructive mindset which, if given its way, would trap all of us in generations of blackness and paralysis. That has not changed and it is a great pity. We always have to be alive to the certainty that every bit of mischief and destruction that can be done by these people will be done. We must be able to withstand all of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned in very strong terms the nihilistic and very destructive approach of the so called Real IRA. These people still believe they can achieve their ends through violence and force the imposition of their will on people who have rejected them in every way possible. All of us share the Minister's determination that this group be given no opportunity to undermine the Agreements or bring about misunderstanding either between Governments or between democratic parties on any part of this island.</P>
    <P>We see the disappointment felt by many Unionists, and not just Unionists, by the slowness of the decommissioning process and the failure of the IRA to live up to the spirit as well as the letter of the Agreement. We understand the problems and difficulties. If we are talking about confidence building there is a great deal that could be done and I hope it will.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed by the way the Minister approached the Patten report and the reform of the police service in Northern Ireland. He is correct that what has been offered through the Patten Commission is a vision of how Northern Ireland could be policed in a different cross-community way. All sections of the community could have confidence in it and it would help bury many of the ghosts of the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister was right to stress that a great deal of movement has taken place in the past couple of weeks on the Patten report. A lot of progress must be made. Nonetheless, it is moving in the right direction. The issue is being diffused. I hope we can see reforms implemented which would make it possible for all sections of the community in Northern Ireland to view the police force in the same way as we view the Garda Síochána or as people in other countries view their national police force. They view it as a police force that belongs to all of the people, that is not partisan and whose purpose is to serve and uphold the law.</P>
    <P>We see all of these things. Each of them has the capacity to damage the current situation. But over the past while there have been huge pluses in Northern Ireland. I will mention three of them because we tend to take them for granted. The transformation of Sinn Féin has been extraordinary. It is now a professional, organised, very able and ambitious political party. I have no doubt that it is utterly committed to the principles of democracy and parliamentary democracy. I am sure it wants to work to achieve its legitimate ends. Any political party has the right to achieve its lawful ends through ordinary electoral and <Col N="955" /> parliamentary politics. We, as politicians, welcome that. The more the institutions are seen to work the more Sinn Féin will find itself to be a legitimate political party which can achieve its aims in the same way as the rest of us.</P>
    <P>It is very important at this stage to pay tribute to the very many people, in the US especially, such as Bill Flynn who did a great deal to encourage Sinn Féin in from the cold and educate them in the ways of parliamentary politics. He was able to give them access when others were not and he knocked some of the corners off the party. I believe the evolution of Sinn Féin is permanent and it is something all of us should genuinely welcome.</P>
    <P>It is very encouraging that David Trimble has, in spite of many difficulties, stuck with the Agreement. He has shown considerable courage in facing down the wreckers in his own party. It must be very daunting to find time and again that small people in your own party, the destructive forces, are out to trip and hinder you at every possible turn. His courage in sticking with the Agreement is something that we here in the calmer waters of our politics should never underestimate.</P>
    <P>As the Minister mentioned, we should be very glad that the public is still very positively with the Agreement. Ordinary people like what they see and they want to hold onto it. They like the possibility of building a society fit for the 21st century rather than harking back to the ghosts of old. The support of the people is still the strongest basis for having confidence that Northern Ireland will evolve in the way we hope.</P>
    <P>The Minister was right to say that civil society needs to be more vocal. The business, academic and trade unions leaders, the newspaper owners and anyone who forms opinion in Northern Ireland all need to be more vocal in their support for the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. They should support it during the hard tough quiet days as well as during the days of great excitement.</P>
    <P>One of the failures among many in Northern Ireland has been the failure of the educated middle classes to support the political process and those who go into politics, which is a very unglamorous, badly paid and often dangerous profession in Northern Ireland. They deserve far more support than they have got from the business and middle class communities, who are in many ways the main beneficiaries of peace and stability. The Minister was right to stress the need for strong backing from civic society.</P>
    <P>The fourth great positive is the fact that the Governments of Britain and the Republic are working together. Of course, there are differences and things get a bit frayed from time to time, with public rows here and there. However, that is part of normal life. The reality is that the Governments and civil servants are working together. Each has a healthy respect for the other and neither takes the other for granted nor at <Col N="956" /> face value. There is a cautious amount of trust. However, there is a working relationship which allows problems be resolved in an orderly way. There are procedures, processes and personal relationships there. A level of trust has been built up. That is part of the glue which will ensure the Agreement will be held together.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland will never be a very happy place. It is the nature of northern people everywhere to be chippy, fractious and combative. Nobody expects the Good Friday Agreement to deliver happiness. However, at least, Northern Ireland now has stability and the mechanisms through which it can resolve its problems. Perhaps it is time for it to start to fend more for itself and to depend less on the outside world to nurse it and resolve its problems. It now has the institutions through which it can resolve most of its problems. It will be a very happy day when the only relationship we have with Northern Ireland is on questions of tourism, sport, education and so on, working through institutions we both support and want to make work, rather than the fire brigade attention which so often passes for policy at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister was right to say how much good could be done if certain outstanding cases, such as the Finucane case, could be resolved. They have the capacity to poison relationships over a long period. Hopefully, the Bloody Sunday inquiry will finally get to the truth of that horrific day and terrible episode. I hope all the truth will be told and that people will be able to live normal lives knowing, not that that wrong has been righted &ndash; it never can be &ndash; but that, at least, the truth is known.</P>
    <P>However, I wonder if we are too prone to looking back. Sometimes, a little national amnesia is a very good thing. After our Civil War ended, people did not talk about the events. Children who grew up in the 1930s and 1940s were not told by their parents of the episodes of the Civil War. There was a sense that certain things were better left lie without stirring them up and keeping them going. Likewise, in France, after the Second World War, a whole generation grew up not knowing about some of the terrible things that happened in France. Sometimes a little forgetfulness is a good thing. One has to get on with life and move on.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the Minister that the outstanding cases need to be resolved, it would be no harm if we could get to the stage where we could leave Northern Ireland to the historians, social scientists, other academics and the movie makers and let ordinary people move into the future. I compliment the Minister on doing his job very well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to the House to update us on Northern Ireland, which is probably the most important issue we could discuss in Parliament. I congratulate him on his total commitment to sustaining <Col N="957" /> the peace that has been achieved and trying to enhance and progress it.</P>
      <P>The situation in the North of this island, saturated as it is with the passions, distrust and hurt which come with conflict, is an matter where Government policy should, above all, be dominated by the desire to establish firmly the values of partnership, mutual respect and equality in the day to day lives of the population of our island. It is only when these values are let flourish that peace can at last thrive. Where peace is allowed develop and grow, the potential of ordinary men and women will no longer be clouded by distrust and uncertainty. This potential will grow and shape a prosperous and just society for all.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provides the framework to establish these values. The Executive, through its leaders, seemed the most visible example of how the two traditions in Northern Ireland could work together in partnership, equality and mutual respect.</P>
      <P>In the Assembly, representatives of the two traditions have debated many issues with much vigour and enthusiasm. We have witnessed these opposing traditions attempting to resolve their differences of opinion through a parliamentary process, where face to face contact and frank exchange of opinion have replaced the pre-Agreement position when no party listened to the other.</P>
      <P>When we consider this great change in the context of the island as a whole, the frequent meetings of Ministers from both jurisdictions in the North-South Ministerial Council bring home to us all the progress which has been made. When we compare this normality to the reaction when the then Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, made the first tentative cross-Border contact with the then Northern Prime Minister, Terence O'Neill, or when a North-South council was mooted in the Sunningdale Agreement, we can truly appreciate the extent of this change in its historical context.</P>
      <P>We cannot allow the Good Friday Agreement and the progress and change associated with it to slip away. It is the bedrock for the future. We cannot return to a situation where all the work to date is assigned to history and not built upon. We cannot allow a state of affairs to arise where future generations on this island are deprived of that spirit of peace and reconciliation which we, only lately, have experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Formidable work has been carried out by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, the current Minister, Deputy Cowen, past Taoisigh, Ministers of State and everyone who has worked so hard to bring us to where we are today. Their approach has never been to apportion blame or to indulge in recrimination, but rather to progress solidly and diplomatically towards the goal of lasting peace. They have realised that recriminations have no place in the serious pursuit of reconciliation. From my personal knowledge of the present Minister and from his political record to date, I am very confident he will spare no effort in seeking to move matters <Col N="958" /> forward. His sentiments in the aftermath of various outrages and crimes that have taken place in the North of Ireland are there as testimony for all to see.</P>
    <P>In regard to the suggestion in the contributions of the Minister and Senator Manning in regard to all parties in the North and South getting together, I would see Seanad Éireann playing a major part in that regard under new Standing Orders or the Seanad review, whereby MEPs from the North and South could have the right of audience in Seanad Éireann to discuss the various European reports which are so relevant to the island of Ireland. There would be all party support for this proposal in the Seanad. I look forward to the day it becomes a real possibility.</P>
    <P>We do not witness too often the great talents of Seamus Mallon, who was a distinguished Member of this House. He and I took our seats on the first day I became a Member on 7 May 1982. He was one of the most outstanding speakers in the House.</P>
    <P>We are very well informed and briefed in the House. The Minister referred to the contribution of Senator Maurice Hayes. He is a treasured and valuable Member, as is Senator Haughey. They are in daily contact with what is happening in the North of Ireland and know at first hand what is happening there. I am grateful to the Minister for attending the House and allowing us to have this debate and I look forward to many further visits by him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like it thought that the Independent Senators were not interested in this extremely important debate. I was very impressed with the Minister's speech. Since taking up his appointment he has made great efforts to continue the peace process in Northern Ireland. That is to be much welcomed.</P>
      <P>I attended a meeting recently at which Denis Haughey MLA spoke. When talking about the past he reminded us of the horrific events which took place in Northern Ireland. He spoke of a constituent of his, a man named Patsy Gillespie who made sandwiches and sold them to whoever came to him. He was kidnapped by the IRA, strapped to his car with a bomb under him and told that if he did not drive to an army base his family would be killed. When he got to the base and rolled down the window of his car he was vaporised by the remote control button being pressed to detonate the bomb. Only a few years ago such episodes were taking place in this country and bringing shame on all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that this process continues. Of course there will occasionally be backward steps, but in general the process has moved forward. I was delighted to meet Deputy Albert Reynolds in the House today because it gave me the opportunity to congratulate him again on the establishment of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. That was one of the most important initiatives taken in the last 20 years in trying to bring peace to Northern Ireland. It broke down <Col N="959" /> barriers between people who rarely met. How could each side have been expected to know what the other side was like? Nothing is more frightening than rumour and making attempts to assess the position of those of whom one has very little knowledge.</P>
    <P>I was privileged to be a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Former Senator, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, did a tremendous job in chairing it. Splendid progress was made at that time and we must be very grateful to Deputy Reynolds for what he did.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we continue with our endeavours to break down barriers. I have frequently bored the House about the need for co-operation between both parts of the island. I recently read the national cancer report and noted the close co-operation with Northern Ireland. Our genes and, regrettably in many instances, environmental conditions are the same. Co-operation at these levels is to the benefit of us all.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard spoke this morning about the need to develop acute hospital services in Monaghan general hospital. People there might do better to look north of the Border with a view to accessing facilities, rather than attempting to develop acute hospital services in small towns which do not have the population to sustain good modern medical practice. For example, great co-operation has taken place between medical practices in County Donegal and the hospital at Altnagelvin in Derry. The logic of the situation is to look to the best treatment available nearest to patients.</P>
    <P>These kinds of practical initiatives are the most important way to go forward. In my profession there was never a North-South divide. The Royal College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Physicians are all-Ireland. The co-operation at the recent meeting in Cavan of the Northern branch of the British Medical Association and the Irish Medical Organisation was an unprecedented step. All those present asked how soon they could meet again to discuss further topics of mutual importance.</P>
    <P>Social contact is also very important. The more we try to travel North to meet people the better. Sometimes this can get one into deep waters. I was grateful to Senator Ó Murchú for his help with the problem I encountered this week when I was asked if I could find an Irish pipe band to play at a festival in east Belfast. I explained to the Senator that the Irish pipe band scene is not one of my fortes, but we must make whatever effort is required.</P>
    <P>I am delighted Senator Maurice Hayes was mentioned so warmly by the Minister. He has done tremendous work. He had a party of visitors from east Belfast last week and I was delighted to meet them and some other Senators may have met them. They told me they had visited Stormont and were a little anxious about visiting Dublin. However, they were very pleased to dis<Col N="960" /> cover that we all spoke English. They said some people in Stormont spoke Irish and they were not sure what they were saying. I said it was a matter of politeness in this House to speak English, especially when there were visitors in the Visitors Gallery who may not be as familiar with Irish as the rest of us. We got good marks for our behaviour.</P>
    <P>We should do our utmost to reciprocate visits from people like Sir Reg Empey, Lord Denis Rogan and Lord John Blaird who have made the effort to visit here by going to Northern Ireland again. Those who want to support the Agreement badly need our support and the more often we visit looking suitably normal the better. At the meeting where I met Denis Haughey MLA I was reminded of the time all the Ministers travelled to Armagh to attend the meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council. They arrived in approximately 20 Mercedes cars, which caused a lot of trouble in the North. I said it had also caused a fair amount of trouble in the South, where people asked why they could not have travelled by bus.</P>
    <P>The reciprocation of any practical facilities which are of value to the populations of both parts of the island is the way to proceed. As a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body I have tried to encourage Unionists to attend meetings of the body. It is extraordinary that at the last meeting there were observers from the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, from Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Observers from Jersey sent apologies because they could not attend, yet we were not in a position to welcome Unionist Members of the Legislative Assembly in Belfast. We need to work on this.</P>
    <P>There is still difficulty in receiving RTÉ in the Down and Antrim area. I have raised this matter since I became a Member of this House. It does not come under the aegis of the Minister's Department and apparently we cannot broadcast across boundaries without permission. However, it would be a great help if RTÉ was received in this area. We can see all about them, so to speak, and it would be no harm if they saw all about us. The Down and Antrim area is perhaps the most important in Northern Ireland in terms of having our programmes broadcast. It may even lead to improvements on programmes such as &ldquo;Bull Island&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I last spoke on a debate on Northern Ireland on 9 March 2000 I said we were further back than when we started in that we had given away Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, none of the institutions referred to in the Good Friday were operating and that, once again, there was direct rule from Westminster. Fortunately, things have changed since then. Like the Minister, I recognise the statement made by the IRA in May. However, progress is so slow that it often seems we take two steps forward only to take one step back. If a perceived concession is made on <Col N="961" /> the Nationalist side, the Unionists try to block it in whatever way possible.</P>
      <P>We have, in effect, said goodbye to the Patten report. Dr. Clifford Shearing, one of the independent members of the Patten commission, stated that the new police Bill dismantled the foundation on which the commission was founded and went on to say that core elements of its report had been undermined. The Patten report envisaged that the new policing body would have genuine powers to require the chief constable to report on any issues pertaining to the performance of its functions or those of the police service. The Bill which has just been passed in Westminster shows that this will not happen. The chief constable will now be allowed to question almost any attempt by the board to obtain a report or to get further information on a report it has received. It has been said that the Patten report has been gutted, not merely cherry picked.</P>
      <P>One of the key issues in the Good Friday Agreement related to the establishment of a neutral police force. Nobody from any part of the Nationalist divide can ever give true allegiance to the partisan police force which has existed for so long and which still exists. I recall Burntollet, I recall when the RUC went into the Bogside and broke windows and I recall having a gun shoved in my face as I travelled through the Six Counties on my way from Donegal to a football match in Monaghan. The situation has not altered very much since then. We still have the same police force which fatally beat Sammy Devaney in his own home in the 1960s and the same force which recently failed to protect Catholics from sectarian violence in Larne.</P>
      <P>The Patten report proposed a 50:50 recruitment ratio of Catholics and Protestants in order that it might be possible in ten or 15 years' time that 30% of the police force would be Catholic. Mr. Trimble stated that 50:50 recruitment was an insult to human rights and should not be allowed. I cannot see what he is afraid of. Mr. Trimble should be reminded that there are 159 RUC installations in the Six Counties, backed up by 78 British Army installations. When one combines the membership of the RUC, the British Army and the Royal Irish Regiment, they number approximately 27,000 members who can protect Mr. Trimble. Mr. Trimble should also be reminded that 280,000 legally held arms remain in Unionist possession. If there is to be any progress in the Six Counties, it must have a neutral police force which comprises members from both sides of the political divide &ndash; Nationalists, loyalists, Catholics and Protestants &ndash; so that if we ever see another civil rights campaign, Nationalists will at least be allowed to march.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the RUC has suffered, with many of its members having been killed or injured in the line of duty and their families devastated. I have heard complaints from some quarters to the effect that the RUC will not be answerable for events in the past. We should let the past go and address the imbalance in the force <Col N="962" /> instead. Many of the men released from prison are not required to look back and the RUC should not be required to look back either.</P>
    <P>This is a time of new beginnings. Unfortunately, the British Government has missed a great opportunity to assist, via the development of a new police force, in this new beginning. I did not expect much from Jeffrey Donaldson or Ian Paisley but Mr. Trimble, at least, should have had the wit to side with Patten. I certainly expected more from Mr. Mandelson, although it appears I was foolish to do so.</P>
    <P>What can we do? We must stand up and be counted. Though a small nation, we have always been able to stand on our own two feet without fear. We must continue to show the resilience we showed in the past when de Valera ceased paying annuities to Britain. If we can stand up to a large nation and show our resolve, we will be respected.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Good Friday Agreement are clear and, if they are adhered to by all parties, progress will be made in regard to the establishment of a lasting peace. If the terms of the Good Friday Agreement are implemented in full, the Six Counties will eventually become a place in which people will be able to live and work in a peaceful manner, irrespective of their particular allegiances or political persuasions. This will benefit all of Ireland and will ultimately benefit England, Scotland and Wales too.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Good Friday Agreement cannot be dealt with in a piecemeal fashion. We cannot pick and choose from it. We must continually remind ourselves and others, particularly Messrs. Mandelson and Trimble, that all the institutions are interdependent. Whether Mr. Trimble likes it or not, there is an all-Ireland dimension to the Agreement to which he and his party have signed up. That dimension must be recognised, respected and implemented. The intrinsic political and economic values of North-South co-operation are obvious but such co-operation also has the potential to help us to address the challenges which face us. The all-Ireland dimension is significant across a range of Government activity, allowing for the pooling of information and resources, potential synergies, economies of scale and key policy approaches. Issues which impact on our economic competitiveness such as human resources, infrastructural development and e-commerce are common to both parts of the island and a joint approach will allow them to have far greater impact in both jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Irish and British Governments to tackle this issue, on which the Irish Government has always taken a firm line. It has clearly enunciated time and again that the provisions of the Patten report must be put in place. The British Government, however, has not displayed a similar zeal in pursuing these objectives.</P>
    <P>The Patten report is only one issue which requires action. Others include demilitarisation and the banning of Sinn Féin Ministers from attending North-South ministerial council meet<Col N="963" /> ings. However, we should not become too disheartened. The Minister stated in his speech that just as one thinks one is reaching the top, a new and steeper slope appears. That is true of all negotiations, but particularly of negotiations in Northern Ireland. Having come this far, we can go further. The progress which has been made has been nothing short of revolutionary. What is more, it has been achieved through the ending of violence and through partnership rather than domination.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that we have learnt that it requires co-operation to move forward. We can only achieve progress by co-operating with people of different persuasions and political beliefs. The Good Friday Agreement gives space for everybody's aspirations. If we implement the Agreement and abide by it, Unionists and Nationalists will have a place in the new society and the new Ireland. The Agreement was voted in by the majority of the people in this country &ndash; by country, I refer to the geographical entity &ndash; and only by adhering to it can we maintain the peace which has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The other path has ceased forever although there is still a group called the Real IRA which causes mayhem. One need only think back to a very recent explosion to understand what will happen if we give way to these people. Everybody else is committed to the process in one way or another. People will not get everything they want at once but we must keep up the effort.</P>
    <P>The Minister is recognised as having one of the best minds in the Cabinet and his dedication to this process is singular. If anyone can bring this process forward in a spirit of co-operation, he can and I wish him well in his task.</P>

Níl aon amhras ann ach go bhfuil an-chabhair tugtha ag an Aire do phróiseas na síochána agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go maith leis amach anseo mar tá an-chuid deacrachtaí fós ann. Ach níor chreid éinne go mbeadh a mhalairt de scéal ann mar táimid ag plé anseo le stair agus leis na céadta bliain agus ní mór a bheith foighneach agus cúramach.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for his role in the peace process. He has demonstrated that he is exceptionally astute and at the same time co-operative. He is also very determined while being conciliatory. In many ways he is one of a new breed of statesmen who is able to rise above narrow definitions and provide us all with new goals, and for that I compliment him very sincerely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No subject has occupied more of our time or generated more debate than Northern Ireland. There have been many debates on it in this House. We have normally looked for a debate when it seemed the peace process was in some danger. At the same time there has been progress from the last debate, which would have been seen <Col N="964" /> as a crisis intervention, and we can see the organic development of the peace process.</P>
    <P>Some years ago before the fall of the Berlin Wall I had occasion to travel from West Germany to East Germany, when I passed through what was a cage. I realised then what a physical barrier was between people. I was in contact with other organisations in Germany at that time and had the opportunity to observe the traumatic consequences which resulted from that division. On one occasion I brought a group from Germany to Northern Ireland. They were very surprised to see no physical barriers as we passed from the Republic to the North of Ireland. However, we know there are barriers which are not of a physical nature. There are walls of suspicion, hatred, misunderstanding and supremacy. These walls are every bit as difficult, perhaps more so, to demolish than any physical wall.</P>
    <P>At the height of the peace process I had an occasion to invite a former loyalist paramilitary to speak at a function in Dublin. He was accompanied by his wife and I had the opportunity of discussing things person to person over a meal. I tried to understand their background and whence they came. Hopefully, he endeavoured to do the same with me. I learned quite an amount from him, for example, that royalty was not necessarily his heritage and that he had no particular reason to celebrate the world wars. Loyalists living in ghettos have not really benefited from the sloganeering of some of the Unionist leaders through the years. In many ways they have been as victimised as many of the Nationalists during that period. What most surprised me was the barrier which existed in terms of knowledge. For example, his wife had never heard of County Clare, which was very difficult to believe.</P>
    <P>We must understand that we have much bridge building and interacting to do. Nationalists and republicans have been particularly generous in this regard. The leadership provided by the Irish Government has been very important, having always worked on the basis of consistency. The biggest danger is not having consistency in negotiation, because if the goalposts are being changed constantly it is very difficult to realise the aims. The Irish Government has been consistent throughout, up to and beyond the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>We are particularly lucky to have the Good Friday Agreement in place as it is a charter with international standing and in many ways eliminates the possibility of misunderstanding or misinterpretation. It must be the basis of all our discussion. All parties have signed up to the Agreement and have benefited from it.</P>
    <P>I was particularly worried to hear the member of the Patten commission using the term &ldquo;gutted&rdquo; in referring to the British Government's reaction to the Patten report. The member wrote at length in <i>The Guardian</i>. My understanding is that the gentleman is very honourable, very level headed and not given to any form of extremism, but is <Col N="965" /> endeavouring to be helpful. Nevertheless he was clearly stating that as a member of the commission and having worked on the report he felt that not only were constraints being put on the report but an effort was being made to gut it. I am glad that the Irish Government and the Minister have not backed away from that challenge as it is so important that a future North of Ireland, a future Ireland and a future relationship between the North and South is based on justice. The edifice we are talking about is peace with a foundation of justice. Each time we chip away at that foundation we chip away at the possibility of peace. We have peace and that is important and the foundation is now being strengthened.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations concerning the Secretary of State, Mr. Mandelson, in this process. I have read what he has had to say and have observed what he has done and the way in which he is able to sideline and avoid the core questions being asked, something he can do exceptionally well and with eloquence. He must answer those core questions. We all understand that Unionists may have their difficulties as they come from a background where they were never questioned or challenged in the past. They were able to live in an artificially created state. There is no doubt it would not have been accepted in any other part of the developed world.</P>
    <P>The other night I listened to a report on the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, to a tape salvaged from San Francisco and to a former member of the British Army who has since died, giving evidence of what he experienced and of the people shot around him on Bloody Sunday. He shed bitter tears that his former comrades were capable of acting in such a terrorising fashion with absolutely no discipline whatsoever. The big question is whether they were acting on higher authority, as I believe they were. If they were it shows two sets of laws and military codes existed. We see a similar position with the murders of Pat Finucane, Rosemary Nelson and Robert Hamill, with no effort whatsoever being made at redress, even though they are cases which point glaringly to collusion on the part of the security forces. I cannot understand how a person who would claim to be a member of the mother of Parliaments can stand over such collusion.</P>
    <P>These are the challenges facing us and we should not allow them to discourage us. In the North of Ireland of 25 or 30 years ago we see echoes of what is happening in Palestine. We can realise what might have happened, indeed what nearly happened in Ireland. It is good we had people who were determined to continue making an effort, even though it was very difficult.</P>
    <P>I talk with no degree of bitterness. My own background is English, my mother, God be good to her, was English and I have nothing but the height of regard for British people. However, wherever Britain has gone in the world it has a black record. It must now come clean where Ireland is concerned. The Republic has borne the brunt of the Northern Ireland problems &ndash; the <Col N="966" /> Republic has always been in the front line. We can see what our Irish emigrants in Britain have had to put up with as a result of the Northern problem. It is not right for people who have the power and mandate to do what is right to back away from that in any way.</P>
    <P>We saw what happened the Stalker inquiry. All the inquiries which did not come up with the correct results were sidelined and the people selected by the Government to bring about those reports were demonised for having endeavoured to tell the truth. That is the background against which we are working.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the prize is great. Twenty five or 30 years ago we talked about the prize of peace and justice. It is now within our grasp. We have actually experienced some of that prize and nobody wants to go back. I have had interaction with the people of the North for many years in different ways. I have found all sides to be honourable people. I act as chairman of the Irish Family History Foundation. Sir Robert Kidd was its vice-chairman and I could not praise him highly enough. When one gets to know people down through the years one realises there is a certain basis of ethics which we would all like to adopt. There will always be an element that will try to undermine it. Basically there has always been this code of ethics to which we could all work.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day it is important to keep an aspiration of a united Ireland. By keeping that aspiration we are talking about a natural development. I can hear it more and more in debate, not only among Nationalists but among people of other persuasions as well. We are particularly lucky to have the present Minister giving us the leadership he has given. I have no hesitation in saying that were it not for the fact that we had Taoisigh, such as Deputy Albert Reynolds and Deputy Bertie Ahern, in place there is absolutely no way we would be where we are today. They took the risks. A particular Sunday newspaper, week in and week out, had four and five columnists attacking John Hume, Gerry Adams and Albert Reynolds at that time. When eventually the breakthrough was made against all the odds it was as if they had never written those demonising articles. We should not be swayed by that type of superficial and ineffective type of publicity. We should stand by what we believe in &ndash; humanity, the goodness of the vast majority of the people, justice and peace.</P>
    <P>Whatever ripples there are at the moment can be overcome but not by the likes of Mr. Trimble, for whom I have much admiration in ways, taking it upon himself, perhaps to save his own bacon, to take from the Good Friday Agreement and unilaterally deciding that properly elected Ministers will be excluded and prevented from doing their duties. That is not a starter. Until that new maturity prevails &ndash; a maturity that, perhaps, was not necessary for Northern politicians in power previously, but it was always necessary for politicians in the Republic &ndash; and the responsibility <Col N="967" /> that goes with it, we will always have an uphill battle but we should not lose hope.</P>
    <P>I congratulate and thank the Minister for all his good work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to the House and congratulate him on a job well done. He continues a good line of Fianna Fáil Ministers for Foreign Affairs who have contributed hugely to the massive advances made in the area of Northern Ireland affairs in the recent past and I wish him well.</P>
      <P>As a youngster growing up in Skerries, we lived in a rather cosmopolitan village. In the 1960s the economy of the town was built entirely around two months of the summer, July and August. This was in the days when package holidays to the Continent had not been heard of and the traditional seaside holiday resort was at its height in Britain and Ireland. Skerries had the good fortune to be a place of desirable resort for the middle classes of the north side of Dublin, while Bray fulfilled a similar role on the south side.</P>
      <P>In Skerries we also had the interesting influence of a large number of Northern Ireland people who came for their holidays in July; the Dublin people came in August. I have an early recollection of asking my father why the Northern people came in July and the Dublin people came in August. I was told simply that the Northern people had to get out in July. I became very friendly with some people from Portadown who rented a house next door to me for five or six years &ndash; it seemed as if it was the entire period of my childhood. This was the first real indication I had of the difficulties in the North. Drumcree then did not have anything like the significance it has now. Not a 12 July goes by when I have not thought of that family and wonder where they are today.</P>
      <P>For too long the difficulties in the North were tolerated with courage and stoicism. It is good for everybody, and particularly the Unionist community in Northern Ireland in the long run, that matters have come to the fore. It is regrettable in the extreme that they have been brought to the fore in the manner in which it has happened over the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>Over the years I have had much contact through my sporting involvement with people of all persuasions in the North, particularly of the Unionist persuasion. I have looked on it as one of the more enriching experiences of one's life. It is said that travel broadens the horizons. Certainly travelling regularly to the North to play rugby broadened my horizons considerably and brought me into contact with a whole range of people whom I probably could not otherwise have expected to come in contact with on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often said while we seem to expect the people of Northern Ireland to travel to the South as a matter of normality and almost necessity, <Col N="968" /> traffic in the other direction is much too infrequent and not nearly enough citizens from the Republic travel to the Six Counties either for business, pleasure, holiday or any other reason. Anything we can do in this House to encourage that kind of traffic should be done. The political in-phrase is dialogue, but dialogue is not just a political term and politics is not just confined to Government Ministers and politicians. Politics, the democratic process, is very much reliant upon the active participation of the ordinary citizenry who can do much to progress relationships with the people of Northern Ireland simply by travelling to the North and meeting them socially or commercially. It is not done nearly often enough.</P>
    <P>There are some difficulties in the political process in the North. I congratulate the Minister on the hard work which I know is being done behind the scenes to bring about the resumption of the full working of the North-South Ministerial Council. It is unacceptable that any one party leader should take unilateral action which undermines the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement. While Mr. Trimble's difficulties with the Ulster Unionist Party are a fact of life, he should not address these problems by causing difficulties for the workings of the North-South Ministerial Council. The only way forward is the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is only in this way that the IRA will be able to re-engage with General de Chastelain.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that the institutions of the Agreement, the Assembly, the Executive and the North-South Ministerial Council were by unanimous consent working extremely well. Even their harshest critics would admit they were working to a level of efficiency way beyond the expectation of most at the time of the Good Friday Agreement. Mr. Trimble should remove his sanction which would allow Sinn Féin to use its influence with the IRA to re-engage with General de Chastelain.</P>
    <P>Another issue to which I would like to refer is the police Bill which passed through Westminster in the last couple of days. Policing is obviously a very complex matter and goes to the heart of the Good Friday Agreement. When quoting the basis on which his commission was set up, Patten asked in answer to criticisms of the report, what did the Unionists think they were signing up to. However, while Mr. Trimble and the Unionist Party can be criticised for their reaction to Patten and to the subsequent police Bill debates, the British Government should take most of the blame for the present difficulties. I do not think anyone could improve on the words of Professor Clifford Shearing, an independent member of the Patten Commission, who described the police Bill as gutting the Patten proposals. If a member of the commission from neither side of the community in Northern Ireland considers the police Bill has gutted the Patten proposals, what would Nationalists consider has been done?</P>
    <P>One of the many central issues in the police Bill debate is the question of flags and symbols. <Col N="969" /> By fudging these two central issues of flags at RUC stations and symbols on the uniform, Mr. Mandelson has tried to ride two horses at once and has ended up satisfying neither side. He said in the House of Commons on 21 November that he did not expect the Patten Commission's view that symbols for the new service should necessarily be free of all association with the symbols of the British and Irish States, yet he offered, or appeared to offer, comfort to the SDLP when he stated that its explicit consent would be required for the symbols and flags to be used by the new service. How he proposes to give an effective veto to the SDLP while at the same time setting up new symbols and flags for the new police service has not been explained. This issue can only be solved by strict adherence to Patten. It is vital that this is done without wavering.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to say that progress on Patten has not been made and I do not want to give the impression to the contrary. Much progress has been made but these issues remain to be resolved. The bottom line in relation to Patten is very simply &ndash; will this new legislation allow young Nationalists and republicans walk into a police station and join up? For me that will be the litmus test and we are a long way from achieving that.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the issue of criminal justice reform, particularly in relation to judicial appointments. While the Criminal Justice Commission considered that merit, including the ability to do the job, must continue to be the most important factor in making appointments, there must be a programme of action to secure the development of a Judiciary that is reflective of Northern Ireland society in particular by their religious ethnic background and gender. It goes on to suggest various persons who should set up a judicial appointments commission. However, there are major difficulties in relation to the commission which would take a much longer debate than we have time for here. Does the Minister consider that the present judicial bench as comprised in the higher, middle and lower tiers adequately reflects the background and society in Northern Ireland at present? I do not wish to embarrass any judicial personage but does any member of the Judiciary consider himself or herself to be a Nationalist, never mind republican? Given that the SDLP and Sinn Féin represent in excess of 40% of the population of Northern Ireland, I believe they are not represented in like numbers on the bench. We are a long way from that.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me to conclude my contribution to this debate on Northern Ireland without taking cognisance of the major difficulties of the Nationalist community in relation to obvious miscarriages of justice. The Stevens inquiry into Bloody Sunday is to be welcomed and I wish them well in their deliberations. However, there are other issues with which I would like to deal in some detail. Pat Finucane was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in Belfast on 12 February 1989. Since then, serious allegations have been <Col N="970" /> made concerning collusion between the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries in this case. In March 1999, a police investigation was set up under John Stevens. In June 1999, William Stobie was arrested and charged with murder. This charge was recently changed to aiding and abetting others in murdering Mr. Finucane. The Stevens inquiry is still ongoing.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting with members of the Finucane family on 24 February last, the Taoiseach expressed the Government's view that an independent judicial public inquiry should be set up to examine all the circumstances surrounding this murder. The Finucane family subsequently met with Prime Minister Blair. The British Government has said that it has not ruled out the possibility of a public inquiry but, to date, it has resisted calls for one on the grounds that an inquiry might interfere with the Stevens investigation. I renew the call for an independent inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.</P>
    <P>Without going into the detail of the other two cases, I echo that call in the case of Rosemary Nelson and Robert Hamill. These issues are of huge importance to the Nationalist community in the North, particularly in relation to the confidence building measures that are required to facilitate the implementation of Patten. I renew my call for public inquiries in these three cases.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his predecessors on the tremendous work that is in train in Northern Ireland. I wish him the very best in his future endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am sorry the Minister must leave.</P>
      <P>I agree with the last request for an inquiry into the deaths of Pat Finucane, Rosemary Nelson and Robert Hamill. These deaths occurred in extremely suspicious circumstances and I believe the issue should be cleared up by way of a public inquiry.</P>
      <P>We all support the Good Friday Agreement. The role the Minister for Foreign Affairs is playing in Northern Ireland represents not just the Government's view but the views of the Opposition. There is currently unanimity in relation to the approach to be taken in Northern Ireland and there is no question of anyone on this side of the House carping or complaining about what the Minister is doing. I believe he has a steady hand at the helm in the way in which he is implementing the wishes of the people of this island and the Good Friday Agreement in so far as we have a role to play.</P>
      <P>There are major problems with every agreement. What has been underlined in this Agreement is the principle of consent. For the first time both traditions accept an assembly on this island, we have consented to the removal of Articles 2 and 3, Unionists have consented to the ending of majority rule, an Assembly is in place and bodies have been established under its aegis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> A problem arises when we move from the underlying principle of consent to the implementation of the Agreement and try to make the institutions which have been established work in a co-operative manner. There are residues from the past. The greatest difficulty which hangs over the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is decommissioning. This issue arose at the beginning when Deputy Albert Reynolds began the process but it was not confronted. A decommissioning commission was established and it was hoped that a formula to deal with the matter would emerge in the fullness of time.</P>
    <P>We have returned to an impasse. The Ulster Unionist Council has held the First Minister, David Trimble, a prisoner of its mantra of no co-operation without decommissioning while Sinn Féin and the IRA will allow inspection of weapons but will not surrender them. The North South ministerial bodies cannot function. A meeting is to take place tomorrow between the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and the Northern Ireland Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, but the meeting cannot formally take place because the Northern Ireland First Minister has withdrawn authority for it. When the question is heard in court I believe Mr. Trimble will be found to have acted wrongly in saying the North South Ministerial Council cannot meet if Sinn Féin Ministers participate. This impasse prevents matters proceeding. A similar situation arose earlier this year.</P>
    <P>It is almost 12 months since the ministerial cars drove to Armagh for the first meeting of the Ministerial Council which seemed to signal a new dispensation. However, this dispensation has not been formalised or implemented in a meaningful fashion. Because the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party refuse to co-operate with cross-Border bodies the process has stagnated.</P>
    <P>The Patten proposals have been incorporated into a new Bill which tries to construct a model which would allow both traditions to give allegiance to a new police force. We hear alarming rumours from Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Government that it will be very difficult for the Nationalist community to give allegiance to the police force as proposed by the Patten Commission. If that is the case it will be impossible to police the two communities. A major problem in the past has been the existence of a Protestant police force for a Protestant state and people, with 90% of the membership of the force drawn from one tradition. If this continues the Northern Ireland police force will be meaningless. It is essential that the police Bill win the respect of both communities. It will be useless to enact legislation which does not do that. If the Bill does not have the support of one tradition in Northern Ireland it is a waste of time and it should not be enacted.</P>
    <P>We are witnessing an upsurge in violence from the Real IRA and an upsurge in civil strife from <Col N="972" /> Protestant loyalists. Both groups are dedicated to ensuring that the Good Friday Agreement does not work. We do not see proper policing of violent elements on either side. Police activity on this side of the Border has also been ineffective, given the stringent and draconian legislation enacted immediately after the Omagh bomb. Not a single member of the Real IRA has been convicted or even prosecuted. It is ineffective to place legislation on the Statute Book if it does not serve a purpose. It was for this reason that I was critical of the legislation when it was being debated. The legislation was enacted for show and I predicted that no action would be taken.</P>
    <P>There has been very little effective action on the other side of the Border in dealing with extremists in either community. There is a deterioration in civil society with <i>ad hoc </i>policing by elements within communities. The situation has deteriorated and can deteriorate further. Let us not assume because the Good Friday framework is in place that everyone will eventually see the light and things will fall into place. If there is continuous frustration and a continual failure to overcome obstacles, the process could go back rather than forward. I am not happy with the level of progress since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. Considering the early progress made in the establishment of the Assembly, the elimination of Articles 2 and 3 and the apparent willingness of the Assembly to co-operate in working for the betterment of the people of Northern Ireland, subsequent progress has been slower than I had hoped.</P>
    <P>We are enjoying an economic boom on this side of the Border. We recently heard of 700 new jobs in the Cavan area and there is to be considerable investment in the BMW region and in the Border region, North and South. We have the will and the money to bring about economic prosperity. In terms of a national spatial plan, I know Northern Ireland has drawn up a similar plan to that the Republic has drawn up but because the Department of the Environment is the responsibility of a DUP Minister, it has had to be done by the civil servants. They are extremely anxious that the Border area would cease to be the Border and would become the centre of Ireland and that attention would be focused on it as the central area for development in the context of a new Ireland in which there would be proper cross-Border activity and where the Border, as such, would disappear. That can only take place if we make progress on the institutions.</P>
    <P>We have to look more widely at this because it is not just an institutional, a legislative or a statutory matter. In the final analysis it is a question of the quality of life &ndash; quality of life in terms of social and economic development and pluralism. We must get away from this notion of intolerance. There does not seem to have been one iota of progress made in terms of the suspicion which exists between the two communities. The bigotry is still there. I am afraid we will have the problems at Drumcree and the Lower Ormeau Road <Col N="973" /> for many years to come. We can begin to move away from that if can move forward with the institutions and if we can overcome the stumbling blocks and hurdles that are causing all the difficulties we are experiencing at present.</P>
    <P>We have had these debates from time to time on Northern Ireland. They seem to arise every time there is a difficulty, which means they are arising on more regular basis. We have something of a &ldquo;benevolent uncle&rdquo; role to play in terms of Northern Ireland because everybody on this side is agreed that we should disturb the situation in any way but that we should be a proactive and positive force. In that sense, as politicians we should be in a better position to reach out to Northern Ireland than perhaps we are doing. The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body is one aspect of it and the Council of the Isles is another. Our political parties are another aspect and we have not made any progress in that direction. For example, my party has sister parties in Scotland, Wales, England and the SDLP in Northern Ireland. There is no reason there could not be a conference of parties which share a similar political view on Northern Ireland to see what progress can be made on that basis. I am sure the Government parties have sisterly feelings towards some of the parties North and South and across the water.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to hear the president of the GAA give, I will not say give the green light but certainly the orange light to Croke Park's being used for foreign games &ndash; perish the thought. It is high time, in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, that Croke Park lost its exclusivity and, where possible, opened up its borders, shall we say, to other games being played there. I think economic exigencies will ensure it does so in the future when the stands are finished and when it has capacity for 85,000 or 87,000 people. It will cost a small fortune to run it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering the GAA does not use Croke Park for practically six months of the year and those six months are the time when other sports like soccer and rugby are played &ndash; the winter months &ndash; there is a fantastic opportunity for big international soccer and rugby games to be played there which would bring a significant amount of money into the kitty. In the context of the Good <Col N="974" /> Friday Agreement, the GAA should be out there looking for business from those sporting areas.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.</P>
      <P>Since the Good Friday Agreement was signed in April 1988 and ratified overwhelmingly by all the people, North and South, considerable progress has been made. In Northern Ireland, we now have a democratic, accountable and inclusive Government. Politicians are really tackling the challenging issues which affect everyone's daily lives such as health, environment, transport, etc. This is something that would not have been envisaged in the past.</P>
      <P>The Executive is working, decision making is in hand and local representatives are working tirelessly for the entire community. The basis for sound government and accountability has been achieved and that has ended a long standing democratic deficit in that region. David Trimble, Seamus Mallon and other Ministers in the Northern Executive from the pro-Agreement parties are meeting under the North-South Ministerial Council. The interaction between these Ministers represents a huge step forward in terms of relationships on this island. I have no doubt that the discussion taking place between these people on a wide range of issues can be of benefit North and South. It is also helping to cement greater friendships and greater trust between these people who may never have met.</P>
      <P>The council, we are told, is focusing its work on the six implementation bodies which administer agreed functions on a cross-Border and on an all island basis and on the six agreed priority areas for co-operation, named at the time as agriculture, environment, health, education, transport and tourism. Every matter being considered is clearly in the interest of both parts of this island. I am told the meetings are extremely positive and constructive. At the first meeting, the council adopted a programme of work to which it was going to give very early consideration. Those areas included matters such as the environment, drugs, transport, social inclusion and the economy. They are all very important issues which have real relevance to the daily lives of people North and South. It will focus its attention principally on combating the evils of drugs and drug-related matters. We do not have to look too far back to realise the level of additional violence that drug use and abuse has brought to all communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> As the work of the Council and the implementation bodies progresses and grows in a way that is consistent with the wishes of all the participants, there has to be real and tangible benefits for all us both North and South. The development of trade and tourism and the quality jobs which, hopefully, that will bring eventually will also be of great benefit to us. I am a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation and we are meeting our counterparts from the Northern Ireland Assembly committee on 14 December to exchange views and to look at ways in which we can interact on matters of culture, arts and leisure. Programmes to combat educational under-achievement and special needs, a matter that is dear to my heart, as well as better strategies for tackling the levels of cancer on both sides of the community and health issues in general are examples of the real benefits that will be gained by engaging in these areas.</P>
    <P>An equally important aspect is that the new institutions are about bringing people together. For too long on this island there has been complete distrust between us and there were times when we treated each other with suspicion. All this can be ended by working together to an agreed agenda. From there, we can build better futures and relationships. As the Minister alluded to, some elements of the Agreement still have to be tackled and a great deal of work remains to be done.</P>
    <P>Since the Good Friday Agreement was signed and endorsed by all the people of the island, it has become obvious that confidence among the Unionist community in the benefits it will bring to it has been badly shaken recently. A majority of those who support the Union would continue to support the real essence of the Agreement, but there is a need to address their concerns just as there is a need to address the concerns of Nationalists. It would be foolish to believe that there are not real difficulties that must be faced. The fact that the First Minister, Mr. David Trimble, refused to sign the nomination papers to enable the Sinn Féin members to attend the North-South Ministerial Council and the fact that counter legal action was taken by Sinn Féin to sort out the matter demonstrate the gap that exists between the communities.</P>
    <P>However, there are many positive elements. It is clear from opinion polls that the support among the people for the Agreement is as strong now as it was in May 1998 when they voted on it. It is proven that the ministerial council has operated effectively. As the Minister stated, the Northern Ireland Executive has adopted its budget and its programme for government. He also alluded to the second inspection of the IRA arms dumps and he suggested that the international inspectorate was happy with the commitment of the IRA to advancing the peace process and continuing its <Col N="976" /> efforts to bring about greater effectiveness in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have built on the positive elements and on the confidence on all sides to bring about greater effectiveness. We must move forward in a balanced way and discharge all the commitments placed on us in terms of working the Agreement. Other speakers referred to the report of the Patten Commission. It provides an opportunity for new beginnings in policing. There is a shared objective to have a police force in Northern Ireland that is capable of attracting and sustaining support from all sides of the community. I was encouraged to note recently during the Committee and Report Stages in the House of Lords that there was a meaningful and positive debate on this matter. I was further delighted to hear the Minister say that he would redouble his efforts to bring about a solution to the serious problems that appear to have presented themselves in that regard. I wish everyone well in terms of what they must do in the months and weeks ahead.</P>

      <P>Peace on this island was a prize long sought. Thankfully, we now have peace and its benefits are enormous and way beyond our dreams not only in the six Northern counties but throughout the island. The benefits of peace can be seen. As a representative of a Border county, I was well aware of what 30 years of violence did. My county of Monaghan was badly affected by the Troubles. We suffered from a lack of development and many other side effects.</P>
      <P>Good Friday 1998 was the conclusion of an enormous amount of good work. The risks taken and the sacrifices made by many gave us a whole new future as we entered the 21st century. It was a new beginning for the whole island where people of different political and religious persuasions could live at peace with one another, respecting their traditions and beliefs.</P>
      <P>The road to the Good Friday Agreement took great courage on the part of many people such as the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, Mr. John Hume, Mr. Gerry Adams, Mr. David Trimble, Mr. Séamus Mallon, Senator George Mitchell, Dr. Mo Mowlam and many others. Their work was at times very difficult, but they had the goal of building a new future and moving on from the sufferings of the past. Their convictions gave us a peaceful future. However, 30 years of violence left many broken hearts and great division. It will take time to heal that division and allow trust to be built between the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>While Good Friday 1998 was a new beginning, nobody thought the road ahead would be easy or that there would not be difficulties along the way. I always believed that, with the will to succeed of so many behind it, problems must be overcome because we cannot go back. The institutions resulting from the Good Friday Agreement are working well and producing positive results for the whole island. Trust and respect are being built on daily in the communities of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent decision of the Ulster Unionists to <Col N="977" /> exclude Sinn Féin Ministers from the North-South Ministerial Council is regrettable and most unfortunate. It is vital that the principles of the Good Friday Agreement are upheld. The international body for decommissioning has confirmed its satisfaction that the IRA is fully co-operative with its inspections. This is proof of the IRA's commitment to a peaceful future. It is clear that we can only achieve our shared goal of a lasting peace, prosperity and partnership through the continuing full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. The issue of policing must be resolved urgently. However, the full implementation of the Patten report is most important.</P>
    <P>Those who seek to destroy the Agreement seek a return to the past when grief and heartbreak were the norm. I compliment the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, on their good work. I wish everybody well in the future. It is good to see the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, in the House. He is always welcome.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to raise this issue. Do I take it by the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, that the Department of the Taoiseach has a direct interest in Moneypoint? Will he be speaking about this important issue with the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Taoiseach?</P>
      <P>I raise this matter because earlier this month the Government published the national climate change strategy and that deserves a full public debate and requires complete openness and honesty from the Government. One of the options suggested in the document is the closure of the ESB's 920 megawatt coal burning station at Moneypoint, County Clare. As the Minister of State is well aware, the station operates 24 hours a day all year round. It employs 298 people and has an annual salary bill of £7.5 million. About £2 million is spent on services in the west Clare area. The station is an essential part of the west Clare economy. Any proposal to close it would be a major disaster for the entire community and economy in west Clare and would be met with the severest opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People working at Moneypoint are living in Kilrush and in all the villages in west Clare. They have a positive and constructive input to the local <Col N="978" /> community. Most of these people have resided in the area for between 15 and 20 years and as a result of their living in the are many schools which would have lost students have managed to maintain their staff numbers. Their input has resulted in a vibrant community.</P>
    <P>The staff at Moneypoint are aware of the necessary changes required on environmental grounds. I recognise that the Government signed up to the UN Kyoto protocol in 1997 and is bound to comply with it. The Government, however, is far behind what it agreed to do and has been seriously negligent with regard to that convention.</P>
    <P>The plant already operates to a very high environmental standard. Recently it was awarded the ISO 14001 certificate. This certification is not easily acquired and full marks go to the station's management and staff for securing it. The station has already introduced controls to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and burns a very special low sulphur coal. Plans are also being put in place to further reduce emissions from nitrogen oxide and sulphur oxide.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Government adopts a responsible approach to the future of Moneypoint. I suggest to the Minister of State that he take the this opportunity to state clearly that the Government will not close Moneypoint. He should also outline the strategy it intends to adopt for Moneypoint in light of the publication of the national climate change strategy. I would like to know exactly what strategy for Moneypoint the Government intends putting in place.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have also been made in the national climate change strategy to convert the plant to natural gas. I recommend that the Minister look very seriously at this option and give this matter very serious consideration. Earlier this year, during the debate on the Gas Bill, I suggested to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, that he recommend Bord Gais taking the gas pipe from Ballynacally, which is between Ennis and Kildysart, westwards through Kildysart village, along the Shannon, into Moneypoint and on to Kilrush. I suggest the Minister contacts the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, and the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, to ensure this happens. This would be the answer to everyone's prayers. It would answer the Government's prayer in relation to conforming with the Kyoto Protocol and it would put in place a positive future for Moneypoint.</P>
    <P>However, as matters stand, the people in the area are very fearful that the Government is just making statements. In signing the Kyoto Protocol we have agreed to the end but we do not have a strategy to devise the means to achieve that end. I want a clear statement from the Minister of State this evening on what is being put in place to ensure Moneypoint remains open as a generating station while complying with the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    <P>It is also important, in considering this option, to ensure there is no reduction in the workforce at Moneypoint. If there is a need to transfer <Col N="979" /> people, particularly from a coal burning to a gas station, the people currently working in the coal yard, the area where coal is taken in and the management of that sector, should be transferred to another sector on site and additional services of a complementary nature should be in place to absorb the displaced people.</P>
    <P>The people in west Clare are fully aware of the climatic changes and of the importance of the Kyoto Protocol that was signed in 1997. We see the dramatic changes in climate. The people in west Clare have seen the increase in rainfall and the change in climate. The farmers in the area fully appreciate what is going on.</P>
    <P>We also recognise that we are far from the emissions levels recommended in 1990. It was recommended that we reduce our emissions to 13% of our 1990 levels by 2010. We know we are now at 18% and the forecast for 2010, if we continue the way we are going, is that it could be up to 38%.</P>
    <P>On 2 November the Minister for the Environment and Local Government was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> as stating that this would be done &ldquo;in a manner that protects our economy&rdquo;. I suggest that this matter should be considered in a way which does not damage the economy of west Clare. I understand that last year the International Energy Agency, an OECD body, considered the option of switching Moneypoint from coal to gas. It concluded that it would be a profitable investment which would yield the largest emissions reduction.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, is here from the Department of the Taoiseach. He might be wearing two hats but I will take the message to Clare that he came to this House representing the Taoiseach. Whatever message is in his speech will be interpreted in that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a responsibility to put together a concrete proposal in relation to the conversion of Moneypoint to natural gas. The Minister of State must assure the Seanad, the people working in Moneypoint and the people of west Clare that the Government does not intend in any circumstances to close Moneypoint or to put plans in place that would result in its closure by 2008 or 2010. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I retain a healthy respect for the Senator since those days.</P>
      <P>The Government's strategy for dealing with climate change was published recently by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. That strategy recognises that fuel switching in the electricity sector, to gas and renewables, can deliver significant reductions in COf8&gt;2 emissions. In this context the strategy points out that closure of Moneypoint would make the largest single contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions &ndash; 3.4 million tonnes of COf8&gt;2 per annum.</P>
      <P>The ESB is, therefore, going to be faced with a decision on the future of coal burning at Moneypoint and the question of using gas fired technology instead. It will be a major decision affecting one of the largest electricity plants in the State. I hope that any changeover, including any new technology used, will work well and meet all relevant aspirations, not least of which is the continuing need to ensure security of supply and employment, about which the Senator spoke.</P>
      <P>Business as usual is no longer an option for Ireland in this area I am afraid. Our record economic growth means that, even with flexibility, to continue our development against a low emissions baseline in 1990 our strategy must be radically different in the coming decade. We have already reached our Kyoto 13% target. Now, we have to achieve the difficult task of dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions over this decade. We intend to do so in a manner that protects our economy, is equitable and will place a premium on efficiency and on technical innovation.</P>
      <P>The main greenhouse gas in Ireland is COf8&gt;2. The burning of fossil fuels in electricity generation is not the only contributor to COf8&gt;2 emissions. The use of fossil fuels in transport and heating are also major contributors.</P>
      <P>The Government's climate change strategy indicates that reductions of emissions will be achieved through an integrated approach, using the full range of instruments and policy options. These include the use of economic instruments, including taxation and emissions trading, with broad sectoral and/or cross sectoral application; a broad range of policies and measures tailored specifically to relevant sectors; a vigorous and appropriate pursuit of common and co-ordinated policies and measures implemented at EU and wider international levels and participation in international emissions trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the energy sector the measures envisaged include measures to support fuel switching towards less carbon intensive fuels and the replacement of existing peat plants with more <Col N="981" /> efficient options, an expansion of renewable energy, the maximisation of combined heat and power and an enhanced demand side management programme under the Irish Energy Centre.</P>
    <P>The quality of life for our children and future generations will greatly depend on the success of the strategy and the part we play in it. We should play our full part in that process. I thank the Senator for raising the matter and will certainly convey the opinions she expressed this evening to the relevant Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for letting me raise this matter for the second time in seven years. I raised the matter of a population register in the Seanad over six and a half years ago in relation to the important matter of breast screening, which was being set up in the country. I pointed out that the lack of a population register made it far more difficult to set up breast screening. Breast cancer accounts for the death of one in five women who die from cancer in this country. It is a major cause of concern that premature death is caused by breast cancer.</P>
      <P>I regret that those who have so successfully set up Breastcheck still have the problem that there is no population register. The Minister of State will be aware that at present women are called for a mammographic examination between the ages of 50 and 65 years, but because we have no population register those running the screening programme must rely on getting data from the general medical services and the private health insurance companies, such as the VHI and BUPA. This can mean that some people are called twice because they are on two lists, which is a cause of anxiety, and others may be left out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure we want this to be the most effective form of screening possible. I do not understand why in this day and age, with the proliferation of computer data, this cannot be set up. The National Cancer Register Board produces data on deaths from tumours and leukaemias. It also encounters terrible problems in the absence of a population register. Instead of a central collection <Col N="982" /> of information on the causes of death, the board must employ specially trained nurses to go through the death certificates in various hospitals, collect the information and send it to the board.</P>
    <P>This is an inefficient way of operating. We co-operate with the cancer strategy in Northern Ireland, where information can be immediately obtained from the hospital in-patient inquiry. All the statistics are collected centrally and the various deaths due to cancer and the types of cancer can be identified. Why does the inefficiency I have outlined continue here?</P>
    <P>The best way we can reduce deaths by breast cancer is by screening because it gets not all, but almost all tumours before even the lump can be felt. While symptomatic breast clinics are very important, by the time people attend them they have some sign, usually a lump in the breast or some other symptoms. At the specialist clinics the people involved in the treatment of breast cancer &ndash; surgeons, oncologists, radiotherapists, physiotherapists &ndash; discuss each case together and try to tailor the best form of treatment for the woman concerned. This is why I am sometimes depressed to hear Senators call for the maintenance of very small units around the country. The Minister for Health and Children has said they do not give the best chance of good treatment to patients, although I accept there is no bigger vote catcher for Independent candidates than to stand for election on a ticket of saving the local hospital or clinic.</P>
    <P>We must establish a population register. We may wish to start other screening programmes. The country has a very high rate of prostate cancer. How do we hope to tackle that without a register? The country also has one of the worst rates of death in men from anal/rectum cancer in the world. Only the two parts of former Czechoslovakia have a higher rate.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State explain why we have not managed to establish this register, which could help us to screen for our commonest causes of death? It would also promote research into the various forms of cancer in the country. While genetic factors may be important, environmental factors may also be very important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter. I listened carefully to what she had to say. I am not sure if the official reply before me will adequately deal with the points she raised, but I will ensure that the Taoiseach, Minister for Health and Children and my other Government colleagues are made aware of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs maintains a register of all insured persons under the social insurance system. As soon as a person becomes known to the Department, normally when child benefit is claimed, a personal public service number is assigned to them. This was formerly known as the Revenue and Social Services number. At this stage the following categories have been allocated a personal public service number, all employees, the self <Col N="983" /> employed and people receiving social welfare payments, their spouses and children.</P>
    <P>A person is allocated one of these numbers and retains it throughout their lifetime. Legislation was introduced in 1998 to provide for the standardisation of the RSI number as a unique public service identifier and renamed the personal public service number. The purpose of this unique identifier is to provide a better quality of service through greater ease in communicating with Departments and Government agencies and access to related services from a single point of contact, increased fraud prevention, greater administrative efficiency and effectiveness and more flexibility and better responsiveness to changing needs. The legislation also provides for <Col N="984" /> the sharing of data using the number between a range of public service agencies.</P>
    <P>The Health (Provision of Information) Act, 1997, was introduced to allow the National Cancer Register Board and other agencies participating in any cancer screening programme to request information from persons for the purpose of compiling and maintaining a register of persons who may be invited to participate in that programme. Last year the social welfare legislation was amended to allow for the use of the number as a unique identifier in this process. I will convey the broader points made by the Senator to my relevant colleagues.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.40 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 28 November 2000.</P>
