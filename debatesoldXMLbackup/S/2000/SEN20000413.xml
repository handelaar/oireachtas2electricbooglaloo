    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Equal Status Bill, 1999 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages. Business is to be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>It is unusual to take Committee and Report Stages of a Bill on the same day but I am assured by our spokesperson that there should be no difficulty and that it is agreeable. I commend Senators Ross and Costello for tabling a motion to introduce a register of political lobbyists which we will support. Can I take it that as the Government parties are not opposed to this measure, they will be voting for the motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat anxious about taking Committee and Report Stages of the Equal Status Bill today. However, there have been no objections. Others may have objections and we have some anxieties about this decision.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's comments on a register of lobbyists and that is a good idea. Last week Senators asked for a debate on Northern Ireland. Debates on this issue in the House have been very useful and perhaps we could have another such debate as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated yesterday, we are not happy with the manner in which the Equal Status Bill is being dealt with in this House. This is important legislation. The Bill took 12 months to pass through the Dáil, yet we are putting it through in two weeks. The proposal is to deal with Committee and Report Stages on the one day. A decent gap should be made available to allow further matters to be considered. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we take Committee Stage only today.</P>
      <P>I hope Senator Ross and I will have the support of the House for our motion concerning a register of lobbyists. I am delighted that the Progressive Democrats have seen that changing circumstances require a changing response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted with the progress that has been made on this issue and I am sure the Progressive Democrats will be able to persuade its slightly larger coalition partner of the desirability of this change.</P>
      <P>The EU has ruled that the Government has been infringing the spirit of the parental leave directive in terms of the period to which leave should apply. Is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform contemplating legislation on this issue? This Bill was introduced in 1998 and despite our efforts the Minister refused to make it retrospective to 1993 which was the norm within the EU and the spirit of the directive. The EU has now determined that the legislation should be retrospective to 1993 and the Government has been severely rapped on the knuckles. The Government's decision means that 150,000 children have been denied the opportunity of their parents having 14 weeks unpaid leave, as is the European norm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate whether amending legislation is being contemplated on this important issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House for a debate on FÁS? In light of the present skill shortages and the fact that there is almost full employment, there are courses which are no longer relevant. I would like to see a review of the structure of FÁS. There should be an overlap between the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Education and Science when courses are related to education and training. A huge amount of public money is allocated to FÁS and I would like to know how it is accounted for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I raised the crisis in Ethiopia on the Order of Business. Last night I attended the launch of the report, Biopatenting and the Threat to Food Security. We should debate biotechnology and its effect on Third World countries. We are very concerned about the effect genetically modified food will have for us but we seem to forget that the threat to food supplies in the Third World is far greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for a debate on Northern Ireland, particularly in light of the proposed Orange march in Dublin. I support that march in terms of the freedom of assembly and speech but I also congratulate the Church of Ireland for denying the use of St. Anne's Church in Dawson Street for an Orange service. This House should recommend an ecumenical service <Col N="1719" /> of contrition and reconciliation in St. Anne's. Until this issue blew up, I was unaware that one of the founders of the Dublin Orange Lodge was John Beresford, who was notorious for having a private police force which terrorised the people of Dublin in 1798. Outside his house in Tyrone Street, which is now of far more civilised service to the people as the Department of Education and Science, the citizens of Dublin hung a notice which said, &ldquo;James Beresford, mangling done here&rdquo;, which demonstrates what was going on in his stables.</P>
      <P>I also support the call for legislation on the registration of the lobbying interests on the part of Members and former Members. These people have direct access to this House and all the lobbying opportunities it offers &ndash; the bar, library and restaurants. I was horrified to discover that a person whom I had formerly regarded as progressive was engaged in lobbying for the likes of Rupert Murdoch in this House. We should know who these people are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris's call for an ecumenical service. I have had the honour of reading lessons at many of those services down the years and they are a great way of healing and bringing people together.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on discipline in schools and the home? Recent surveys have indicated that teenagers are beating up their parents. Anyone who watches television will see how teenagers in America have got out of hand, even 12 year old children cannot be controlled. We are getting to that stage now. We have gone too far down the liberal path and it is time to re-examine the issue of discipline and reintroduce some common sense into how we look after young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators Manning, Quill and Norris in their calls for a register of lobbyists. Not only politicians should have to register their interests with the Public Offices Commission. This is all about power and money. The bigger the customer, the more money it has to throw at the lobbyists to perform whatever functions it wishes them to do. It is about much wanting more. The &ldquo;more&rdquo; we need is more accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's amendment to the Order of Business. During the debate on the Equal Status Bill yesterday there were amendments from the Government side which we are still considering and which will have to go back to the Dáil. There is no rush for the legislation and we are as entitled as the other House to consider it properly. The amendments which have been tabled are critical to the operation of the Bill. This side of the House has protested on more than one occasion about rushing legislation. It is not good practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> I support the call for a debate on parental leave. It raises the wider issue of child care and the Government's failure to address it. It is a vital issue for many families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Ministers for Public Enterprise and Education and Science to establish a review body to examine the situation for secondary schoolchildren in rural areas and the bus shelter system? It is unchristian that thousands of children have to wait for school buses in pelting rain, sleet and snow when there is so much money available to the Government. There are problems with advertising companies but the matter should be looked into. I raise this issue on a day that students from Athenry vocational school are visiting the Houses. There are 1,200 students in Athenry and evening after evening in bad weather they must wait in the rain. The Departments must examine the idea of providing bus shelters for children from rural areas; they already exist in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator McDonagh's call for a debate on the need for bus shelters and the whole area of school transport. School buses in rural areas are packed to capacity. There are three or four children sitting on seats designed for two people. The situation is deplorable. This area has been neglected for years.</P>
      <P>A community group in Tipperary has proposed the building of a small community centre. All Members of this House will be interested to hear that it is in honour of a former Member, the late Senator Willie Ryan. The group has asked some Government bodies for help with funding. Perhaps the Leader could explain to the relevant Ministers that this is a gesture by a community to honour a distinguished former Member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on school transport, particularly bus shelters. This is a suitable area for debate in this House in light of the Oireachtas joint committee report on school transport. Many serious issues are raised in that report and it would be appropriate to debate it. Buses have to meet the conditions for the national vehicle test for emissions, brakes and lights, but no such conditions have to be met for the carriage areas. Those are in deplorable condition and are not suitable for transporting children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ormonde's call for a discussion on community employment schemes and the future role of FÁS. There is a good deal of misunderstanding with regard to community councils and the changes proposed in this area. I heard that a monitoring committee will examine the function of FÁS schemes and their relevance to the care of the elderly. Approximately 50% of community employment schemes and FÁS schemes in the western region <Col N="1721" /> focus on care of the elderly and those in hospital. There is a need for a debate on these schemes. Such a debate would be important from a community viewpoint and would be in the interest of the common good. It is important that the House should be advised of the outcome of the assessment of these schemes and that information should be made available to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House told me two weeks ago that the Local Government (No. 2) Bill would be introduced in a month's time. I seek his reassurance on that. That would bring us up to Easter week and, enthusiastic as we are, I doubt if the Minister would come in to speak to an empty House. I assume that as soon as the House resumes after the Easter recess, the Bill will be introduced and dealt with expeditiously, given that it should have been introduced six months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, Costello, Henry, Norris and Coghlan called for a debate on Northern Ireland. I can arrange for such a debate. I will pass on Senator Costello's view to the Minister concerned and I can try to investigate the points he made.</P>
      <P>Senators Ormonde and Chambers called for a debate on FÁS to review its success and its future role. FÁS has made a magnificent contribution to the country. When times were bad FÁS was to the fore and it was able to keep people in employment and to boost the morale of people who could not secure employment. When many men and women lost their jobs, FÁS helped to retrain them and provided a facility for them to learn new skills. Senator Ormonde has requested such a debate on other occasions. I intend to allow as much time as the Seanad requires during the first week it resumes after the Easter recess to discuss the achievements of FÁS and its future role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1722" /> Senator Jackman called for a debate on biotechnology, Senator Farrell called for a debate on school discipline and Senator O'Meara called for a debate on parental leave and I can allow time for debates on those matters.</P>
    <P>Senators McDonagh, Tom Hayes and Finneran called for a debate on school transport. Many speakers said in recent weeks that that the introduction of the school transport system in 1967 contributed a great deal to this country's achievements. Every boy and girl, regardless of how remote the area in which they lived, could avail of that system. It contributed to transforming the country. I can allow time for such a debate. Children in those areas served by the school transport system are fortunate. Parents in other areas, such as the area from where I come in north Westmeath, do not have access to this system and have to provide such a service.</P>
    <P>I note Senator Tom Hayes's remarks about a former Government Chief Whip and one of the longest serving Senators, the former Senator Willie Ryan.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Coogan's point about the Local Government (No. 2) Bill, it is still with the Attorney General's office and when it comes back to Government I hope it will be initiated in this House. I am sure we will be updated on it at a meeting of the General Council of County Councils in Monaghan tonight which the Minister will address. I am sure many Members of this House will be present to hear what he has to say.</P>

      <P>The Minister was clarifying the issue contained in the Government amendment whereby for a first offence the suspension would be for 30 days in order to allow the particular club or body to get its act together.

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (2)<i>(b),</i> between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following new subparagraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)by refusing to permit certain categories of members to vote at general meetings and stand for office in the management committee;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to a similar issue which has arisen in the Irish Ladies' Golf Union. It is similar to other amendments we have tabled to meet the issues raised by the Irish Ladies' Golf Union in the context of the administration of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the concern to ensure that associate, that is women, members of golf clubs can have a greater say in the running <Col N="1723" /><Col N="1724" /> of such clubs, but I cannot accept these amendments. Amendment No. 42 would appear to treat a club as discriminatory if it did not give voting rights to all members of registered clubs, irrespective of the nature or duration of their membership. My understanding is that there are diverse membership categories. The implications of giving voting rights to every type of membership are unclear and it may not be appropriate to give voting rights to some categories of members, for example, temporary members or affiliates. Sections 8, 9 and 10 are not a vehicle for making substantial changes to the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904, the consequences of which are unknown.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 46 would deem certain actions by clubs to be in contravention of the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904. Section 4(a) of the 1904 Act requires that a club, in order to be eligible for registration, must make certain provisions for the management of the club by the committee or governing body and section 4(d) provides for the election of members. It is possible to object in the District Court to the grant or renewal of a certificate of registration on the ground that the club's rules are not in conformity with the 1904 Act. I am not aware that an objection has ever been made on this basis, but it is statutorily provided for. I do not see this provision as being appropriate to the Bill. I cannot, therefore, accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (2)<i>(b),</i> between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iii)refusing or failing to do all that is reasonable to prevent sexual harassment from occurring in the club;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am simply asking that this amendment be inserted in section 8. Section 8 defines a discriminating club in a general way. Subsection (2)<i>(b)</i> gives some of the particulars as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)refusing to admit a person to membership;</P>
      <P>(ii)providing different terms and conditions of membership for members or applicants for membership;</P>
      <P>(iii)terminating the membership of a person or subjecting a member to any other sanction; or</P>
      <P>(iv)refusing or failing, in contravention of <i>section 4(1),</i> to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the needs of a member, or an applicant for membership, with a disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> I seek the insertion of the following new paragraph:</P>
    <P>(iii)refusing or failing to do all that is reasonable to prevent sexual harassment from occurring in the club.</P>
    <P>Sexual harassment is mentioned in the Bill. This is an appropriate point at which to insert this amendment. It is important that at all crucial stages in the Bill the point is made that sexual harassment is a serious discrimination in that advantage is taken of somebody over whom people consider they have authority. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The core objective of the provisions dealing with registered clubs is to address the discrimination practised by such clubs against members or prospective members, most conspicuously on the gender ground. This is a complicated area and I do not intend to increase the difficulty by bringing sexual and other harassment in registered clubs into this Bill.</P>
      <P>Issues around sexual harassment could be problematic in the context of a club, particularly as such sexual harassment could occur, not only between persons in authority and members or prospective members of the club, but also between ordinary club members. It would be a draconian approach were an act of sexual harassment in the club bar to result in the forfeiture of that club's certificate of registration.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the District Court hearing is quite specific, namely, to determine if the club has a rule, practice or policy, which discriminates against a member or an applicant for membership, or that a person involved in the club's management discriminates against a member or an applicant for membership in relation to the club's affairs. With a view to keeping the focus of the District Court hearing on these matters, I am not willing to have the section enlarged in the way put forward by the Senator and I do not, therefore, intend to include provisions on sexual harassment in registered clubs in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of the amendment might render the Bill &ndash; in relation to the provisions dealing with registered clubs &ndash; susceptible to legal challenge. I am conscious that registered clubs are members' clubs and that in addressing inequalities in this sphere, we have to respect this status and ensure that the measures pass constitutional muster. In the light of what I have said, I am unable to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press the issue. It is amazing the Minister should say there is a legal difficulty in inserting this amendment given that the section contains certain rules. All I am seeking is the insertion of the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>(iii)refusing or failing to do all that is reasonable to prevent sexual harassment from occurring in the club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" /> Clubs should be required by law to have that as a condition of their operation or a condition of their membership in the same way as it is right and proper that they should have a rule that they cannot discriminate against persons with a disability. If there are legal difficulties with what I propose, equally there could be legal difficulties in regard to being non-discriminatory towards persons with a disability. People may cite the outcome of the Supreme Court decision in relation to the Employment Equality Act. The Minister of State should think a little more about this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that what we are dealing with here is the abuse by registered clubs of the drink licensing laws in terms of discrimination in the clubs. Issues around sexual harassment could be problematic in the context of a club. While this is a serious issue, this is not the context in which we should deal with it. An entire club could have its licence endorsed or removed because of the activity of two members on the club premises. This section deals with the matters which go before the District Court with regard to a club's licence to sell alcohol and it is not an appropriate place to deal with this question.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(iii)refusing or failing to do all that is reasonable to prevent indirect discrimination from occurring in the club;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is very easy to identify direct discrimination but indirect discrimination can be quite subtle. Because of the subtle way it is sometimes proceeded with it can be difficult to identify such discrimination or to make a case. Nevertheless, the legislation should make it clear that indirect discrimination is just as illegal as direct discrimination.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone some way towards defining direct discrimination in subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this subsection. We have already asked the Minister to be more generous with regard to sexual harassment. I now ask her to be more generous in dealing with this amendment.</P>

I refer to section 4(6) which makes it clear that the concept of reasonable accommodation for the needs of people with a disability will extend to all the areas covered by the Bill, including the register of clubs. Because of the cross reference to section 4(6) in section 3(1)<i>(c)</i>(ii), the concept of indirect discrimination applies also to all these areas.

      <P>The Registration of Clubs Act, 1904 employs the term &ldquo;a club premises&rdquo; and I understand that the actual certificate of registration also uses this term. The term &ldquo;head office&rdquo; is not used in relation to the court application process under the 1904 Act. Given the type of club at which this provision is targeted, I consider that an applicant will have no difficulty in serving the application specified in subsection (5) on the club at its club premises. Moreover, once a case of this type comes before the District Court the alleged discriminating club might attempt to challenge the validity of the proceedings on mere technical grounds by alleging that the copy of the application had been sent to the wrong address. I hesitate to allow scope for any possibility of such procedural irregularity. The section as it stands is clear and I do not propose to accept the Senator's amendment.</P>

      <P>The 1997 Bill contained additional measures directed at discriminating clubs. However, on foot of legal advice the sole measure directed against such discriminating clubs is now the removal of the certificate of registration. This certificate, which is a matter of statute, is peculiar to a registered club and I am advised that it is legitimate to make this conditional on clubs not discriminating. We could be constitutionally vulnerable if other measures <Col N="1730" /> were directed at registered clubs which did not apply to private clubs. I consider the loss of the certificate of registration alone to be an effective measure. Most public reaction to the register of clubs provision in the 1997 Bill focused on the loss of the right to serve drink to members.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Connor's amendment. The Minister has said that public reaction to the 1997 legislation was that the loss of the licence would be sufficient penalty. However, the vast majority of the public would believe that a club in contravention of the law, particularly as it relates to discrimination, should not be in receipt of funds, particularly national lottery funds. A similar amendment has also been tabled and Senator Connor has made a valid point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be scandalous if a club which has been found to be practising discrimination and has lost its drinks licence received national lottery or other public funds and continued to receive those funds while its licence to sell alcoholic liquor was revoked? Sport and recreational clubs throughout the country have received funding from the national lottery, and rightly so. If one of those clubs was found to be seriously in breach of this law and continued to carry on a development funded by the national lottery while under investigation for discrimination, there would be very little public support for the continuance of payment to it.</P>

      <P>What we are trying to achieve is administratively but not legally possible. The question is how to address this issue in an administrative fashion so as to ensure that what Senator Connor is concerned about does not happen. The matter has been looked at with a view to enshrining this principle in law to ensure all clubs are treated equally. The issue of private clubs arises in this respect.</P>
      <P>The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation administers national lottery funded schemes for sports. Applicants are required to submit rules and procedures as evidence of non-discrimination on grounds of sex, religion, ethnic origin etc. It is also a requirement that the facilities and equipment be accessible to people with disabilities. The bulk of national lottery funded expenditure goes to community and voluntary groups, many of which are active in promoting equality and non-discrimination, for example, youth clubs, women's groups, Travellers' groups and groups dealing with child care, the care of the elderly and the disadvantaged. Conditions applying to individual schemes are decided by the Departments administering the particular scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators want us to do all we can to ensure discriminating clubs do not receive grants from the Government. I will ask my officials to draft correspondence to be issued to all Departments on the passage of the Bill drawing to their atten<Col N="1731" /> tion the concerns of Members with regard to the administration of public funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said that this is the legal advice she has received and that we have to accept it. What she is saying, in effect, is that a club can receive national lottery funds on satisfying the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation that it is not a discriminating club by virtue of the fact that it operates an open-door policy. That does not mean however that a year from now refugees or asylum seekers, for example, will not be refused access to the club to avail of its facilities for the purposes of holding meetings or engaging in social and recreational activities. If a case is taken and the club is found by the Director of Equality Investigations to be actively engaged in discrimination there is nothing the Government will be able to do under the Bill to prevent the club from continuing to benefit from national lottery funds. In effect, public funds will continue to be available to a club found to be in contravention of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support everything Senator O'Meara said. I appreciate the Minister of State is trying to come to an administrative arrangement whereby the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation which has responsibility for the Operational Programme for Tourism, under which many facilities have been grant-aided, will have to be satisfied that a club is observing the rules laid down. As Senator O'Meara said, a substantial grant may be sanctioned out of public funds for a club for major construction works before it is found by the Director of Equality Investigations and perhaps the courts to be actively engaging in discrimination in serious contravention of the Bill in the use of its facilities by asylum seekers and refugees. It appears that in such circumstances the Minister of State will be powerless to stop the handover of substantial public funds to the club concerned.</P>
      <P>It should be made clear in whatever administrative arrangement is made that if a club is found to be in contravention of the Bill having been promised or while in receipt of public funds for development those funds will be either withheld or withdrawn until it is seen to put its house in order. That is the bare minimum we can accept.</P>

      <P>With respect, not every element is risky. The Supreme Court judgment is a comfort blanket used in tight corners. This matter has the potential to become a major issue of public concern. The first comment that will be made if a club is found to be discriminating under the Bill is, &ldquo;They are getting public funds and nobody is doing anything about it.&rdquo;  It will be up to the person being discriminated against to alert the Minister of State. This may sound over-the-top but many people would not know how to go about doing this. Will it be part of the role of the Director of Equality Investigations to inform the appropriate Departments that a club has been found to be discriminating and that it is his or her recommendation that public funds should no longer be available to it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, which has been included on the advice of the Attorney General, is intended to protect rights of freedom of association. The Attorney General has advised that the existing exemption at section 9(1)(<i>a</i>) does not sufficiently protect such rights. For example, the Freemasons is not a religious body and, therefore, cannot avail of the exemption at section 9(1)(<i>a</i>). It is a body which was set up to encourage interpersonal bonds of a fraternal nature and is thus <i>par excellence</i> a body of individuals who are exercising their constitutional right of freedom of association. Our advice is that it would be extremely difficult to justify in law a refusal to renew the Freemasons' certificate of registration which is based, not on any drink related ground, but on a refusal to admit women. The same logic extends to many other groups &ndash; lesbian and gay organisations, the ICA, Traveller groups &ndash; which might well wish to exclude members of a particular category. There is no rational basis on which to suggest that such groups do not enjoy the same right as others to drink together in the privacy of their own club.</P>
      <P>The amendment extends the exemption to protect clubs whose principal purpose is to cater only for a person of a particular gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief or no belief, age, disability, nationality or ethnic or national origin or members of the Traveller community. It does not include race or colour based clubs. Thus a club catering for the needs of widows, Travellers, Freemasons, Italians, etc. will not risk forfeiture of its certificate of registration if it refuses to admit other persons.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(f2&gt;c)it has different types of membership, access to which is not based on any discriminatory ground,</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;d)for the purpose of reducing or eliminating the effect of any rule or practice of the club (whether adopted before or after the commencement of this section) restricting access to particular types of membership to persons of a particular gender it offers concessionary rates, fees or membership arrangements to persons who were or are disadvantaged by any such rule or practice,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is being introduced in response to various concerns expressed by women golfers that the Equal Status Bill, although intended to promote greater equality, might not achieve this aim or could even be disadvantageous to women. The new paragraph (<i>c</i>) will make it clear that a club can continue to have more than one category of membership, provided that access to such categories is not determined on the basis of a discriminatory ground. It will thus be permissible, for example, for a club to continue to have full members and associate members, as long as men and women can access both categories without discrimination. This was implicit in the Bill before the present amendment but there had been some misconceptions that the Bill would require the abolition of the associate membership category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also included a new paragraph (<i>d</i>), which extends the concept of positive action to include concessionary arrangements introduced by a club to mitigate the effects of past gender based discrimination. Thus, for example, a club will not be regarded as discriminatory if it makes concessionary arrangements for former associate <Col N="1735" /> members who were excluded from full membership because of their gender. I would emphasise that the new text permits concessionary arrangements but imposes no obligation on clubs to make such arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am aware that women golfers would like us to go further. They have made known to us that they consider it unjust that they could be charged a full levy for joining as full members despite their long association with the club. Careful consideration has been given to formulating an amendment to meet those concerns, but we are advised that it would not be appropriate to go further than we have in addressing the position of women in golf clubs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a view we are straining the concept of discrimination in this matter and to do so would be unwise, particularly given that men would have cause for complaint in that women were clearly being singled out for preferential treatment in the legislation without account being taken of the fact that, for better or worse, they had the benefit of cheaper subscriptions over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main issue regarding membership is that full and associate memberships should be available equally to men and women. As long as that is done from a certain date, I do not think it reasonable that women should be of the opinion <Col N="1736" /> that because they have been members for 20 years they should be treated differently from men, who have also been members for 20 years. From a certain date after the passing of the legislation, everybody should be treated equally. Many men might prefer the cheaper associate membership and many women might prefer the dearer full membership. As long as men and women are entitled to access to both full and associate memberships and pay accordingly, there will not be discrimination.</P>
    <P>The principle ensures clubs will not attempt to suggest the legislation will abolish associate membership because it does not. The legislation provides that there is nothing wrong with associate and full memberships as long as they are available to men and women. The issue is not about the category of membership but access to it by both genders.</P>

    <P>In page 19, subsection (1), lines 31 to 33, to <Col N="1738" /> delete paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) and substitute the following new paragraphs:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>)are purchased or leased by an operator of a passenger road service or passenger rail service and are to be used for the purposes of either such service, or</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)are purchased or leased for use as a taxi or hackney.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to insert into this Bill an obligation on all public service vehicles, such as taxis and hackneys, to provide a service in the same way as public transport is expected to provide one. It is a disgrace that there is no obligation to provide a service for people with a disability here, particularly regarding access to trains and buses. I have no doubt the Minister of State will say there is a Government amendment which deals with this matter.</P>
    <P>A public service licence is issued for taxis, hackneys and public service vehicles. This legislation should ensure that these forms of transport are made accessible to people with a disability. It is as simple as that. The arguments for this have been made many times and I will not rehash them. I hope the Minister of State will accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment since the existing regulatory framework in regard to taxis already permits accessibility issues for people with disabilities, as well as quality and service issues, to be addressed. These functions are vested in the relevant local authority which issues the taxi or hackney licence and the matter comes under the broad remit of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>Informing me that local authorities issue these licences and that this matter comes under the broad remit of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is hardly an acceptable answer. That Department and local authorities should be as amenable to this legislation as anyone else.</P>
      <P>With regard to the debate about access for people with disabilities to public buildings and transport, taxis and hackneys are part of our public transport system. Since they are licensed as public service vehicles they should, as far as is practicable, be friendly to people with disabilities and allow them access.</P>

      <P>In page 21, subsection (2), line 4, after &ldquo;complainant&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or some other person (including the Authority) on his or her behalf&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to a person making a complaint to the director. It appears that only the person involved can make a complaint of an alleged discriminatory act committed against them. I want to broaden that to include &ldquo;some other person (including the Authority) on his or her behalf&rdquo;. It should not be controversial or difficult to add that line. If a refugee with a poor knowledge of the language, for example, needs a friend or interested party, not necessarily a professional representative, to make a case on their behalf, their submission to the director should be valid.</P>

      <P>The authority has the function of assisting complainants by providing forms, advice, etc. The authority would facilitate persons with disabilities, language or literacy problems or otherwise requiring special help in notifying the respondent.

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 21(2) makes it clear that the complainant, the person at the heart of the alleged prohibited conduct, must issue the notification to the respondent. It would not be appropriate for a third party to take on this core task. If I am a wheelchair user and I am refused access to the local pub, it is better if I make the complaint than someone else making it for me. We cannot allow people to make complaints on behalf of others. The person who has been discriminated against must be at the centre of the complaint. There is also the issue that a person may not be in a position to make a complaint because of a disability.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to extend the time limit. Section 21(1) states that a &ldquo;person who claims that prohibited conduct has been directed against him or her may, subject to this section, seek redress by referring the case to the Director&rdquo;.

      <P>This entire section was substantially modified on Report Stage in the other House to meet the concerns expressed by Opposition Deputies and to introduce greater flexibility into the process. A two month timeframe appeared in the 1997 Bill and it strikes the appropriate balance between the interests of the complainant and those of the service provider. The difficulty arises if, for example, a person tells a publican the problem occurred on 15 November last year. The respondent must have time to remember the event and to be able to respond. We must strike a balance between the rights of the person making the complaint and the respondent. Section 21(3) deals with exceptional circumstances. It states that &ldquo;for the reference to 2 months there were substituted a reference to such period not exceeding 4 months as is specified in the direction&rdquo;.</P>

Section 25(1) states that &ldquo;. . . .the Director shall investigate the case and hear all persons appearing to the Director to be interested and desiring to be heard&rdquo;.

There will be no problem with the continuance, on an administrative basis, of such arrangements.

      <P>In page 25, subsection (1), lines 24 and 25, to delete paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and <i>(b</i>).</P>
      <P>This relates to appeals against decisions of the director, the form and contents of a decision by the director in relation to an appeal. Section 29(1) states:</P>
      <P>(1)Every decision of the Director under this Part shall be in writing [in other words, the director puts his decision in writing] and&ndash;</P>

      <P>We believe the decision of the director should not have these qualifications, that is, &ldquo;if the Director thinks fit&rdquo; or &ldquo;if any of the parties so request&rdquo;. We believe each decision should at all times include a statement giving the reasons the director reached the decision. To give it transparency and openness, the director should be in a position to give the reasons for any decision he makes. In that way, people will have confidence in the decision making process and it will be transparent.</P>

      <P>This brings us back to the critical test which has to be applied in this legis<Col N="1744" /> lation &ndash; all the different grounds. Senator Connor's point sounds reasonable but I would say to him that there is no motivation or secrecy underlining the provision. It merely enables the director exercise discretion where it is called for. The effect of the amendment would be to remove the flexibility aspect in a sexual harassment case, for example. It might be considered appropriate or parties to the case may prefer not to include information in the final decision or determination.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the provision ensures that the parties can obtain a reasoned decision from the director if they so wish, but they may not want the detail. There is no motivation or secrecy in this provision. It is simply to allow that flexibility depending on the type of case before the director. The wording in this section is identical to that in the Employment Equality Act.</P>

      <P>In page 25, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)The Director shall give notice of a decision in a format accessible to a complainant with a disability, and shall in general adopt such procedures as will facilitate the participation of persons with disabilities including receiving submissions made through sign language or other formats.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 74 is self-explanatory in that it requires the director to give notice of a decision in a format accessible to a complainant with a disability. As this legislation is directed towards achieving a balance of rights and ensuring we facilitate disabled people as far as possible, this amendment is very sensible and is one I hope the Minister will accept.</P>

      <P>Similar amendments were tabled during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil. We examined the matter in consultation with the Director of Equality Investigations. Following that, we do not consider it wise to set out in primary legislation the type or form of procedure mentioned in the amendment. The informal procedures which have been developed over the years by equality officers operating under the umbrella of the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission and which take due account of case law and the rules of natural justice have proved to be effective. The director will build on these administrative procedures taking account of the new grounds of discrimination in drawing up operating procedures for the new office. There has been an examination of the accessibility issues raised not only in relation to people with disabilities but with language problems or otherwise requiring help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1745" /> In addition, section 25(3) provides for the possibility of making regulations governing the procedures of the director's office if, in time, it is shown that the less formal operating procedures are less than effective.

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 41 and 42, to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>)on any such grounds, an organisation consisting wholly or mainly of persons in respect of which the grounds apply or having as its object the furtherance of the interests of such persons is treated less favourably than an organisation consisting wholly or mainly of persons in respect of whom the grounds do not apply, is treated, has been treated or would be treated,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage and my concern grew during the discussion. Initially I stated that this section was included in the 1997 legislation. The Minister of State claimed that having engendered a degree of exceptional caution in the Department regarding this legislation, the Supreme Court judgment has had the effect of convincing the Department that this section should be deleted.</P>
      <P>However, the effect of such a measure would be to water down the Bill because it would mean that a group could not take an action as a group <i>per se</i>. We explored this issue in the context of, for example, the Traveller community being prevented from renting an hotel room for a meeting. I asked if the group could take a complaint to the Director of Equality Investigations but the Minister of State said that the secretary of the group who had tried to make the booking could do so on an individual basis, or that each member of the group could take an individual action. This seems farcical and wrong and is against the spirit of the legislation.</P>
      <P>This Bill arises from the need for and the desire of the Oireachtas to correct injustices. Using the example of Travellers, the need for the legislation has arisen out of discrimination suffered by that group and others and many such instances have been discussed during debate on the Bill. In many cases people suffer discrimination by virtue of being a member of the group which is being discriminated against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this legislation was first mooted two other groups have emerged as suffering discrimi<Col N="1748" /> nation, namely refugees and asylum seekers. It is important that the Bill encompasses all eventualities as far as is possible and that it reflects the Oireachtas's intention and the spirit of the principles and policy underlying such legislation which received the support of all political parties in both Houses since it was first published in the early 1990s.</P>
    <P>This amendment is critical to the spirit of the legislation. The Bill will be undermined if a member of a group being discriminated against can take an action only as an individual and not as a member of a group, or if a group <i>per se</i> cannot take an action. I am not satisfied with the assurances given to me and that is why I am proposing this amendment. The Minister of State should see beyond the fog of caution which has descended on the Department arising from the Supreme Court judgment. She should put aside the fear the judgment has engendered in the Department, recognise the need for this amendment and accept that its rejection will water down the Bill and reduce its effectiveness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this amendment. There is little I can add. If, for example, a group of Travellers are refused service in a licensed premises, it is the group which is being refused and not an individual member. Romany people operate in the same kind of nomadic groups one finds among the Traveller community and the discrimination is often against the group. We are seeking to add clarity to the legislation. We pressed this issue on Committee Stage and we do so again on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Meara expressed concern that a case could only be taken by an individual member of a group. However, the provisions are broader in that every member of the group can take a case at the same time. If there are 100 people in a group, 100 cases can be submitted and 100 people can receive compensation, if appropriate. I gave an example involving a residents' association taking a case to the District Court in which the chairman is the named individual taking the case. However, because legal fees are involved it is not open to other members of the group to take the cases so they operate in the chairman's name. This is different because we are not dealing with legal fees. There is no difficulty with 100 cases being submitted for the 100 members of the group. The 100 people will receive compensation if it is appropriate. Mary Smith does not have to be singled out as the person who has to fly the flag for the entire group. They can all fly the flag as individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister is not taking my point on board. Often in such a <Col N="1749" /> case a committee member is named to limit the potential liability of the group. I am trying to make the point that the right of a group to take an action should be enshrined in law. The Minister is right in that in practice 100 individual claims could be made, but the law should enshrine the principle that the group should be able to take an action. This Bill does not allow for that and is the less for it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated her anxiety to get this legislation onto the Statute Book but I reiterate what Senator Cregan has said, that it is important to table amendments and to examine legislation, particularly legislation which is so important, to ensure it meets the spirit of the intentions behind it. I acknowledge the hard work of the Minister and her officials in putting this and its twin sister, the Employment Equality Act, through the Oireachtas. I look forward to seeing the Bill implemented and the changes it will bring about. I look forward to its powers being used by the Director of Equality Investigations.

Behind me sit the hard working staff, one of whom has worked on this Bill for seven years. After such a long time working on it, we hope she can move on to more wonderful things. I thank all of the staff who have worked on this legislation over the years. It will now return to the Dáil so the amendments can be finalised and, hopefully, it will be passed before Easter.</P>
