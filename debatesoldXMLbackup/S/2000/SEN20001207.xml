      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to find accommodation for asylum seekers which does not deprive the children of Ireland of the Community Games and the working people of Dublin and the north east of their main holiday centre.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for the discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, motion re referral to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affair of the terms of the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Report and Final Stages; and No. 3, the National Treasury Management Agency Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes and on which Senators may share time. No. 3 will not be taken before 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable to me. Will the Leader share with the rest of the House his plans for the remainder of this session, that is, the days on which we are to sit, the business he proposes to take in the remaining days and when he proposes to rise for the Christmas recess? He caused a certain degree of confusion yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express sympathy to the family of the young man shot yesterday in foul sectarian circumstances in Northern Ireland and to the victims of the ongoing troubles there. It is a very sober reminder to us that the problems in the North are not yet resolved. There are very dangerous undercurrents and forces at work which are out to destroy the Agreement. With the impending visit of President Clinton, it is imperative that efforts among the elected politicians of Northern Ireland and between the two Governments are greatly intensified. It would be a great achievement if, by the time President Clinton arrives, real progress was made on the outstanding issues and it would be the wish of this House that that message be sent to all involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable to us. We also express our concern about the developments in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>We had a very useful debate on BSE yesterday. I realise the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, was unable to be back in time to be here. However, in view of the very serious allegation made by the EU Commissioner for Agriculture that BSE could be spread through the excrement of animals in ground water, will the Minister come into the House as soon as possible to refute this allegation or let us know what scientific evidence there is? It will be another blow to the beef industry if perhaps unfounded allegations are brought before the public. This allegation was in our national newspapers yesterday and there was a long report on it in <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to the Order of Business. When No. 1, the motion on the UN International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination comes back to the House, it would be particularly appropriate for us to discuss it, given the calls made yesterday and on many occasions for a debate on immigration policy, racial discrimination and so on. This motion has to come back from the committee by 15 December and this would be an appropriate forum in which to have a debate on it.</P>
      <P>I call for a debate on homelessness. Fr. Peter McVerry said again today that 1,250 children are homeless in Dublin and are living in hostels and bed and breakfasts and that up to 100 sleep rough every night, coming up to Christmas and in foul weather. It would appear little is being done about it because the number is increasing dramatically every year. In circumstances in which we are talking about a booming economy and a generous budget for large sections of the community, something positive needs to be done in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I take up the point raised by the last speaker. In the lead up to Christmas, it is only right that this House should spare a <Col N="1383" /> thought for the homeless. I am also thinking of the homeless in Britain. Given that over one-third of the homeless in London are Irish we should not forget them. In view of the affluence being enjoyed here perhaps the Leader might on some occasion in the new year broaden out the whole question of the Irish community abroad. From my experience in Britain and in North America the wheel has come full turn and they are now looking to Ireland for help. Perhaps we can establish some forum to build bridges with the Irish community abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a series of Ministers in this House who are not equipped to deal with the legislation they have been bringing through. I ask the Leader for an assurance, particularly in relation to No. 3, that in future we will have Ministers or Ministers of State from the Department where the legislation was initiated. Last week we had the ICC Bill and the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill which were taken through by Ministers who are competent in their own fields but who were not attached to the relevant Department. That is insulting to this House. If complicated and important Bills are brought through by Ministers who are not familiar with the legislation it means no amendments will be accepted because they have no authority. Perhaps the Leader can give an assurance that in future we will have Ministers from the relevant Departments and specifically in regard to No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask permission to remove No. 14 from the Order Paper. We shall resubmit this Bill, whose presence on the Order Paper prohibits us from having any other Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>Provision for the education of children with autism has caused some controversy and dissension within the concerned groups. Perhaps the Minister for Education and Science would come to the House for a debate on that issue.</P>

      <P>Senator Jackman will have to move an amendment that No. 14 be included in the Order of Business so that it can then be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That No. 14 be included in the Order of Business.&rdquo; As the seconder of that Bill, Senator Coogan supports the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue of child care early in the next session. Given the money put into both the supply and demand side in the budget, it is important to assist the Minister in identifying implementation initiatives and ways of encouraging people to get involved in the provision of child care and also in <Col N="1384" /> the additional training and development of staff in that whole area.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader also to look in the new year at recruitment agencies. The relevant legislation has been on the Statute Book since early 1970 and I understand the Minister is initiating a review. It is important to look at that area and to make recommendations to the Minister at an early stage of the review. In the context of the labour shortages it is important to attract people to these shores and also to encourage some of the long-term unemployed to return to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning asked for details of what is to be taken between now and Christmas. I would like the Taoiseach or Ministers representing him to report back on what happens today and tomorrow at the EU summit in Nice where important matters are being discussed. On occasion we have only heard about such matters from the newspapers. It is important to have such a report. Last year we discussed the whole question of whether our neutrality was under threat and, if so, what we should do about the European Rapid Reaction Force. Tax harmonisation will also be discussed at the EU summit. Listening to the debates yesterday, we realise how important an element that is for this country. Qualified majority voting will also be discussed and whether there will be a commissioner for each state in the future. It is important the reports on these items are brought back promptly by either the Taoiseach or somebody representing him at senior ministerial level, taking into account what Senator Ross said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.</P>
      <P>Local authority members have been circulated with a letter from the General Council of County Councils, the representative body of local authorities, with regard to policy issues. Concern has been expressed in that letter regarding the Local Government Bill which has been published but has not been moved by the Government. That concern was expressed in letter form and by members of the General Council. With a view to helping the Leader and the Government, if they wish to bring the Bill into this House we will facilitate them in every way possible to ensure the commitments and promises made to councillors during the past year will be fulfilled as soon as possible. In the event that the Government does not wish to bring it into the House and does not want to deal with it, it is my intention to bring forward a local government Bill that will take into account the issues of concern to local authority members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan in relation to this matter. It appears from a circular which the General Council of County Councils has sent to county councillors that&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to be repetitive. It seems from the circular that it is blaming some Oireachtas Members for holding up the legislation. I support Senator Coogan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views of Senator Costello in regard to the homeless. While I accept the budget was heavy on spin and PR, many more practical measures are needed. I support the views of Fr. McVerry.</P>
      <P>I support also the views of my colleague, Senator Coogan, in regard to the local government Bill. If it would facilitate matters perhaps it could be taken in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning asked about the business for the remainder of the term. I will come back to the leaders later in the afternoon. President Clinton's visit takes place next Tuesday. Certain Members may have to be made available for this important visit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the end of session, I noticed a change of expression by various Senators regarding debates for which they had been calling recently. I will review the question of the days on which the Seanad will sit in light of the call on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader will tell the rest of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consult with the leaders. I agree with Senator Manning that all political leaders in Northern Ireland should make a very special effort in relation to whatever business has to be agreed before President Clinton's visit takes place. Everyone in Ireland, North and South, acknowledges the very important contribution made by President Clinton during his eight years in office. He has been a guiding light and I hope his successor will continue the good work he has done.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry referred to the BSE debate and I undertake to convey her views to the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is worth recording our congratulations to RTE on its magnificent coverage, on both television and radio, of the debate in the Seanad. Although it was budget day in the Dáil, it gave a full and comprehensive coverage of the BSE debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to No. 1 and I have no difficulty bringing it back to the House for discussion. Senators Costello and Ó Murchú called for a debate on homelessness, particularly as it is nearing Christmas, a family time. They also asked for a debate on the Irish abroad, whether they <Col N="1386" /> are in the US, Australia or the UK. I will leave time for such a debate.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform Senator Ross that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, will be present for the Bill later today. I heard what the Senator said. Yesterday evening, when Members discussed the budget the Minister for Finance had to be in the Dáil. It is impossible for him to be in two places at one time. I will do everything I can to ensure that the appropriate Ministers are present when we debate matters appropriate to their portfolios.</P>
    <P>I will allow time for the debate Senator Jackman called for and the Minister for Education and Science will be in the House. I agree to her proposed amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox called for a debate on child care. We had a wonderful budget and I am very surprised that it has not been mentioned on the Order of Business. I would have thought that people would be consistent and that when things are of a positive nature the Opposition would welcome them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Leader is deliberately provoking Members to break the guidelines laid down by the Cathaoirleach. He has said on numerous occasions that the Order of Business is not the place to discuss substantive issues or policy. The Leader is now provoking and inciting Members to breach the Cathaoirleach's ruling. It is a deplorable example on his part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am responding to Senator Cox's call for a debate on child care. I welcome the extension of maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks. I also welcome the budget increase in child benefit of £25 per month for the first and second child and the £30 per month for each subsequent child.</P>
      <P>Consistency is the reason the people in Ireland have been successful. I would like to remain consistent and give credit where credit is due. I am surprised no one welcomed the budget. Many commentators did so.</P>

Perhaps we could schedule this to take place the week before Christmas and, if time allows, have the Taoiseach present to make a full and comprehensive statement to the House.</P>
      <P>Senators Coogan and Burke inquired about the local government Bill. I can assure the House that it is my intention, as I am sure it is the intention of all Members and leaders, that this Bill should get safe passage through the House for a period of about two weeks. I give an assurance to the House, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, that this Bill will pass through this House in 14 days.</P>

There is no political agenda on this side of the House and we are the ones who are bringing it before Government and it will make a decision on it. This legislation is long overdue. It is about time that local authority members who have worked on a voluntary basis for many years were recognised for the wonderful work that they are doing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 18, line 42, after &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;such information shall also be published by electronic means and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to the House. I thank her for adjusting her schedule to take Report Stage this week rather than, as was planned originally, to take Committee and remaining Stages on the one day. This legislation is a reminder of the need to take our time.</P>
      <P>A number of amendments were tabled but none was accepted. I was afraid that the message might have gone out that the Minister did not plan to listen and improve the Bill. The fact that she waited until today to take Report Stage is evidence that she is willing to listen to us and to improve the Bill.</P>
      <P>I resubmitted most of the amendments I tabled on Committee Stage. I did that not because I hope they will be accepted by the Minister but to give us an opportunity to discuss the quite important principles involved. It is for reasons of principle and expediency that I believe these amendments should be accepted. I hope the Minister will consider and accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> Let me begin by addressing the reasons suggested by my colleague, Senator Norris, last week. He suggested that the rejection of the amendments could be put down to a reluctance on the part of the Minister to go to the bother of returning to the Dáil to have my amendments passed there, especially in the run up to Christmas. Last week he bet his last polo mint that no amendments would be accepted. That is why I hope he will not come here today. I want to win his polo mint even if it is his last one. He got to enjoy his polo mint last week.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to accept Senator Norris's reasoning. I do not mind that I do not or cannot believe it. The truth is I do not want to believe that the Minister is not going to listen and take amendments, even if she agrees with them, just because we are coming up to Christmas and she does not want to go back to the Dáil. This is important legislation which has been in the works for many years. It has been in these Houses for well over 12 months. I cannot believe that Minister would rush it at the last fence. I prefer to believe, in my innocence, that she has come here with an open mind about the possibilities of accepting amendments and improving this Bill through Senators' scrutiny of it. We have had some very good debates on this legislation over the past couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in good faith or, at least, with a suspension of disbelief &ndash; which is slightly different &ndash; let us take the Minister's arguments for rejecting these amendments at face value and address them on their merits. We run into a difficulty straight away because the most superficial glance at the case put forward by the Minister shows she has made an elementary error in constructing her Bill. That mistake is to read the sections I wish to amend as enabling clauses, which were the Minister's words last week, which empower the Minister to do something.</P>
    <P>They are not enabling clauses. Instead, they are restrictive clauses. There is a huge difference. Without exception, they seek to put a boundary on the powers of the Minister and future Ministers to do what he or she likes, by specifying the occasions and manner in which certain information must be put into the public domain before the Minister can perform certain actions under this Bill. There is a big difference.</P>
    <P>I drew attention on Committee Stage to the long-standing tradition in these Houses of bounding the powers of the Minister and future Ministers. I know the Minister intends this legislation to last a long time, so when I refer to &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;, I am also referring to future Ministers. It seems unfair to infer the present Minister will always be in office, although I am sure she will be there for a long time.</P>
    <P>I drew attention to the long-standing tradition of bounding the powers of future Ministers in this way. The ability of the Legislature to put a fence around the way future Ministers can behave is one of the fundamentals of our democracy. That <Col N="1390" /> recognises the great truth that knowledge is power, and that by enforcing the dissemination of knowledge to the public, we put a constraint on the power of the Executive.</P>
    <P>A set of publication tools has been developed over the years, each for use in appropriate cases. This has occurred over hundreds of years, if one takes other parliaments into account. The annual report and accounts that I talked about last week is used as the main public control mechanism over semi-State bodies, which have to publish an account, even if they do not want to. In recent years, they have had to publish that account within a certain number of months because some of us have insisted on that. There are also public registers of information, which are required to be kept up to date and open permanently to any member of the public. We also talked about that last week. They are usually only open during office hours, but that is the way things happened from the 1920s until now. There is also publication through advertisements or public notice, which is particularly appropriate when it is necessary to draw the attention of the public to an action the Minister is proposing to take.</P>
    <P>Those three mechanisms restrict the power of the Executive and the Minister. They say the Minister cannot do something unless he or she fulfils that requirement. In all these cases, the intent and effect of the legislation is to restrict the future Minister's actions.</P>
    <P>It is a fundamental misreading of those clauses to interpret them as empowering the Minister or whoever is involved. A requirement to publish an annual report does not empower a semi-State body to publish a report, rather, it disempowers that body from not publishing a report. I hope that huge difference is understood. I want the Minister to understand my concern at what I regard as her misunderstanding last week.</P>
    <P>A requirement to keep a public register of certain information does not empower a Minister or other body to keep such a register, it disempowers those people from not doing so. A requirement to advertise certain information does not empower a Minister or other body to indulge in such advertising, it disempowers them from not doing so.</P>
    <P>Such measures and restrictions serve to strengthen the rights of citizens. They are not there to widen the powers of the Minister or a semi-State body. That is why reviewing these restrictions and keeping them up to date is an important part of the task of the Houses of Parliament and of the role of the Legislature in preserving the very nature of democratic government. I know I am spending a long time on this, but we are taking a group of amendments together and I can only speak once on them.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation to consider the possibilities opened up by new technology. As many Senators noted last week, these possibilities are very extensive. The worldwide web did not exist until about 1990. Although it was not invented to further the workings of democracy, it is poten<Col N="1391" /> tially a most worthwhile tool in achieving that task. The tools of publication that have been developed by our legislative tradition have not been perfect in achieving their effect. However, they were rightly employed as the best that were available at that time. When a new tool appears on the horizon that has the potential to bring the world of democratic publication a giant step closer to the ideal we are all seeking, we have an obligation to look at it, try it out and, if it works, embrace it.</P>
    <P>We will never be inclined to do that if we misunderstand the whole process and see publication clauses as giving enabling powers to the Minister, which is a fundamental difference. That, I regret to say, seems to be the thrust of the advice given to the Minister in her response to the amendments I tabled on Committee Stage. This was summed up by the Minister's statement:</P>
    <P>There is no need for a specific provision of the type proposed by Senators Quinn and Henry in the Bill. The requirements already included in the relevant sections of the Bill normally to publish such information in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and-or at least one local newspaper represent only the minimum such requirement on the Minister under the Bill.</P>
    <P>In other words, there is nothing to stop the Minister taking additional measures to publish the information if she thinks fit. Of course there is not, but the point of my amendments is to require him or her to take the particular additional measures, whether or not he or she thinks fit. There is a fundamental difference in thinking between the advice the Minister has been given, the words she used last week and what I propose.</P>
    <P>The point of my amendments is exactly the same as the point of the underlying section. They seek to restrict what the Minister might see fit to do or not do. That is fundamental. They seek to restrict future Ministers in the interests of achieving a very worthwhile end &ndash; the best possible kind of publication, from the democratic point of view.</P>
    <P>I will cite the Minister further to illustrate how deeply entrenched is her mistaken view of the point of this part of the legislation. She said:</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill to preclude the Minister from disseminating such information in other ways also, including by electronic means, where it is considered necessary to do so. If I believe the information is not circulating satisfactorily to the people concerned, the use of electronic means to improve the situation will be considered. I do not wish, however, to have too many stipulations in the legislation as to how such information should be published.</P>
    <P>That last sentence lets the cat out of the bag. While we should applaud the Minister's honesty in admitting it, she is saying she does not want her power to be further circumscribed. This is the fundamental issue. We are concerned with <Col N="1392" /> restricting the powers of the Minister to do what he or she likes in the future. The legislation requires her to do only a certain minimum by way of publication. It leaves it to the whim of the Minister and her successors to decide on the most appropriate means of achieving desirable democratic ends. I want to restrict that.</P>
    <P>This is a practical issue. Belief in the future of the information society and of Ireland's role within it is patchy in the Government. To give him credit, the Taoiseach is among those who are converted. This was reflected in the award given to him on 9 October as the cyber champion of the year. In accepting the reward he renewed the Government's commitment to doing its business on-line. He said:</P>
    <P>The Government itself is also working to use the power of the new technologies to do its job better by getting public services on line. Key steps we have taken include the Revenue on-line service, which provides an increasing array of on-line services and which went live on 29th September, and the FÁS on-line jobs service. Only a few weeks ago we launched the new REACH agency to work with the Government to find the best way to deliver their services electronically. We have also initiated the Cabinet Project which will bring the benefits of modern technologies right to the highest level at decision making in the Government &ndash; the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>This is realistic and forward looking. It is fully in line with the economic goal of making Ireland the e-commerce hub of Europe. Some Ministers share that openness towards the future and are working towards achieving it. For example, the Minister for Public Enterprise took a major step forward with the early passing into law of the Electronic Commerce Bill, which I am pleased to say she initiated in this House. Other Ministers who have recently introduced legislation to the House were very open to amendments of this kind.</P>
    <P>However, belief in the information age is patchy across the Government. All reports of recent years make discreet reference to the problem, but certain Ministers and higher civil servants do not want to know. There is an excellent way of separating the sheep from the goats by looking at the websites of the different Departments. I do not want to add to the discomfort of the Minister, who every time she answers questions in the Dáil must squirm with embarrassment at the criticism of her Department's website.</P>
    <P>There are some excellent Government websites, some are average and some are dreadful. Senator Norris would be safe in betting his last polo mint, as he did last week, on which of these categories the Minster's website falls into. The state of a Department or company website is a good indicator of where it stands in relation to the future. For some the information society is the present. They are exploiting it with a view to staying ahead. For others it is a nebulous concept <Col N="1393" /> to be adjusted to when it becomes more prevalent. Their websites are usually under construction, or, to use the jargon, &ldquo;in re-design&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On a positive note let me tell a story against myself. At the beginning of 1987 a proposal was made to my company to buy a fax machine at a time when they were just entering the market. My board of management considered the question and decided not to buy one. I remember thinking at the time that the decision not to buy fitted in well with my personal ambition to cut down on the amount of paper we were using in running our business. My approach was to engage in talk rather than in sending memos. Within a few months we realised we had made a mistake because we were in a world &ndash; 12 or 13 years ago &ndash; that did its business by fax.</P>
    <P>I offer that story to the Minister by way of gently encouraging her. No matter how ingrained in the past her officials and perhaps she may be, there is always hope of change in the future. I hope the next time she introduces legislation to this House it will be fit for the 21st century and does not seek to live in the past. However, I do not want to wait until then. We have an opportunity to proceed with this Bill and, therefore, I urge the Minister to accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in seconding the amendment. When Senator Quinn and I tabled these amendments I was sure they would be accepted. I could not see any reason why they would not be because similar amendments to other Bills have been accepted. I cannot believe that the Minister cannot accept them simply because she does not want to return the Bill to the Dáil before Christmas. That could be done in ten minutes.</P>
      <P>From the outset of its term of office the Government has talked about openness and transparency. These amendments are an encouragement of that philosophy. The Minister rightly said that future Ministers are not precluded from publishing on the Internet via electronic means. These amendments require them to do so.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Quinn and other Senators I believe that giving information to people at every opportunity improves rather than disimproves our democracy. I cannot understand why the legislation does not provide that the most modern methods of imparting information be availed of. With due respect, who reads <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>? It is not something with which the public is familiar. The people we need to make sure have information are those who can have access to it on the Internet anywhere.</P>
      <P>It will not take ten minutes of the Minister's time to return the Bill to the Dáil with these amendments, where I am sure they would be accepted. I ask her to accept them. They are realistic and forward looking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Quinn I acknowledge the Minister's ready availability and accessibility in ensuring the effective and <Col N="1394" /> expeditious processing of this Bill. The Minister's availability has been a hallmark of her term of office, as many in this House have acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn's amendments are narrowly focused, which is a tribute to the Minister because it shows she has got the main thrust of the Bill correct. That was acknowledged by all sides of the House during the initial debate on the Bill. The same amendments are now being tabled again.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge Senator Quinn's expertise in these matters and the foresight he has demonstrated on many occasions. However, we must focus on the people of rural Ireland who are at the front line in terms of wildlife. I am a product of rural Ireland as I come from the town of Cashel which can boast of a population of only 3,000 people. Will the method of advertising get to the people to whom it matters? I have no doubt it will. If I was asked what was the main medium for the people of rural Ireland, I would say the local newspaper. A person may miss a copy of a daily newspaper or the nine o'clock news on television, but if he or she does not get the local newspaper, he or she will miss out on something.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a masterful exercise in motivation. The people at whom the Bill is directed will be quick to accept what is proposed. We discussed the last day why motivation is necessary in this Bill. I spoke on this matter because I felt that if the Minister had approached the legislation in a more doctrinaire and punitive manner, we would have failed in the Bill's aim to achieve partnership in terms of our wildlife while, at the same time, looking after and harmonising our national aspirations with our international obligations. It is important to motivate people at local level. One must put down a marker and that is where the legislation comes in. It has been drafted in a balanced and fair way.</P>
      <P>I am a little surprised Senator Quinn is so determined, given his contributions in the House in the past. When he started his address today he was cautious and reserved. However, that changed gradually as his contribution continued. I am sure it could be attributed to passion, which I admire in people. When he focused on the Minister in the early part of his address he was not prepared to make a statement about her reason for not accepting his amendments. He raised questions, but as he continued he spoke about the Minister squirming with embarrassment. He knows that is not correct. Anyone who knows the Minister as I do knows her mettle. She does not easily squirm with embarrassment.</P>

      <P>I was surprised the tone of his address tended to change, but I am sure it could be attributed to passion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does Senator Quinn believe the method proposed in the legislation will achieve what it is intended to achieve or is he making a case for <Col N="1395" /> information technology? That might be what he is doing. He made the same learned and informed contribution on many other Bills and he spoke about electronic advantages. However, it is more important to focus on this Bill. I have no doubt we could have a broader debate on this issue. Does the Senator believe the Bill as it stands will achieve its purpose? I have no doubt it will.</P>
    <P>It is democracy in action to table these amendments again. However, I am sure the Senator will acknowledge they have a narrow focus for such an important Bill. We have waited a long time for this Bill. I am sure Senator Quinn agrees that the Minister was one of the foremost speakers when she was in opposition on the necessity for this Bill. It is not a case of inheriting it in her portfolio. She feels passionately about this Bill and I am sure the Senator will acknowledge that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have done so already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>That is important. Perhaps we could have a broader debate on this issue in the near future.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that this Bill be enacted as quickly as possible so we can deal with the dangers confronting wildlife. We might get tied up in semantics, although I am not saying Senator Quinn is doing that. One of the most learned and appropriate contributions in the House the last day was made by Senator Farrell, although he got little publicity for it. Like Senator Quinn, he spoke with passion about the dangers for wildlife. He wanted to know why there is a lack of food for wildlife and why certain species are endangered. There was so much common sense in what he said I almost wish it could be recorded and used.</P>
      <P>We must tap into the common sense of the people of rural Ireland. If we do not succeed, all the aspirations, plans and legislation will not achieve what we specifically want to achieve. I am talking not only about the protection of our wildlife but about an appreciation and enhancement of our wildlife and of the environment which is essential for our wildlife. I would prefer if the amendments were focused on that because it would broaden the debate and help us to inform the public that what we are asking for here is the partnership I mentioned.</P>
      <P>Members know there are grave dangers and that this matter is urgent. It is not just about harmonising our laws with our international obligations but about our love for wildlife. When one species disappears, we will wonder how it happened and why we did not put down a marker. That is what the Minister and the Department are doing in this Bill. We do not want to have to ask in five or ten years' time why we did not see what was happening to an endangered species.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the amendments will be debated, it is essential to put on the record that the Minister has done an excellent job and she has got it right. The fact that the amendments have a narrow focus is a tribute to the fact that the Minister has <Col N="1396" /> got the legislation right. I know Senator Quinn will want to revisit a comment or two he made about the Minister and correct the record in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume I will also get the opportunity to make a Second Stage speech. No one in the House disagrees with the substance of this Bill. The Minister has done a good day's work in protecting our wildlife and we all applaud that. It is our function as legislators to seek to improve areas where we believe there are gaps in the manner in which the legislation will be implemented.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn has tabled a reasonable set of amendments in relation to communicating to the public the actions being taken by the Minister. The Minister has stuck to the traditional means of communication in the Bill, that is, publication in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> and local newspapers and on local radio stations. All this is extremely desirable but there are other means of communication, electronic communication, which is readily accessible to all and sundry. This type of communication is becoming more and more accessible. Many farmers throughout the country have a computer. If one is looking for a job, one is quite likely to enter an Internet café in the city. If one wishes to travel, to find a cheap holiday or some business angle, it is all on the website. The Internet provides all these facilities and more and more sites are being established. There is an onus on every Department to establish a website, keep it up to date and in line with legislation.</P>
      <P>This is not just a technical point. There is a responsibility on the Minister to ensure that the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has an adequate website database to communicate the provisions of the legislation in relation to designated natural heritage areas. In designating natural heritage areas, the Minister must make the information available to the public. Subsequent issuing of orders must also be publicised to those who will be directly affected if a natural heritage area is designated in a particular area. The public at large must also be informed because natural heritage areas are of interest to everyone on the island. This information cannot be limited to local newspapers or radio stations, it must be more widely disseminated.</P>
      <P>This is a serious flaw in the legislation because the Minister is limiting the information to at least one local radio station or one local newspaper. There is no reference to the national newspapers. There is more than one local newspaper in many instances. This information relates not only to the local population directly adjacent to the designated natural heritage area. There will be other impacts of the designations in the future such as the protection of flora and fauna, commercial shooting and so on which must also be publicised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support totally Senators Henry and Quinn's amendments and I cannot understand why they cannot be incorporated in the legislation. If <Col N="1397" /> Senator Quinn decides to put the amendments to a vote, they are rejected and the Minister is not prepared to go back to the Dáil, I see no point in moving my amendments and wasting time. If the Minister has not got an open mind to consider what I regard as an imminently reasonable set of amendments, we are going through a charade.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister is here in person. On the Order of Business, Senator Ross complained that very often Ministers with other portfolios come to this House to deal with issues with which they are not totally <i>au fait</i>. That is not fair to the Minister or the House. I compliment the Minister on being in this House throughout the entire debate on the legislation. However, if she is not willing to consider reasonable amendments, that is extremely disappointing. I would have expected the Minister to give the amendments a proper hearing on Committee Stage, come back on Report Stage and either accept them or table her own amendments. If the amendments are rejected out of hand and there is no positive response, the only conclusion we can come to is what Senator Norris suggested on Committee Stage. I hope this is not the case and I appeal to the Minister, even at this eleventh hour, to accept this set of amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill to preclude the publication of information by electronic means where it is considered appropriate, therefore, there is no need to incorporate the amendments in the Bill. In certain cases, this would weaken the Bill. I acknowledge and welcome the fact that information technology is rapidly becoming more generally accessible and that it will play an enhanced role in our lives as time goes on. A time will come when the information super highway, to which I have occasionally heard Senator Norris refer on radio, will pass through all our livingrooms. However, this has not yet happened, nor will it happen for a number of years. I look forward to the day when it does happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, I fully support the Government's commitment to the development of information technology. Indeed, since my appointment as Minister, I have more than doubled the staffing of my Department's information technology unit to improve communications within my Department and externally. I am keenly aware of the need to improve and enhance communications among my officials who are spread across the length and breadth of the country. Our improved communication network has greatly helped in our day-to-day operations. I am also focused on the importance of improving communication between my Department and the public to ensure that relevant information is easily accessible. The Department's website is of particular value in this regard. For example, the website is used for listing special areas of conservation. However, our site needs improvement and I have sought pro<Col N="1398" /> posals from consultants to undertake a complete redesign of the site.</P>
    <P>What the Senators are proposing can already be done, where appropriate, under the Bill as it stands, without a need for amendments. My view is that these amendments are not essential in all cases and inappropriate in some. What we are talking about here is legislation intended to protect our natural heritage. In legislation generally, an obligation is often placed on a Minister to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil </i>certain information where legal decisions are taken. This Bill provides for such publication, where appropriate. Publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is essentially a legal device, as publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> effectively indicates to the Judiciary that the Minister has fulfilled his or her responsibility under the relevant section of the legislation. It is not generally contended that it is an effective means of informing the public.</P>
    <P>There are many ways of informing the public of legislative developments. I do not believe it is necessary to list comprehensively in a Bill every way in which the information shall be disseminated. If I believed that the proposed amendments identified any fundamental deficiency in the Bill that would impact on the protection of our natural heritage, I would be amenable to reconsidering my position on them. However, I do not believe this is the case. The Bill sets out the minimum publicity that is required in each circumstance, and each circumstance is different. The Bill does not preclude any manner of disseminating information.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment to section 16(5), this will oblige me to publish electronically the relevant information where it has not been possible to contact an owner, occupier or other person who would be affected by a decision to propose a site for designation as an NHA. Section 16(5) is not intended as a means of notifying the public in general of proposals to designate sites as NHAs but to contact individuals on whom the proposed designation directly impacts. Section 16(5) sets down a comprehensive proactive notification procedure which will target those most likely to be affected by the proposed designation, such as farmers, local residents, business interests and local authorities.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it would be essential for the purpose of the notification procedure to put such information on a website. This would place the onus on people to access the website, which I do not believe to be the correct approach. However, I have no difficulty in general information relating to NHAs being available on the Department's site.</P>
    <P>The same principle applies to amendment No. 3. This amendment relates to section 18(4)(<i>a</i>), which deals with a situation where a decision is made to amend or revoke an NHA designation order. A comprehensive notification procedure is provided for and this is again aimed at those most likely to be affected by the designation. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the publication of the information on my website, if <Col N="1399" /> deemed appropriate at a future date, but I believe the provisions of section 18 are more than adequate.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 10, which relates to section 36(8), the position is clear. There is an enabling provision that will allow the Minister to publish the list of commercial shoot operator permit holders from time to time. To give effect to this section, it will be necessary to make regulations after the enactment of the Bill. I have already given firm commitments that I will consult fully with interested parties in the completion of these regulations and the operation of this section. The manner and frequency under which a list of permanent holders will be published will be one of the issues addressed during such consultations.</P>
    <P>If I were to accept this amendment, I would be pre-determining an issue that will be subject to discussion. I am anxious to ensure that the good working relationship that has been established with the relevant bodies during the drafting of the Bill will be maintained and I want to leave subsection (8) as open as possible, pending the outcome of the discussions to which I refer. However, the option is there to publish such lists on the website if considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 11, which relates to section 51(<i>a</i>), Senators are proposing to amend the provisions governing the illegal advertisement of fauna. The provision, as drafted, is clear in that it states that a person &ldquo;shall not publish or cause to be published any advertisement&rdquo;. I am completely satisfied that publication by electronic means is fully comprehended by that wording. This provision is clear and all-embracing.</P>
    <P>In this section there is specific danger in detailing electronic means in that the illegality of employing a measure not mentioned could then be called into question. In effect, if we were to insert the Senators' proposal, it may, by highlighting one particular form of publication, create a weakness in relation to any other type of publication not specified. In short, the amendment could weaken the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 pertain to sections 56 and 57 which deal, respectively, with the import and export of flora and fauna to and from the EU. The Senators are seeking that where the Minister decides to designate or amend or revoke a designation of a port or airport through which the import or export of flora and fauna is permitted, it should be published by electronic means as well as in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. The primary function of the existing provision is to act as a legal device. I have the option to publish material electronically or by any other means for the purpose of informing the wider public. However, I do not consider that this should be a legal requirement.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 58 is to allow Ireland to ratify the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, CITES. Amendment No. 14 proposes to amend subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) <Col N="1400" /> which empowers the Minister to designate additional management authorities with responsibility in relation to the management of CITES. Subsection (2)(<i>d</i>) specifies that the Minister will publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> notice of any designations or amendments or revocation of such designations. Again, if I consider it necessary and appropriate to publish any further notice, I may use any method deemed appropriate including electronic means.</P>
    <P>I wish to summarise my position on these amendments. I am actively supportive of information technology developments and will use IT where appropriate to improve my Department's work and to facilitate its customers. It is rather ironic for Senators to make charges which try to infer that I have no interest or am rather backward in my approach to developments in technology or do not realise the importance of technology in the modern world. As already stated, I support fully the work the Government is doing in this area. The fact that I have specific responsibility for broadcasting and the introduction of digitalisation in that sector shows not only my obligations but also my deep interest in technological developments. It is somewhat disingenuous of Senators to try to imply an image of my Department, my officials or myself as being a little slow in accepting technological change.</P>
    <P>The Bill as drafted outlines only the minimum level of notification and publication. This relates to the issue raised this morning by at least one Senator, namely, the importance of making known the contents of the legislation to those it primarily affects. I live in Ennis, which is the information age town, and Members must be practical and realise that, as we speak, the kind of access to technology that may be available in Ennis is not available in other areas. Whereas we would wish to promote and further the acceptance of information technology and ensure that there is no question that a two-tier IT society comprising the information rich and the information poor will be created.</P>
    <P>We must take a practical approach to this matter. As matters stand, it is most important to ensure that appropriate information is published in local newspapers. However, I re-emphasise the fact that electronic means can still be used in the context of disseminating information under this legislation. Ministers have the option, at all times, to notify people or disseminate information by electronic means.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendments do not suggest taking any action which cannot already be taken under the Bill as drafted. They are not necessary and, in certain cases, they are inappropriate. As stated earlier, there is also a danger that they could weaken the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello seemed to suggest that I have come before the House without an open mind. I assure Members that I take the work of the Dáil and the Seanad extremely seriously. The amendments that have been tabled on this Bill, either in the Dáil or Seanad, or in connection with any <Col N="1401" /> other Bill with which I have been associated, have been given every consideration. Senators will appreciate that I am not always in a position to either accept or agree to amendments that have been tabled. However, such amendments are given every consideration before I reach a decision. It is not a question of my wishing to rush this Bill or any other through the Houses of the Oireachtas. I have more respect than that for our institutions.</P>
    <P>I hope Senators will recognise that, as a matter of principle, I have considered carefully the amendments before us. I cannot accept them because I genuinely believe that the provisions in the Bill offer the best way forward and do not preclude any method of disseminating information by technological means. In my opinion, the general thrust displayed in this part of the Bill is the best route to take.</P>
    <P>We have been awaiting the introduction and passage of this Bill for over 16 years. It was long promised but did not see the light of day until now. In all my discussions with individuals and groups who have shown an intense interest in this Bill, the issues, content and substance of the Bill were raised. The question of the dissemination of information, which has been raised by some Senators, was not seen as a priority by those immediately involved in wildlife issues. The Bill provides an opportunity to use new technologies as access to them becomes more readily available. I cannot accept the proposed amendments.</P>

      <P>I rise in sadness because I am disappointed the Minister has failed to address a number of the points I raised. In her response she again used the word I had criticised. Six times in her reply the Minister used the word &ldquo;preclude&rdquo;, saying nothing in the Bill precluded the use of electronic technology. The point of the amendments is to insist that future Ministers use modern technology.</P>
      <P>The Minister has shown her confidence, her faith and her commitment to the elements of what is sought. I am concerned that Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú seemed to suggest that I had not acknowledged the Minister's commitment. On Second Stage we praised the Minister for what she is trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed because these amendments are an attempt to improve the Bill. Senator Ó Murchú reminded us that we have waited a long time for this Bill, which he wants to see expeditiously enacted. After 16 years, would an extra ten minutes in the Dáil be an unreasonable delay? All amendments passed in the Seanad must be returned to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not answered my criticisms. It is not enough to say nothing in the Bill precludes a Minister from using electronic means. The amendments are intended to force Ministers in the future to use the various means of disseminating information which are already the methods of the present rather than the future. Those of us who have children know they no longer write <Col N="1402" /> letters. Few of them read newspapers, apart from the sports pages. However, my children e-mail me from all around the world. They use the Internet to get information and read <i>The Irish Times </i>without buying the newspaper. I am not talking about the future. This is happening now.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear the Minister refer to Ennis and say that what is happening there is not yet happening in the rest of the country. It is happening in the rest of the country. What is happening in Ennis is not the future. It is the present for a large number of people. In Singapore, every citizen has been given an e-mail address because that country wishes to become the electronic centre of Asia. We have already announced that we wish to become the electronic hub of Europe. It is not out of the question that what we urge the Minister to do could be done within a year. We are talking about the present, not the future. We wish to ensure that Ministers of the future will not be able to restrict information by saying it may only appear in newspapers and be heard on local radio stations.</P>
    <P>When I was chairman of An Post in 1986 we had never heard of the fax machine. We made a five year plan in 1986 without knowing of the existence of a threat to the letter writing of the future. We were out of touch. In 1890, when the Bell telephone company was setting up in the United States, the Postmaster General of the United Kingdom was asked if the post office would get into the telephone business. He replied that he saw no future in telephones and besides, he said, &ldquo;We have messenger boys.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not insinuate that the Minister is behind the times. I was concerned that Senator Ó Murchú thought I was being personal when I said the Minister would squirm. I was referring to the Minister as the head of a Department. I believe the Minister will squirm with embarrassment when she compares the website of her Department with those of some others. We have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not touched on the basis of my argument. On a number of occasions she said the option is there if a future Minister considers it appropriate and that it can be done if a Minister wishes to do it. I want to restrict the Minister's freedom to withold this information from the public. If I live in rural Ireland and, in the future, I do not have access to newspapers, I will want to be able to access a website and see the information I need. A large number of people in rural Ireland are already communicating electronically, particularly people younger than I. This is the way, not of the future but of the present.</P>
    <P>In referring to amendments Nos. 12 and 13, the Minister stated that if a future Minister decides to restrict the importation of certain flora and fauna this must appear in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. How can I find that out? If I miss the announcement in a local newspaper, must I get <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>? If I am in Donegal, Clare or Kerry that may not be convenient but I can sit at my desk and, within seconds, see what restrictions the Minister has <Col N="1403" /> introduced. The amendments are not intended to empower. They are intended to restrict future Ministers.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello's concern may be correct. The Minister says she has an open mind but she did not accept a single amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad and seems unlikely to accept one on Report Stage. These amendments, which are intended to restrict the freedom of future Ministers to withold information from the public, will enhance the legislation and make it suitable for the 21st century, not for the 19th and 20th centuries.</P>
    <P>There is not a single Deputy who would delay these measures or vote against them. If the Minister were to bring the Bill back to the Dáil to make amendments to restrict the right of a future Minister to withhold information by not insisting it be put on the Internet, no Luddite in the Dáil would vote against such a measure or delay it.</P>

      <P>It would be accepted that citizens have a right to access information and the Dáil would enable the public to have information in the most realistic and forward looking way.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to reject the assumption that because people got information from local papers in the 20th century they will continue to do so in the 21st. Let us include local newspapers and local radio stations but let us also include the means of getting information which is favoured by so many people now. Let us improve democracy by improving every Bill that comes through the House, particularly this very worthwhile Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Murchú was concerned that I had not complimented the Minister on the Bill. This is great legislation and I welcome it. Senator Gibbons and Senator Farrell spoke from the heart about it last week and it was a joy to hear them and the Minister's enthusiasm for the Bill. We are trying to improve the legislation, but that will not happen if the amendments are rejected. I urge the Minister to reconsider them.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposed by the Senators is not well founded for two reasons. First, it would be superfluous and, second, it would very much weaken the protection for NHAs. An NHA order may include whatever provisions are required to provide for the conservation of the site, including stipulations concerning the management of the site. There<Col N="1405" /> fore, there is no need to make specific reference to management plans.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in addition to management plans, there are various other types of plans or protective measures which could well be relevant to the conservation of an NHA. Examples include habitat conservation guidelines, commonage framework plans, individual farm plans and aquaculture zoning plans. If a reference to management plans is included, it would be necessary to refer to all other potential conservation measures. It is not appropriate, nor would it be a wise course of action to detail all these in primary legislation. One danger of detailing such a list is that the validity of employing a measure not included on the list could be called into question. Additionally, it is possible that further types of conservation measures which are not in existence at this time could be devised at a future date. Therefore, I cannot agree to include a reference to management plans as sought by the Senators because to do so is not only unnecessary, but it would ultimately weaken the protection afforded to NHAs by limiting the range of conservation measures the Minister could employ to ensure the conservation of natural heritage areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 3, after &ldquo;works&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;excluding turf cutting privately undertaken for domestic purposes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 proposes to amend section 19 and it also has relevance to section 20. I am attempting to protect turf cutting in areas where the bog, or area of peat, is in an NHA or an SAC, although there are separate regulations for SACs. As the Minister knows, this has been a controversial issue in relation to the designation of SACs. People in western counties, in particular, have engaged in the timeless practice of cutting their own turf for their domestic heating purposes. They found that under the regulations made for the special areas of conservation this practice had to cease, although the Minister intervened at a later stage to allow a period of ten years by which time people who cut or extracted turf for their own use would have to find alternative means.</P>
      <P>I welcome the designation of NHAs. There are many sensitive areas that need to be designated as natural heritage areas. I support that power being put into law. Turf cutting is taking place in many of the areas that will be designated in counties such as Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and Clare, the Minister's constituency. The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, will know much about it because the practice is very prevalent is his constituency. It may be an out of fashion practice but it is timeless and is important to thousands of people, particularly in the western counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> It was interesting to note what the Minister had to say in relation to orders she made after the SAC designations. She made an order in relation to blanket bogs and a separate one for raised bogs. In respect of the order on turf cutting for raised bogs under SAC she said:</P>
    <P>Most damage to SACs is caused by industrial and commercial operations. Cutting for industrial and commercial purposes in these bogs must cease before the 1999 cutting season. In exceptional cases, to protect employment the Minister may agree to allow cutting in 1999 where the operator has already entered into a formal agreement with the Department. The Department will then transfer the operations to non-SAC sites and will cease operations within the SAC at an early date.</P>
    <P>In the case of domestic cutters [this is the interesting and important point] it is clear that despite the fact that there are much more users than individual and commercial operators, the damage done to the bogs by an individual in a year is small in most situations.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acknowledged that the amount of damage caused by a domestic cutter is small in most situations. I have been careful to state it is turf cut for domestic purposes only. That point is repeated in the order she made on 8 March 1999 in relation to turf cutting on blanket bogs which states:</P>
    <P>There are, of course, some relatively small areas of blanket bog where turf is now being cut which will have to remain within the boundaries of the SACs because total cutting in these areas would lead to damage of the more sensitive areas of the bog. In almost all of these areas people who have been cutting for their own domestic use may continue to cut the amount of turf needed for their own use for up to ten years to allow them time to make new arrangements.</P>
    <P>I want to protect the right to cut turf for one's own domestic purposes in an area of bog belonging to a landowner or farmer where that land may be designated a natural heritage area. I raise no objection to these areas being designated natural heritage areas.</P>
    <P>There is a timeless practice of turf cutting. The Minister has acknowledged in her statement of February 1999 and in her statement on blanket bogs in March 1999 that the amount of damage caused is very small. If the Bill proceeds to become an Act, without this insertion which makes an exemption for turf cutting, it will be defined as works and it will be illegal to do any excavations, digging or removals from the site. Section 19 defines works and put limits on the works that can and cannot be done; mostly it refers to works that cannot be done.</P>
    <P>We noted last week that local authorities are exempted. A local authority can cause serious damage and change to a natural heritage area if, for example, it wants to realign a road passing <Col N="1407" /> through such an area. It appears local authorities can carry out major excavations on a natural heritage area for any other reason, perhaps to place a sewage treatment works in such an area or in pursuance of any other works in which it may be involved.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister understands what I am seeking because she has constituents who would have raised this matter with her. I merely ask that turf cutting for domestic purposes only be exempted where references to works appear in sections 19 and 20 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's thesis is quite right in regard to what she is trying to do. This group of people will become smaller and smaller and it is not as if they will be a growing problem. I have not noticed the youth of Ireland going into turf cutting at a terrific rate. This group will become less of a factor. I suggest some of them will, unwittingly, infringe the legislation. They will not have the famous electronic means of getting information. Given that this will not be a great problem the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this reasonable and appropriate amendment. This is the type of work that will be carried out in the bogs of Ireland in the future, despite the concerns of Senator Henry that the younger generation is not likely to take up turf cutting in great numbers. Nevertheless, there are turbary rights throughout the country. Much of the land that is likely to be designated as natural heritage areas is likely to include some bogland because it has that type of flora and fauna which is part of our natural heritage. While the Minister includes in the legislation an interesting clause under which works may not be carried out, namely, works &ldquo;which are liable to destroy or to significantly alter, damage or interfere with the features&rdquo;, presumably work that would not alter or damage the features significantly could be carried out. Can the Minister give a cast iron guarantee that private cutting of turf for domestic purposes would be covered by that clause?</P>
      <P>Obviously it could be argued that cutting turf over decades would alter the shape and character of a landscape. Nevertheless, given that the private cutting of turf for domestic purposes is a time honoured tradition and that turf is the normal fuel used in many areas and is not produced on a commercial basis, the Minister should specifically exempt this type of work from those which are precluded in natural heritage areas. This matter will remain a grey area if the Minister does not accept an amendment of this nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the amendment simply because of my experience of what has happened in the past in the area I represent. The Department purchased existing bog and gave those who wished to cut turf the opportunity to <Col N="1408" /> relocate in areas that were not affected by the relevant NHA or SAC. The Minister bent over backwards in allowing those who did not wish to relocate to cut for a further ten years in those locations.</P>
      <P>There is no danger that people will be prevented from cutting turf. They will be afforded an opportunity to cut turf at another location if the one they are using is part of an natural heritage area. While that option exists, as it has in the past, there will not be a problem and I oppose this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot add to Senator Connor's contribution. I hoped the Minister would accept my amendment because we are talking about domestic purposes only. It seems quite likely that in a natural heritage area there may have been, as Senator Connor mentioned, timeless rights or rights over many generations. As Senator Henry said, fewer people will become involved in this activity in the years ahead. It would be a shame to lose these rights for domestic purposes only. We are not talking about commercial use and I urge the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's amendment concerns the overall framework to be put in place for the conservation of areas of natural heritage, with particular regard to peat extraction from bogs.</P>
      <P>I will outline the context in which peatlands and the conservation of nationally important bogs should be considered. There is no doubt that peatlands are among the most important wildlife areas in Ireland. This is true of both blanket and raised bogs. Being so familiar with bogs it is often difficult for us in Ireland to fully appreciate their significance on a global level. Most people take them for granted.</P>
      <P>Ireland contains some of the best remaining examples of raised bogs in Europe. In the EU context, we are practically unique in still having intact active raised bogs. On the world stage Ireland's raised bogs are probably the most extensive of their type. Ireland supports 8% of the world's blanket bog, more than any European country. One particular type of blanket bog, lowland blanket bog, occurs only in Ireland and Scotland.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the scale of damage and loss of both types of bog has been significant. The sad reality is that 80% to 90% of Ireland's raised and blanket bogs have been degraded or destroyed over the past number of years. Of the original area of 300,000 hectares of raised bog in the country only about 6% remains with less than 2% in quality condition. This represents a significant loss of our natural heritage and of the global natural resource.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently concluded OECD environmental performance review of Ireland provides a broad snapshot of environmental and nature conservation issues in Ireland. The critical importance of Irish peatlands was highlighted in this review. The two main recommendations in relation to <Col N="1409" /> nature conservation was to ensure effective protection of designated nature protection areas and to give particular attention to protecting peat bogs of great ecological significance. Clearly, our remaining bogs are important and we must strive to conserve them.</P>
    <P>Obviously the extraction of turf impacts on peatlands. We are not focusing on all peatlands but on those which are recognised as being of national significance and which deserve protection in the common good.</P>
    <P>It is not tenable to suggest that extraction of turf, even for domestic purposes, should be completely unrestrained in such critically important habitats. The core purpose of designated NHAs is to conserve our most important natural heritage sites. Neither I nor any other Minister could be expected to stand over legislation allowing the destruction of these irreplaceable sites. At the same time I appreciate the tradition of turf cutting for domestic use in Ireland. Many people have fond memories of their exploits in the bog. Turf cutting adventures feature extensively in our literature, songs and art.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while recognising the imperative of protecting important sites I intend to adopt a fair approach to the issue of small scale domestic turf cutting. The aim is to achieve a balance between the needs of the people on the ground and the conservation of this nation's heritage. It is my intention to devise, in consultation with relevant interests, a set of arrangements to deal with peat extraction in NHAs as has already been done in relation to SACs. I am conscious of the social and economic impact an immediate cessation of turf cutting could have on small communities. This will inform my work in bringing forward practical arrangements for domestic peat extraction.</P>
    <P>I regard it as wholly wrong to include a blanket exemption for private domestic turf cutting in the legislation. Many people will agree to cease cutting in the short term. The extraction of turf by other people in NHAs could be brought to a conclusion over a period of years. General lifestyle changes will facilitate progress in that regard over the extended period &ndash; a point was made by Senators this morning.</P>
    <P>I will recap on the situation with regard to the SACs because I know Senator Connor has a particular interest in them. Senator Moylan mentioned that my Department has given a great amount of attention to raised and blanket bogs. Members will be aware of the compensation arrangements that I have put in place. They are good, fair and significant. There is also a question of the choice of relocation. Those who wish to continue to cut turf for domestic use and will be able to do so for another eight years. There was a derogation, if one wishes to use that term, from the very start. I wanted to ensure that there was a fair balance between the conservation of our bogs and the tradition of domestic turf cutting.</P>
    <P>I made the point, and I think it is an obvious one, that a great deal of damage was done to the bogs where the industrial and commercial sectors <Col N="1410" /> were concerned. It is a different situation for domestic cutters and that is why I was able to ensure that they can continue turf cutting until 2008.</P>
    <P>The compensation available is generous. Arbitration is available on compensation amounts because we wanted to be fair and open about all of the procedures. There are the relocation arrangements that Senator Moylan and others referred to. There has been a largely positive response from domestic cutters. To date a sum of £3 million has been paid in compensation to a substantial number of people who ceased domestic turf cutting.</P>
    <P>I have attempted to ensure that any arrangements made for NHAs will proceed on foot of a great deal of consultation. The procedures put in place for SACs have been fair and given people an opportunity to continue domestic cutting for a number of years to come.</P>
    <P>I know that the proposal here is to ensure that turf cutting could continue without any time limits. However, I hope that in my reply to the amendments this morning I have outlined that we are only talking about special areas of conservation or natural heritage areas. These areas have a particular significance. We have done our utmost to ensure that there has been a fair approach to this issue.</P>
    <P>The statistics show that bogs are under threat and it is important, therefore, to introduce balanced and fair measures to ensure there is conservation while at the same time taking account of the wishes of those who wish to continue with domestic turf cutting. My approach is the best that can be achieved under the Habitats Directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the assurances given by the Minister that there will be consultation with communities affected by the extension of NHAs to areas where turf cutting takes place and who are not already affected by the SAC directive. The problem is that the Minister will hold all the cards when she goes to negotiate.</P>
      <P>The people involved are beaten from the start because the legislation has placed a blanket ban on works. The Minister will always be able to wave the big stick of the law against them if they do not settle on her conditions. I know that sounds harsh and I appreciate what the Minister did in relation to the compensation package for SACs. However, the majority of the people who wish to continue cutting turf are not satisfied with the compensation that has been put in place because most of them have nothing to do with it. They wanted to continue this timeless practice and right to cut turf where they have turbary rights and full turbary ownership. We are interfering with what is often an absolute right. Most people would have no difficulty with the extension of the protection of an NHA to these sensitive areas. This practice is acknowledged in several statements by the Minister as causing little damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> The Minister made points about the 80% or 90% destruction of bogs to reinforce the argument against small domestic turf cutters. Let us deal with all the facts here. Some 80% or 90% of it has been extracted or destroyed by a State agency, Bord na Móna, over the past 60 years of its operations. It has been the main agent for extracting peat from the bogs of Ireland. It is responsible for altering at least 80% of the bogs. I would be amazed if domestic turf cutting amounted to more than 10% of the destruction over the generations. Bord na Móna is continuing its operations and gives very valuable employment.</P>
    <P>I am not old enough to remember the war years. However, in the 1940s the Minister's grandfather, who was the then Taoiseach, and the Minister for supplies, Mr. Lemass, used the bogs extensively to meet the fuel supply shortage during the war. It was in those years that we lost so much of our raised and blanket bogs.</P>
    <P>I know people who would be ashamed to say they own bogs because they associate them with poverty and deprivation. They would turn their heads the other way when they passed them. However, we recognise that they are very important archaeological sites.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have to press this amendment to a vote. While I recognise that the Minister is willing to enter negotiations with the communities, their great disadvantage will be that the Minister will have enacted legislation which will state that any works they carry out will be illegal. That is a great disadvantage for anyone coming to negotiate with <Col N="1412" /> the Minister, notwithstanding her generosity. I acknowledge fully that the Minister will approach this with generosity, but she will be advised by officials who may take a different view.</P>
    <P>We must not forget the economic importance of turf to many people. We live in an age of rapidly increasing oil prices. Thousands of people in rural Ireland still depend on peat or turf for their domestic heating and cooking, in many cases, however old fashioned that might sound.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the Minister's arguments. I would accept some amendment of the wording in my amendment. I would be willing to accept the application of the Minister's ten year rule, so that turf cutting for domestic purposes could continue for at least ten years. That is guaranteed under the SAC regulation but it is not yet guaranteed to anybody under the NHA regulation, although there is some promise in what the Minister said.</P>
    <P>Senator Moylan and the Minister made the point that relocation was important. That was a total failure. People were offered relocation to alternative sites. However, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which is the successor of the Irish Land Commission and holds most of the State owned bogs, told people to go to totally unserviced and inappropriate areas. The Land Commission advised people to move to sites which were fairly pristine and virgin and were imminent candidates for becoming NHAs. It was completely wrong to allocate to people portions of bog in such areas. The number of people who accepted relocation was minuscule, if not zero.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides that a landowner must notify the Minister if he or she wishes to carry out work on a designated NHA. The Minister can either prohibit such work or agree to it being carried out. If the Minister does neither within six months of being notified, the landowner can proceed with the work. My view is that it is only reasonable that landowners have an assurance that they will have a decision on their proposed works within a specified period. The Attorney General's office is also strongly of this view. I am satisfied that six months is a reasonable period within which to make a decision both from the point of view of the landowner and of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, O'Meara and Ryan propose that an onus be put on the owners, occupiers or users of the land to give a further 14 days' notice to the Minister at the conclusion of the stipulated six months period for a decision on proposed work in a designated NHA. While I appreciate where the amendment is coming from and that it is motivated by a desire to avoid damaging any NHA, I do not feel it would be satisfactory. It would involve the use of the applicant as part of the management process to ensure that his or her application is not overlooked. This would be unfair. It would be a most unusual approach and would not constitute good legislation. Neither would such drafting be to the liking of the Attorney General's office. There is always the possibility of replies not being issued due to pressure of work, oversight etc. However, I intend to address this through proper management systems in respect of the process in my Department.</P>
      <P>We intend to put proper management systems in place in the Department. It is not considered proper that the applicant should become part of the management administration system. The Minister will have six months within which to prohibit or agree to proposed works in a designated NHA. The six month period is appropriate and, therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This proposal is for the amendment of section 19(2), a provision I inserted on Committee Stage in the other House to enhance the protection to be afforded to proposed NHAs. <Col N="1414" /> The provision requires that a person shall not carry out any potentially damaging works in a notified NHA without first giving three months' notice to the Minister. Proceeding with work without giving such notification would constitute an offence. In most cases it will be possible to make the final decision on designation of an NHA within the three month period. Furthermore, section 20 of the Bill enables the Minister to apply to the courts to seek the prohibition of such works.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes that the notification period to the Minister before undertaking works in a notified NHA be extended from three to six months. It is considered that the requirement for three months notification amounts to placing a burden on a landowner. The Attorney General's office is clear that any burden placed on a landowner in such circumstances must be reasonable and the legal advice is that the period of three months is appropriate. However, the imposition of a restriction of six months on a landowner runs the danger of being found to be unreasonable and unnecessary.</P>
      <P>From the prospect of allowing sufficient time to the Minister, a period of three months is adequate to facilitate any necessary action. Three months allows time to the Minister to undertake an assessment of the applications of the proposed works for a notified NHA, to move to designate the site as an NHA, if deemed appropriate, or to proceed to seek a court injunction in the event of it being considered necessary to do so. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 21 provides powers to the Minister to order restoration of damaged natural heritage areas. The Senator has proposed to limit the application of section 21. There is a <Col N="1415" /> danger that this amendment could lead to a weakening in the protection afforded to NHAs. Conditions can be attached to a consent issued under section 19 and it is prudent to have the power to order restoration in the event that such conditions are not met. It could happen that a person who obtains consent to carry out works under section 19 does not subsequently abide by the conditions attached to the consent. In such cases, if damage was caused to an NHA, restoration might be appropriate.</P>
      <P>If the words proposed by the Senators, &ldquo;otherwise than in accordance with <i>section 19</i>,&rdquo; were inserted into this section, it would leave open the possibility that people could evade having to carry out restoration on the NHAs in cases where restoration would be appropriate. It may be that Senators are concerned about a hypothetical situation where a person might be directed to restore a site after they have carried out works in good faith in accordance with section 19 consent. I assure Senators that it is not the intention that this section should be used in this manner. I have no doubt it would not be proper, nor would it be legally feasible, to give a person consent and then require him or her to restore the site if damage was caused as a result of actions taken on foot of that consent.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment as it would lead to a weakening of the protection of natural heritage areas.</P>

      <P>This amendment was tabled in the Dáil and on Committee Stage in this House. While the intention of the Senators is understandable, I have examined the suggestion in detail and I cannot accept it is appropriate to incorporate the amendment in the Bill. If adopted, the proposed amendment could give rise to practical difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essence of this problem is the requirement that would exist to establish definitively when the alleged works within an NHA were carried out. This would necessitate establishing specific dates involved. It would be extremely difficult to prove the exact date or dates when the relevant work was carried out, particularly if a number of years had passed, which is quite likely in the scenario envisaged by the Senators. The obligation on the Minister under the proposed amendment to <Col N="1416" /> determine precisely when works were carried out could be used efficiently and effectively by the occupier-owner of the lands to avoid having to restore the lands in question.</P>
    <P>In the case of alleged damage to NHAs, it will be determined that, when restoration is an option, my Department will act expeditiously to remedy the situation by endeavouring, where appropriate, to have the site restored as soon as reasonably possible. I cannot envisage a situation where more than ten years after the works have allegedly been undertaken my Department would intervene to order the restoration of an NHA. In any event, I expect that after such a period it could prove extremely difficult to restore an NHA. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The proposed amendment draws particular attention to one of the principal changes arising from the Bill. Section 32 is a totally new provision which will affect our approach to the conservation of wildlife in Ireland, and it is a provision of which I am particularly proud. Senators may be surprised to note that the Wildlife Act, 1976, actually excluded from its general scope all fish and aquatic and vertebrate species. In practical terms, such an approach at the time meant that tens of thousands of species from both marine and fresh water ecosystems were, strictly speaking, off limits from any conservation consideration. While this may have been understandable in 1976, it would be completely at variance with events today when an ecosystem or holistic-based approach to biodiversity conservation is being adopted. The new Bill brings all wild animal species, as well as wild plant species, within the scope of the Act, apart from certain species relevant to fisheries, whether commercial or recreational, which will be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 32 contains a provision which provides for the exclusion of species relevant to fisheries which will, in turn, be specified in regulations to be made under the section. The intention is that species relevant to any type of fishery can be excluded by being listed in the regulations. Species listed are likely to be relevant to existing commercial fisheries and other types of fishing such as sport or recreational fisheries, for example, coarse fish. Species which are not yet subject to commercial exploitation but which are under consideration, or are the subject of trials to investigate the potential for exploitation, or which may become so in the future, may be listed under section 32 regulations. Limiting excludable species, as the amendment proposes, to those fit for <Col N="1417" /> commercial exploitation would be overly restrictive.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the overall change in the scope of the Act to comprehend the vast majority of wild species represents a fundamental departure for wildlife conservation. This broadening of the basis of wildlife legislation is of great significance and establishes a new and comprehensive framework within which the conservation of biodiversity can be addressed and advanced. In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 74 of the principal Act outlines the level of fines that may be imposed for offences committed under the Wildlife Act. The principal Act outlined three levels of offence with varying penalties applying, depending on the level of offence committed. In the case of lower level offences, the penalty also varied, depending on whether a first, second or subsequent offence was involved.</P>
      <P>In section 68 of the Bill, the graduated system of penalties is maintained but the level of fines applicable has been substantially increased. I also provided for the imposition of prison sentences at all levels of offence. Under the principal Act, the maximum fine was £500 with no possibility of imprisonment. The maximum fine has been increased to £50,000 and a term of imprisonment can be combined with a fine or imposed separately. The maximum term in relation to a lower level first offence is three months and this rises to a maximum of two years at the top of the scale.</P>
      <P>The Senator's proposal would end the current graduated system of penalties for ordinary offences under the legislation. As I outlined, I do not favour this approach and I am supported in this regard by the advice of the Attorney General's office, which is that it would generally be inappropriate to have the same level of penalties for first offences as for repeat offences. Many circumstances could arise where an individual, through an oversight or a lack of knowledge of the relevant legislation, might commit a relatively minor offence under the wildlife legislation. In such cases, it would be unreasonable to impose a sizeable fine, possibly £1,500 and/or 12 months imprisonment under the Senator's amendment, on that individual.</P>
      <P>The proposed maximum fine of £500 and/or a term of imprisonment of up to three months provides adequate scope for an appropriate punishment. Under my proposals, if the same person committed a further offence, he or she would potentially be liable to increased fines and a longer term of imprisonment as a defence based on ignorance of the legislation would not hold as much weight. On a third conviction, the maximum level of punishment would be the same as for a summary conviction on the more serious offences under the Wildlife Acts.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 68 generally, the provisions stipulate that the offences committed in respect of natural heritage areas will fall within the category drawing the heaviest penalties. I have decided to also provide that offences committed in special areas of conservation will be dealt with similarly. It would be inappropriate to impose a lighter regime on SACs than NHAs.</P>
      <P>The substantially increased penalties, taken in conjunction with the other measures introduced by the Bill, will serve to enhance greatly the protection and conservation of our important habitats and our wildlife generally. I do not intend to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Title>National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend <Col N="1422" /> the role of the National Treasury Management Agency to provide for the establishment of a State claims agency, a central treasury service and a fund investment service. The aim of these new services is to make savings and maximise income for the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I will set out for the House later what each of the services involves and how they will operate in practice. First, I would like to outline why it is proposed to establish them under the auspices of the NTMA.</P>
      <P>The NTMA was established in 1990 with flexible management structures and suitably qualified personnel to borrow money for the Exchequer and to manage the national debt management at a time when debt management had become an increasingly complex and sophisticated activity. The NTMA has proved successful in managing the national debt. In the performance of its debt management role, the agency has built up a broad range of financial management skills. The proposed central treasury and fund investment services involve the utilisation of these skills. It makes sense to avail of the NTMA's expertise in these areas and provide for the addition of these facilities to the services already provided by the agency.</P>
      <P>Turning to the State claims agency, the present arrangements for handling claims against the State are unsatisfactory. A new approach is needed to put in place a structured and coherent response to meet these claims. The choice here is between establishing a new agency to handle claims or to give the task to an existing one. The broad range of skills which the NTMA has built up, supplemented by the particular expertise which claims management requires, will enable it to perform this new function in an efficient and cost effective manner. The agency intends to recruit experienced claims managers who will form the core skill-set in the claims management area as they do in commercial practice. In addition, the agency intends to recruit legal expertise both directly and through the use of a panel of solicitors. An experienced risk manager will also be recruited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might assist the House if I detailed some background to the decision to establish the State claims agency. The upsurge in Army deafness claims which took place towards the end of 1995 caused increased attention to be directed at the general question of compensation claims against the State, their cost and how they should be managed. It was argued that the management of claims against the State, centralised in a single agency dedicated to that purpose, would involve the adoption of a proactive approach in seeking least cost settlements in accordance with best practice of claims departments of insurance companies. The main benefits which were seen as arising from the operation of a claims agency were savings in settlement costs and legal charges &ndash; to both claimants and the State &ndash; resulting from more efficient handling of claims. The risk advice role which a claims agency would assume <Col N="1423" /> would also help to reduce the incidence of claims and thus the overall cost.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments looked favourably on the idea, first, directing that draft legislation to establish a State claims agency should be brought forward and later that a claims agency under the NTMA should be considered further. However, the issues involved proved very complex and required extensive consultation with Departments as well as the Office of the Attorney General. This was against the background that there is no general legislative provision for dealing with personal injury or property damage claims against the State onto which proposals for a claims agency could have been grafted.</P>
    <P>Extensive discussions also took place with the NTMA on the issues involved and, in particular, on how to deal with certain concerns which arose. Those concerns related to issues such as the scope of the claims to be managed, the funding provisions which should apply and how to give Departments &ndash; the clients &ndash; an influence in the way the claims functions would be handled. The provisions of the Bill meet these concerns and I am happy to recommend them to the House.</P>
    <P>This whole process took longer than any of us would have wished or expected. The drafting of the legislative provisions was also a lengthy process, reflecting the fact that, in this Bill, we are breaking new ground. It is essential that Departments and other State authorities against whom claims are made have an influence on how claims are handled by the agency on their behalf. This will be achieved through their being directly consulted on the general guidelines to be laid down on how the NTMA carries out its claims management functions and through the policy committee on which the Departments will be represented. The policy and general procedures to be followed in handling claims will be subject to the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>It had been envisaged at an earlier stage that a State claims agency would deal with Army hearing loss cases. However, the strategy adopted by my colleague, the Minister for Defence, has been successful in bringing about a dramatic reduction in the levels of compensation paid in these cases. The Minister has established a pilot scheme specifically for the Army hearing loss claims and it is hoped that most of them can be disposed of under that scheme with considerable savings to the Exchequer. Accordingly, there may not be a role for the claims agency in handling such cases. However, this matter will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new arrangements will lead to savings for the Exchequer. It is, however, virtually impossible to estimate the amount of savings which might be achieved. The potential can be gauged from the overall cost of claims. Latest estimates of the costs of the new claims arising, excluding Army hearing loss, amount to £8.5 million per year. The legal costs on this amount could be around £2.8 million per annum.</P>
    <P>I do not regard the present arrangements for <Col N="1424" /> handling claims against the State as satisfactory. Society in Ireland is becoming more litigious. Further &ldquo;class actions&rdquo;, as in Army deafness, may occur, in addition to the growing number of routine cases. I am strongly of the view that the State must have in place a structured and coherent response to these claims. A more businesslike approach to the settlement of genuine claims is also desirable in the interests of claimants and to secure lower costs in the long run. The provisions of this Bill will achieve these objectives.</P>
    <P>I know the agency intends to adopt a commercial approach to claims management &ndash; it will not be a &ldquo;soft touch&rdquo; for inflated claims or those with little or no merit. I would like claimants, existing and prospective, and their advisers to be clear in that regard. If all concerned realise that, they will be less likely to make or push claims which they know to be less than deserving. I have no doubt, however, that cases will arise which involve sensitive issues or where injury has been caused through negligence on the part of the State. I assure Senators that in situations such as this the agency will deal with claimants in a fair and sympathetic manner.</P>
    <P>The agency will also be proactive in the vital area of risk management. The application of sound risk management principles and procedures should ensure that, over time, the frequency of accidents and injuries will decline. They can never, of course, be totally eliminated. One of the tasks facing the agency will be to ensure that Departments have procedures in place to deal quickly and positively with the victims of genuine accidents. Such an approach can often mean that incidents which might otherwise give rise to contentious claims and litigation can be quickly resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Central Treasury Service proposals will enable the NTMA to offer deposit, overdraft and loan facilities to health boards, vocational educational committees, local authorities and other designated non-commercial State bodies. The objective is to offer such bodies a competitive service in these areas with a view to achieving savings for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The proposals stem from concerns expressed by the NTMA that the interest paid on short-term surpluses and charged on overdraft facilities along with bank charges represented very bad value compared with the NTMA's capacity to raise or place cash at wholesale money market rates. In order to achieve savings for the Exchequer, the agency suggested that it might offer central treasury services to the non-commercial State sector, aimed at complementing, rather than replacing, existing banking arrangements for the organisations involved.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental group which was representative of the NTMA and the various Government Departments concerned examined these proposals. The group concluded that the interest rates offered and charged by the banks were generally less competitive than rates which <Col N="1425" /> the NTMA could offer. However, the group also noted that some organisations had negotiated discounted bank charges as part of packages requiring them to maintain some minimum level of cash balances and-or overdraft facilities with their banks.</P>
    <P>The practice of maintaining certain levels of cash balances or borrowings in return for low transaction processing fees is not necessarily the most cost effective option. Best practice would dictate that the cost of each service should be evaluated separately, with the objective of availing of the most competitively priced combination of services. I can envisage a situation where the NTMA provides the bodies with keenly priced deposit and loan facilities while the banks provided the transaction processing services. The Bill will bring greater competition and transparency in the provision of these services which can only be of benefit to the bodies concerned. It will be necessary for each individual body to weigh up the amount of any additional costs that could arise from any disturbance of existing banking arrangements versus the amount of savings that could be derived from availing of the NTMA facilities.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental group recommended that the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990, should be amended to enable the NTMA to offer cash management services to non-commercial State bodies and this recommendation was accepted by Government. The necessary provisions to give effect to this recommendation are contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Last week the House debated legislation which will make the NTMA manager of the new National Pensions Reserve Fund. In this role the agency will act on behalf of the independent commissioners who will control, manage and invest the fund. The proposed role for the agency under the current Bill is somewhat different. The Bill deals with funds such as the social insurance fund which are managed by Government Ministers and where the Minister concerned has a statutory responsibility to invest the fund assets. The Bill will enable the agency to perform this investment function on the relevant Minister's behalf.</P>
    <P>Since the establishment of the NTMA the Government's professional investment expertise has been concentrated in the agency. However, under the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990, the agency is restricted to a debt management role. It does not have the statutory authority to manage and invest funds on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>This situation is currently causing difficulties. These difficulties can be illustrated if I describe the situation which has arisen with the social insurance fund. The fund holds the proceeds of employer and employee social insurance contributions and is used to pay social insurance benefits. In previous years, the fund's income was not sufficient to cover the costs of these benefits and had to be subvented by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Due to the increase in employment and wages <Col N="1426" /> and the decrease in social insurance payments in recent years, there is currently a surplus in the social insurance fund. This surplus is projected to reach £630 million by the end of the year. The Minister for Finance is required to invest this surplus in certain authorised products. These include long-term bonds, short-term securities and cash accounts. However, the risk and investment management systems and skills effectively to manage such a large sum available to the Minister are in the NTMA. The issue is being resolved in the short term with the assistance of the NTMA through investment in NTMA Exchequer notes. This addresses the risk issue through utilisation of the agency's risk management systems. However, this approach is not sustainable in the long term, particularly as the volume of moneys involved increases. Additionally, it does not maximise the return on fund investments as it does not enable investment in higher yielding assets such as long-term bonds. The most sensible solution to this issue is to enable the NTMA to invest the fund directly, utilising the full range of authorised investment instruments, on behalf of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In short, this Bill addresses the anomaly whereby the Government's professional investment expertise which is concentrated in the NTMA cannot be utilised in the investment of Government funds. It enables the NTMA formally to provide a fund investment service where required. It will remain a matter for the Minister in each case to decide whether or not to avail of the service.</P>
    <P>The NTMA has, over the past five years, been involved in consultancy projects in Central and Eastern Europe, South America and Asia. In all cases work has been carried out for the ministries of finance in the respective countries. Apart from revenues generated, consultancy work has brought additional benefits to the agency in the form of broadening the skill base of its employees. However, the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990, does not formally include a provision to provide consultancy services to parties other than the Government. This Bill formally empowers the agency to undertake such assignments.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the main provisions of the Bill. Part 2 contains the provisions in relation to the State claims agency. In general, the NTMA will be empowered to manage personal injury and property damage compensation claims against the State, Government Departments, Ministers and the Attorney General, community and comprehensive schools and residential centres for young offenders. Claims against other bodies can be assigned to the agency in the future, if it is appropriate and cost effective to do so.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 define a number of key terms used in relation to the management of claims. Section 8 sets out the functions to be performed by the agency in relation to the management of claims and counterclaims. The agency will manage claims and counterclaims to ensure that the <Col N="1427" /> State's liability and associated legal and other expenses are contained at the lowest achievable level. The section also requires the agency to provide risk management advisory services. Where it considers it appropriate to do so, the agency may purchase insurance cover against certain insurable risks.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the delegation by Government order of the management of claims or classes of claims to the agency, at the request of Ministers. The section also contains a provision which would allow the Minister for Finance to direct the agency not to begin or to discontinue managing a claim. Such a direction would be made at the request of Ministers where the interests of the State so require.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the Attorney General's functions in relation to the management of claims by the agency in so far as his role as legal adviser to the Government is concerned. The agency will perform those functions on his behalf subject to the right of the Attorney General to receive such information as he requests from the agency and to give directions to the agency, where the interests of the State so require. Such directions may include one directing the agency not to begin, or to discontinue, managing a claim. A direction to that effect will, however, lapse after 30 days unless a direction from the Minister for Finance is given or a delegation order is revoked by that date. The Attorney General may also give general guidelines to the agency.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the establishment by the Minister of a policy committee which will advise the agency on policy and procedures relating to its claims management and risk management functions. Section 15 provides that the Minister for Finance may issue directions and guidelines to the agency in relation to the performance of its claims management functions.</P>
    <P>Section 16 sets out the arrangements which will apply in relation to the payment of settlement amounts or awards due to claimants and to the payment of fees to professional and other experts. The agency will make such payments out of advances from the Post Office Savings Bank fund and will subsequently recoup the amounts involved from the Departments and offices. The Post Office Savings Bank fund is an extra budgetary account of the Minister. It is used primarily to hold and invest the deposits received from the Post Office Savings Bank, but it is also used as an intermediary through which the NTMA conducts certain debt management activities with the markets. It provides a ready-made vehicle for the funding of settlements and the payments of fees.</P>
    <P>Part 3 contains the provisions in relation to the central treasury services. Central treasury services are defined as the taking of deposits from and the making of advances to local authorities, health boards, vocational education committees and other non-commercial State bodies. These other bodies may be prescribed by order.</P>
    <P>Section 20 authorises the Minister to provide <Col N="1428" /> central treasury services to non-commercial State bodies and also provides that such bodies may choose to avail of the service at their own discretion. Section 23 enables the Minister to delegate the operation of the central treasury service to the NTMA while section 25 provides that the Minister may issue directions or guidelines to the NTMA in relation to its performance of the function.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that the central treasury service will operate on the Post Office Savings Bank fund. As with the settling of claims by a State claims agency, the fund provides a ready-made vehicle through which central treasury services can be provided.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides that vocational education committees may place funds with more than one financial institution and also utilise the central treasury service. At present, vocational education committees are precluded from banking with more than one bank which prevents them from seeking the best value available on surpluses which may arise on their accounts from time to time.</P>
    <P>The provisions in relation to the fund investment service are set out in Part 4 of the Bill. Funds invested by the Minister and funds invested by other Ministers are dealt with separately. Section 28 provides that funds invested by the Minister for Finance may be delegated to the agency by ministerial order. Section 29 provides that the NTMA may act as an agent of another Government Minister in the performance of his or her investment functions under terms and conditions agreed between the Minister and the agency.</P>
    <P>The NTMA was established in 1990 as an innovative solution to a particular problem which existed at that time. In the performance of its primary task of debt management the agency has developed a number of competencies and skills which can be usefully employed to the Exchequer's advantage in other areas. This Bill allows the NTMA to build on the strengths it already possesses as a debt management agency and to use its expertise to provide further financial and risk management services to the State. I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. It is not often that two items of legislation pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas side by side concerning the same agency. This has happened with the National Treasury Management Agency &ndash; last week we dealt with the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill which has the NTMA as the manager of the fund and today we are dealing with legislation which sets out to radically expand the role of the NTMA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State stated in his speech, the NTMA was set up in 1990 to manage the national debt. This was done at a time when the management of the national debt was a significant issue for the Government. At that time the <Col N="1429" /> debt to GNP ratio was in excess of 120% and rising annually as public sector deficits were large. Financial markets were a lot less benign than today, interest rates were very high and there was much greater volatility on currency markets.</P>
    <P>The management of the national debt was a primary consideration of the State's economic policy. The objective of transferring responsibility for managing the national debt from the Department of Finance and central Government to the newly established NTMA was to concentrate expertise in the new agency, attract additional expertise from the private sector and bypass the State's salary structure. The going rate for the relevant expertise in the financial market was substantially above pay levels in the State sector at that time. As well as managing the national debt the NTMA was given responsibility for managing the State's savings products. An example of these was the saving certificates that were sold through the post office system.</P>
    <P>The NTMA has done an excellent job in managing the national debt. I wanted to say that before Senator Ross arrives because he totally disagrees with that point of view. Although the national debt remains as high as ever in monetary terms, it has rapidly declined as a percentage of GNP, particularly in recent years as the economy has grown rapidly. The debt to gross domestic product ratio is forecast to reach 45% this year, almost one-third of what it was in the late 1980s. This improvement was achieved on the back of the recent boom and this significant reduction means that the Irish Republic has the fourth lowest debt to GDP ratio in the EU at present. This contrasts very favourably with the difficult days of the 1970s and 1980s when successive Governments borrowed funds in an attempt to spend their way out of recession. They were probably successful in doing that given the figures the Minister for Finance produced yesterday.</P>
    <P>It is now the intention under this Bill to extend the role of the NTMA to provide for the establishment of a State claims agency, a central treasury service and a fund investment service. The NTMA is a good place to vest the new responsibilities for a State claims agency. This is an opportune time to establish such an agency because this nation seems to be becoming very fond of litigation, not just at national level but at local level. I am sure the Cathaoirleach will agree with me on this point.</P>
    <P>This week Dublin Corporation is considering its estimates under some stress and it pains me that we must provide £6 million to meet compensation claims. This figure is substantially reduced from other years because the local authority has put in place a proactive unit to monitor and examine these claims. Local authorities are very anxious to provide better services for their communities but we are curtailed in doing so because we must pay outlandish sums in compensation. The Minister for Finance might take note of this and see if it is possible for the new agency which <Col N="1430" /> will look after State claims to take an interest in large claims made against local authorities.</P>
    <P>The main feature of this legislation is that section 8 imposes a mandate on the agency to contain claims. Up to now a large number of claims made against State agencies went to a full hearing. This is contrary to the practice in the private sector where claims are made against insurance companies and they are generally anxious to settle at an early stage. It is in the interest of the claimant and the person making the payment to settle early because it substantially reduces the cost and publicity involved.</P>
    <P>A very high percentage of State claims go to trial. One of the reasons for this is that the heads of Departments, against whom the claims are lodged, are very reluctant to settle because they are afraid to do so without the protection of the courts. The setting up of the new agency will get over this difficulty as the agency will take the responsibility for the settlement of claims. The agency already has the financial expertise. It can make actuarial estimates and decide when is the best time to settle and what are the most suitable terms. In the long term most claims must be settled on a legal basis. I am sure that the agency will have to recruit experienced barristers and solicitors to assist it in this type of work. Am I correct in understanding that litigants who do not wish to accept the decision and offer made by the agency have the right to go to the High Court with their claim?</P>
    <P>Quite a number of class actions have been taken against the State. For example, the Army deafness claims. There is a possibility that legal action will be taken by adults who were abused while they were in the care of the State as children. The State will now be in a better position to redress these claims and any claims brought against it. The present arrangements for handling claims against the State are totally unsatisfactory. The proposals made in this legislation will put in place a structured and coherent response to meet these claims.</P>
    <P>I agree with giving the NTMA the additional role of a fund investment service. The most obvious recipient of this service is the management of the social insurance fund. I was surprised, like many other Senators, to find out that this fund now has a surplus of £630 million. It would have been an ideal fund to invest in the new pensions fund initiated by the Minister. However, I accept that he gave coherent reasons on Second Stage why this should not happen.</P>
    <P>It is right that the NTMA should be given the role of managing surplus funds in the insurance fund and any other funds that may be available to the State. Also included are any surplus funds that local authorities may have. I very much doubt that local authorities have surplus funds to invest to that degree.</P>
    <P>In the area of cash management, local authorities have a very good working relationship with their banks and are very active in the management of their own cash flow arrangements. A <Col N="1431" /> survey carried out a few years ago indicated that local authorities were conducting this business very efficiently and there was no need for another agency to become involved in this activity.</P>
    <P>Currently, local authorities receive a very good discount rate in regard to the application by banks of commercial charges for the operation of their accounts. It could be expected that the full rate of charges would be applied if the cash management role of local authorities were transferred to the NTMA. The centralisation of this function would remove another independent function of local authorities and contribute to a lessening of local democracy. There is no justification for giving this role to the NTMA, unless it is done on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>With these reservations, I welcome the principle of this Bill. It is long overdue and I am pleased we are discussing it today. It makes a great deal of sense and will allow matters to be managed in a more organised fashion in future. I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I commend the Bill, which is an endorsement of, and a vote of confidence in, the National Treasury Management Agency. This fortnight two pieces of legislation have come before this House to extend the powers, responsibilities and scope of the services provided by the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
      <P>The agency was set up in 1990 to deal with the particularly severe national debt we had at that time. Irrespective of the criticism levelled at the agency last week in this House, I feel it has done an excellent job over the years. I appreciate that the criticism was not voiced by the Opposition spokesman on finance, Senator Joe Doyle, but by another Senator. The agency has been a success. Europe is envious of our present debt ratio. This Bill is a vote of confidence in that agency, and the increased scope of its services is welcome.</P>
      <P>The Bill covers three areas which give new powers to the agency. The State claims agency, a new facility being provided for in the Bill, is welcome. We now live in a claims culture where litigation is the order of the day. It is appropriate to centralise our response. However, we must also protect the public right to claim against the State if it has in any way wronged or injured one of its citizens. I understand that right to go to the courts is enshrined in this Bill, which I would like the Minister to confirm in his response.</P>
      <P>Recent times have seen massive claims against the State, which I believe will continue in the future. That is now the frame of mind of the country and there will be an increase rather than a reduction in the number of claims against the State. The processing of these claims has become extremely costly. This measure is an important one and will prove to be beneficial. The National Treasury Management Agency is the right body to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> Last week we gave the NTMA another vote of confidence by handing it a £5 billion pension fund to manage on behalf of the State. Irrespective of what was said here last week, I believe the agency has the expertise to do that. That was confirmed today by the Minister &ndash; although it was, perhaps, not confirmed last week &ndash; when he said it is already providing consultancy services outside the State and that its services have been availed of by ministers and departments of finance around the world.</P>
    <P>It was alleged here last week that it was a debt management agency and had no expertise in regard to investment. I do not believe that to be the case. The decision we took last week to make provision in law for the agency to deal with the reserve pension fund was an excellent one and I have no doubt it will do an excellent job.</P>
    <P>Today we are expanding the scope of the services of the NTMA even further. The first of those is a State claims agency, which is an important step. The facility to deal with the finances of local authorities, health boards and so on will bring competition into this area. At present, those bodies must deal directly with the banks. The local authority of which I am member sent a special resolution recently to the bank seeking better terms. We did not get better terms but we had nowhere else to go and had to take what was offered at that time. If a local authority is not satisfied with its bank it can now go to this agency, but there is no compulsion on it to avail of these services. That also applies to health boards and designated non-commercial State bodies. That is an important area of loan facility and finance management.</P>
    <P>I had not thought much about the area of investment by Departments. However, I see that by the end of this year the social insurance fund will have a credit balance of approximately £630 million. There was a need for a tier of this agency to deal with such a large investment, which will probably increase.</P>
    <P>It is an endorsement of our public finances that we have reached a situation where the social insurance fund will have a credit balance by the end of the year of £630 million. Who would have thought ten years ago that that would be the case? At that time, we were providing amounts from the Exchequer to supplement that fund. We are now in a situation where we can invest the contributions of employers and employees, through this agency, for the future needs of the citizens in such areas as disability payments, unemployment benefit and so on.</P>
    <P>This is an important day in the management of this country's financial services. The decision taken in 1990 was an important one and has proved very successful. This agency is now moving forward, on an incremental basis of confidence, on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>This Bill has provision for those three matters to which I referred. The consultancy services the agency is providing will expand dramatically, with the extension of its powers under this Bill. Its <Col N="1433" /> expertise might not be known internationally, as it might have been perceived as a debt management agency. However, the fact that we have shown confidence in it by handing it the pension reserve fund last week and are giving it responsibility in this Bill under the three headings I mentioned will send the right signals on behalf of the agency, both nationally and internationally.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the National Treasury Management Agency on the excellent work it has done on behalf of the country over the past ten years. It has the expertise to go forward under the new responsibilities given to it. I have every confidence that it will deliver and save the nation, including many State bodies, local authorities and health boards. I commend the Bill and thank the Minister of State for introducing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. I am in favour of one part of the Bill, but am opposed to another part. I disagree with the notion of making the National Treasury Management Agency the State claims agency. There is no evidence that the NTMA has any relevant experience in the field of dealing with claims against the State. The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, said a more business-like approach to the settlement of genuine claims is desirable in the interests of claimants and in securing lower costs in the long run and that the Bill would achieve these objectives. I doubt if that will be achieved here.</P>
      <P>The extent to which the Minster for Finance is an NTMA fan is an urban legend. If there is a need for a State claims agency &ndash; perhaps regrettably there is &ndash; a small dedicated unit of relevant professionals is called for. To make an analogy with the Roman emperor Caligula, who made his horse a consul, the thinking appears to be that because there is the NTMA the State claims agency should be included under its remit. A unit should be established for the purpose of claims handling and it should be disbanded as soon as it is no longer necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Ross in that I am prepared to believe that the NTMA has done an excellent job since it was established. While it may be excessively concerned with blowing its own trumpet &ndash; Senator Ross's point &ndash; it has a very good tune to play. However, whether it does <Col N="1434" /> its job well or badly, there is no doubt about the nature of the job, which is the treasury function of managing the funds to get the best return.</P>
    <P>The treasury function calls for highly specialised and extensive expertise. Therefore, it makes good sense to extend the scope of the NTMA to include all funds in the wider area of Government, rather than to merely manage the national debt, which was its original purpose. Shortly after I first became a Member of this House in 1993 I argued that we should turn over the then huge debt of NET to the NTMA in the interests of having it professionally managed. Had that been done the State would have saved an enormous amount of money. Even today we are still not finished picking up the pieces from NET.</P>
    <P>It is not a leap to extend the function of the NTMA from managing the national debt to providing similar treasury services to a whole range of other public bodies. It is a slightly bigger leap to give to the NTMA the management role on the national pensions reserve fund, although it is one that can be made. Arguably the NTMA's expertise is in managing bonds rather than equities.</P>
    <P>However, I draw back in horror by the size of the leap involved in giving the NTMA the powers to become the State claims agency. Nothing in the history of the organisation or in its expertise equips it to perform that role. The gap is too big to breach, no matter what the Minister may say. I am in favour of not multiplying the number of State bodies unnecessarily, but that should not extend to running together two bodies with two completely disparate functions. This is one case where we need horses for courses.</P>
    <P>The Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1998, was initiated in the Seanad where it passed all Stages in a businesslike manner. It was presented to the other House where it passed Second Stage and was then transferred to a legislative committee. The purpose of the Bill was to restrict the practice of solicitors touting for business for personal accident claims. It was agreed at the time this was the prime cause of the rising number of claims against the State.</P>
    <P>When I was at school I read about the <i>Marie Celeste,</i> a ship that disappeared in the oceans and was found empty. Nobody knew what happened to it. The Solicitors (Amendment) Bill disappeared after it was referred to committee. Yet, as this Bill demonstrates, the problem it sought to address has not gone away. This Bill focuses on settling claims whereas the previous legislation aimed to address the problem at its roots by ensuring that there was no encouragement to make claims. Does this mean the State has lost interest in trying to stem the number of claims and is resigned to being taken for a ride by whoever wishes to claim against it?</P>
    <P>It is interesting to contrast the fate of the two Bills. This Bill is being rushed through the legislative process and will probably be on the Statute Book next week, certainly before Christmas. The other Bill, which goes more to the root of the <Col N="1435" /> problem, continues to be in a legislative limbo more than two years after publication. While I welcome this Bill, I have grave doubts about the wisdom of including under the very efficient NTMA &ndash; I am sure Senator Ross disagrees &ndash; a national State claims agency. Let us think again on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance was not here. It was the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen. I am sick and tired of Bills being put through this House and Ministers being sent in here to baby-sit, which is what it is known as, the Members and Bills in this House. It is unfair on this House because this is the third time in a week this has happened on important Bills. It happened on the ICC Bank Bill last week when the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, was here, although the Bill did not emanate from his Department. It also happened on the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill last week when the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, was here, although that Bill did not come from his Department. He took Committee Stage, which is a matter of great detail. I am sick and tired of this happening.</P>
      <P>I do not blame the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, and he must not take it the wrong way. Perhaps it would be all right if this was the only time and there was an extraordinary and good excuse why the Minister for Finance is involved in other things, such as the budget, but he has two Ministers of State and neither of them can be in this House because they have more important things to do. The business of this House should be ordered when the Minister or Ministers of State can be here. It should not be ordered willy-nilly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a mild protest, I have no intention of contributing to this Bill now because I know there is no Minister here who is authorised to listen and take action on it. This will continue. While all <Col N="1436" /> Stages of the ICC Bank Bill were rushed through last week because there was an EGM the next day and it would be sold the following week, this Bill must go through for other reasons. I know that anything I say today will not carry any weight or make any difference and it will not persuade any Minister to amend it on Committee Stage or any other Stage. I am tired of it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to speak to a Bill when a Minister is here from the wrong Department. I realise it will be inevitable but it is time people outside this House realised it is being treated badly. Ministers are sent in here willy-nilly. It depends on who is available, not on who is suitable to take the Bill. I do not doubt that the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, would be capable of taking this Bill through the House. However, it is time we had the right Minister at the right time in the right place.</P>

      <P>On the question of whether the NTMA is the appropriate place in which to locate the State claims agency, Senator Quinn made the point that its expertise lies in the financial area and that it has no expertise in dealing with claims management. The same can be said of any other existing agency, which might be given a claims management function, or any newly established independent body. The NTMA's expertise is in the financial area, given that its main areas of activity are borrowing and debt management. However, as the Minister of State said in his speech, he has no doubt that the broad range of financial skills which the agency has built up, supplemented by the particular expertise which claims management requires, will enable the agency to perform this new function in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is here. The purpose of raising this matter on the Adjournment is to try to persuade him to find a different location for the 500 or 600 asylum seekers he intends to locate in the Mosney Holiday Centre. It is not a suitable centre for a number of reasons, particularly because it is the venue for the national Community Games. I, the Dublin Community Games, the national Community Games and many families who have used the centre for their holidays over the years regard the proposal as unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>This centre has been used for the Community Games national finals and for at least 40 sporting and cultural activities, under the auspices of the Dublin Community Games, in which thousands of children from County Dublin and Dublin City participate. Another centre would not be suitable for these activities. The thousands of children who participate annually in the Community Games stay in the holiday cabins. It is also the venue for many sporting and cultural activities. The Minister will deprive people of this venue for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>As well as being the venue for the Community Games, the Mosney venue is also used widely by families from Dublin, particularly from areas in my constituency on the north side of the city, and from the north east of the country, including Meath, Louth and north Dublin. It is also a common venue during the marching season in the North. Many families come down from the North during July and August, given that it is not a suitable location for families with young children at that time of the year. It serves a major function in that sense as a reasonable holiday home venue for thousands of working class children and families. That is the second reason the Minister should reconsider the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third reason he should reconsider the proposal is that he would be creating a degree of ghettoisation by housing large numbers of people together. This would effectively create the old concept of detention centre or remand centre. This is not the proper way to deal with the asylum seeker issue under best practice. It is certainly not acceptable to the Irish Refugee Council which <Col N="1438" /> has complained strongly about the proposal, as have those in charge of the Community Games. Amnesty International has spoken out against the proposal. There are many reasons we should seek an alternative venue.</P>
    <P>There is growing opposition to this proposal. I attended a meeting during the week organised by the managers of the Community Games. Large numbers of public representatives attended and they are launching a campaign to try to preserve the Mosney Holiday Centre as a venue for the Community Games. I do not know what assurances the Minister can give in relation to this matter. Perhaps there is a possibility of an alternative site. It would be better if the location could remain free to continue with the functions and activities for which it is currently used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Costello for giving me the opportunity to respond to this matter in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The number of asylum seekers entering the country has increased dramatically in recent years. The current rate of arrival is in excess of 1,000 per month and, on the basis of recent trends, it is anticipated that approximately 12,000 applications for asylum will be made this year &ndash; that was the figure I predicted almost a year ago. The significant increase in persons applying for refugee status has resulted in an acute shortage of accommodation in the greater Dublin area. At this point, the supply of accommodation in the greater Dublin area has been virtually exhausted. Apart from the shortage of accommodation in Dublin, it is not desirable from an integration point of view to have all asylum seekers located in the capital.</P>
      <P>In line with overall Government policy and allied to the lack of accommodation in the Dublin area, it is necessary to source suitable accommodation throughout the country on an ongoing basis. The alternative where asylum seekers would have to resort to sleeping on the street and in parks is simply unacceptable. In the longer term, my aim and that of the Government is to achieve a fair and balanced distribution of asylum seekers throughout the country. In the meantime, all suitable offers of accommodation are considered and where practical and feasible are brought into use.</P>
      <P>In line with this policy, the Directorate for Asylum Support Services, which is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers, has entered into an agreement with the proprietor of Mosney Holiday Centre following an approach by him for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services for asylum seekers on part of the holiday centre site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the House is aware that procuring accommodation for asylum seekers in the quantity required presents a huge challenge to the State. Essentially, this demand is driven by the numbers of persons who arrive on our shores to seek asylum, each of whom is entitled to the <Col N="1439" /> basic requirement of a roof over his or her head. There is no gainsaying that and, in the circumstances, it would have been most unwise of the directorate to spurn this offer of accommodation. The House will also be aware that the facility at Mosney was used to accommodate those who fled from part of the Six Counties in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</P>
    <P>It should not be assumed at this stage that the accommodation of asylum seekers on part of the site at Mosney and the holding of the ESB Community Games at Mosney cannot co-exist. The making available of any balance of the facilities on the site at Mosney to the ESB Community Games is a matter, in the first instance, for the proprietor. At their request, I am meeting representatives of the ESB Community Games today, 7 December, to explore with them what support I can give to facilitate the continuation of the games at Mosney.</P>
    <P>I am approaching this meeting with an open mind and I am anxious to explore any options that may exist in this respect. At the insistence of the directorate, a clause was inserted in the memorandum of agreement governing the use of Mosney which specifically allows for the use of <Col N="1440" /> the facility for special events such as the holding of the Community Games finals, subject to the agreement of the parties to the memorandum.</P>
    <P>I state categorically that the centre at Mosney is neither a remand nor a detention centre. We do not have detention or remand centres for asylum seekers. I stress that I cannot allow a situation where women and children must sleep on the streets. I must ensure that all asylum seekers are housed, and at times this is a very difficult task. People seem to underestimate the real difficulty in finding accommodation for 1,000 people per month. It is a very difficult task, one which causes a lot of administrative difficulties. However, I am pleased that we are coping.</P>
    <P>On criticisms by groups in relation to the Mosney option, I can say without fear or favour, whatever about people's criticisms, that I have done a lot more on behalf of asylum seekers than most of my critics.</P>
