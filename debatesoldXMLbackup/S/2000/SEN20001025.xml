      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline when he will publish and make available to the House his annual report on the operation of the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to expedite the provision of the new accommodation at Elphin post-primary school, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Leonard of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that a paediatrician is appointed to Monaghan General Hospital.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Glynn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to ensure that adequate training and educational outlets are provided to young people wishing to pursue a career in agriculture.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tom Hayes of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the situation in Mohober national school, County Tipperary, which urgently needs the building of an extension, <Col N="266" /> and to outline the progress of the application and confirm when the work will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Caffrey of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to outline whether any consideration has been given to the question of providing spur lines from the main transmission line of An Bord Gáis from Pollatomish to Galway, to the major towns in Mayo that are within a reasonable distance of the main line from the Corrib field.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senator Henry's and Senator Finneran's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 18, motion No. 29. No. 1, motion re Order of Business, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion re Freedom of Information Act, 1997, to be taken without debate; No. 3, motion re referral of Abbeylara report to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, to be taken without debate at 5 o'clock; No. 4, Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 2000, all Stages to be taken today with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 20 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes; No. 5, Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill, 2000, Committee and Remaining Stages to be taken today and No. 19, motion No. 26, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., with business to resume thereafter if not previously concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. With regard to No. 3 which is being referred to a committee, will the Leader ensure that the House will have an opportunity to debate the report of the committee when it is available?</P>
      <P>I think everybody would like to express their good wishes and congratulations to all the Irish athletes who took part in the Special Olympics, in particular those who won medals. All who participated have done the country proud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly proud as one of the gold medal winners comes from Bagenalstown, my home town. It is the first gold medal winner from Bagenalstown, but I am sure the precedent established will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, media handling of events has been very much in the limelight this week. There were two incidents, one which I will not talk about concerning the pretty disgusting article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, but freedom of speech, at least, is <Col N="267" /> also an important matter. The other was the judgment today in the Supreme Court which has ordered a retrial for the costs of a libel action. On a number of occasions we have had a debate on the media, their relationship with politics and the type of regime which should operate in the 21st century. I again ask the Leader for such a debate. Nothing much has happened as a result of the debates. Promises of change were made by the Minister but they have not yet happened. I would like an opportunity for a wide ranging debate on the media.</P>
    <P>A debate on Northern Ireland would be timely and is something all sides would welcome.</P>
    <P>Finally, Senator Norris asked for a debate on No. 18, motion 18. Following the example of the Deputy Leader last week, I will be pedantic and point out that it is No. 18 of the non-governmental motions on the Order Paper. A debate on standards in public life, funding of political parties, lobbyists and the issues which arise from this would be very useful. The motion is in the name of all party leaders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a difficulty with the Order of Business and am certainly not happy to take all Stages of No. 4. One of the main reasons for this is that I believe business was handled incorrectly and badly last week. We had plenty of time last week for business. We made the point last week that one week there is nothing planned while the following week we try to get everything shoved through. To make a point, I am not prepared to take No. 4 today, even though it may be practical to conclude consideration of it. It is not the way to do business. We said that as far as possible we would leave time between Second and Subsequent Stages of a Bill as a matter of practice, unless there was an extraordinary reason we had to push through all Stages. We have always been prepared to co-operate when there has been good reason. However, I am not prepared to co-operate following a day and a half last week when we did nothing, despite the fact people had their diaries arranged to do business.</P>
      <P>The reason I have no objection to taking No. 3 without debate is that the committees have the power of compellability which can require witnesses to attend and give evidence, and I accept this is the appropriate way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise two other issues. Perhaps the House could have a debate in the near future on the whole area of promotion, career prospects and pay of elected public representatives. I anticipate the publication of the Buckley report which is due and I would like to hear people on the record. As one who represents people and has to negotiate, I believe that people should be prepared for this one single fact of life, that nobody applauds when others get more money. When any report which proposes more is greeted with disdain in the media people should be prepared to deal with that and to make the arguments in public which they have been able to make in <Col N="268" /> private. Public representatives have nothing to hide in terms of their demands. It would be in order to make the case not in a whinging way but in a professional manner.</P>
    <P>I come to the main point I wish to make on which I would like a discussion. I have been inundated with letters in the past couple of days from teachers in special schools around the country who are absolutely appalled in trying to integrate into schools those with disabilities, a handicap and difficulties. Teachers were offended and humiliated by the language used in an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on Sunday last. While not wishing to open a debate on the <i>Sunday Independent </i>a number of points have to be made by public representatives. There is an issue here that needs to be stated about the accommodation of difference and the way we approach those who are less well off than ourselves in all walks of life. We need to look at that. It is cynical that a conditional apology is presented by the editor of that newspaper as an apology. It is no apology whatever. It is not accepted by those who work with these people. It is shameful and disgraceful. It has set the country back decades. I have rarely witnessed such anger among ordinary people trying to do an ordinary job. I hate raising this matter as it may appear I am getting on a bandwagon. I speak as one who represents professionals working in the field who are devastated by what has happened. If this is a cynical attempt by a newspaper to gain controversy and increase circulation, it is the lowest it has gone. People have been hurt and deeply offended by this article. It is important that public representatives say that.</P>

      <P>We are on the Order of Business. This is not an appropriate time to debate this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling. In the debate Senator Manning called for, in the whole area I would try to investigate whether we have possibly taken class action in favour of people with disabilities against that Sunday newspaper. They have all been hurt and humiliated and deserve damages. If it can be done it should be done. The paper should be buried for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business as outlined by the Leader is not acceptable to the Labour Party because of the referral of a motion to the European affairs committee without debate. He then listed three further items which are to be taken without debate and went on to say that all Stages of the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 2000, shall be taken today. That is no way to conduct business. There are ten or 12 Bills that have not been reached in the Dáil but have been passed by this House largely because they were rushed through. We could have spent a good deal more time discussing them at length because some of them were substantial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of those from the Senator's party are not often in the Seanad. The business is regulated to suit Members from that side of the House at times. We are taking three items without debate. I had understood that the item on the Freedom of Information Act which has been referred to the committee would be debated when it came back to this House. What we have got is a hotchpotch of issues, a list as long as your arm, that has been referred under the regulations to the committee to be discussed. It is back to us in the House, again in draft form, and we are not allowed debate it. How are we to operate the Freedom of Information Act if we get an incremental list that we cannot discuss? What is the purpose of this House if we simply rubber stamp motions coming before it, refer them to a committee and then refer them back to the Seanad? I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we take item 2 with debate. I agree with Senator Manning that when item 3 on the Abbeylara shooting comes back to this House we should have a debate on it. These are important issues and the House should not simply be a rubber stamp.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise one other question on legislation. The Leader indicated that a landlord and tenant Bill would come before the House at some stage. When can we expect it? Large numbers of people are being evicted from their homes. Today an auction was due to take place where 28 families were to be evicted on foot of two streets being sold off by public auction in my constituency. These people have absolutely no rights and would be put on the road, the local authority would have to deal with them and the landlord would dismiss them simply by going to the courts. Can the Leader give a clear indication as to when the landlord and tenant legislation will come into existence?</P>
      <P>In relation to the paralympics, I agree wholeheartedly with everything that has been said. The remarks in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> were absolutely scurrilous. We should all be proud of our para-athletes who succeeded in going to the Olympics as well as those who succeeded in winning gold, silver and bronze. As a nation we should not tolerate the type of approach which has been so easily presented in a widely read Sunday newspaper. I am unhappy with the late and conditional apology from the editor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we on this side of the House strongly endorse the remarks made by Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello with regard to the Special Olympics in Sydney and congratulate those who won medals as well as those who participated. It is probably a truer reflection of the proper Olympic spirit than the games that took place before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the remarks made in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> are totally unacceptable and have been shown to be so. Senator Farrell has been consistent over an extended period in asking for a debate on the media. Such a debate would be opportune now. Frequently in the media we get opinions rather than news. The <i>Sunday Independent</i> particularly has become virtually the Dublin opinion or some other person's opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much easier to enunciate opinions than to collect news. There has been a lamentable lapse from proper journalistic standards. Senator Manning made the point about freedom of speech and I do not disagree with that. Freedom of speech is essential in a democracy but editorial judgment is also essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It went from the norms that one would expect. These and other issues should be debated in the near future. Those who work in this area, the athletes, should be congratulated, particularly on a day on which the law has been enacted to ensure that people will not be discriminated against by virtue of gender, sexual orientation or disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last issue, as I am a journalist employed by the <i>Sunday Independent</i> I have a declarable interest here. I am without equivocation on the sentiments, the rhetoric, the language and everything to do with that article.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret it was published and that anybody could sincerely hold those views. I do not say this with any mandate but it reflects the vast majority of opinion of journalists in Ireland. I condemn it and I wish to put that on the record in case it is misread or misconstrued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader provide time for a debate on No. 18, motion 31, which Senator Norris and I tabled yesterday? Given the revelations in CIE over the past week we should debate the system of political appointments to semi-State bodies. This is a running sore which has been abused by successive Governments for a long time. It is appropriate that all parties should now debate this in a sober atmosphere to put an end to the <Col N="271" /> abuse of political appointments to semi-State bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having consistently appealed to the Tánaiste on the Order of Business in regard to the groceries order I congratulate her on yesterday's announcement to retain it and, therefore, the ban on below cost selling. I believe it could be of huge benefit to many small shops and supermarkets in rural constituencies such as Limerick West.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader schedule a debate on FÁS with particular emphasis on community employment schemes? I recently discovered that personal assistants to people with physical and sensory disabilities must leave such schemes after three years. They gain invaluable training during that period and develop great one to one relationships with the people for whom they care. I call on the Tánaiste to come into the House to debate the matter with a view to extending the period for personal assistants on such schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the conviction with which everybody has distanced themselves from the article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. We are all great at shouting but there is still no intercom on the DART for the visually impaired and I will not even go into the details of my efforts to get a place for an autistic child. Despite all the protestations he still has not been placed.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader obtain information by tomorrow as to whether there are contingency plans if the proposed firefighters strike takes place in Dublin on Halloween? Has anybody thought through the ramifications of that? It is unbelievable that Dublin will only be provided with emergency cover. I call for the defence of Dublin. Halloween is a nightmare in my area. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should make a statement in this regard because it is important.</P>

      <P>I have an interest to declare as a director of Independent Newspapers Limited. I support Senator Manning's plea for a debate on the media. I endorse every word that has been uttered, particularly by Senator Ross, who speaks for me in this matter. I share the anger of Senator O'Toole and I also support the words of Senator Dardis. What was written was indefensible. It was indecent, hurtful and should not have been written or published. I know that my views are shared by my colleagues on the board of Independent Newspapers Limited and, in particular, by the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have the highest regard for paralympians. They epitomise the true olympian De Coubertin spirit of competing. Far more is required of them in terms of human courage, application and suffering than of ordinary athletes and we have the highest admiration for them. Like Senator O'Toole I also feel for the people who work in this field. I have been in this field most of my life <Col N="272" /> and have been working towards normalisation and bringing people into the community so that they can display their abilities to the full. I glory when they do so and I deeply regret that they should have been offended. I wrote a review in the same newspaper last Sunday and I feel besmirched by the entire matter.</P>

      <P>This is an historic day and, consequently, I congratulate and compliment the Tánaiste for heeding the unanimous view of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, as embodied in No. 18, motion 6, which states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann supports the retention of the Groceries Order, because of the stability it has generated since its introduction in 1987 in providing a fair trading environment for all practitioners in the grocery trade, in having consistently delivered on low prices, quality stores, consumer choice, and in ensuring that food inflation has been lower than general inflation and indeed lower than the U.K. or the average E.U. inflation rate.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, as spokesperson for my party on disabilities I wonder if you would give me the opportunity to register my outrage at the appalling and demeaning comments that were published in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. Only last week Senator Ó Murchú condemned the portrayal of the tragedy in Kilkenny by the media. Following the conditional apology this morning by the editor of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, I hope the journalist concerned will take the opportunity next Sunday to make a full and frank apology for her comments. Should similar reporting continue, perhaps the agencies of Government and particularly the Minister for Health and Children could consider withholding the finance which is so readily given to this newspaper for advertising on a weekly basis.</P>

      <P>The reason I object is that the Order of Business is not kept to 30 minutes. Last week it was two hours, partly because of all the obituaries that were mixed up in it. That must be looked at. The Order of Business is the most vital part of the day very often if we are honest and admit and accept that. If one has constituents coming in this is what we like to think they come in for because there is energy and a full House and substantial, important issues are raised. Perhaps it needs to be looked at in a different way but I do not agree to curtailing it and I wish to place that on the record.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if my colleague, Senator Costello, formally moved an amendment and I hope he did. If so, I shall second it.</P>
      <P>I am also happy that my colleague, Senator O'Toole, confronted the question of the remuneration of employees of this House, including Senators. This is timely because it is lamentable that people who served for 14 years and participated in four elections leave with a measly pension of £5,500 a year before tax. How realistic is that in the marketplace? We should be up front and put on the record what we consider is appropriate. If we are professional politicians, we are entitled not only to criticism from the public, which we receive, but also to remuneration for the work we do.</P>

      <P>&mdash;the language in particular was spectacularly offensive, ill-bred and badly chosen. To describe citizens of Ireland as cripples shows, in my opinion, that the journalist involved is semi-literate and 50 years out of date with the thinking of the people, who gave their answer. I heard the partial apology and it fascinated me that the editor appeared not to realise the offence that had been given until the people rang in in their thousands. I wonder about his judgment. There was also the pathetic excuse that it had stirred up a debate and there would now be a real debate about disability. That would excuse Julius Streicher and his anti-Semitic newspapers in the Third Reich.</P>
      <P>However, if we are serious about the handicapped and people in wheelchairs, why is it that Members based in what is known throughout the Oireachtas as &ldquo;the bunker&rdquo; could not receive a person in a wheelchair in our offices? It is like snakes and ladders; it is necessary to turn left and right and go up and down stairs. Nobody could get in and if we are serious let us do something about it.</P>

      <P>I was not particularly hurt by what was said in the newspaper because I was playing in a competition 25 years ago where a lady was marching up and down in front of us. We were sitting outside and eventually somebody who knew her came along and asked her if she was going to play golf. She said &ldquo;no&rdquo; but that she had brought her son to play a game. However, she said he could not get out because &ldquo;all those cripples are out there&rdquo;. People with handicaps hear the rough end.</P>
      <P>I blame the editor and sub-editor because the buck stops with them. However, they are only interested in the big bucks that they get. Regardless of whether one is in a wheelchair or a trapeze artist, one has feelings. One's father, mother, brothers, sisters and children who go to school also have feelings. The media has said harsh things about politicians, priests, football managers and many others. However, nobody appears to have taken any heed of it. People only heed when it hits a particularly sore spot, but all people are equal. We all have feelings.</P>
      <P>The way the media has attacked families and individuals over the past ten years is scandalous and I call for a debate on the media and the right to privacy. At present, the media is a Frankenstein gone out of control. However, they are thin skinned because when a famous presenter on RTÉ was criticised, he got very annoyed and threatened legal action. However, when somebody asked him about the way he interviewed politicians, he said they were only robust interviews. It was a robust interview when he was putting in the boot, but when somebody put the boot into him, legal proceedings were threatened.</P>

Even in the Abbeylara case, there was no regard for the family or children going to school. The media has no regard for people because they are now controlled by big business operators such as Smurfit's and others in England. They are only interested in creating a product that will sell the paper and make money. I want a full debate on the right to privacy and the media.</P>

      <P>In deference to the Cathaoirleach's plea not to indulge in debate, I wish to make one point. When a debate is held, I hope there will be a positive response from the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children regarding the full integration of people with disabilities into the mainstream education system. A case which upsets me enormously involves a first year student in a third <Col N="276" /> level institute whose parent must travel with him. The parent has had to go with him since college started two months ago to act as his scribe. When a request was made to the Department, they were told that the money for such facilities is gone.</P>
      <P>Given that the Equal Status Act came into operation today, surely we should think positively and work towards the resolution of those problems which involve minute financial sums but which mean so much to people with disabilities. There should not only be a debate but positive action, in financial terms if possible, to ensure inequalities does not arise.</P>

      <P>As I raised this matter last week, I hope the Cathaoirleach will allow me to make a point about it. The comments of Senator Maurice Hayes are particularly gracious and sincere. One would expect that from him and his comments are particularly welcome because of his position. The matter I raised last week related to the<i> Sunday Independent</i> and its distasteful treatment of a tragic family even before the funerals had been completed. I would have liked an apology in that particular case as well.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that in this case the <i>Sunday Independent</i> has reached another new low. Obviously, sections of the media are intent on pushing out the boundaries to include what is unacceptable in a caring and just society. It is not enough at this stage to get an apology because, first, the apology was conditional. I am worried, however, that is all that will happen. I do not wish to focus specifically on the <i>Sunday Independent </i>which has done good work.</P>

Senator Cregan praised the Tánaiste earlier and she deserves praise for her ruling on the groceries order.

      <P>I bow to your judgment, a Chathaoirligh, in not continuing the debate on the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. Last week I raised the question of the lack of editorial control in Sky Television concerning the rail crash. I also mentioned the low standards which newspapers &ndash; particularly the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Examiner</i>&ndash; used in a serious matter, that is the tragedy in Kilkenny. I accept what has been said here today by the journalist and director from the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. It is admirable that they said they would not abide by the decision of the editor to publish that article. It is about time Mr. Tony O'Reilly got off the fence. He is the chairman of that newspaper and keeps saying that he does not get involved in editorial matters in his newspapers. Given this and other recent instances, it is about time he, as chairman of that company, got off the fence. He is involved both in newspaper production and in getting the profits out of the company. Profits are what the game is about, and I have no objection to him making profits. The people who brought the Paralympics to Australia attracted more than one million people to see those games. In this instance, since Mr. O'Reilly is involved in newspapers in Australia, it should be pointed out to the Australian media that he is also the chairman of the newspaper which has gone so far out on a limb in denigrating everybody and everything involved in the Paralympics.</P>

The Bill, however, comprises a single amendment to existing legislation, the purpose of which is to increase the budget of the Irish Film Board from £30 million to £70 million. I appeal to members of the Opposition to allow the Bill to go through in one sitting. The growth and development of the film industry requires the passage of this legislation without delay. It would be a good idea if at a later stage we could arrange a wider debate on issues relating to the film industry.

Having listened to my colleague, Senator Kiely, I am totally confused. I am not sure if he announced that the gas pipeline will go through Donegal, because he mentioned Donegal when he spoke. I would like the debate to be widened. Perhaps the Minister for Public Enterprise or the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources could address the House during a general debate on this matter.</P>
      <P>I do not see why the line could not be extended to Sligo. There is a proposal to bring a line from Belfast to Derry for Coolkeeragh power station. It would be very simple to link the two lines which would mean that we in Donegal who are always left out would be included.</P>

    <P>Senators O'Toole, Henry and Quill raised No. 4. It has not been my practice to take all Stages of a Bill and to request the approval of the House for such on the Order of Business. However, this is very short legislation of two sections, as Senator Quill stated, which will increase the expenditure limit of the Irish Film Board from £30 million to £80 million. I am allowing 20 minutes for spokespersons, 15 minutes for other Senators. Time will not be curtailed and we can return after 8 p.m. to continue the debate. As Senator Quill also said, if the Seanad deems it necessary, I will allow time for the Minister to come here to listen to the statements and hear the views of Senators on how they believe the industry should be geared for the future given the ten or 15 year plan the Government is examining at present.</P>
    <P>Many Senators, especially Senators O'Toole and Norris, called for a debate on the promotion, pay and career prospects of public representatives. This is very worthwhile. As Senator Norris said, when a person can serve here for 20 years and only have a £5,500 pension there is something radically wrong; it is wrong at the top in the Department of Finance, with the Minister and with the Government. Everyone on all political sides charged with this has erred. I hope the Government rewards and remunerates with courage the work done in the name of Ireland by the <Col N="282" /> Dáil and Seanad. Anyone who has served a company and contributed to it having the same achievements and track record this nation has had since 1987 because of the work of all political parties who participated in Government &ndash; the world has seen the success Ireland enjoys under its Legislature &ndash; would have a pension by now on which he or she could retire. I sincerely hope this happens in the Buckley report. It is long beyond the time for it to happen and it should have happened long ago. In the words of the late Paudge Brennan, it is never the wrong time to do the right thing and I hope this is the right time.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Order of Business last week that the Whips were to meet on a certain issue. The Government Whip informed me that he waited for a long time and the Opposition Whips did not turn up. Perhaps this can be rectified after the Order of Business and I ask the leaders to ensure it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Second Stage of the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 2000, initiated in the Seanad, and I look forward to listening with interest to the views of the Senators.</P>
      <P>It is a short Bill with a simple purpose. As is the general rule with statutory bodies which receive public funding, a ceiling is set by statute on the cumulative capital outlay, commitments and liabilities which the body may incur. This ceiling governs the allocation made to the body during the annual Estimates process. It is the means by which the Oireachtas ensures that the operations of such bodies will be reviewed in the Houses every four to five years.</P>
      <P>Three years ago, I introduced the Irish Film Board Bill, 1997, to increase the ceiling from £15 million to £30 million. It is a measure of the greatly increased activity of the board in this quickly developing industry that this ceiling will be reached before the end of this year. This provides tangible evidence of strong Government commitment to the development of a vibrant film making sector. It is my firm intention to accelerate still further the pace of development by providing substantially increased resources for the board in the coming years. Accordingly, the Bill proposes to raise the ceiling on authorised issues from £30 million to £80 million &ndash; an increase of £50 million.</P>
      <P>Recognising the growing importance of the creative audiovisual production sector for our cultural expression and economic prosperity, I established the Film Industry Strategic Review Group in 1998, under the chairmanship of Mr. Ossie Kilkenny, to review progress in the sector and make recommendations for its further development as we face into the early years of this new millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group submitted its report in August 1999. It recommended a strengthened, <Col N="285" /> broadened, restructured Bord Scannán na hÉireann to address the cultural and new strategic goals of the industry. The key focus areas for the board identified by the Kilkenny report in its recommendations were script development; development and production finance; strategic business development; generic marketing of Irish films, cinema going and video rentals and the marketing and promotion of Ireland as a film location; training and development; production expertise; technological policy, development and foresight and co-ordination with the television broadcasting sector.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, following Government approval of a strategic plan for the industry, closely based on the conclusions of the report, I instigated within my Department a review of the Irish Film Board to determine the resources of personnel, current funding and organisation required by the board to take on the expanded scope recommended for it in the strategy group report.</P>
    <P>My Department engaged Olsberg SPI, in conjunction with BDO Simpson Xavier, to review the organisation and management of the board. They reported in August of this year, whereupon I invited Mr. Kilkenny, who had earlier been appointed by me to the position of chairman of the Irish Film Board, to draw up a plan of action based on the strategy review group's recommendations and taking into account the report of the management consultants.</P>
    <P>The board is now finalising its plan which will take into account my comments here in the Seanad. I am confident that this plan will be soundly based. It will plot the course the board will follow over the next five years to deliver the driving force which will push the industry forward into a new and more mature phase of expansion, creativity and commerciality in this new decade.</P>
    <P>Of necessity, in the first phase of development of the sector there was a particular emphasis on attracting substantial international productions to use Ireland as a location for their filming. Such productions play a very important role in sustaining the viability of the production infrastructure and developing the skills base because clearly, at this stage of its development, indigenous based production would not have been capable of sustaining the scale or volume of maturity necessary to underpin the infrastructure and skills which are essential to the industry.</P>
    <P>While incoming productions will continue to form a vital element of our industry and will contribute to its further growth, the time is now ripe to look to a scaling up of our domestic production companies. To help in the achievement of this, the Government is fostering a favourable environment for long-term business planning and investment in the industry.</P>
    <P>During the 1990s the task was to build a film production infrastructure here in Ireland, an infrastructure of skills, facilities and creative talent. Starting from a very low base of production at the beginning of the 1990s, Ireland now has the <Col N="286" /> highest <i>per capita</i> output of feature films in the European Union, and ranks fourth internationally in attracting inward investment for film production.</P>
    <P>What, then, is lacking? The creative audiovisual content sector is undergoing a period of rapid change and developments in response to the advent and ongoing application of digital technologies. To become effective players in the evolving digital marketplace, while continuing to gain strength in the enduring media of cinema and television, companies here in Ireland will need to grow and consolidate. With our pool of increasingly experienced and self-confident talent, the time has come for an increased measure of business discipline and planning. Indeed, the &ldquo;flowering of our culture&rdquo; in the audiovisual media during this new decade will depend on the emergence of strong, creative, strategically managed companies which can build and attract the capital resources to develop and produce slates of projects, including long running television series, which will appeal to global markets.</P>
    <P>In the digital age, it is now widely recognised that &ldquo;content is king&rdquo;, that quality audiovisual content is crucial for competitiveness. Supporting the development of creative skills and production capability is a vital counterpoint to the development of the digital technology and telecommunications industry in Ireland and on the promotion of Ireland abroad.</P>
    <P>Audiovisual production is the most powerful means of bringing Irish culture and creativity to global audiences, generating an awareness of and interest in Ireland and our culture. This is of particular importance for a country such as ours, which has a vast international diaspora, generating a worldwide sense of Irish cultural identity. It is also a key complement to our international trade promotion and marketing of Ireland and our development of businesses based on intellectual property, an important element in the modern world economy.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that all EU countries recognise the importance of this sector by strongly supporting their audiovisual production sector. Indeed, the EU Commission recognises the special cultural significance of creative audiovisual production, and in its state aid rules allows more generous support to this sector than to other industrial sectors.</P>
    <P>The Government's position, therefore, is that the audiovisual production industry is to be assigned a central place in Ireland's industrial policy through co-ordinated commitment by the industrial agencies of the State in conjunction with the Irish Film Board to the development of the industry and, in particular, to fostering strong indigenous companies in this sector. We are entering a new phase of opportunity and potential for this increasingly important sector with a diversification of the distribution channels, the potential for the emergence of global niche markets and increased competition to win audiences. While all this comes within the statutory scope of <Col N="287" /> the Film Board Acts, 1980 to 1997, which legislation was broadly and comprehensively drafted, it nonetheless represents a major new direction for the board's operations. The board's five year plan, Strategy and Structure 2001-2005, sets out clearly how the board proposes to respond to this challenge.</P>
    <P>A key role of the board in fostering an environment for growth will be to bring together and act as a facilitator to optimise the impact of all the agencies of the State which make inputs into the development of this sector. Now that a clear Government endorsed strategic plan is in place, it is important to ensure that all relevant resources of the State operate in concert to achieve the realisation of that plan. This will require liaison at top executive level in the organisations concerned to co-ordinate support for the sector.</P>
    <P>Beyond this, there will be significant changes in the board's emphasis. First, there will be increased commitment to enhancing the development process. Development is a critical phase in which many of the key creative and business decisions must be taken, decisions which will in great measure determine the market potential of the project. The board will be striving, through financial support for development, to encourage companies to develop beyond the &ldquo;subsistence&rdquo; mode of operation where, at any given time, they have only one project on hand whether at the development, production or market phase. What is needed, and what the board plans to support out of its enhanced financial allocation, is companies to develop slates of projects &ndash; usually three to five projects &ndash; so that development as well as production becomes an ongoing function. The board's crucial role in nurturing new talent and creative originality will mean that support for the development of individual projects will continue to be an important component of its development loans scheme.</P>
    <P>There will also be closer integration of training in script writing and the development of scripts with the development support which will be provided by the board. This will increase our capacity to produce excellent scripts which can appeal to the international markets upon which our indigenous industry is ultimately dependent.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the second change of emphasis which will take place in the board's policies. The board will place greater emphasis on the commercial potential of the projects which it supports, seeing them as the basis for helping businesses to grow and their potential to contribute to the achievement of the company's business plan. Our capacity to develop and express our culture and creativity in the audiovisual media is dependent upon our doing so in a way that can appeal to wider audiences. Audiovisual production is highly capital intensive and, therefore, must have regard to the market. State aids, such as section 481 and the Irish Film Board schemes, are intended to facilitate growth and consolidation of companies <Col N="288" /> and the parallel development of a pool of professional business and production skills. If they operate merely to enable the perpetual extension of a subsistence mode of production, these resources are being dissipated and there is ultimately no value added in terms of company or industry growth.</P>
    <P>Every company which applies for support from the board should have a strategic business plan. This does not mean that only larger companies can prosper in this industry but that every company should have properly thought through what goals it seeks to achieve, what partners it needs to achieve these goals and the timeframe for their achievement. Practical advice and assistance can be organised to help companies to develop their strategic thinking and plans.</P>
    <P>At this point I wish to refer to the important issue of funding to support the training needs of the film and television production sector. Up to the end of 1999, the European Social Fund co-funded the operations of Screen Training Ireland to the tune of 75%, the balance of 25% being provided by the Irish Film Board. Screen Training Ireland operates under the aegis of FÁS which itself supplemented the overall figure from its own training resources. Now, however, the ESF funding is no longer available for film training.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I have provided additional resources to the Irish Film Board to ensure the continuation of the vital training inputs necessary for the development and expansion of the industry. This also constitutes capital expenditure by the board. In providing these funds for training to Screen Training Ireland and, in accordance with my strategic policy for the industry, I expect the Irish Film Board to ensure, in close liaison with FÁS, that the training being delivered is consistent with the strategic needs of the industry.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with the question of how the Screen Commission function of the board will operate within the new strengthened board. The Screen Commission of Ireland became operational in 1998 as soon as funding became available through approval by the EU Commission for the reinvestment of a portion of the Irish Film Board's recoupment of its loans in the funding of the Screen Commisison. It was set up on a pilot basis under the direction of a voluntary panel of industry experts. To give the commission a statutory basis for its business it was constituted as a statutory committee of the Irish Film Board.</P>
    <P>The original conception and remit of the Screen Commission was that it would operate with a high degree of independence from the Irish Film Board and it established a separate identity, executive and office. At that time it was felt that the functions of the Screen Commission did not overlap with those of the Irish Film Board and needed to be discrete and distinct from the board's established functions. Whereas the film board's focus was on the fostering of indigenous projects and talent, the focus of the Screen Com<Col N="289" /> mission was seen as being to bring mobile international projects to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Screen Commission tackled this brief with commendable professionalism and enthusiasm. Ireland was represented by the commission at the major locations, expositions and principal film markets in Europe and north America and, in addition, participated with Irish producers in trade missions to Australia and Canada. Through Irish participation in these events, several projects either came to Ireland or seriously considered Ireland as a location and business contacts were established.</P>
    <P>However, in light of the film industry strategic review group's report, which recommends an enhanced central co-ordinating role for the film board, and the recommendation of the consultants' report on the organisation of the extended film board, it is now rational that strategically the Screen Commission function should be co-ordinated under the film board itself. Furthermore, the distinction originally envisaged between indigenous and incoming productions is much less clear in practice than in theory, particularly in the case of co-productions involving a substantial Irish financial and management input into the project, as is the case in many European co-productions. This year Ireland ratified the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production and already there are several co-productions in the pipeline for Ireland under the convention.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it has now been decided to reposition the Screen Commission function. It is envisaged that the chief executive of the Screen Commission will now report directly to the board and will work in close liaison and co-ordination with the Bord Scannán team. I have no doubt that the board will give careful consideration to the question of how best to build on the brand identity, connections and goodwill which have been built up by the Screen Commission so that these can be exploited to the full in achieving the board's overall strategic objectives.</P>
    <P>I greatly appreciate the expertise, commitment and considerable time that the members of the Screen Commission have given to their task. Their knowledge of the industry and their prestige has enabled the pilot period of the commission's operation to be an important learning experience and a fruitful one. The Irish film industry has reason to be grateful for the exceptional commitment of those who give so generously of their time in the various boards, panels, professional associations, committees and policy groups which have steered and guided Ireland's maturing industry since the start of the 1990s. I have benefited from their generous and comprehensive advice in formulating Government policy for the industry. Without the benefit of the Screen Commission's expertise and the experience gained over the past three years, it would have been much more difficult to establish an effective screen commission function within the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> I am aware that internationally there are many Irish people, people of Irish descent and friends of Ireland who occupy positions of eminence and influence in this industry, including members of the outgoing Screen Commission, who would be not only willing but delighted to help us in achieving the goals we have set ourselves. I have been considering how we might avail of this pool of goodwill, and this is a matter I intend to explore with the Irish Film Board.</P>
    <P>To return to the specific topic of the Bill, I envisage that it will lay the financial foundation for the next phase in the development of the film industry in Ireland. I have outlined to Senators the extended role of the board in building upon what has already been achieved. Because of the increased expenditure of the board in recent years I wish to point out that the Bill is urgent to enable the board draw down funds for films which will be going into production in the coming months.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Exchequer allocation to the board, which is voted annually in the Vote for my Department, the board is also authorised to use recoupment of its loans under its schemes. Repayment is conditional on certain commercial targets being reached by a film and I envisage that the reinvestment of such recoupments will continue to play an important part in enhancing the board's support for the industry. Of its nature the board is not a commercial bank and one of its principal functions is precisely to provide finance on terms which cannot be offered by the commercial banking sector. However, as the industry matures, it might be expected that the current recoupment rate of 13% should improve, providing additional resources for reinvestment in the industry. Reinvestment of recoupments and further development of production loans adds to the cumulative capital outlay of the board and, accordingly, is reckonable for the purposes of the legislation ceiling set by the Oireachtas in the Film Board Acts.</P>
    <P>There are two issues which have arisen in the course of my review of the Irish Film Board on which I feel I should make my position clear. First, the question of a change in the name of the board was raised. I am opposed to this. It would require statutory change and would suggest a break in the continuity of our film policy. I consider that the current title of the board, in Irish and in English, makes it clear that it is the State agency with ultimate responsibility for the implementation of Government policy on film. The second point relates to the location of the board. It has been suggested that the board should be entirely based in Dublin. Senators will be aware of the importance given by the Government to decentralisation. I do not envisage the board's headquarters moving from Galway. However, I agree with the board's approach in establishing an office in Dublin and it will be a matter for the board to decide how it should organise its work between Galway and the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> I appreciate the co-operation of Senators in expediting enactment of this very short but crucial Bill. There are already a number of imminent film productions awaiting passage of the Bill to receive support from the board and I again thank the House for facilitating passage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. We certainly will not be opposing the Bill and will co-operate in its passage. The Bill is not one of principle but is enabling in nature and is built upon the principles upon which the film industry should develop as laid down over the past decade or so. It is built upon a story which has by and large been successful. In some cases there has been a steep learning curve, but nonetheless it is based on a successful story which has been of benefit to the wider community.</P>
      <P>The sums of money involved are quite staggering. When this issue was last debated in 1997 the funds were increased from £15 million to £30 million. Today the figure is being increased from £30 million to £80 million, a very dramatic increase in the sums of money available. In her speech the Minister did not explain why such a dramatic rate of increase is necessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech was written in a sort of management speak which is the sort of language people learn in the Smurfit Business School and such places, the purpose of which, as George Orwell declared, is often to confuse and obscure as much as to enlighten. I am not saying the Minister did this deliberately, but the language in her speech is a very long way from the clear and limpid prose I read in her essays in UCD many years ago. Perhaps the Minister might favour a return to the clarity of language of which she has such a grasp. I quite frankly did not understand parts of the speech, but that may be a fault in me rather than in the speech.</P>
      <P>This is an enabling measure and there is no difficulty with the principle. I pay tribute to the enormous developments which have taken place in the Irish film industry over the past decade or so. I pay strong tribute to the current Minister who has been dedicated, persistent, consistent and successful in what she has done, but I pay particular tribute to her predecessor, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who in a sense made this his own issue and drove the issue with much vigour, imagination and flair. He can claim some credit for much of what has happened.</P>
      <P>We were very slow starters in the development of a film industry. Various attempts in the past failed for reasons which were later identified &ndash; lack of expertise, lack of capital, lack of nerve and lack of commercial backing. The iron hand of Finance saw very little value&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;in becoming involved in so risky a venture. Another factor was that many of <Col N="292" /> our private sector firms did not have the nerve to become involved.</P>
      <P>The Irish Film Board has changed the environment in which the film industry has developed, particularly over the past decade. We now have people who can travel anywhere in the world, who are recognised and who can command top positions. The quality of production has increased significantly while the level of training has made it possible for many young people to carve out a career for themselves in films. I would like to see export earnings from Irish films quantified, but I believe it is quite significant. I would like the Minister to indicate the numbers employed. In 1993 the figure was about 480, by the mid-1990s it was over 1,000 and today I expect the figure is higher. I know numbers fluctuate, but I would like the Minister to indicate those who get jobs from the film industry, the level of those jobs and the money involved.</P>
      <P>The nub of the Bill is page 12 which will lay the financial foundations for the next phase of development of the film industry in Ireland. The Minister outlined the extended role of the film board.</P>
      <P>It would be helpful if we had a value for money analysis, perhaps not today, but in a later debate on the future of the film industry in Ireland, which I will ask the Leader to facilitate. It would be interesting to get a global picture on how the film industry has developed over the past ten years or so, where the failures and successes have been and the overall value to the economy in the widest possible terms, not just financial terms. I do not think it is an area which is well understood by most ordinary people, myself included. We know when films are being shot in our areas that the streets are interrupted, that those with the equipment are generally quite arrogant and trample over the rights of people in the area, that roads are closed with little concern for the people who use them on a daily basis and that we are almost expected to look at these people as though they had come from some outer orbit, in much the same way as when the circus came to my home town. The circus people had an exotic flair and we were willing to accord them all sorts of privileges, respect and almost awe. However, the circus was in town for only one day.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is a great understanding of the extent to which the industry impacts on the greater economy and life of the country. I would like a debate in which we could look back over the past ten years, have a warts and all look, because undoubtedly in a high risk area such as film, there will be failures. If we are not prepared to risk the failures we will not have the successes. Nobody expects 100% success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said, &ldquo;As the industry matures it might be expected that the present recoupment rate of 13% should improve&rdquo;. Perhaps she will explain what is meant by recoupment, why the rate is as low as 13% and why it might improve in the future. This may be clear to everybody else <Col N="293" /> but I would appreciate some elaboration on it. The Minister did not mention &ndash; there is no need to do so but perhaps she might say a few words about it &ndash; how she sees the future role of RTÉ in film making. I would like a wider debate on the Minister's brief than the debate today, one which would include a look at RTÉ which has to make so many crucial decisions over the next couple of years as it is radically reshaped for the new age in which it finds itself. It will probably have to reshape ten years from now and ten years further down the road, so rapid are all the changes in that whole area of telecommunications.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will address the two specific points she raised at the end of her contribution on the name of the board. I see no reason to change it. It is perfectly adequate. She took me by surprise. Will she explain why there is pressure for a change of name. I urge her to keep the headquarters in Galway. That location is perfectly satisfactory and, rather than move to Dublin, offices should move out of Dublin. Dublin is becoming virtually unlivable because of the traffic.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I wish the Minister well. Perhaps she will respond to the points I have raised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It gives me great pleasure to welcome the Minister to the Seanad, particularly with the good news for the Irish film industry. It is acknowledged on all sides that increasing the grant aid from £30 million to £80 million is indicative of the support which the Government is prepared to put into the film industry. It is also indicative of the fact that the Minister is prepared to put her money where her word is and particularly where her heart is. From my observation, since the Minister took office it has been particularly evident that she gave quite an amount of her time to this section of her portfolio, not just in speeches but in the amount of travel which she has done throughout the country as well as internationally in an effort to help the Irish film industry. It is clear she had to conduct an exceptionally strong negotiating stance to achieve the level of grant aid announced. In setting up the strategic review body and given the work it has done, it is evident <Col N="294" /> that the planning which has gone into sustaining and developing the industry was particularly professional. Anybody looking through the results of that committee will see clearly, apart from the personnel on it, that it focused on issues which are important to the industry today.</P>
    <P>The industry is changing fast. There is absolutely no comparison between the film industry today and ten years ago. Ten or more years ago creativity and technology would not sit comfortably together, yet now it is vital that creativity and technology are comfortable partners for any success because the whole international scene is changing in the audio visual industry.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we would all rejoice in the success of a film made not only in national acknowledgement but in international acknowledgement. There were many cases of that. We rejoiced not only because of the artistic aspect of the film but because it was a great boost for the country. Therefore, the film industry cannot be viewed in isolation from the image of Ireland internationally, its economic welfare or its tourist standing, all of which have to interact. While being practical and pragmatic, the Minister has laid down certain markers. Many of the small companies here today would have great difficulty in competing in the current market. It is not long since we had the broadcasting Bill when there were many debates on the digital revolution. The outcome of the digital revolution is that there will be many more channels, the net result of which is that, apart from whatever standard or lack of standard might be involved, audiences will have to be competed for.</P>
    <P>Television audiences in Europe are diminishing precisely because there are more channels seeking viewers. We will not be exempt or protected from that in any way. Our past record in the film industry, as good as it may have been, will be soon forgotten. One has to look at how one should tackle that problem. One suggestion made by the Minister in one of her speeches is that small companies, if not merging, should create a co-operative structure because they will have difficulties in providing the wherewithal, particularly if working on a single project at any one time. We all know what that means. Very often the film rights are sold. Therefore, they cannot depend on that income but have to depend on limited fees. There is no build up of capital. Given that most of the small film companies in Ireland are under-capitalised, that will be a problem.</P>
    <P>The only way to get over that is through some merger or an association with some of the bigger companies. In the past we tried to attract projects from outside the country and often they helped the industry and also local communities. They gave us the chance to see how others work and an opportunity to make further contacts in the marketing field. It is important not to rely totally on outside projects. We have much talent and creativity and many scripts that could be created. We have a fair record in the industry itself and we should continue to focus as much as possible <Col N="295" /> on the indigenous projects. The Minister has underlined that and rightly so. We were successful in other areas precisely because we focused on the indigenous talents and creativity. One of the major difficulties with which we have to contend is marketing. I am sure some of the film makers discovered this when they went out to the international field. We can produce a good artistic product but the difficulty is to get it into the international market. Often we do not have the necessary structures to do that.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning sought an explanation for the enormous increase from £30 million to £80 million. I hope that reflects the changed world in which we live and that it will generate a greater need for ready cash for expenditure. I hope the film board will focus on that in terms of marketing because no matter how good the product is, the board must go out and sell it. If the product is not sold and the money invested in it is not recouped a fund will not be built up for future work. Marketing is an important area.</P>
    <P>I would like the film board to consider the harmonising of technology and creativity, even though it is a debate from the past, because questions will always arise in this regard. It is easy to concentrate only on technology and have those tools at one's disposal. They are absolutely vital because without them one will get nowhere in the modern world but at the same time it is important not to overshadow creativity because if it is not central to film making, upcoming generations will not be interested. Everybody might be exceptionally good at using technology in future but they may not make the input required to ensure creativity is fine tuned, acknowledged, recognised and passed on from one generation to the next.</P>
    <P>Audiences have always displayed a great loyalty to the film industry, right down to parochial level. There is a certain loyalty among theatre audiences. Few large areas did not have a cinema in the past. If the cinema was to close it became a debating point for the local urban or county council for 12 months because it was felt that the community was losing something that was particularly important to its lifestyle. Luckily many cinemas were saved even when the prophets of doom were saying that television would lead to many cinema closures.</P>
    <P>The same arguments apply today to the progress in the audiovisual industry. Commentators say that some elements of it will become defunct. I do not accept that because there is a recreating cycle in industries such as the film industry and we must always be careful to concentrate on all the outlets we have for our products. It may be video today or television or even a mobile cinema tomorrow but the important aspect is retaining the audience's loyalty.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning raised the question of RTÉ which is relevant. It is our national broadcasting network just as the Abbey Theatre is our national theatre. That has not been changed but loyalty must be taken into account. However, RTÉ had <Col N="296" /> to make its own case for doing so. It is not just a matter of ensuring the company obtains an increased licence fee. I do not argue for or against such an increase, although I am sure there are telling arguments in favour of it, but there were times when RTÉ took its audience for granted.</P>
    <P>Programmes with ratings which were not in the top six or the top ten were nevertheless important. These programmes had audiences of 300,000. If one works on such programmes on an ongoing basis, listens to the needs of the viewers and ensures that the programmes reflect not only their aspirations but their artistic creativity, loyalty to them will be built up. Somebody asked whether the GAA would have a loyalty to RTÉ regarding the coverage of live games or whether it would sell the rights to another station or international network. These are important questions but at the end of the day RTÉ must cultivate loyalty within its audience.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the film industry. No section of it should be taken for granted. I am glad the Minister referred to FÁS because people do not always recognise what that body has done at ground level. Anybody from rural Ireland will say that driving through any village or town the hallmark of quality set down by FÁS can be seen. More importantly, FÁS cultivated a sense of ownership in all the projects it undertook by involving the local community. The body has done the same with its training courses in film.</P>
    <P>Only last year Justin Nelson of RTÉ discovered a film which had been made in Cashel by a local company on sites such as Rockwell College, the Rock of Cashel and so on. The film was restored and a large audience viewed it. Only one camera worked which meant that every time a different angle was used the film makers had to reposition the camera and then everything had to be edited together. Despite the limited technology the final result was excellent&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was made in the mid-1950s. The acting ability of the so-called amateurs in the film was excellent. That culture of people wanting to be involved in the world of film has always been present. Many bodies have tried to involve people but FÁS has made it possible for anybody who feels they have any flair or talent. They might not become big producers but they have been focused in a certain direction and I am glad the Minister gave recognition to FÁS. Even in the absence of EU funding I am glad the money to be provided for the film board and for training will mean that FÁS is still involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the legislation, on the amount of money which she has succeeded in providing and on her interest in the industry. People of all ages wish the film industry well and feel indebted to it for what has been achieved down through the years in portraying our identity and giving Ireland greater recognition abroad. I do not say this in terms of propaganda but there <Col N="297" /> is not a country in the world which does not use the film industry to show itself in the best light. Ireland should not be different in that regard.</P>
    <P>That does not mean one is into the area of censorship or one is being insular in regard to the way one thinks or in what one wants to achieve but there is an onus on the Irish film industry &ndash; and it is not a question of biting the hand that feeds one &ndash; because it still owes a loyalty to Ireland and it should avail of any opportunity to portray Ireland in such a positive manner. It has done a good job in the past in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long time since the word &ldquo;censor&rdquo; came into one's head when one heard about films. It is extraordinary to think that in a few decades a thriving film industry has been developed and those involved deserve great credit. I welcome the legislation which provides more money for the industry. I also welcome the fact that at last we will get to see Milo O'Shea and Maureen Toal in <i>Ulysses</i>. We have been deprived of that part of our culture for a long time. It seems to be a good film based on the clips I have seen.</P>
      <P>The Minister's contribution, as Senator Manning said, contained a good deal of Department speak and she used the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; a great deal.</P>
      <P>I have seen and read the Kilkenny report but I do not know what the Olsberg report contains because it has not yet been made public. I presume the Minister's comments that there will be increased commitment to the development process and that the board will have a crucial role in nurturing new talent and creative originality, which will mean that support for the development of individual products will continue to be an important component of its development loan scheme, are based on the Olsberg report and that we will hear more about it later.</P>
      <P>I welcome the comment that it will increase our capacity to produce excellent scripts, which can appeal to the international markets upon which our indigenous industry is ultimately dependent, but I hope there will also be increased encouragement to look at the film industry within schools as a possible career path. I hope film will also be included in curricula and studies outside arts schools. The film industry should be given the prominence it deserves as an important cultural aspect in our lives.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked during the summer about her concerns about our culture being subsumed in a larger European Union. I do not have worries about our culture being subsumed within Europe, but I am concerned about it being taken over by American culture. It is much more influential than anything to do with the eastern European countries that are applying for membership. Some 98% of English speaking films are made in America. Our contribution will be tiny and we must fight in a competitive market to have them brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there are so many co-productions because this helps to bring them for<Col N="298" /> ward into a larger market. It is difficult for small firms to do this themselves. However, I wish something could be done about the broadcasting of RTÉ to Northern Ireland. There are still large sections, particularly in Antrim and Down, where the reception of RTÉ is bad. Permission must be sought to strengthen the signal to broadcast across the Border, but it is fine if it leaks across as it does in the western part of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This matter should be addressed because it would be useful in the North-South context to ensure people in Northern Ireland can have sight of our home broadcasting stations. I class TG4 as one of the best of these in terms of producing good work here. Co-productions between Channel 4 and RTÉ are seen in the South but I wonder if they are seen all over Northern Ireland. Does Channel 4 broadcast all the programmes it co-produces with RTÉ? This aspect should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The two most important aspects in the Kilkenny report were that the annual sum should be increased &ndash; this has been done &ndash; and that the capital grant to the film board for running costs should be increased. I hope that will happen. The Minister said there will be increased funding for training and I hope the capital grant to the Irish Film Board will not have to fund the training of Screen Training Ireland. This should be considered a separate entity because it is important that the film board gets good funding.</P>
    <P>I was fascinated to read in the explanatory memorandum that there are no staffing implications for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. However, I hope there are staffing implications for the Irish Film Board because it is grossly understaffed. It has a staff of approximately six and if it is to also have an office in Dublin &ndash; I agree that the board should continue to be located in Galway &ndash; I do not know how it will manage unless it bifurcates itself and sends three in both directions. Any office in Dublin will also require three staff and I hope it will get more staffing.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny report said that the capital budget of the film board should be doubled in two to three years. Last year the Minister mentioned four to five years as the length of time involved, but that is considered much too long by the industry. I hope the film board will get a big increase so that it has plenty of money because it obviously will be given an enormous amount of work to do.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny report also mentioned the role and responsibilities of the Irish Film Board <i>vis-à-vis </i>other State agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and RTÉ. This needs to be greatly enhanced. The board needs to be given a stronger strategic role in developing the industry and, on the basis of the Minister's comments, that is likely to happen.</P>
    <P>The other great emphasis in the Kilkenny report was on the Irish film tax incentive, section 481. All films have received money under section 481 and the industry is currently in very good con<Col N="299" /> dition. Much of this may be due to the fact that the rate of exchange with sterling is very poor at present and, therefore, it is financially better to make films in Ireland than it is in England. We should be careful that this is not an artificial boost to the industry but, given the performance of the euro at present, the position is unlikely to change in the short term. Nevertheless, it is important to keep it in mind. I hope the Minister will also push the tax incentive aspect in the budget because it is most important.</P>
    <P>Three recommendations in the Kilkenny report still have not been implemented. It suggested that the tax relief at the marginal rate of tax permitted for personal investors should be 100% for projects with budgets below £4 million. This sum is the average budget of most Irish originated feature films and it would be splendid if that change was put in place.</P>
    <P>The rate would remain at 80% for film projects with budgets over £4 million. However, the 80% relief should be reviewed upwards in light of changes in conditions such as the lowering of marginal rates of personal taxation. Investors must be permitted to opt to invest £50,000 in the first year. This would mean that they would not be entitled to make a further investment in the second year. This also needs to be considered.</P>
    <P>These three recommendations would meet the targets for growth set out in Ossie Kilkenny's report and I hope the Minister will try to push them with the Department of Finance. We have come a long way since Moby Dick, which was made in Youghal, and The Quiet Man, which was made in Connemara, were our great film achievements.</P>

      <P>Yes. There are other home-grown films, such as David Shaw-Smith's wonderful film, Hands on Arts and Crafts in Ireland, and Éamon de Buitléir has done much to give us great pride in the countryside. I hope the Minister, who has responsibility for heritage, will try to impress more on people that heritage is also important in the film making industry and the arts. I look with some dismay at our lack of concern for environmental issues. What if a few sand dunes go? However, not that many unspoilt areas remain. This area was important in the past in terms of people coming to Ireland to make films.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does it matter if pylons are erected in certain areas? It may matter considerably because it may mean that it is impossible to get skylines for films that could be made here. We do not have to make the country into a giant film set, although at times it appears Ireland is becoming a giant golf course. However, these considerations should be taken on board when environmental issues are being examined. Perhaps the Minister <Col N="300" /> could put forward these reasonable points of view.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and hope her advisers will forgive me for noting that there is much Department speak in her speech. Perhaps she will be able to elaborate in her reply on the Kilkenny report and what more will be done by the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Minister's proposal to increase the budget of the Irish Film Board from £30 million to £80 million. By any standards that is a substantial increase which must be supported. It is a very wise investment in the future development of the film industry. As long as the arithmetic is correct the language does not worry me. The Irish film industry has a long pedigree. My late father remembered being taken to Killarney by his father to see <i>The Dawn</i> being shot in 1925. While the industry has a long history, however, it has not yet reached its full potential which is waiting to be exploited. I have no doubt that this amount of money will give an enormous blood transfusion to this second phase of the film industry.</P>
      <P>I have just been attending the 45th Cork film festival, so if I talk back to front or upside down it is because no Cork person who is interested in film got any sleep for the past nine days. The opening feature of this prestigious international festival was an Irish-made film about Adam based on a very witty and urbane screenplay by Gerry Stembridge. It was vintage Stembridge at its best and was universally acclaimed as being a really fine film. It will be on general release after January 2001. The verdict after the screening was that here was a modern Irish film, shot mainly in Dublin, which could be the equal of any films shot in Barcelona or Berlin. It represented modern Ireland at its most creative and imaginative. It was refreshing for those of us who saw it.</P>
      <P>While we welcome Irish films of any genre, in recent times we have had a glut of productions based on the activities of the Provisional IRA or on difficulties arising from drugs, drink or brawls. There is a place for that type of film and I must say that <i>The Crying Game</i> was very entertaining but, nonetheless, it is good to see that we are moving on from that and projecting modern Ireland on film.</P>
      <P>I was particularly pleased to see that film was the opening feature of the Cork film festival. In addition, there were some stunningly clever shorts shown there. Many of them were Irish-made, which is what one would expect from a country that in the past century has excelled in the art of short story writing. One thinks of Seán O'Faoláin, Frank O'Connor and dozens of others. In a country such as ours, it is only natural that film-makers would produce some very creative and effective shorts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What pleases me more than anything else about the Cork film festival is the number of young people who buy season tickets to attend all the films, morning, afternoon and evening. Is <Col N="301" /> there an appetite among the upcoming generation for film? I am certain that there is. Is there a capacity among sizeable numbers of the upcoming generation to become film-makers themselves? I am certain there is. The kind of money the Minister is making available will help to develop that capacity further. That money along with the guidelines set out in the Kilkenny report will enable us to develop the film industry with a new level of coherence and continuity. In the past, a good, interesting and marketable film would be made on a once-off basis, but one would not hear about another film for a long time.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning mentioned the disruption caused to roads in Dublin during film shoots, but I have a cure for that which I will come to in a moment. The extra investment combined with better strategic planning will provide coherence, continuity, development and growth for the forward thrust of the film industry. As well as being an art form, film is an industry, which is how it should be viewed. If it is an industry, we must treat it as such. Questions were raised about the economic dividends. They were spelt out some time ago and they are tangible, both directly and indirectly.</P>
    <P>There is another dividend which is difficult to quantify and that is the image of Ireland abroad that good films can project. Our better films are the best ambassadors we can send out internationally. One cannot put a cost on that at any time, but particularly now when the assets of the 21st century will not be coal, steel, brawn, horse-power or man-power. Those assets are brainpower; creativity and technology coupled together, and nowhere are they coupled better than in the film business. Inward investment is often prompted by the fact that Ireland is seen as having a young workforce with high levels of intelligence and skills. That is taken into consideration when foreign companies decide to invest here. Therefore, if our films project us as a nation with that combination of creativity, intelligence and skilful use of technology when they are shown abroad, that provides benefits beyond a direct economic return from film-making. One cannot quantify it.</P>
    <P>As was mentioned on the Order of Business today, I would welcome a wider debate on the film industry when we have more time. The Minister could attend the House for such a debate. I would pin high hopes on the future of the film industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning mentioned the disruption on roads caused by film-making. I had some difficulty in Cork when part of <i>Angela's Ashes</i> was filmed there. It was the part where they were trying to recreate the old lanes of Limerick. They went to a fairly &ldquo;high church&rdquo; part of Montenotte to get a road that would fit the physical proportions they wished to portray.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I should not have mentioned the area. However, the genteel people of that area could think of no justification why their road was chosen to portray the lanes of Limerick in <i>Angela's Ashes</i>. There is an excess of films being made in Dublin. I agree with Senator Manning that there is an excess of these great big gadgets moving into an area and disturbing the genteel citizens of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong that roads should be cordoned off and made inaccessible at given times. If the 40 mile rule &ndash; currently in place concerning technicians and craftspersons, the people who underpin the film industry &ndash; were to be removed, one would see a great upsurge of film-making in the regions. The Minister should use her influence to have that rule removed because it places a stranglehold on the development of film-making in the regions.</P>
      <P>I will give one example, <i>Disco Pigs</i>, was a fine film, although perhaps not as good as the book. It was initiated in Cork but, after a week, the making of the film was transferred to Dublin. The cost of taking technicians and the level of staff involved to Cork undermined the budget. They had to transfer the film making to Dublin.</P>
      <P>I hope I have made the point when I say that there is scope for the development of the industry but it must be made to happen on a regional basis. That will never happen until that rule is removed. It is restrictive practice at its worst. Perhaps the Minister will seek to have it removed. If nothing else happens as a result of this debate except that, many of us will be very pleased.</P>
      <P>I wish to make two further points in respect of this report. One is about the bringing forward of scripts. That is the most fundamental of all ingredients to making films happen. There is very poor investment in the bringing forward of good scripts in Ireland and that must be addressed. In the United States, about 15% of the budget for film-making is put into bringing the script forward. It is about 3% in Ireland and that is a very telling figure. It is not enough to be very imaginative and creative. Creativity and imagination must be professionally developed and they must be skill and knowledge-based. In other words, they must be nurtured. That nurturing can only happen in the context of investing in the script-making elements. If we make and continue to make good scripts, I am certain we can make good films. Perhaps the Minister will attend to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Distribution and marketing are another issue. To date we have not put enough resources into distributing films domestically and marketing them internationally. It is another area which must be addressed. Our internal audience is not sufficiently large, even if there were a huge switch in the morning and many more people started going to the cinema again in the way they did <Col N="303" /> when I was young. People are beginning to go back and cinemas are sprouting again all over the country and that is fabulous. However, even if we all became film buffs overnight, we would still not have an internal market sufficiently large to sustain a thriving film industry. We must develop the techniques of marketing skilfully and strategically abroad.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Irish Screen Commission for its work in recent years and to the members who put this report in place. We call it the &ldquo;Ossie Kilkenny&rdquo; report for short. They have given something tangible with which to plan for the future. There is enormous scope for the development of home-made programmes, be they short films, feature films, documentaries or whatever else. Our national broadcasting service is crying out for them and we must seek to do something to strengthen, encourage and foster the making of them. When good documentaries are made, the audience figures prove without doubt that there is a market for good documentaries. The number of people who watched the Seán O'Mordha programme, <i>Seven Ages</i>, was phenomenal. People, young and old, who disparage history and gave it up as a school subject switched on to it. It is just one programme which comes to mind.</P>
    <P>Occasionally one turns on the television and sees a delightful documentary. I am not a great viewer of television; I do not have time because of my occupation. I happened by chance to turn it on one evening last week and saw a documentary on a man walking mountains in Wicklow. He recreated the story of Red Hugh O'Donnell and Hugh O'Neill in 1592 before the Battle of Kinsale. There were other elements such as the story of Wicklow and its magic and magnificence and they were all present visually in the documentary of one man walking the mountains. There was very good and stunning camerawork. It is a delight when one sees such a well made Irish documentary. I was reared in the belief that soap was for washing oneself and, while that was the end of soaps in our house, we are now saturated with soaps of a different kind. If Irish television is to retain its audience, it must have many more Irish-made documentaries, feature films, shorts and other home-produced programmes.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning spoke of George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i> at the beginning of his speech. The end of <i>Animal Farm</i> has one of the saddest images of all literature where one of the poor animals looks in a window of the farmhouse and sees the pigs inside living exactly as the humans they had driven out. He looks from the humans to the pigs and back again and cannot tell the difference between them. That is about as graphic a description as one will get of disillusionment and a good idea gone wrong. When I switch from RTÉ to one of the other channels and cannot tell the difference between them, that will be a great disillusionment for me. I am of the television generation. I was born and raised far from here and <Col N="304" /> television opened up our world. It was the great invention of our time.</P>
    <P>I welcome this investment and I want it continued and built upon because the returns will be potentially enormous. It is money very well spent and I compliment the Minister on this amending legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an increasing school of thought, especially in reflective circles in the United States, that the function of television is to sell audiences to advertisers and that the myth that the function of television is to make good programmes people would like to watch is a complete misunderstanding of the objective of corporate television ownership, which is to sell audiences to advertisers. The real relationship is the audience a television station can offer to an advertiser. It immediately raises questions about quality, range, risk and such matters, all of which are relevant to this debate.</P>
      <P>One of the problems with the global film industry is that entry costs are extremely high. Economists, especially those of the liberal market school, who are not the only economists but give the impression that they are, accept there is often a need for intervention by the State where entry costs are very high. Otherwise competition will be undermined. That is not the reason we have a film industry. We have one because, among other things, the Minister had a visionary predecessor. Every time I think of the extraordinary success of the Irish film industry, which he did not achieve on his own and I know the Minister has built on and extended his achievements, I always remember the comment of Senator Quill's former leader who said that, if Deputy Michael Higgins ever got to Government, he would go mad. Deputy Higgins's reply when he was Minister was, if this is madness, let us have more of it. It was a wonderfully inspired madness, if that is what it was.</P>
      <P>It is wonderful to see creativity in any area in this country being fostered, supported and successful. It does not matter whether it is in the visual, performing or audiovisual arts because each of them is wonderful and it is wonderful to see them flowering. It is also wonderful to see the extent to which some things which are unique to us turn up in some of these.</P>
      <P>However, we need to get a grasp on reality. The global audiovisual industry is dominated by one country, the United States, and one view of that country. Countries such as India have extraordinarily successful indigenous film industries, but they are no more than indigenous and do not really reach the rest of the world. The only global audiovisual industry is largely dominated by the United States. We ought to be concerned about that for both cultural and commercial reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to most film criticism I have read, while the United States is very good at producing a particular type of formulaic mega-successful movie, the Hollywood studios are not particularly good at broadening their agenda. The most hor<Col N="305" /> rendous thing Hollywood does is copy a success <i>ad nauseam</i>, with multiple variations on a theme that has proved successful. It is a real effort for a good director to get something new onto the Hollywood agenda.</P>
    <P>I would have thought, therefore, that one of our functions, and that of any other country, is to foster an imaginative and creative audiovisual industry. It is probably not excessive to say that, given current trends, we are in danger of developing a world audiovisual industry which is both monocultural and monoglot. It will be in English and will consist of variations on one country. As Senator Ó Murchú said, it will largely be an uncritical view of the country from which most of this material comes. There are wonderful exceptions. However, the predominant image of the United States in most of its successful movies is a long way from the inequality, stress, pain and exclusion that is the real United States. The image is usually of a reasonably affluent, comfortable with itself, racially integrated, perfectly healthy, sexually liberated place.</P>
    <P>The great struggle for Europe, as a continent of diverse cultures, languages, traditions and religions, is to find a mechanism to counter the tendency to move towards world domination by one country and to put together a vision of itself that is both commercial and creative. We will not do that on our own. However, I hope we will begin to build an indigenous industry which will be both successful and reflective of ourselves.</P>
    <P>I commend the successful introduction of the maximum number possible of international production companies to Ireland and the fact that they were persuaded to make their productions here, both for the immediate cash benefits and also for the reasons the Minister outlined of developing and sustaining our skill base in all the various areas. It is a bit of fun and it creates a bit of froth on a cold winter's night to realise a lot of international superstars are floating around the Dingle peninsula, as they were on one or two occasions in the past. We all welcome that. However, the political skill and achievement will be to build from that an imaginative, creative and quality driven indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>I am a reasonably regular film watcher and reader about film, but I would not claim to be an expert. However, much of the Irish indigenous film industry's output is not wonderful. I am not surprised some of it is not a commercial success because it is, in some cases, painfully stereotypical and badly written. There is never much problem with the quality of the acting, but the quality of the writing sometimes leaves a lot to be desired. The Minister said that script and story are major areas for development. However, I do not know how economic instruments can be used to encourage something as creative as script writing. On the other hand, many people will say reading Hollywood scripts is not a particularly pleasant experience in many cases either. However, we have a job to do here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> In other areas of the creative arts, small amounts of money can liberate enough creative talent. Unfortunately, because of the scale of costs involved, that is not the case for an indigenous film industry. However, I saw a film in the Cork Film Festival two years ago which was a wonderful spoof on all the disaster, horror and catastrophe movies. It was a full length 60 or 70 minute film which was made for £10,000. I never worked out how the producers managed to make it for £10,000. One could see it was cheap, but one could not see how it was made for the sort of money most film makers would spend on the entertainment budget. It was a remarkable success.</P>
    <P>I am a little wary when those in the indigenous industry continue to give lack of sufficient capital as the reason they cannot make films. To a degree, it is also due to a lack of willingness to think creatively, to which I will return in a minute.</P>
    <P>There is no disputing that the attempts to build a film industry have at last been successful. I agree with Senator Manning that one of the many things that inhibited the development of a film industry here was the remarkably unimaginative view of most new things taken by the funding Department in this State. Its capacity to read the future is not one of its greatest skills. An example was its determination to neglect the fishing industry for the best part of 60 years by not funding it. It has never been a particularly good Department for looking forward. It never got used to the possibility of success but always believed we were unsuccessful. It understood how to deal with a lack of success but it is having great problems grappling with success.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the need to project an image of ourselves. As I said, that must be both commercial and creative. That involves questions of imagination, reflection and challenge. The question is how we can bring these to ourselves and the international community.</P>
    <P>It is not too difficult to bring them to ourselves, although many in the Irish film industry will say that those who make decisions on film distribution in this country are more than a little resistant to Irish made feature films unless they have the stamp of an international studio, either as a collaborator or co-producer. Many people who have made critically acclaimed films have had great difficulty getting them distributed here.</P>
    <P>The problems of international distribution are legendary. Every year a significant number of good films produced in the United States, outside Hollywood and its allies, never reach this country or Britain because no one is prepared to distribute them. We should look at the issue of diversity of film in this country, not just in terms of what we make ourselves but also in terms of the films that reach this country. Our cinemas are now dominated by 12 or 14 films at any given time.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the ways in which we can reflect on ourselves in film is through the relationship between television companies and film making. All the efforts to persuade RTÉ, and &ldquo;persuade&rdquo; is a gentle word, to be more willing to engage independent operators have been overwhelmingly successful. What is even more astonishing is the extraordinary success of the hopelessly underfunded TG4, which has discovered a range of imaginative television programmes with a shoestring budget that would be considered laughable in the rest of the world. It is a fraction, for example, of what the equivalent of TG4 in Wales has at its disposal.</P>
      <P>It is an extraordinary achievement and a compliment to the capacity and quality of many indigenous film makers. I am not sure that they would have chosen to make programmes as Gaeilge if they had the choice but that was the only funding available. The station has been a remarkable success. In a time of comparative affluence it is a great pity that TG4 is still running on a shoestring. Its budget has been well spent and it is clear that if further money were available, it would be used with great imagination, flair and a little of the humour and devilment that are often missing from conventional film making output.</P>
      <P>I am a fan of TG4, as are most television critics who do not look at it with their prejudices to the forefront. At least one TV critic is incapable of looking at TG4 without seeing only the negatives. Most of the critics and most of the people who bother to watch the station and have sufficient Irish to be able to enjoy it accept that TG4 does a remarkably good job. It only has a small audience but it was never going to attract a huge audience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> There is also the fourth or commercial TV channel. It is time the Minister talked to either the Independent Radio and Television Commission or to TV3. It is unobtainable in a considerable section of the country, including where Senator Tom Fitzgerald lives, although it must be said that the people in those areas are not missing much. However, since the station has a habit of spending its resources on buying sports programmes which otherwise would be available on RTÉ, their enterprise deprives at least 20% of the population of access to those programmes. This debate is about the need to use the audiovisual medium, in particular film, to reflect our identity in a successful way yet this television channel has no virtually no indigenous sport, no indigenous movies because it will not fund them and no indigenous culture. It does not use a word of our language from one end of the day to the other, has no indigenous drama and no indigenous anything except news and a few talk shows.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that is what we want in a world where there is a limited number of terrestrial frequencies. It is useful to look at the ratings. Whatever big international movie TV3 shows in a particular week will be number one, with an audience of about 200,000 people which is approximately 8% of the full audience. That is followed by whatever sporting event the station has managed to buy which, in turn, is followed by that wonderful example of high quality culture, <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>. There is enough satellite television available to satisfy that market. It would have been possible, and still is possible, to have a commercial television channel which can do a little more than simply buy in cheap international programming of the intellectual level of Mr. Jerry Springer. Instead, it could do something to reflect ourselves and how we are.</P>
    <P>I am not seeking the equivalent of the highest quality produced by BBC2, Channel 4 or RTÉ. However, TV3 could do much better and it is a pity there is no agency to remind it that it has a commitment to quality as well as quantity and depth as well as breadth. There is a problem there and I ask the Minister to talk to the people concerned. It is a dreadful waste of a national resource.</P>
    <P>We are attempting to develop an indigenous audiovisual and film industry but if I see another drama or movie about sexual repression by the Catholic Church in Ireland I will scream. It is a worn out topic. I am also tired of comedians who think they are funny because they do the brave deed of pulling the nose of the Catholic Church, as if it had any influence any more. As for the number of people who believe it is daring and an indication of how progressive one is to slip as many four letter words as possible into a programme, I consider it a schoolboy or schoolgirl reflection of the way Ireland was in the 1950s.</P>
    <P>There are enough big themes in Ireland in 2000 to stimulate and challenge a creative artist. They run from, if I want to be highly political, the decline of a once great political party for one <Col N="309" /> reason or another through to the dominance of our media by, essentially, one man, to growing inequality and the extraordinary cultural impact of the last seven years. Those years have produced huge change in every area of Irish life in terms of education and our social, religious and cultural values. Any artist of merit could pick a great deal from that. However, we will inevitably have yet another &ldquo;powerful script&rdquo; about repression in Ireland. Anybody who knows anybody under 25 years of age in this country will realise that whatever else they are, they are not repressed. The script might be an interesting picture of how Ireland used to be but it is not the stuff of challenging creative art.</P>
    <P>We need to be challenged by artists about how we are, not given pictures of how we were. We all know how we were; enough has been said and written about it. I am not referring to serious documentaries on the awful things that were done but about creative script writing and stories. It is time many of our scriptwriters grew up and, like all artists, picked on the real powers in society at present rather than on safe targets which no longer have the power they had previously. They are easy targets and make people feel brave about themselves but they do not add much to either our stimulation or entertainment.</P>
    <P>I wish An Bord Scannáin well. I hope the money is used creatively. I also hope the board will not fall into an Irish equivalent of the narrow view of what represents good film making. The relationship between our television service and film producing is far from complete. TG4 is underfunded so it cannot work there, TV3 is clearly determined not to spend money on those indigenous matters so we are left with RTÉ. There is an issue there with regard to RTÉ's part in the development of film and assistance in the development of film. If we are going to develop film commercially, that is one issue but if we want to be both commercial and different, a quality of scriptwriting and imagination will be required which, so far, I have not seen much of. I hope that through more imagination, challenge and stimulation, and perhaps a willingness to examine different ways of looking at things, we can make some progress.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill and the Minister well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the Bill and commend the Minister on what she is doing in increasing the amount of money from £30 million to £80 million. As a person who has benefited or at least who comes from a part of Ireland which has benefited in a big way from the film industry, I understand what the industry means to those involved, including directors, actors and stand-ins. In 1968, when &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo; was being filmed in Dingle, I stood in for the great man, Bob Mitchum, for two weeks. I spent nine months working on the film. Only two weeks ago I spent four hours under the cameras with Sarah Miles in my living room, reliving the making of <i>Ryan's <Col N="310" />Daughter</i> for a programme which will be shown on BBC Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I see the benefit of the film industry throughout Ireland, be it in Dublin city or in the west. My wife provides bed and breakfast and at least half the people who stay in it during the summer ask where <i>Ryan's Daughter</i> was made. Quite a number of people have seen <i>The Playboy of the Western World </i>which was made in Inch, and the film which starred Tom Cruise. These films have brought a huge number of people to the Dingle peninsula because of the scenery which was portrayed and the ambience of the area, the most beautiful part of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister should provide an additional carrot to those in the film industry to make films which would be successful and which we would love. I have in mind films based on the book <i>An tOileánach, The Islandman</i>. A couple of years ago I dreamt of pushing this if possible, and I had Gregory Peck as an t-oileánach, the tall gaunt man with the jet black hat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That film could be made. It is a beautiful story and could be distributed in any part of the world. I also have in mind the story of a man who went to the Klondyke, Mickey McGowan, based on the book <i>Rothar Mór an tSaol</i>. I read the story years ago and saw a documentary on it about five years ago on RTÉ. I would like the Minister to make recommendations, if possible, to those in the film industry to look at projects with particular emphasis on an Irish background and Irish or Irish-American actors.</P>
      <P>Gregory Peck's mother was born in my parish in Lispole. Gregory Peck and Scott of the South Pole expedition were cousins. I also mention the Creans in the context of another subject for a film. The Creans were always known as the Scotts, simply because Tom Crean went with Scott to the South Pole. Gregory Peck and Tom Crean were related. Tom Crean and Gregory Peck's mother were born within a mile of each other. It would be great if it was possible to provide a carrot to bring the books I have mentioned &ndash; there are hundreds others I have not mentioned &ndash; to film.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan spoke about the underfunding of TG4. In the early days I was very dubious about TG4, but it has turned out to be my favourite television station at night. It is absolutely fabulous and great credit is due to everybody involved in it. Commentary in Irish is given for English programmes and it is very simple to follow. We should not expect TG4 to be profitable. We are a small country with a population of four million, <Col N="311" /> and to think these stations can stand on their own feet and be profitable is too much to ask.</P>
    <P>In addition, there should be a link between the television licence and what people want to watch. People pay up to £300 to watch programmes on Sky, but if there is special viewing, such as a boxing or football match, extra must be paid. I am not saying that should be the way, but the television licence should reflect the reason for which it was introduced. The legislation links the licence to transmitting or receiving apparatus and those in possession of such an apparatus must pay a licence fee. The licence is now expected to be a payment for all programmes on television, something with which I do not agree. If people want to see programmes they could pay separately. I know the Bill is only slightly concerned with television, but quite a number of productions, including feature films, are being shown on television.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the siting of masts and aerials all over the country. We should make a break for it and join the satellite community. That is where the future lies whether or not we like it. Ten years from now people will ask why we did not join the satellite community when it was cheap to do so. Tara television is broadcast <i>via </i>satellite. Most of the programmes on RTÉ are being retransmitted <i>via </i>satellite on Tara.</P>
    <P>On one occasion the Minister said she did not feel it was right that people should have to pay to see special and sporting programmes, such as having to pay £15 to see the All-Ireland Final. I cannot get TV3&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;unless I pay Horizon Television. That is wrong. The entire Dingle peninsula cannot get TV3 because Horizon has it on. Horizon hold the people of the Gaeltacht to ransom because there are certain pockets in the Gaeltacht that cannot get TG4 through the normal aerial but can get it though Horizon if they pay a large sum of money. This is not just for Tom Fitzgerald in Dingle but for hundreds of Tom Fitzgeralds all over Ireland who are in the same boat. I can look across the harbour and see that the mast which transmits it is about half a mile away as the crow flies. Yet I cannot get TV3 simply because a big company demands so many hundreds of pounds per year. That is wrong. TV3, though I suppose it is independent of the Government, should be told straight that it should provide television service to all the people. My understanding is that all that is required to transmit it is to put a dish on top of the mast. Everything is in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill simply because I have been a great admirer of films and have gone to films all my life. If somebody asked what was the best film I had seen I would have to say &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo;. I love films and take a deep interest in them. I see a great future in Ireland for the film <Col N="312" /> industry. What has been done up to now is magnificent.</P>
    <P>In the early days Gael Linn did great work in collecting the archives and storing all the old films. The reason BBC contacted me about making this film was that I actually had a half an hour of old super 8 millimetre film which I took while working on the set. They could not believe it and said it was magic. I hope to hand it into the archives some day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate. I found it interesting and helpful. A number of issues have arisen more than once and I will do my best to address them. In regard to the points raised by Senator Manning, when I came to office in 1997 there was great potential for the film industry and there was a good deal on which to work. However, there was no Screen Commission and the only talk about the film industry was the need for a section 481. Section 481 had been recognised by me and everybody else as an important element in progressing the film industry for a number of reasons. I was happy to ensure, through Government support, that section 481 would be given a further five years. That agreement was made with the Department of Finance and announced at the time. I thought we needed a more strategic approach to the film industry. It was not sufficient to speak about one particular element of the tax code and hope that an industry could hang on that. That was the reason I established the Screen Commission. I went further and decided a strategy was needed for the next ten years. That is the reason for setting up the Film Industry Strategic Review Group. Under the chairmanship of Mr. Ossie Kilkenny some great work was done.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to the film industry, certainly since 1997, is evident given the moneys being provided to support the Irish Film Board. In 1997 the current moneys amounted to £0.419 million and the capital was £3.7 million. In 2000 the amount of current moneys has increased from £0.4 million to £0.7 million and the capital has increased from £3.7 million to £6.2 million. This substantial increase mirrors the possibilities within the industry. We need to recognise this not only in debate but to bolster it in terms of funding and financial commitment which we have done and which I hope to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Direct employment in the industry is 2,000 full-time equivalents and indirect employment generated by the industry in the services sector adds another 3,000 to the figure. The first figure understates the number of people earning their living from the industry as employment is project based and, therefore, discontinuous. A substantial number of people have an opportunity to work within this industry and certainly there is scope for further growth. From the research carried out it <Col N="313" /> is difficult for a number of reasons to elicit not only the numbers working in the industry but the economic knock-on effects. The point was made by Senator Quill and others that sometimes it is difficult to quantify the amount of money that can be generated in other sectors of the economy, particularly in the area of tourism where it has a positive knock-on effect, not least in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald and others will be aware that a number of counties, of which Kerry is one, have taken the opportunity to set up their own screen commissions. They have recognised the economic benefits that can accrue from such an industry. The review by Alan Gray in 1998 is interesting because it recommended the continuance of State aids. IBEC maintains a statistical database on the numbers involved and the knock-on effect of the industry on the general economy. We have an opportunity to become aware of the internal workings of the board through the annual reports.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning asked for an explanation on the recoupment factor. When a film receives a production loan from the Irish Film Board that loan is made conditional upon the payment but only if the film is successful. It takes a long time to build up the skills and capabilities to produce commercially successful films, hence the actual recoupment is low. The Irish Film Board rate of recoupment compares favourably with other national film funding agencies. As our emphasis becomes more commercial it will be expected that the films produced will be more commercial and, therefore, the board should get a better recoupment. I hope that explains the approach to recoupment.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning and many others referred to the role of RTÉ and our broadcasters with regard to the film industry. The independent producers have had a number of discussions with me which are ongoing, particularly in regard to the Broadcasting Bill. Committee Stage is about to be taken in the Dáil and the Bill will be before the Seanad in due course. Because of my concern regarding independent producers and knowing the difficulties that existed between them and RTÉ in regard to the understanding and interpretation of the existing legislation, I felt the best way of approaching the issue was to ensure it would be set down in new legislation and that is why there is reference to independent producers in the Bill which will be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>RTÉ has an important role to play, as do our other indigenous stations, TV3 and TG4. All of us wish to re-emphasise and underline the important role TG4 has played. It has tremendous broadcasters who generally are young, but they are highly technical, effective and imaginative in their approach. The TG4 model could be followed by existing channels and others which may come on stream.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Manning agrees with the location and name of the film board. I am committed to locating the film board in Galway. <Col N="314" /> There is an office in Dublin but it is up to the board to decide on the day to day workings of the Dublin office. However, the board's headquarters must remain in Galway.</P>
    <P>Senator O Murchú referred to the importance of indigenous projects and I agree with this approach. We would all welcome a scenario where blockbusters are imported because, as Senator Ryan said, that helps to build an infrastructure and skills base, but indigenous industry can also develop. That is why the film board plays such an important role in this area and I have supported it in terms of funding. I agree with Senator O Murchú that small companies need to consider partnerships and associations to strengthen their own position and it is most important that every company should have a business plan and a strategic approach.</P>
    <P>The importance of marketing and distribution has been recognised by all in the film industry. There will be a division within the strengthened film board which will have specific responsibility for marketing.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the Olsberg report but there is a little confusion in this area. The Senator is well aware of the Ossie Kilkenny strategic review report. That review has been completed and the report has made 20 recommendations. I support all the recommendations except one which proposes a levy on cinema seats. Olsberg SPI was engaged to review the organisation and management of the board. The board is finalising its own plan on foot of that report and I hope it will take into account the comments I and others made in the House. I look forward to the board's final deliberations on this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry also referred to RTÉ reception in the North. I have read the departmental files and attempts to improve reception have been ongoing for 20 years. Senators will understand there are political considerations in this issue. I would like an improvement in RTÉ reception throughout the North and I hope such an improvement will take place through digitalisation and the Broadcasting Bill, 2000, because the Bill provides for a reciprocal arrangement. That issue can be discussed when the Bill is debated in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry also mentioned tax relief, budgets below £4 million and the 80% debate. I have discussed both issues with the Minister for Finance. They are financial matters first and foremost, but the Minister and the Department are aware that I am pursuing them.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators highlighted the need for an emphasis on development, but such emphasis was recommended in the Kilkenny report, not the Olsberg report.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill referred to &ldquo;Adam&rdquo;, a film which was shown during the Cork Film Festival. I envy the fact that she spent so much time in Cork during the festival. She will be glad to know the film was supported by the Film Board and section 481. Practical help and support is available for such films. I would welcome a debate on <Col N="315" /> film in the House. The Whips can discuss it, but if I was invited to the House for such a debate I would be delighted to take up the invitation.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill also raised the 40 mile rule. It is a SIPTU rule which relates to paying <i>per diem</i> outside a 40 mile radius. As it is a union matter, I would be happy following the debate to contact the unions to make them aware of the views expressed in the House on the issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised a number of issues. I agree Ireland has wonderful film locations and actors of great ability for which it is known internationally. We are also known for our literary prowess, but film script writing involves a specific skill and expertise and the development of scripts is of extreme importance because, as the Senator said, we are referring to quality driven indigenous projects. The money must be available for such development and the film board feels strongly about that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised the issue of the independent producers in RTÉ. I hope I referred in some way to the importance of the independent producers and our indigenous television stations. In addition, TG4 has been a tremendous success. The Senator will be interested to know that the film board, television broadcasters, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Enterprise Ireland are to establish a focused policy framework for developing commercially viable television productions in the Irish language. This is one of the recommendations in the Ossie Kilkenny report and it is a matter dear to the Senator's heart.</P>
    <P>TV3 is in a very different situation from RTÉ in the sense that it is a commercial station and, therefore, has a number of different criteria. Giving and monitoring a licence is a matter for the Independent Radio and Television Commission, not me as Minister. Certain criteria have been set down by the Independent Radio and Television Commission for obtaining a licence and it monitors such situations.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom Fitzgerald referred to <i>An tOileánach</i> and I was most impressed that the Senator stood in for Gregory Peck.</P>

      <P>Why was the date 1 January 2001 picked? Is it a convenient round figure or is there a reason for it? Does the Government expect to have the Bill enacted by then or from where did the date 1 January 2001 come? I am concerned that if the Bill passed through the other House quickly, there could be a hiatus in which people might feel they could do certain things.</P>
      <P>The website is a most accessible way of checking matters and it is a wonderful medium in that regard. The Internet is one of the most over-rated media, but as a source of getting this sort of information the website is good. It is a pity they did not leave themselves the flexibility to introduce it earlier. Perhaps the Minister will say he is compelled to do so by 1 January, but if the Bill is enacted sooner he could do it before he is legally compelled. In that way, all of what is covered here would be published once the Bill is passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, in the light of Ireland's historic support for the people of Tibet at the UN and other international fora, pledges its whole hearted backing for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and our representatives at the UN and on the Security Council in taking every possible measure to secure the human, civil, political and religious rights of the people of Tibet.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. It is a pleasure to see him here for what is an important debate. It gives us the opportunity to place on record our congratulations to him and his officials for securing a position on the United Nations Security Council. It is a very significant development and one we welcome. It is a credit to him and those around him. It also places this motion in a particular context. It is significant that there is no amendment to it. This is something on which all parties agree and we support the people of Tibet in seeking their human, civil and political rights.</P>
      <P>We, as a people, have an honourable tradition in this matter. It is significant that, in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 14 October, Deputy David Andrews, the Minister's predecessor in the Department of Foreign Affairs, referred twice to Tibet when examining the possible reforming and progressive role Ireland could take at this unique and historic moment in the United Nations. He said:</P>
      <P>It is imperative that we use this opportunity to advance the cause of smaller nations. As de Valera spoke out for Abyssinia and as Aiken spoke out for an independent Tibet, we should be willing to adopt an active and independent voice for the rights of small nations.</P>
      <P>A few paragraphs later he said:</P>
      <P>As we supported the cause of an independent Tibet in the face of strenuous Russian opposition and spoke out on the conduct of the Algerian War, much to the ire of the French, we should be vocal in our support of the smaller, poorer nations.</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, the position in Tibet is not yet resolved &ndash; in fact, it is quite tragic. We in this House can get carried away and produce the waffle before the meat. Therefore, at the beginning, I headline two specific suggestions we might consider. We should examine the possibility of urging the European Union to open a consular office in Lhasa or, at the very least, to appoint a rapporteur there. This would be a small degree of recognition of the existence of Tibet which we have historically supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, the Taoiseach on several occasions but principally in the past 18 months, in meetings <Col N="321" /> with senior Chinese officials, drew their attention to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process in Northern Ireland as a potential model for the peaceful resolution of the position in Tibet. The fact that the Taoiseach drew attention to this and suggested it as a model indicates that, with our new position on the Security Council, it should be possible for Ireland to consider offering to act as honest broker and host a meeting between the contending parties who are clearly the Chinese occupying power on the one hand and, on the other, the Tibetan Government in exile in Dharamsala, headed by the Dalai Lama.</P>
    <P>In that context I wish to put on record two brief items which were put on record in 1965 at the time of this important debate. Mr. Lopez from the Philippines told the UN General Assembly:</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the people of many emerging countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America have come to look with deep suspicion on whatever has been euphemistically described as &ldquo;movements of national liberation&rdquo;? The phrase, sacred in the memory of freedom fighters everywhere, has been abused for selfish ideological reasons. The record of the Chinese Communist occupation of Tibet conforms to the worst type of imperialism and colonialism, past or present.</P>
    <P>Mr. Aiken said in the same debate in the 20th session on 14 December 1965:</P>
    <P>In the view of my delegation, the terms of the Declaration [on The Granting Of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples] as we stated when it was being adopted are as much applicable to Tibet as to any other Territory, whether in Asia, Africa, Europe or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee on human rights of the Committee on Foreign Affairs passed two motions unanimously and they are to be found on the Order Paper today. The first is No. 18, motion 15:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes:</P>
    <P>Whereas governmental and non-government organisations have reported an increase in political repression and restrictions on religious freedoms in Chinese occupied Tibet in 1999;</P>
    <P>Recognising that bilateral dialogues on human rights with the Government of the People's Republic of China have failed to produce meaningful improvements in the human rights of the Chinese and Tibetan peoples;</P>
    <P>Commending the Government of the United States for introducing a resolution on China at the 56th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights;</P>
    <P>Calls on the Euroopean Union to co-sponsor a resolution on China at the 56th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights; </P>
    <P>Expresses strong support for His Holiness the Dalai Lama's Five Point Peace Plan con<Col N="322" /> taining the following components: (1) transformation of the whole of Tibet into a zone of peace; (2) abandonment of China's population transfer policy; (3) respect for the Tibetan people's fundamental human rights and democratic freedoms; (4) restoration and protection of Tibet's natural environment; and (5) commencement of earnest negotiations between the Chinese leadership and the Dalai Lama or his representatives on the future status of Tibet.</P>
    <P>This is a very widely and generally held feeling. Coincidentally, I received in my post today an ordinary postcard from west Cork urging me to take up these specific issues. This is something on which the people feel strongly. It is not as widely known as the position in East Timor, but it is parallel to that extraordinary position in which Ireland honourably played a significant and important role.</P>
    <P>There is a severe religious clampdown in Tibet although that may not appear to be the case. The Chinese are good at concealing this but I have been there and am a witness to what goes on. One can see Tibetan peasants turning the prayer wheels and one can also see the places where the military type indoctrination of Buddhist monks take place. I have received notes from Tibetan monks, who have given them at the risk of their lives, saying that Tibet is free, that the Dalai Lama is their leader and that we should tell the world. These are the messages which come from this cosmetically organised situation. At present, there are house to house searches by the People's Armed Police and the Public Security Bureau for any evidence of household shrines, altars, incense burners, tankards or pictures of the Dalai Lama. An anonymous telephone line has been set up &ndash; a helpline as they call it &ndash; which is a hotline where informers are encouraged to tell the authorities about anyone they suspect of practising Buddhism in private. This is religious repression on a scale which must strike a note with the people of Ireland, given our experience of penal laws.</P>
    <P>There is also resource exploitation. There is the question of how the Chinese have systematically raped the mineral and water resources of the Tibetan people. We have played a small role in this. I am sure the Minister knows of the controversial Dulan project which involved the resettlement of 58,000 Tibetan people &ndash; an enormous population transfer &ndash; and the construction of a dam. When the World Bank vice-president was in Ireland, a small number of members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs met him. Afterwards, I wrote to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, asking him to have Ireland's member on the board vote against this project. I received a letter from the Minister on 5 September indicating that our representative had voted against it and that the project had been rejected by the World Bank. We can play a role in this matter and it is very important we do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> At present there are projects to increase oil and gas exploration on the Tibetan plateau. The Tibetan Government in exile has issued a clear, precise statement against this. The representatives of the people of Tibet say the plans for major exploitation of oil and gas reserves in Tibet by PetroChina, in partnership with Western companies such as BP, ENI and AGIP, will cause harm for the Tibetan people. They call for an immediate halt to the construction of the Sebei-Lanzhou pipeline and the increase in exploration for gas and oil on the Tibetan plateau.</P>
    <P>Their position with regard to the development in investment in Tibet is clear. The Government in exile supports projects which benefit the Tibetan people and opposes those which cause harm. It does not want projects that facilitate the transfer of Chinese into Tibetan areas and so on. It believes the project will be harmful because it will employ a sizeable disproportion of Chinese and other non-Tibetans, deplete natural resources with little or no benefit to the Tibetan people, consolidate the Chinese control and occupation of Tibet and increase the Chinese Government's reason for maintaining control. It will facilitate the erosion of Tibetan culture and traditions, facilitate the transfer of Chinese settlers or workers to Tibetan areas, negatively affect the sustainability of Tibet's ecosystems and employ only a few Tibetans in skilled positions.</P>
    <P>It is very important to recognise the real situation in Tibet. I went there five years ago. The brief I was given by UNPO was to develop criteria and then to test the position there to see if it was a colonial situation. I can give the Minister a copy of the report we produced, which is very clear, rational and lucid. On every point, we ascertained that the situation in Tibet was a colonial one and a form of imperialism.</P>
    <P>In the past we had a habit of being practical, of looking at the <i>realpolitik</i>. I remember urging the Government from this side of the House not to get involved in the Iraq beef deals. I was told that while what I was suggesting might be moral, it was not in Ireland's economic interest and we could not afford it. That backfired terribly on the people of Ireland, who were left with a huge bill.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, one can do the moral thing and also reap a long-term benefit. I recommend the Minister to look at the works of distinguished economic analysts, such as Gerald Segal and Jonathan Mirsky, who have shown that China, far from being the economic giant that people imagine, is much more comparable to a country like Brazil. There are 250 million migrant agricultural workers travelling around that country. According to Jonathan Mirsky, the highest yield that international investor countries have received from China is about 3%. It does not represent either the economic threat or the golden egg we imagine.</P>
    <P>We can confront the Chinese position honourably. We need not antagonise them. We can do it calmly, clearly and coolly. The Minister will be <Col N="324" /> able to do that far better than I could because my passions are engaged in this issue. We can do it without losing the respect of the Chinese &ndash; instead, we will gain it. If we use this opportunity we will enhance our standing in the eyes of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am privileged to second the motion and thank the Senator for inviting me to do so. Senator Norris has made the general points. It is good he has put on the record the contribution Irish Governments made from 1959 to 1961 and in 1965, in particular, at the UN.</P>
      <P>This issue has exercised me since I was elected to the Seanad. A debate took place on this subject in 1989. The resolution, which was passed, was proposed by the former Senator Mary Robinson. We noted that 1.2 million Tibetans had been killed since the Chinese invasion. We were concerned that an estimated 2,500 monks, nuns and lay Tibetans were in prison without trial. We condemned the Chinese regime and urged the Irish Government to use and support all international measures.</P>
      <P>The situation has continued in the intervening 11 years and nothing much has happened since. What I said during that debate ties in very clearly with the points made by Senator Norris in his conclusion tonight. I said then:</P>
      <P>Nowadays, everybody needs China and everybody wants to be friends with China. If we are not friends with China, it can be a costly thing in terms of commercial and trade terms throughout the world.</P>
      <P>That is even more relevant today. I am very conscious we have had the highest level of communication with China over the past number of months, in terms of contact by the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach. It is hugely importantly that we deal with this as diplomatically as possible.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, his Department and the Government on achieving a place on the Security Council. I hope and believe we will serve with distinction there. This is one of the issues we should ask to be looked at.</P>
      <P>The measured tones of what Senator Norris said are very important. We do not need to put ourselves out of court in dealing with this. We can deal with this diplomatically and outline what is wrong. We can say to China that this is unacceptable, in terms of the global market, community, peace keeping and human rights.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris touched on some of these issues. It has been raised continuously with us over the past ten or 12 years that the country has effectively been raped by the Chinese Government. Any wealth, particularly gems, has been mined out of the ground by the Chinese and exported, at a time when there is no investment in health, education and various other rights which people should have there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The levels of deprivation of human rights in Tibet are hardly paralleled anywhere in the world. The Panchen Lama, who is 11 years of age, <Col N="325" /> has been imprisoned by the Chinese since he was seven years of age, without allowing any international access to him. No matter where we stand, that is in breach of every convention, from the convention on human rights to that on the rights of the child. It is ironic, and somewhat pathetic, to note that the Chinese invasion of Tibet took place on the same year as the UN declaration on human rights. Very few human rights have been available to the people of Tibet during that time.</P>
    <P>According to Amnesty International, there are nuns who have been imprisoned since the age of 13 years in Chinese prisons, which is totally unacceptable. In recent times, more than 11,000 monks and nuns have been expelled for opposing what is called patriotic re-education. If ever we needed to see the penal laws referred to by Senator Norris revisited, this is a precise example. This comes under what has been referred to by Amnesty International as the &ldquo;strike hard&rdquo; campaign of the Chinese forces.</P>
    <P>A huge number of the political prisoners are women. At a time when the world is so conscious of rights, it should be clearly understood that a quarter of the known political prisoners in Tibet are women. The ways they are being kept, and the lack of access to them, should also be known.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to raise at the highest possible level the issue of the invitation of foreign human rights delegations to Tibet. The Chinese Government has played a very clever diplomatic game by inviting, with great brouhaha, foreign delegations to visit Tibet. That looks good and gets a lot of coverage. However, unfortunately, when they get there they are denied independent access to Tibetans. The Chinese refuse to allow independent human rights organisations to investigate the human rights situation in Tibet.</P>
    <P>This mirrors what went on in East Timor and every other repressive regime. There is a fear of letting in international observers. We have learned over the years that before we can solve a problem we must let in the light and let people understand it. The Chinese Government has won the propaganda war in regard to Tibet because it does not allow information out of it and, therefore, the world is not as aware of it. One of the reasons for tonight's debate is to raise that awareness.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by mentioning what is the most appalling adverse approach to human rights and the right of people to express themselves and to have families &ndash; the child quotas operated by the Chinese Government against the Tibetan people. Tibetan people are only allowed to have one or two children, depending on where they live. They are forced to subscribe to a system of extraordinary strength in family planning policy. People are penalised for having more children than the number authorised. It is an appalling regime and I ask the Minister to deal with it on an emotive level, a human rights level and on a diplomatic level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> We have to convince the Chinese authorities that they have a huge market and that they can play a role on the world stage and be successful at it. Trade can be successful but we cannot continue to do business and interact with a regime which is so utterly repressive of political rights and, in particular, of the fundamental rights of children, women and families. This is a country where a population's culture, language and religion are effectively being wiped from the slate.</P>
    <P>The Minister is supportive of the motion. I ask him to follow in the footsteps of his illustrious precedessors in the UN by making a mark on this issue and ensuring that Ireland's voice is heard and leads the world in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion. It is a motion about human rights more than anything else and human rights is an issue we all must explore. Undoubtedly, the issue of human rights has come to the fore throughout the world but that has happened only in the last few years.</P>
      <P>Europe leads the fight for the extension of human rights values throughout the world, although it is not long since Europe was not a haven for people who wished to be involved in human rights issues. The history of Europe is not the history of a continent in which humanity was of the highest order. In Europe there have been the biggest and worst atrocities ever perpetrated. Regardless of whether atrocities are perpetrated on a religious or political basis, it was in Europe where the biggest and worst occurred. It is only in the last few years that Europe has got itself together, as it were, and been a leader in promoting the expression of human rights throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The Tibetans have endured an enormous problem over the last 50 years. It is suggested in the motion that this has only happened since 1950 but the Tibetans were under a feudal system before the 1950s. That feudal situation existed throughout the centuries and was horrific. The peasants and the ordinary people of Tibet were poor because of the overlords who were supposedly religious leaders. The invasion of Tibet by the Chinese did not improve the lot of the Tibetan people but it did not do them much more harm than was done to them in previous centuries.</P>
      <P>Tibet will never be free unless it is an autonomous country. It has never been an autonomous country. It was previously ruled by warlords who wore a religious uniform and, for the last 50 years, it has been ruled by the Chinese. The Chinese claim that Tibet is part of their area of responsibility. I am not sure whether the Tibetan people are better or worse off than they were before the Chinese invaded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris visited Tibet as a member of the foreign affairs committee. He got every opportunity to see what he needed to see. He was not inhibited in any way.</P>
      <P>Tibet's history was tumultuous. It is an area of the world about which we knew little until recently. We must ensure that whether it is an autonomous region of China or a separate country, the people of Tibet have every right to express themselves in political or religious terms. We must ensure that if the Chinese continue their control of Tibet, they accord to the Tibetans every human right which people in Ireland expect. I am not sure if that is possible. How can it be done without putting monitors all over one of the most remote countries in the world to watch what is happening?</P>
      <P>Resource exploitation is another issue of concern. How can we monitor whether the resources of Tibet are being exploited? I do not think there is any way of doing it. We often talk about warlords and the corruption of the leadership of countries in Africa. The corruption does not come from within Africa but from without. If people did not buy the oil or diamonds and did not exploit the resources of that continent, there would be no warlords or corruption. Corruption starts mainly from the outside.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that Ireland, through the United Nations and other international bodies, will try to get the Chinese, the overlords or controllers of Tibet, to give the Tibetans freedom of speech, freedom of accommodation and freedom from exploitation of their rights. They should have the freedoms enjoyed by the people of Ireland. I do not think that will be possible.</P>
      <P>Wherever human rights violations occur, whether it is in Ireland, Tibet or anywhere else in the world, Ireland must ensure, and it will have the opportunity to do so as a member of the Security Council in the next couple of years, that it is to the forefront in fighting for an improvement of the conditions of the people concerned. We must use our time on the Security Council to make certain exploitation, whether it is of tribes, parties, ethnic groups or the people in &ldquo;autonomous&rdquo; regions of major powers, and human rights violations do not continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him and the Government on attaining a seat on the Security Council. I also wish to reflect on some of the points which have already been raised, one being the strong position the Minister has inherited. Previous Ministers for Foreign Affairs, including Frank Aiken and Brian Lenihan, have represented a viewpoint on human rights, which reflected that of the Irish people, throughout the world. I can safely say our view on the nature of human rights and our concerns <Col N="328" /> in that regard have developed because of our domination by another country. We feel we have something to say and that it is our right to say it.</P>
      <P>Tonight's motion expresses the fact that people have something to say about what is happening in Tibet. The day we stop speaking about it will be the day the Tibetan people will be completely and entirely subjugated. We must continue to speak about the suffering of these people.</P>
      <P>I do not consider myself an expert on Tibet or its history and I bow to the knowledge of Senator Norris. He has had the opportunity of visiting Tibet and of talking to the people and I feel somewhat of a fraud discussing the issue without a deeper knowledge. However, my knowledge comes from the reading I have done and the parallels I have found between the history of Tibet since 1949 and the history of Ireland in terms of imperialism and colonisation. We cannot pussyfoot in terms of China simply because we need to trade with it. We must state things as they are  &ndash; I would not make a very good diplomat &ndash; and deal with the situation factually.</P>
      <P>The parallels with the people of Ireland are the subjugation not just of the nation but of its language and religion and the attempted annihilation of its culture. If we were still dominated by another country and the Government of that country decided Knock was to be demolished to make room for a hydro-electric station we would feel very upset. Yet a similar thing happened in Yamdrok Tsho. The late Panchen Lama stopped the hydro-electric station being located there as it is a place sacred for the people of Tibet. On his death, however, the authorities went ahead and built the station, affecting not only religion but the economy of the area, depleting some rivers, etc.</P>
      <P>The other parallels were mentioned by Senator Norris, including the transplanting of Tibetans, reminding me of the phrase &ldquo;To hell or to Connaught&rdquo;, and the bringing in of unskilled Chinese people for road building who are prisoners for political or other reasons. Tibetans charged with political or other crimes are being corralled and used for slave labour. These are things which have a parallel with the history of Ireland and which we find so naturally abhorrent. We have treated the Chinese Government lightly and very diplomatically and gently. I understand the Minister's role demands such an approach. Nevertheless I feel it is critical for us to condemn the Chinese in terms of the issues outlined.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by Senator O'Toole to the limitation on the family size for Tibetan people, a continuation of the policy which the Chinese imposed on themselves. However, certain Chinese people, if they live in areas of Tibet, are allowed to have more than one child. Sometimes they are allowed have two children depending on their education or their commitment to the area. I suppose the idea behind this is that in time they will outnumber Tibetans and that the Tibetan people will disappear completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> We can ask why China feels it has a right to colonise. China denies that what is happening is colonisation &ndash; they say there was never a break from the 13th century, that it was and is their country. However, most people with any learning would say that from 1913 to 1949 the Tibetan people had independence, that they established relationships and trade with other countries and as such were an independent state and have every right still to be such. Tibetan language, history and tradition are different from that of China.</P>
    <P>Why was China so adamant on taking Tibet? Resources, including mineral resources, were already mentioned as a factor. The other issue is that Tibet forms a buffer zone, in the same way as we were perhaps seen in Elizabethan times as a buffer zone between the rest of Europe. In the case of Tibet, the buffer zone offers China the possibility of distributing nuclear weaponry within it. The zone has been used and abused, an example of which are the agricultural reforms up to 1980 under which an effort was made to make Tibetans grow wheat when barley was their natural crop, creating starvation and wiping out people.</P>
    <P>There are many things which could be talked about, but I only know about the tip of the iceberg. Others know much more and I am sure the Minister has much background information supplied to the Department. The more the Minister reads this information, I am sure, the more he feels the people of Tibet must have support and that there must be voices raised continuously on their behalf. I commend to the Minister the five points raised in the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion we are debating provides an opportunity which I welcome to set out the policy and approach of the Government in regard to the people of Tibet. The very fact this debate is taking place reflects the extent of public disquiet in Ireland about the situation of the people in Tibet. From the many representations I have received and the questions asked in the Dáil, I am well aware of the depth of those concerns. In this context, Irish and international NGOs, including the Tibet Support Group and Amnesty International, have been active in drawing attention to reports of abuses of human rights. Among these abuses there are reports of torture, arbitrary arrests, detention without public trial and lengthy detention of Tibetan nationalists for peacefully expressing their political and religious views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tibet's history has at times been tumultuous. Tibet has not been helped by outside intervention. Indeed, the threat of European expansion, including earlier British and Russian rivalry, and the establishment of their spheres of influence affected in a major way Tibet's economic and political development in the latter half of the 19th and the early part of the 20th centuries. The net effect was for Tibet to turn itself into a closed country, isolated from outside developments and progress. The history of Tibet since the 1950s is <Col N="330" /> well known and it is unnecessary for me to repeat it.</P>
    <P>Tibet is one of several autonomous regions within the People's Republic of China and is recognised by the Irish Government as such. As the House is aware, Ireland, since the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979 has accepted the &ldquo;one China&rdquo; policy of the Government in Beijing. This is the context in which our broad approach must be seen and addressed.</P>
    <P>What can we do to improve the human rights situation in Tibet? Our objective is to highlight the abuse of human rights wherever it occurs and to take appropriate action at multilateral fora, such as at the UN Commission for Human Rights in Geneva, to secure human rights improvements. In addition, the question of human rights in China and Tibet is raised on every appropriate occasion in the course of our bilateral contacts with the Chinese authorities.</P>
    <P>During her visit to China in September, the Tánaiste took the opportunity to discuss human rights in China and Tibet with Premier Zhu Rongji. Last week in Seoul at the ASEM summit the Taoiseach pointed out to Premier Zhu and other Asian leaders our belief in the universality of human rights and explained how they are firmly established as a cornerstone of our foreign policy. He also made clear our intention to uphold the value and rights of the individual, in particular in the areas of freedom of expression, association and religion, irrespective of the level of economic development. They speak about Asian values and the priority they give to the achievement of a certain level of socio-economic development before other rights can be accommodated. We do not agree with their approach.</P>
    <P>China signed in recent years two key UN human rights instruments, the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This was a most welcome development and has been acknowledged as such both by Ireland in our bilateral contacts, and in EU-Chinese discussions. The next priority is the ratification by China of both of these covenants. Such early ratification and implementation by China of both covenants would be viewed not only as a sign but also as a concrete proof of their commitment to safeguard and guarantee the freedoms which are set out in them. We have offered to assist China in whatever way we can by sharing our experience of drafting legislation for compliance with UN international covenants and other conventions. A similar offer has been made to China by the European Union and we collectively have encouraged China to enter into enhanced co-operation with the specialised UN bodies.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House speaks of support at the international level for &ldquo;every possible measure to secure the human, civil, political and religious rights of the people of Tibet&rdquo;. Each of these rights is of course fundamental. I would <Col N="331" /> point out, however, that they are covered by only one of the two basic UN covenants, namely the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. The International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is of equal importance and is also of particular relevance in the case of Tibet. The Government, in its approach to Tibet, is concerned with economic, social and cultural rights and we will, therefore, be pressing for early implementation of both covenants by the Chinese authorities.</P>
    <P>In the framework of action undertaken by the United Nations, Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, visited China on several occasions. She engaged in a dialogue with the authorities there on a number of human rights concerns. Her office is also ready to assist China in moving to ratify the covenants. I understand that the question of the establishment of a technical co-operation programme between the Chinese authorities and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is under active negotiation and I look forward to the early signature by them of the agreement which would allow this programme to commence.</P>
    <P>While it must be acknowledged that there have been some improvements of the legal system and of social and economic rights in China, including longevity, health and literacy, I regret that little progress has been achieved on the ground, in particular regarding civil and political rights. We firmly condemn the continuing restrictions upon fundamental freedoms, including freedom of thought, expression, religion, assembly and association.</P>
    <P>The European Union has a dialogue with China on human rights of which the most recent round took place on 29 September last. This dialogue is not seen by us or by any EU partner as an end in itself but as a means to an end. Through the human rights dialogue, the European Union regularly discusses with China issues of serious human rights concern, including individual cases, the death penalty, conditions of detention and, of course, Tibet. Concern at the lack of progress in the dialogue has, however, led to the European Union agreeing to engage in a process of review of the dialogue, with a view to a more focused and result-oriented approach with tangible improvements on the ground. That review is ongoing. As recently as Monday of this week, when the EU-China summit took place in Beijing, this dialogue on human rights was also discussed at length. The European Union was represented at this summit by the Presidency, the Commission and the Secretary General-High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. There again the European Union objective was reiterated. The importance of early Chinese ratification of the two UN covenants was also stressed.</P>
    <P>In response, Premier Zhu informed the European Union of his hope that China will ratify the UN Convention on Social, Economic and Cul<Col N="332" /> tural Rights before the end of the year. In view of the importance which we attach to the cultural and linguistic identity of minorities, this would be of particular relevance to the people of Tibet, and I therefore hope that this timetable will be adhered to.</P>
    <P>While we will continue with our EU partners to improve the EU-China dialogue along the lines I have just indicated, I stress that the existence of this dialogue does not preclude the European Union from expressing publicly its concerns about human rights in China. It is in this context that in both 1999 and again this year the EU Presidency expressed serious concern at the human rights situation in China in its opening statements to the annual sessions of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>At the 56th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva last March, Ireland was fully associated with the European Union country statement in which deep concern was expressed, <i>inter alia,</i> about the fact that in China, despite some steps in the improvement of the legal system and social and economic rights, little progress has been achieved on the ground, in particular regarding civil and political rights. Continuing restrictions upon fundamental freedoms, including freedom of thought, expression, religion, assembly and association, were firmly condemned. The European Union expressed its concern in particular at the harsh sentences imposed on political dissidents calling for democracy in China, as well as at the alarming human rights situation in Tibet. The maintaining of administrative detention and the use of the death penalty were also highlighted as matters of particularly serious concern to the Union.</P>
    <P>The human rights situation in China will be raised by Ireland and its EU partners in the context of discussions at the current session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which deals with social and human rights issues.</P>
    <P>I welcome the co-operation which China extends to a number of UN treaty monitoring bodies. For instance, in May of this year, as a party to the UN Convention Against Torture, China's third periodic report was considered by the UN Committee Against Torture. I welcome the statement made by the Chinese delegation that it was a consistent position and principle of the Chinese Government to oppose and prohibit torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The conclusions and recommendations of the UN Committee Against Torture on the report appreciated and encouraged the continuing efforts of the Chinese Government to introduce amendments in its legislation and practices to bring them into line with international norms of human rights. In the concluding observations, however, concern was expressed about the continuing allegations of serious incidents of torture, especially involving Tibetans and other national minorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> I have outlined what we are doing in the UN General Assembly and its subsidiary bodies. Our commitment to human rights will be carried through in our work on the UN Security Council. As I made clear in the Dáil last week, our record at the United Nations over the past 45 years will guide our actions on the Council. Through our forthcoming membership we will have a unique opportunity to bring these principles into the heart of UN decision-making. We will be seeking to play a positive role in conflict prevention and resolution wherever the need arises. We will be responsive to those who elected us and to the wider membership. We envisage engaging fully and effectively across the whole Security Council agenda.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to speak about religious freedom in Tibet without speaking of the Dalai Lama. We on this island know very well the bitterness and distrust that can be associated with religious divisions. The recent visit of the Dalai Lama to Northern Ireland struck a chord in that he was warmly welcomed by both sides of the sectarian divide. It seemed that, coming from an entirely different religious tradition, he bore a message of reconciliation to a divided community.</P>
    <P>This is not the occasion to discuss the ongoing process of dialogue in Northern Ireland. However, everybody in this House will be only too familiar with the difficulties and challenges which dialogue can pose and the demands which it can make on patience and perseverance. As we have also seen, apparently insoluble and intractable problems can eventually yield to such efforts and they can be resolved by determination, imagination and courage. There is a further important feature of dialogue which I should emphasise, that is that it should not be described as &ldquo;pointless&rdquo; until at least it has been tried. I hope very much, therefore, that they will come when we might see dialogue in place between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities, on a mutually agreed basis and in a way that would address the fundamental issues of concern to both. The objective which should be shared by all is the welfare of the people of Tibet and the safeguarding of all their rights.</P>
    <P>I assure the House of the priority attention the Government will give to this issue and my intention to ensure that full information is made available to the House with regard to the progress that I sincerely hope will be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I came into the House with the hope that we would get a reply from the Minister which would be courageous, bold, full of action and promises of action on Tibet. Because the scripts are written in Iveagh House I know it is difficult to depart from those scripts and, given the diplomatic atmosphere into which politicians sometimes get seduced, to depart from that atmosphere. However, I was disappointed with the Minister's reply because if human rights in Tibet are being infringed and there is a problem, action <Col N="334" /> is required, not words. What is required is the Minister to say &ldquo;I am going to do the following&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister's contribution was an aspirational speech about dialogue and concern. If I was the Chinese Ambassador and I had read a copy of the Minister's speech I would be happy because I would say &ldquo;These guys are not going to do anything about Tibet but they are going to make all the right noises&rdquo;. There is a danger that the Minister's contribution will send signals to China, America and the great powers that Ireland will use its position on the Security Council to champion human rights cosmetically, to make the right sounds and achieve nothing at the end of the term.</P>
      <P>I refer to one or two phrases in the Minister's contribution. He continuously said the Tánaiste, for instance, took the opportunity to discuss human rights in China and the Taoiseach pointed out various issues. What is going on? It is no damn good these people discussing human rights. If the Tánaiste is concerned about human rights in Tibet or if the Taoiseach wants to point out the difficulties there, he or she should condemn them openly and proudly and assert Ireland's independence on this issue.</P>
      <P>It is no good pussyfooting around with countries such as China and allowing them to bully other countries. The Chinese for years have practised economic and territorial imperialism. If we continue to allow them to do so and if we make sweet sounds such as this and pretend that engaging them in dialogue will solve the problem we will play into their hands. They will unfortunately be happy to hear what the Minister had to say.</P>
      <P>He stated: &ldquo;We condemn the continuing restrictions upon fundamental freedoms, including freedom of thought, expression, religion, assembly and association&rdquo;. We know that but what will be done about it? I am long enough in this House and many Ministers for Foreign Affairs have come in to say Ireland is acting within the European Union and Ireland and its colleagues are great champions of human rights. Whenever I hear a Minister saying he and his European partners are doing something I know they are doing absolutely nothing. It means they have all got together and diluted the thrust of everything. They are doing nothing whatsoever and are hiding behind each other.</P>
      <P>One can be assured that while the Minister is delivering his speech to the Seanad and the Dáil about Tibet and saying he and his European partners are doing something about Tibet, there are guys in Brussels, Sweden and France delivering the same speech and they are doing absolutely nothing. The words &ldquo;European Union&rdquo; in the context of championing human rights or doing something in the foreign affairs arena are a guarantee of inaction and that is what the Minister said in his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find China, as a nation, offensive because it oppressed people in Tiananmen Square and because of its barbaric use of the death penalty. However, it is time that was said in the House. <Col N="335" /> I also find the United States offensive for those reasons because any country which systematically practises the death penalty should be condemned in this House. It is even more incumbent on us in Ireland given our history to take a stand alone on the Tibetan issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contribution was milk and watery. It does not bode well for our tenure on the Security Council. It signals that we will make all the right noises but at the end of the day the great powers such as the Chinese and American ambassadors will be happy with us because we will say lots and do absolutely nothing. The only thing the Chinese will understand is Ireland standing up to them, condemning them and initiating moves within the EU and the United Nations. I would like the Minister to make a pledge that he will initiate moves in the United Nations for stronger condemnation and to use his position on the Security Council to assert our independence and commitment to freedom.</P>
    <P>The Chinese care about world opinion because they care about trade and money, as do the Americans. That is the key to foreign affairs and diplomatic relations. Most wars are fought over trade and increasing the wealth of the invader and this is no different. We should launch a crusade which threatens trade with China. When we visit China and say we want to promote trade and then make mealy mouthed sounds about Tibet, the Chinese read the signals perfectly well. We mean we want trade but we must pay lip service to human rights in Tibet.</P>
    <P>This is a serious problem for the world and I congratulate Senator Norris for championing this problem as he did East Timor. It is a matter of conscience whether we take up the rights of small autonomous nations or pretend to do so. When Tibet was invaded many years ago it was a serious problem. It has been a problem which to our shame we have not been able to do anything about since but now that we are in a position to use our influence, it appears that perhaps we are defaulting and funking the function we have been given.</P>
    <P>This is a case of economic and territorial imperialism by the Chinese against the wishes of the people of Tibet. At the very least the Minister when he attends the Security Council should demand a plebiscite from the Chinese to ascertain public opinion there. I ask the Minister when he comes before the House again not to accept the mealy mouthed foreign affairs scripts he is handed and not to be seduced by the comfort of diplomatic language and by the fact that there is always a crying need for Ministers when they take up that office to somehow become engulfed in the culture of saying little and doing less. I support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>For a moment, I thought Senator Ross would declare war on China. I am not sure we could manage that. However, this is an important motion, which I am glad to support because a few comments should be put on the <Col N="336" /> record. We must realise the Tibetans are a distinct race. They are distinct from all their neighbours and the Chinese. They do not regard themselves as Chinese and the Chinese do not regard the Tibetans as Chinese.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the Chinese invasion in 1949 Tibet displayed all the attributes of an independent statehood recognised under its national law. It had a population, a defined territory, a government and the ability to enter into international relations. Nepal, Bhutan, Britain, China and India maintained diplomatic relations with Tibet's capital and the Tibetan foreign office also conducted limited relations with the United States when President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent emissaries to Lhasa to request assistance for the Allied war effort against Japan during the Second World War.</P>
      <P>During the four UN General Assembly debates on Tibet in 1959, 1960, 1961 and 1965, many countries expressly referred to Tibet as an independent country illegally occupied by China. It still is that today.</P>
      <P>Tibet's independent foreign policy is perhaps most obviously demonstrated by the country's neutrality during World War II. Despite pressure from Britain, the US and China to allow the passage of military supplies through Tibet to China when Japan blocked the strategically vital Burma road, Tibet held fast.</P>
      <P>The Chinese takeover constituted an act of aggression on a sovereign state and a violation of international law. The continued occupation of Tibet by China with the help of several hundred thousand Chinese troops represents an ongoing violation of international law and the fundamental rights of the Tibetan people. China tries to justify its occupation by saying that it &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; Tibetan society from a medieval feudal serfdom and slavery. It trots out this myth every time the issue is raised.</P>
      <P>As Senator Lanigan said, Tibetan society was by no means perfect. It was in need of changes, but it was not as bad as China would have us believe and it certainly was not a serfdom. As far back as 1960 the International Commission of Jurist' Legal Inquiry Committee reported: &ldquo;Chinese allegations that the Tibetans enjoyed no human rights before the entry of the Chinese were found to be based on distorted and exaggerated accounts of life in Tibet.&rdquo;  Whatever is the case, there is no justification for the Chinese claim that they &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; Tibetan society; it is invalid. International law does not accept justifications of this type. I encourage the Government to speak out as loudly as it can in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had no trouble speaking out when Iraq invaded Kuwait or in relation to East Timor. However, as many Senators said, speaking out against China means speaking out against a huge mass of people who are willing to buy goods. China has just been admitted to the World Trade Organisation. As Senator O'Toole said, the marketplace governs what is done. This is a pity <Col N="337" /> because we are witnessing the destruction of a people and a country.</P>
    <P>The so-called unity of nationalities is a key element of Chinese policies towards Tibetans. After the occupation of Tibet in 1949-51, this policy meant the introduction of collectivisation under Chinese rule. These social changes brought about the complete disruption of traditional Tibetan ways of life and of their social institutions. We witnessed the systematic destruction of more than 6,000 monasteries. Monks and nuns were killed or forced to give up their vows and hundreds of thousands of Tibetans were killed in warfare and by starvation or they were executed because they resisted the policies being forced upon them. The Chinese have encouraged mass immigration by Chinese into Tibet. Tibetan children are now losing their language because Chinese is taught along the borders and is moving more towards the centre of Tibet.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the Dalai Lama proposed a five point peace plan and we as a nation should not have much trouble supporting it. He proposed a transformation of the whole of Tibet into a demilitarised zone of peace and non-violence. Second, he proposed the abandonment of the Chinese population transfer policy which threatens the existence of the Tibetan people. Third, he proposed respect for the Tibetan people's fundamental human rights and democratic freedoms and, fourth, the restoration and protection of Tibet's natural environment and the abandonment of China's use of Tibet for the production of nuclear weapons and the dumping of nuclear waste. This is one of the most horrific aspects of the occupation. His fifth proposal was the commencement of earnest negotiations between the Tibetan people and the Chinese people. These negotiations broke down but I understand they are up and running again between Beijing and the Tibetan Government in exile.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the motion speaks of support at international level for every possible measure to secure the human, civil and political rights of the people of Tibet. He said that each of these rights is fundamental and he pointed out that they are covered by only one of two basic UN conventions. However, they are fundamental human rights. On 10 March 2000, the Dalai Lama said:</P>
    <P>Human rights are of universal interest because it is the inherent nature of all human beings to yearn for freedom, equality and dignity and they have a right to achieve them. Whether we like it or not, we have all been born into this world as part of one great human family. Rich or poor, educated or uneducated, belonging to one nation or another, to one religion or another, adhering to this ideology or that, ultimately each of us is just a human being like everyone else. We all desire happiness and do not want suffering.</P>
    <P>It would not kill us to support that aspiration or the five point plan the Dalai Lama put forward in 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> I am not sure what the Government can do, but it will do nothing if it remains silent. Fortunately, it is not remaining silent, but if we are to change things, we must accept that Tibet is not a province of China. It never was and never will be a province. It is a separate independent nation. When the Iraqis took over Kuwait, we immediately condemned them. Sanctions are still in place against Iraq. Although that is another matter, they have been in place for too long.</P>
    <P>When other nations were taken over by larger nations, we condemned it. We repeatedly spoke out about East Timor, and we should speak out on this matter. As Senator O'Toole said, the marketplace governs much of what we do and the 1.2 billion people in China might buy Irish products. However, it is a great price to pay for the freedom and individual liberties that the Tibetan people have lost. As an oppressed people, we should know exactly what that means.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will continue in the same vein and continue to press the matter at all levels. We cannot get the Chinese to leave there immediately, but if we say nothing, they will never do so. If we keep asking, they may do so some day. We have little power but whatever we have should be used on the diplomatic front. We should do what we can and encourage the Government in exile to continue its dialogue with Beijing and <i>vice versa</i>. Perhaps a resolution will come about as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of being a little jocose, I cannot resist making the point that the only people in the world who apparently do not like the Dalai Lama are the Chinese and the Democratic Unionist Party. It is a most interesting point.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs on securing a seat on the Security Council. However, the Department and the Minister should reflect on the scale of that victory by securing 133 from a possible total of 174. They should remember that this is a commentary on our past position and an act of faith that we will continue to maintain that position. We are regarded as people who are more or less honest brokers and who take the best, most honest and correct position on many issues of international conflict. We are not in the pocket or under the influence of any of the major powers, and I hope that position continues.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go over issues on which we are all agreed. We all agree about what is wrong. There is appalling military repression in Tibet. Its territory is occupied by a foreign army and it is under the control of a foreign Government. This Government is foreign in every possible definition. It is foreign in terms of language, religion, politics and every other way. We should begin to push away from the idea, to which I have never subscribed, that there is something other than an issue of colonial control involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know about the political repression and deportation and the effective cultural blitzkrieg <Col N="339" /> that has gone on for almost 50 years. We know about what is effectively a campaign of sectarian murder which has killed millions of Tibetans. We know it is essentially a colonial situation that is based on the belief of a large country that its own security interests and need to have access to resources are much more important than the rights of a small people in a small, and what they consider peripheral, country.</P>
    <P>We all know that, but strangely enough and contrary to what was said by some speakers in this debate, from the very beginning the issue of Tibet produced some resonance in this country. I was seven years old when the Chinese invaded Tibet and I clearly remember newspaper stories about the flood of refugees from Tibet led by the Dalai Lama. Somehow those events resonated with the Irish people, perhaps because we were focusing on the idea of religious repression by what was then perceived to be international communism. Due to that we have a wonderful, independent record on the Tibetan question as epitomised by Frank Aiken's words which Senator O'Toole quoted.</P>
    <P>We would be foolish to believe, however, that the position we used to take represents the position of the international community, which is not nearly as good at taking moral positions on these issues as its rhetoric would suggest. Led by the major powers and many others who aspire to be major powers, the international community is full of the rhetoric of human rights and the need to resist repression. Twice in the last ten years in the name of those values the western world has resorted to armed force &ndash; in Kuwait and, more recently, in Kosovo. The reality is that what has been done by China in Tibet, in terms of intensity, cruelty, brutality and duration, far exceeds the brutality of either the invasion of Kuwait or the behaviour of Serbians in Kosovo. The only difference is that China is not Serbia or Iraq. Morally and ethically speaking, in terms of scale, extremity and brutality there is no fundamental difference between the three instances I have cited. The difference in approach by the west is dictated simply by China's size and the west's belief in China's current strategic importance.</P>
    <P>In the good old days when the world was divided into good guys and bad guys, we could always condemn every abuse of human rights by one side, while ignoring those committed by the other side. It took me a long time to realise what people meant when they talked about the free world. I noticed that it included all the dictatorships of South America, South Africa under the old apartheid regime and Mexico which had not had a change of Government in 70 years. Then I realised that there was one common theme &ndash; the free world is the one which allows the so-called free market to operate. Once China decided to move into a neo-liberal style of economic order, it was effectively co-opted into the free world and it did not matter much what it did after that, in the same way as Indonesia was also regarded as <Col N="340" /> part of the free world following the bloody overthrow of President Sukharno 40 years ago. That is the problem. The free world is the one which is free to deal with economic affairs in the manner approved by the countries that benefit most from that situation.</P>
    <P>I have a problem with the tone of the Minister's speech. We appear to pussyfoot around China and that is not just a Government issue. It is a matter of considerable regret to me, and one I have raised frequently, that last year when we had a Chinese parliamentary delegation in the Houses of the Oireachtas, they insisted upon and were allowed the privilege of having their meeting with the Committee on Foreign Affairs in private.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was quite an unprecedented and appallingly wrong decision. We were made to operate to Chinese standards in our own freely elected Parliament. It was a profoundly wrong decision which allowed the Chinese to dictate the conditions under which they would come here. While I know that Senator Norris probably did wonderful things when he was in China, it would be a brave delegation that would try to dictate to the Chinese how to deal with us in a such a fundamental fashion. We allowed it to be done and I fear that we are allowing it to be done all the time.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the EU focus of the Minister's speech, which implies that appalling countries, like France &ndash; led, incidentally, by a member of the international grouping of which I am also a member &ndash; are happily preaching human rights out of one side of their mouths, while encouraging French companies, including the oil firm Agip, to become involved in the rape of Tibet's resources.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister rejected the idea of so-called Asian values. This is an excuse by corrupt and dictatorial regimes all over Asia to pretend that their position is logical. The winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize for Economics, Armytra Sen, is an Indian who vigorously rejects the idea that democracy and development are in any way in conflict. He has made the simple point that there has never been a famine in a democracy. Therefore, the best way to provide the most basic services for one's people is to institute democracy. When we hear the Chinese and all their friends in Asia talking about development in Asian values, we should tell them that is nonsense. Democracy is not a western idea, it is the most basic concept of human rights. Yet, that basic idea has been taken away in Tibet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extraordinary that we have accepted the right of a minority to secede in this island because they did not wish to be part of a single State. While we are vigorously, and with some pain for many people, accepting that right, we apparently do not accept the same right of a minority &ndash; who are far more diverse from China in terms of lang<Col N="341" /> uage, culture, religion and race than any of the people on this island &ndash; within what is now the People's Republic of China. We have accepted formally that they do not have a similar right.</P>
    <P>The issue of Tibet will be resolved ultimately, not by a compromise but by a decision and willingness to allow Tibet to be an independent State. There is a role for the language of diplomacy in the Minister's speech concerning all these matters. However, I am not aware of any such issues &ndash; whether in East Timor, South Africa or elsewhere &ndash; having been resolved solely by the language of diplomacy. It also needs figures such as Tom Hyland and Kadar Asmal to go beyond the language of diplomacy and describe reality as it is. The reality of Tibet is of a colonised country under the jackboot of an occupying power, using a level of repression and brutality that is only paralleled by such places as Kuwait under the Iraqis and Kosovo under Slobodan Milosevic. Whatever the Chinese may feel, it is better for everybody in the world for us to tell the truth about these things. It is only by telling the truth that the possibility of a resolution will emerge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Norris, as other speakers have done, for bringing this issue before the House. Human rights, freedom of religion and democracy are issues of international importance. If they are diminished anywhere, they are diminished everywhere.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Minister and especially the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, on the tremendous support she and the Department have given to the Burmese Government in exile. Burma Action Ireland brought the issue of the human rights atrocities in Burma to the attention of the people, and the Irish Government has been extremely supportive. The Department of Foreign Affairs sponsored a meeting of the Government in exile a month ago. It has only been able to meet for the second time since the elections in 1990. The Department has been very supportive in giving training to those people who are trying to set up an alternative Administration for Burma. It has given financial assistance towards bringing people here.</P>
      <P>Is it important that the great support given to the democratically elected Government of Burma, which is opposed by the military dictatorship, SLORC, could be because they are not people of great importance whereas the lack of action over Tibet could be because a large and important country is the cause of human rights suffering there? I think it is. Burma had elections in 1990 and the National League for Democracy won 82% of the seats. However, we have taken the concerns of this country much more to heart than we have those of the people of Tibet, even though their suffering has gone on for a great deal longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another interesting point was that Aung San Suu Kyi, that tremendously courageous woman who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, was <Col N="342" /> given freedom of the city of Dublin when Mary Freehill was Mayor. I heard murmurings about the Dalai Lama being given the freedom of the city and I do not know why it did not go ahead. Is our lack of courage regarding such instances because China is such a powerful country and, I regret to say, extraordinarily important in world trade terms and that this affects us much more than it should? We saw the son of Aung San Suu Kyi, Kim Aris, coming here and being rightly feted in the city, and we were all extraordinarily pleased and proud to see him accepting the freedom of the city on his mother's behalf. How much more pleased and proud we would have been if the Dalai Lama had also received the freedom of the city when he was here. The Prime Minister in exile, Dr. Sein Win, came here last year and was well received in the Republic and Northern Ireland by many political leaders, and we were delighted by that.</P>
    <P>It was good to see the great interest the Dalai Lama had in politics in Northern Ireland and it would perhaps have been good if we had had a reception for him here. The fact that those who fight for democracy in Burma have been elected is a strong point and makes a difference, but we need to re-examine the attitude of surrounding Asian countries to Burma. They have had little more interest in it than they have had in Tibet. If we wait for these countries to be helpful, especially when such a large neighbouring country is involved, we will be waiting forever. Now that the Government has a powerful position on the Security Council and is in a position to make better representations on behalf of Tibet, there must be less talk and more action.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention briefly the plight of Buddhist monks and nuns in Tibet. We know from newspaper reports that nuns have been appallingly tortured and raped. I also refer to a child who has not been referred to in the debate so far, namely, the Panchen Lama. Senators may remember about ten years ago when the old Panchen Lama was dying how outrageously he was treated by the Chinese Government. He had been a prisoner for many years and was treated horribly, even in his dying state. The Tibetan people decided on a child of about five as their new Panchen Lama. This was naturally the right of the Tibetan people, but the Chinese Government, realising after a few years this child's popularity within Tibet, decided on another child of its own who would be the Panchen Lama. The serious issue now is that both children and their families have been little in evidence for eight years.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ask the Chinese Ambassador what has happened? I asked when I attended an interparliamentary union meeting in Beijing what was the situation of both Panchen Lamas and their families and all I received as a reply was that they were well and in good health. That is not satisfactory and I ask the Minister to appeal to the Chinese Ambassador regarding the position of both these children and their families.</P>
    <Col N="343" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all my colleagues who took part in this debate and I thank the Minister. It is important that he was present, especially in the early part of the debate. I wish we had been given evidence that we were embarking on what Mr. Robin Cook called &ldquo;an ethical foreign policy&rdquo;. He did not live up to it and what we had in the Minister's reply was an extraordinary degree of intellectual confusion for which I doubt he was entirely individually responsible. For example, the statement about the one China policy is a backwards step from the position taken by Deputy Spring when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs. We are moving backwards and I regret and deplore it. It is undemocratic. Positions are being taken by mandarins which do not reflect the sentiments of the Irish people nor, I am glad to say, those of people in the House. It is most regrettable that these positions should be taken.</P>
      <P>I will not counter the musings of Senator Lanigan because they were effectively countered on the same side. The question of the alleged feudal basis of the regime under the Dalai Lama prior to 1950 has been so effectively countered that I need hardly refer to it. The Dalai Lama is central and is universally popular. I have been in Tibet, not as part of a Foreign Affairs delegation but was sent there by the Unrepresented Nations and People's Organisation in The Hague, and there is universal respect for the Dalai Lama.</P>
      <P>I say that there is intellectual confusion because of the reference to the one China policy. We are told we must accept that Tibet is part of China, something which no one in their right moral sense could possibly do and over which no international legal authority will stand. Therefore, how can Ireland maintain this position? We heard bland phrases about China giving a report on its human rights, that it is signing two instruments and that its third periodic report was considered. The Minister welcomed the statement by the Chinese delegation that it was a consistent position of principle of Chinese Government to oppose and prohibit torture. How wonderful.</P>
      <P>A report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 7 October stated that nuns were driven to suicide after Chinese torture. This is exactly contemporaneous with these statements which have been so easily and happily accepted by whoever wrote the Minister's script. This occurred in 1998 during the visit of the British Ambassador and two European colleagues. When he was outside the prison talking about human rights, the Chinese authorities were attacking and savaging the people inside, including five nuns who &ldquo;spontaneously&rdquo; committed suicide. Does anyone believe that?</P>
      <P>I recommend this report to the House to read and, in particular, for the glimpse it has given of the inside of a prison cell block for women political prisoners called Rukhag 3. The crimes for which these nuns were imprisoned included pasting protest posters on monastery walls, scattering leaflets or shouting reactionary slogans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> What would the House think if this happened in Ireland, which it might have 250 years ago? Would we be comforted by the notion we had been absorbed into a larger entity and that we would get human rights when that entity considered it right to give us them, but that major economic forces were dictating against that?</P>
    <P>The European Union-China dialogue has produced no tangible result whatever, except to assist in the murder of five nuns. It is clear China looked on that dialogue as a sign of weakness and a means of endlessly deferring any pressure to ratify the United Nations convention. This was exacerbated when the United States detached the whole question of most favoured nation status from human rights considerations.</P>
    <P>I know the Chinese have said there is religious freedom. I have a statement here from the Chinese, which says they respect religious freedom for all the citizens of China, including Tibet. It then goes on to say that backward beliefs must be cast aside by Tibetans as they develop a modern civilisation. It says that, as society progresses, some decayed, backward, old customs that bear a strong tinge of the feudal serf system have been abandoned, which reflects the Tibetans' pursuit of modern civilisation and a healthy life, as well as the continuous development of Tibetan culture in the new era. In other words, while they are prating about religious freedom, on one hand, they are, on the other, oppressing the people who wish to exercise their rights to religious freedom.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record the precise Chinese policy. I have an official document of the Chinese authorities with responsibility for Tibet, who met in Chengdu under Chenkuiyan, the Tibet autonomous region party secretary. His subsequent communication to Beijing this year stated, first, that they must gradually stamp out this Tibetan so-called religion and culture until they are reduced to mere museum pieces, without the current ability to influence generation after generation of people. Second, the Dalai Lama and their so-called exiled government in Dharamsala are the main impediment to peace and stability in Tibet and, therefore, they should uproot them.</P>
    <P>Under the patriotic re-education campaign which was launched in 1997, religious repression has been waged with mounting ferocity. The Chinese Government recently issued four prohibitions &ndash; first, a prohibition against faith and religion; second, a prohibition against the installation of religious altars, prayer flags, Dalai's photographs and other religious symbols in homes; third, a prohibition against participation in religious or other activities of blind feudal faith and, fourth, a prohibition against sending children outside the jurisdiction to schools run by the Dalai.</P>
    <P>Imagine if this were Ireland, in a human rights context. I remember a previous Government, which was so jittery that, on official advice from the Department, there was an attempt to prevent Mary Robinson meeting the Dalai Lama. She <Col N="345" /> managed to engineer an accidental meeting. Thank God, President McAleese was able to meet and directly converse with the Dalai Lama in Belfast in the past few days. I congratulate her on her courage and I wish the Government had similar courage.</P>
    <P>My colleague mentioned the Panchen Lama. However, there is also Nawang Sangdrol, who was sentenced to 21 years for singing independence songs, and Nawang Choephel, an ethnic musicologist, imprisoned as a spy for studying Tibetan traditional music. When his mother met him for the first time after five years she had to ask him if he was her son. Imagine that in an Irish context.</P>
    <P>It is very important for us to do whatever we can for the people of Tibet. We owe it to them. If we are serious about peace &ndash; and we blather and prate about peace all the time &ndash; it is incumbent upon us to stand behind and support the one world leader who has consistently maintained a position of non-violence. If we do not, and if the young Tibetans find they are no longer able to control their anguish and break out in physical violence against the Chinese, we will be as guilty as the Chinese for any blood that follows.</P>
    <P>I made two suggestions, which are not terribly adventurous. I hope the Department, with this new opportunity, will take them up. The first suggestion was that we should offer the possibility of a framework and location outside the limelight for a meeting between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government in Ireland if we are serious about assisting in this situation.</P>
    <P>The other suggestion related to the economic question. There are 1.3 billion people in China but the economy is in chaos. As I said, it has been compared to Brazil. It is not an enormous market, eagerly waiting to acquire European products. Some 90% of those people have an annual income of less than $200. How many fridges are they likely to buy out of that? I appeal to the Minister and the Department to seize the opportunity, not to go for the easy solution, to listen to the voices of people in this House and the Irish people and to follow in the tradition of the position we took on East Timor. That position did not come from a Minister, a political party or the mandarins in Iveagh House, but from a decision by the people of Ireland. Any Government or official that takes this position&mdash;</P>

      <P>The matter I have tabled concerns another piece of good news with which the Department and the Government have been involved. The Mitchell scholarship programme is a flagship initiative of the US-Ireland Alliance, a Washington based non-profit organisation dedicated to strengthening the ties between the United States and the island of Ireland for future generations. Trina Vargo, Senator Edward Kennedy's Irish administrator for many years, was the brains behind this foundation and she deserves much credit.</P>
      <P>The idea was to establish a prestigious, competitive, national scholarship that enables American university graduates pursue a year of study at institutions of higher learning on the island of Ireland. Modelled after the Rhodes scholarships, it was named after Senator George Mitchell, in honour of his contribution to the peace process. The long-term objective is to have future leaders in America who know Ireland and are committed to the relationship. The scholarships are awarded to individuals between the ages of 18 and 30 who have showed academic distinction, commitment to service and potential for leadership.</P>
      <P>During President Clinton's 1998 visit to Ireland, the Taoiseach announced the Government would provide a £2 million endowment for the establishment of the Mitchell scholarships. The Bill passed the Houses of the Oireachtas with all-party support. In this House, Senator Quinn ensured some of the scholarships could be taken up in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding has been provided by an anonymous donor, the British Government, Bombardier, Cross Atlantic Capital Partners, Mutual of America, Verner Liipfert Bernard McPherson and Hand and many others. The universities in Ireland and Northern Ireland have waived tuition fees and are providing housing for the scholars. The scholars are given an $11,000 <Col N="347" /> stipend and USIT is providing a travel stipend so the scholars may travel throughout the island of Ireland, the United Kingdom and Europe.</P>
    <P>In this the first year's competition, 12 impressive young Americans were selected from more than 250 applicants in a nationwide competition. At least one student is attending each of Ireland's seven universities and Northern Ireland's two universities. To ensure these scholars enjoy their time in Ireland the Minister, Deputy de Valera, has provided Dúchas passes so the scholars may visit historic sites during their stay, the National Trust is providing them with similar opportunities in the North, the Royal Irish Academy is providing use of its facilities and the Abbey Theatre is providing theatre tickets. I am sure many others will come forward to help ensure that these scholars enjoy their stay here. Many Members of the Oireachtas have promised to give them meals in the House and, since there are so many of them, they will be delighted to get invitations from others as well.</P>
    <P>They are incredibly impressive people and will make a big difference in the universities to which they have been affiliated. Edward Augenblick from Colorado, a graduate of Georgetown University, has gone to the department of mathematics at University College Dublin. Rebecca Blustein, from Piedmont, California, is enrolled for an MA in medieval Irish history at Maynooth. Erin Breeze from Nederland, Colorado, is enrolled at the University of Limerick doing peace and development studies. Traci Donovan from Cleveland Heights, Ohio, is at University College Galway and will be working for the Irish Centre for Human Rights. Mikela French is from Idaho Falls and Boise State University in Idaho and is a science graduate but over here she is in the Queen's University Irish studies programme. Desha Girod of Wayne, Pennsylvania, is doing peace studies at the School of Ecumenics.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that it is not just people with Irish names and Irish connections who wish to come here. Winifred Li from La Brea, California, is in University College Cork studying English and is particularly involved in Celtic literature. Gabriel Paquette from Brooklyn, New York, is in the MA programme in culture and colonialism at University College Galway. Rachel Rebouche from Bossier City, Louisiana, is in Queen's University in the department of legal studies. Rebecca Reichert from Crystal Lake, Illinois, is doing a degree in biomedical sciences at the University of Ulster. Laela Sturdy from Cooper City, Florida, has a degree in biochemistry and is in the M.Sc. programme in multimedia systems at Trinity College. Thomas Vitolo is a mathematician from North Carolina. He has a degree in economics and computer science and is now in the financial and industrial mathematics programme at Dublin City University.</P>
    <P>To have people of such high calibre joining these programmes means that not only they but <Col N="348" /> the other students in the departments to which they have become affiliated will benefit. My reason for putting down this motion is that the Department is supposed to produce a report on the fund every year. Sadly, too many reports do not come before the Houses of the Oireachtas because there is so much other work before them. I would not like it thought that there is a lack of interest in this programme and that is why I have asked the Minister to give the first report tonight. Again, I congratulate the Minister on the science fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for her warm and gracious remarks pertaining to the investment we are making in science and research. Our national development plan, which is costed at in excess of £40 billion, includes a figure of almost £2 billion for research, technological development and innovation. The Senator has outlined how we propose to spend that funding and how we have commenced spending it. She has been a great champion of research and science in this country and has been of great assistance to me, in my capacity as Minister of State, over the last three years.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to address Seanad Éireann on the operation of the George Mitchell scholarship fund. The Senator is no doubt aware of the Taoiseach's announcement, on 4 September 1998, during the visit of President Clinton to Ireland that the Government would contribute an endowment of £2 million to a new scholarship scheme to enable highly qualified American students to attend certain third level institutions in Ireland. The British Government has made an endowment towards the funding of two scholars and endowments have also been made by a number of private individuals, as was outlined to the House by Senator Henry.</P>
      <P>The scheme is known as the George Mitchell scholarship scheme in recognition of Senator Mitchell's contribution to building lasting peace in Northern Ireland. I was deeply honoured in autumn 1998 to inaugurate the scholarship in the United States, on behalf of the Government, with Senator Mitchell in the presence of many of his colleagues and friends from politics, business, law, science, the education and academic sectors and particularly from Irish America. Tonight, on behalf of all Irish people, I sincerely thank Senator Mitchell for his unique and wonderful contribution to facilitating a meeting of minds to ensure mutual understanding on the island of Ireland and to ensure that we work together to sustain lasting peace. We hope we will not let Senator Mitchell down and that we will be able to build on that peace in the years ahead. I am confident wise counsel will prevail and positive attitudes will be the order of the day during the serious discussions taking place in Northern Ireland over the next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> The scholarships are intended to be a highly prestigious award which will attract the best students in American universities. I agree with Senator Henry that there was huge interest across America in the scholarships. It will be similar to the Rhodes scholarships which bring American students, including President Clinton in his time, to Oxford University. Each scholar will follow a course of study in an Irish university or institute of technology and, in addition to their tuition, fees and accommodation expenses, each student will receive a stipend of $11,000.</P>
    <P>In order to contribute its endowment, the Government was required to bring forward legislation. The George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Act, which was signed into law on 23 December 1998, empowers the Minister for Education and Science to establish the new fund in the United States, to enter into agreement with persons who will manage and control the new fund and to pay into the fund the sum of £2 million. I will take this opportunity to outline the position in relation to institutions which George Mitchell scholars may attend. Scholars under the new scheme may attend an Irish university, any institute of technology, the Irish School of Ecumenics or, in Northern Ireland, a university or other institution of higher education which the Minister specifies provided that institution and any other relevant authority consents to the presence of the students.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to the House to know that the fund is now managed and controlled in the United States by US-Ireland Alliance. Based in Washington DC, US-Ireland Alliance is a non-partisan, non-profit making organisation composed of members from both the USA and Ireland which is aimed at consolidating existing relations between the USA and Ireland, North and South, and building that relationship for the future. US-Ireland Alliance carries out is functions in accordance with an agreement entered into with the Minister for Education and Science under the 1998 Act and executed on 8 March 1999. The agreement covers such matters as the control and management of the new fund, criteria as to the academic standard necessary to receive a scholarship and disbursements managed from the fund.</P>
    <P>Selection of scholars is approved by a selection committee based on recommendations made to it by US-Ireland Alliance. The income from Ireland's endowment will meet the administration costs involved in the nationwide campaign in the USA for these awards in addition to funding two scholarships. The first Mitchell scholars are currently beginning their studies.</P>
    <P>The Minister is required under the terms of the 1998 Act to prepare an annual report on the operation of the fund and a copy of the report, the audited accounts and a copy of any auditor's report must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Department of Education and Science is currently in the process of preparing <Col N="350" /> this report and has recently requested the US-Ireland Alliance to provide details of the operation and administrative budget for the programme as well as information on the successful scholars, their courses of study, the institutions they will be attending and their benefactors. As soon as these details are available, the first report will be laid before the Oireachtas in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Henry for her warm words and for bringing this important motion before the House. It is appropriate that we discuss it now. We wish everybody involved in Northern Ireland affairs every success, particularly over the next weeks, months and years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I have raised this matter as a result of representations made to me by the VEC in County Roscommon, the parents' council, teachers and people in general in the Elphin area who are extremely concerned with the slow progress in the provision of the new accommodation at Elphin post-primary school.</P>
      <P>Elphin post-primary school has 104 pupils and 14 teachers, with 11 subjects at junior cycle and a full range of subjects at leaving certificate level. Unfortunately, the school must work from two campuses which are a half mile apart. At all times two classes, with 20 in each class, must be located on a campus half a mile from the main building. This is a totally unsatisfactory method of addressing the needs of the pupils in the Elphin area. It has a knock-on consequence in that many pupils are leaving the area to attend schools outside Elphin because of the inappropriate facilities provided. Parents feel aggrieved that their children have to walk half a mile along the streets of Elphin in rain, frost and snow to get from one classroom to another. I know of nowhere else where this type of operation would be allowed continue.</P>
      <P>As far back as January 1999 a deputation consisting of the chief executive officer and chairman of Roscommon VEC, Monsignor Travers, the bishop's representative, representatives of the school's board of management, parents' representatives and public representatives met with the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, and outlined the difficult situation. The second campus, bad and all as it was, was no longer going to be available as there is only a yearly lease on it and it is costing a large amount of money. Therefore, it is probable that the facility currently being used will not be available to Elphin post-primary school in the future.</P>
      <P>The school identified a site which was available and which has been bought and paid for, but the necessary further steps have not been taken. While some movement has taken place, it has been at a very slow pace which has resulted in great anger in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> The representations I have had are strong. I would be negligent in my duty as a public representative if I did not outline in stark terms what has been brought home to me by parents' representatives, teachers and the chief executive officer of the VEC. They feel that the necessary strands are not being pulled together, and that is why I raise this issue. I ask the Minister to give this matter priority and that the totally unacceptable situation in Elphin be immediately addressed so that the town and catchment area has proper facilities.</P>
    <P>A site has been provided and we are awaiting plans and then a contract to provide new accommodation. It is not a major task for either the office of the Minister, which I know has great interest in it, or the building section of the Department. It is a matter of bringing all the strands together so the wishes of the people, and the decision of the former and current Ministers to provide accommodation, is put into practice.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach comes from the area and I know he fully supports this proposal. He has attended the public meetings and the deputations in support of the parents, teachers and pupils, as have other public representatives. Two years have passed since the application was made to extend the school and since the first deputation to the Minister. We need action and a positive response. I must report back to the parents and the board of management next week and I do not want to return empty handed.</P>
    <P>I ask that this matter be given the utmost priority so we can report favourably to the people of Elphin, the authorities in the school and County Roscommon VEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Teacy Mr. Teacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Teacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to discuss the provision of new accommodation at Elphin post-primary school in County Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I would like to outline the background to this project. Our Department received an application from County Roscommon VEC in February 1999 for the provision of an extension to Elphin vocational school. The VEC also requested funding from the Department to purchase a site at the rear of the school to accommodate the proposed extension. The VEC was subsequently requested to complete an ST1 Form and an educational worksheet. These are policy documents that set out a school's curricular options and are required by the Department of <Col N="352" /> Education and Science to determine the need for additional accommodation at a school.</P>
    <P>Following an analysis of these documents by a senior inspector within our Department, a schedule of accommodation for the extension to Elphin vocational school was prepared in July 1999. The new extension will provide a number of specialist rooms, a library, a general purpose/dining cum PE area, staff accommodation, toilets and stores. In total, the new extension will provide a total of 952 square metres of additional accommodation at the school and will represent a substantial investment in the educational infrastructure of the region.</P>
    <P>Additionally, this project will be funded under the national development plan. I am pleased to inform the House that County Roscommon VEC acknowledged acceptance of the schedule of accommodation in October 1999. A design team was duly appointed by the VEC to commence the architectural planning process and this is ongoing.</P>
    <P>Roscommon VEC has recently been requested to instruct its design team to prepare and submit a stage 1 outline &ndash; site suitability, briefing and site report &ndash; to the Department's building unit. This submission is to incorporate pre-stage 2 &ndash; outline sketch scheme &ndash; options. Once this report is received and evaluated by staff in the building unit of the Department in Tullamore, a planning and briefing meeting will be held with a view to progressing the project.</P>
    <P>Regarding the VEC's request for funding from the Department for the purchase of a site to accommodate the new extension at Elphin vocational school, I am pleased to relate that the Department provided £30,000 for the purchase of this single acre site last July. I can assure the Cathaoirleach, Senator Finneran and Members that every effort will be made to have the architectural planning of this important project expedited.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to what Senator Finneran said. He has made an excellent case on behalf of the people of Elphin. This is obviously a very worthy educational project which deserves our full support. I intend having an immediate discussion with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, regarding the matter and will request that priority be given to having a positive conclusion so proper facilities are provided as quickly as possible for the children of the Elphin area.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26 October 2000.</P>
