      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to clarify if the Office of Public Works intends to vacate the depot at the military barracks, Summerhill, Nenagh and if so, to outline the reasons and when it will take place.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Quill of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to address the issue of the future preservation and protection by the State of the 700-acre Mount Congreve Estate, Waterford, which has one of the world's larger and more important collections of rare trees and shrubs.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ridge of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to address the discrimination against twins by equalising the monthly child benefit for twins with those of other multiple births.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tom Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to explain the reasons why the school bus which takes students to Cappawhite national school will not collect children in the Philipstown area of County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I have also received noticed from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Defence to provide accommodation for the Phoenix youth project in St. Bricin's Hospital, accessing directly from O'Devaney Gardens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators O'Meara and Quill and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1 and 17, motion 17, the motion to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m and business to resume thereafter if not previously concluded. Business to be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>Thank you. The day of the debate on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill is one of the days when the poor resources with which ordinary Members must work are contrasted with the army of advisers who accompany the Minister. The Minister will have two or three officials to advise him on every section of the Bill while the poor Senators will do a wonderful job with effectively no resources at all. This demonstrates the lot of legislators who have to compete with the level of advice being offered to the Minister. This happens under every Government but it will be demonstrated very dramatically today.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Lord Mayor of Dublin on her decision to invite the Orange Order to march in Dublin later this year. We are very ready in this part of the country to speak about tolerance and diversity of culture but our track record in these matters is not good. This morning we heard the two polar voices of Irish bigotry on the same radio programme, &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. We heard that the DUP in Ballymena have refused to confer a civic honour on Liam Neeson and very bigoted remarks were made by a DUP representative from there. An hour later we heard the obverse of the same surly bigotry from a Sinn Féin councillor who implicitly threatened the Orange Order if they held their march in Dublin. The decision of the Lord Mayor gives us an opportunity to put into practice what we preach so frequently in this House, that is, the tolerance of all traditions and cultures on this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of my independent colleagues and friends, I endorse the Order of Business. I congratulate the Leader on arranging for the portraits of former Leaders to be hung in prominent positions in the House. Furthermore, I congratulate him on the measurements of the portraits. The largest portrait, coincidentally, is of the latest Leader. It is two square inches larger <Col N="1067" /> than the others. Has this been done by accident or by design?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to the Order of Business. I concur with Senator Manning's remarks about the scarcity of resources for Senators. The Leader has often pointed out that between 30% and 40% of legislation is initiated in this House. In these circumstances, the role of the House is changing dramatically and the lack of resources is more apparent than ever. If we are to do our job properly we must examine the resources available to enable Senators to present their case in the best and most beneficial way.</P>
      <P>Again I ask for a debate on the housing crisis. I am constantly amazed at how we can live with anomalies in our society. Land which was sold two years ago by a member of the farming community for £17,000 is now being rezoned by Meath County Council and its value will rise to £450,000 per acre. The land is worth 26 times what it was bought for two years ago. We can control wages by national wage agreements but we do not seem to be able to control the price of land. There is a need for a full-scale debate to identify the inadequacies and the anomalies in our attempts to make reasonable provision for those in need of housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Manning in extending a welcome to the Orange Order should it choose to march in Dublin. I find it strange that a comparison is being made between the Garvaghy Road and what may happen here. The comparison is an invidious one. It is a pity that Orange men and women do not come to the Republic more often because they would discover that they have nothing to fear from us and that we do not pose any threat to them. The best example I could give is what happened in Lansdowne Road when Ulster won the European Cup in rugby. It is worth reminding those who had such comments to make that they are entitled to walk freely through Bodenstown annually.</P>
      <P>I realise that we had a debate on Northern Ireland recently but events have moved on in terms of the statements made by Mr. Trimble and others and developments over St. Patrick's weekend. It would be useful for the House therefore to return to the issue at an early stage.</P>

      <P>Will it be possible to discover what way the Government is thinking on the taxation of bed and breakfast establishments and small family run guesthouses? There is much confusion on the issue in terms of what will happen. Many small family run guesthouse owners are extremely worried as the imposition of a tax could put them out of business.</P>

      <P>This is the fourth time in as many weeks that I have requested the Leader of the House to invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to debate with us the <Col N="1068" /> issue of litter, about which the dogs in the street are talking. The Minister's failure to discuss it with us in a rational way fills me with puzzlement. Is he afraid to face the music? I repeat my request and stress that it is an urgent matter. The Leader of the House should see to it that the debate takes place not later than next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support Senator Manning's remarks regarding the lack of research facilities available to Members of this House. I also support his other remarks. Size was mentioned. Whatever about portraits, size does matter. In that context I very much welcome An Bord Pleanála's landmark decision yesterday relating to Liffey Valley which was based on the best interests of the environment. Retail outlets should be located near where people live, not several miles away. Our roads are being choked. I hope this decision will have a suitably advantageous knock-on effect for the benefit of provincial towns and villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those who have spoken about the litter problem. There is a need, as Senator Manning said, for an informed debate. How the problem of litter can be eliminated and refuse can be dealt with is being debated throughout the country. Groups are paying experts from Europe and the United States to come here, yet Members of this and the other House do not the resources to have a meaningful debate which may lead to the minimisation of waste to the greatest degree possible. Why should we not have access to the resources that are available to every dog in the street? I agree with everything Senator Manning said in this context.</P>
      <P>The Orange Order has been a very bigoted group in the past. In various counties there used to be Orange parades which were broken up at certain stages. It was population decline which suddenly drew them to County Donegal. At mass this morning the Pope spoke about differences and the need to reunite the peoples of the world. The people of the North and South should take account of what he said. If we are not afraid to confront differences on this island we can succeed. The &ldquo;don't be afraid&rdquo; syndrome should therefore replace the &ldquo;we are afraid&rdquo; syndrome at the Orange parade in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader of the House draw the attention of the Government to the need to provide a proper place for the assessment and care of disturbed teenagers? I fully support the view expressed in the High Court yesterday by Mr. Justice Kelly when he had no choice but to send a young girl, against his will, to the Central Mental Hospital for assessment. It is very important that disturbed teenagers are not admitted to mental hospitals if they are not mentally ill. In this day and age this is not too much to ask.</P>

      <P>On my way to the House this morning from Ballsbridge I observed that there was only one passenger in seven out of every ten cars. In the context of economic development and the provision of infrastructure this cannot be sustained long term. There is a need for a change of attitude to the utilisation of resources. The Irish Architects Association has expressed concern about our ability to meet the housing targets set in the national development plan. This is worthy of debate. The Minister should be invited to discuss with us the issue of how the targets set in the national development plan can be met. There is a need to make certain changes at local authority level to provide the planning structures required to enable us achieve the targets set.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Quill's call for a debate on the litter problem which is becoming a source of huge embarrassment in certain parts of the country. Huge progress has been made in beautifying our cities, towns and villages but the litter problem continues. It presents a particularly bad image to tourists. It also affects our pride. Unless it is tackled in a radical way progress will not be made. A debate in this House would be a good starting point.</P>

      <P>I commend the House on promoting the Irish language by having statements from time to time. Will the Leader convey to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government my concerns and those of others who complain that a number of local authorities are erecting signs in the English language only? It is important that every local authority adopts a bilingual approach.</P>
      <P>I support the call of Senator Quill and others for a debate on litter. Every local authority from the biggest to the smallest should employ litter wardens and hit the litter bug where it hurts &ndash; in the pocket. That is the only way to teach them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to intervene to prevent the threatened bus strike from going ahead? She successfully did so on the last occasion. There is talk of a one or two day stoppage on Friday and Saturday. As with all strikes, if it is allowed to go on, those involved will have to sit down and settle it at some stage. If it is true that bus drivers are earning around £250 per week it is a national disgrace. Junior barmen get more than that and they do not have to put up with what bus drivers must put up with in this city. All strikes must be settled at some stage. If at all possible, the Minister should instruct CIE management to sit down and talk to those people and avoid the discomfort which would be caused by another bus strike.</P>

      <P>In response to Senator Manning on the Order of Business, we are taking No. 2, the motion for early signature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Manning, Dardis and Lanigan welcomed the announcement of the Lord Mayor's <Col N="1070" /> invitation to the Orange Order to hold a peaceful and orderly march in Dublin in May. As far as I am concerned, they are as welcome as the flowers in May. We in the 26 Counties have always prided ourselves on our freedom of expression. Anyone who wants to participate in an orderly fashion will be most welcome.</P>
    <P>I have found that many of these events can be very uplifting. When a representative from the Grand Lodge of the Orange Order came down to Drumree, which is just five miles from my home in north Westmeath, a dear neighbour of mine was asked by a member of the media what he thought of him marching through Drumree. He said that he could march a hundred times a day if he wished and he could feel free to do so if he was doing it in an orderly way. As Senator Lanigan said, if it will reunite all sections of the people on this island, then let it be.</P>
    <P>I observed Senator Ross's comments but he is not here to hear me reply.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello called for a debate on housing. As I said the last time there was a call for such a debate, I welcome the plan of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to build 500,000 houses in the next ten years, a house for every eight persons on the island. I am proud to be part of a Government which has started to plan and implement that.</P>
    <P>I will pass on Senator Caffrey's views to the Minister for Finance. I understand he has a good personal working relationship with and the admiration of the Minister on financial matters. Perhaps the Senator will take this up with him later this morning on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>Senators Quill, Lanigan and Ó Murchú called for a debate on litter and I will provide time for such a debate. Of course there are many regulations and laws available to local authorities, of which many Senators are members, and they should appoint litter wardens, as Senator Glynn pointed out. Most towns and villages are beautiful on a Friday evening but on Saturday, Sunday and Monday mornings they are a disgrace. The takeaways cause the problem because their customers throw the packaging on the streets.</P>

      <P>It is these premises which are responsible for the people who are littering and, therefore, they be targeted immediately. That is simple to implement and control. Video camera systems may be available in all towns and villages. Such video evidence is available in Dublin if Dublin Corporation wants to implement it immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will pass on the views of Senators O'Dowd and Chambers to the Minister. I will also pass on the views of Senator Glynn on bilingual signs to <Col N="1071" /> the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Bohan called for something to be done about the imminent bus strike as a matter of urgency. He said that a bus driver of ten years is earning only between £250 and £260 per week. That is the nub of the problem. Not many people will want to become bus drivers. It is a matter of the company addressing the problem now rather than leaving it for a number of weeks if the strike takes place. I will pass on Senator Bohan's views to the Minister. It is easy to see why there is a problem and why the strike is imminent.</P>

    <P>NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;Where a claimant proves for a year of assessment that income received by him or her consisted of dividends paid by a credit union within the meaning of the Credit Union Act, 1997, of an amount not greater then £750, the first £375 of such income shall be disregarded for the purposes of calculating his or her liability to income tax for that year of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. He has already been over this ground in the other House and it has been a matter of considerable public discussion in the media over a period of weeks. However, my proposal is modest, that the first £375 of income from dividends, which are not greater than £750, which are paid by a credit union to a depositor should be disregarded for the purposes of calculating liability to income tax in the year of assessment. That clearly puts modest parameters on the amount of income tax which should be disregarded.</P>
      <P>This is desirable when one considers the role of the credit unions and the profile of the credit union membership. When one contrasts the credit unions with the banks and the other financial institutions, the difference is that credit unions are self-help, voluntary organisations and certainly in urban areas their membership consists by and large of very small savers indeed. They are the type of people who do not have substantial bank accounts, investments in financial institutions, stocks and shares, or off-shore accounts. They are the ordinary savers one will find the length and breadth of the country. There are almost two million of them, which is a substantial number, and they should be encouraged rather than discouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill and the thrust of Finance Acts since the mid-1980s has been to provide incentives <Col N="1072" /> through income tax and other measures to various areas which the Minister considers in need of encouragement. If the Minister intends to provide incentives for rural development, urban renewal, the building of a regional airport, the development of a seaside resort or a car park it is surely not too much to ask him to provide an incentive for small savers in credit unions. I know small savers in my constituency, which is pretty disadvantaged, and I am not aware of any major tax evaders who are members of credit unions. Credit unions are strongest in disadvantaged areas. Members save for First Holy Communion, Confirmation, marriage and for deposits on homes, although it is becoming increasing difficult to save for the latter.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we are taking away from a level playing field by providing for a modicum of income to be disregarded for tax purposes. Even at this late stage the Minister should do a U-turn. I know he is not listening to me and that he has no intention of listening, especially given that he is now talking, but it is an important issue and it is to such things the Minister should be listening. These issues engage people. People have heard the Minister say he is not very anxious to make a tax payment when he is placing a bet in a bookies. However, they have not heard him speak too loudly in relation to the Ansbacher accounts or about the fat cats who are getting the cream by evading tax. Yet the Minister has described the Irish League of Credit Unions as tax evaders, not tax avoiders.</P>
    <P>The Minister has flown in the face of the recommendations of the working group which he established to specifically examine this matter. It is not a funny matter but a very serious issue and the Minister should respond to it in a serious way. I urge the Minister to seriously consider the recommendation and not treat it in the offhand fashion in which he treated it in the other House and in public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this recommendation which proposes to exempt from income tax the first £375 of dividend income on credit union shares where the total of such income is less than £750 per year. As a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service I had an opportunity of meeting representatives of the credit union movement which requested that the Finance Bill take account of the recommendations of the working group which considered taxation on credit union savings. The movement was also anxious to meet with the Minister. The members of the Minister's party, who form the majority of the committee, were also sympathetic to these views. The Irish League of Credit Unions indicated that it sought several meetings with the Minister but that these had been refused. Since then the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have met with the league.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time the Minister has clearly stated that he must wait for the EU ruling before <Col N="1073" /> he can deal any further with the issue of credit union taxation. He said that any change in legislation at this stage would aggravate the complaint made to the EU by Irish financial institutions that the law is biased in favour of credit unions. However, this has changed in recent times because a letter was received by Pat Cox, MEP, from Mario Monti, the EU Commissioner with responsibility for competition, stating that his office is currently examining the situation from the point of view of the State aids rule in the Maastricht Treaty. However, this in no way precludes the Minister from reforming the credit union position. In view of this I ask the Minister to again examine the question.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the credit union movement. A branch of the league can be found in almost every large parish in Dublin. Its clientele is quite different from that which frequents banks. The league's members are ordinary working people who have some savings and who have to obtain credit for different occasions in their lives. What we are asking for is reasonable and I ask the Minister, in view of the EU ruling on this matter, to sympathetically consider the recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out that I will have to leave at 3.30 p.m. for an EU Council meeting in Lisbon and the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, will take over at that time if we have not previously concluded.</P>
      <P>Recommendation No. 1 proposes to exempt from income tax the first £375 of dividend income on credit union shares where the total of such income is less than £750 in a year. In February 1998 I established a working group, chaired by Mr. Terence Larkin, to specifically examine the taxation of returns on credit union savings. After six meetings of the working group it was not possible for members to reach a consensus and in the absence of an agreed position the chairman made a number of recommendations, namely, that credit union surpluses should continue to be exempt from corporation tax, that 20% DIRT should apply to interest on all credit union deposits, that 20% DIRT should apply to all dividends on shares except where the dividend in any year is £750 or less and in such cases that only the first £375 be exempt, and that there should be no reporting to Revenue of interest or dividends on credit union savings. Two of the group members did not support these recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are important issues to be decided arising out of this report, including issues of tax equity and Exchequer cost, particularly if any tax relief given to credit union savers has to be extended to savers in other financial institutions. Senators will also be aware that there is a very important EU dimension arising from complaints made to Brussels by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association. The Irish Bankers Federation has also submitted a complaint to the Commission which I understand relates to the position of credit unions with respect to consumer credit legislation. The Commission has already <Col N="1074" /> addressed an earlier complaint by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association by concluding in November 1998 that the facts complained of did not amount to a state aid. I understand that the complaint made by the association in 1999 contains more information than was supplied to the Commission in 1998.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Irish League of Credit Unions recently accepted the Government's position that complaints about taxation made to the EU Commission must be resolved before any further moves are made regarding the taxation of credit union savings income. The House will also be aware that Pat Cox, MEP, received a letter from Commissioner Monti advising him that the Commission is currently examining the situation from the point of view of the state aid rules of the treaty. The Commissioner stated that that examination does not in principle preclude the Minister for Finance from reforming the credit union tax position. Not surprisingly, however, the Commissioner noted that any change made to the tax position by the Minister may lead to different conclusions being arrived at.</P>
    <P>The legal advice available to me is that there is no certainty that the decision on the 1999 complaint by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association will be the same as that on the 1998 complaint. I am advised that it is both rational and logical to take the view that if credit union interest and dividends are not taxed either in the hands of the credit union, as is currently the case, or in the hands of credit union members, as is proposed by the Irish League of Credit Unions, the same conclusion reached in 1998 by the Commission can no longer be reached. The recommendations of the working group will be further examined in the light of whatever decision the EU Commission takes in relation to the complaints about existing tax law. I should emphasise that the Commission is not dealing with the current proposals of the Irish League of Credit Unions but rather is treating credit unions under existing law. It would not be unreasonable to assume that further concessions to the credit union movement would trigger complaints which would also have to be dealt with. As I pointed out earlier, the Commission is indicating that any changes made to the tax position of credit unions may cause it to arrive at different conclusions.</P>
    <P>It is also very important that Senators reflect on the consequences of the recommendation. A person could have up to £7,500 in a credit union account without being liable to tax on interest earned. Credit unions would have a significant competitive advantage over other financial institutions and it is inevitable that they would use it. Significant funds would flow from other financial institutions to the credit unions. Experience also indicates that some people will seek to have more than one tax free account in a credit union and this has been acknowledged by the ILCU.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his statement following the meeting with the ILCU pointed out that there were general equity aspects which must be con<Col N="1075" /> sidered, which relate to all financial institutions, while ensuring the integrity of the tax system. As I have said previously, the ILCU accepts that the current complaints before the European Commission must first be disposed of before further consideration is given to these matters. I cannot accept the recommendation for these and other reasons.</P>
    <P>Senator Joe Doyle stated that I am using the complaint to the Commission as the reason for not doing anything in this area. I have stated on countless occasions in reply to parliamentary questions in the Dáil and in letters to Members of both Houses that it is one of the matters they must bear in mind. The current position of the ILCU is the source of the complaint to the Commission. The complainant thinks it is unfair under the State aid rule and that something should be done about it before further concessions are given to the ILCU. It does not take Einstein to work out that if the current position of the credit unions has given rise to such complaints, any more favourable treatment under tax law will definitely trigger further complaints.</P>
    <P>I have also stated in replies to parliamentary questions and in debates in the Dáil and elsewhere that it is our understanding that the Commission's decision in 1999 as a result of the 1998 complaint that it was not a State aid was based on grounds which were not unusual. The current position is that the surplus income of credit unions is not liable for corporation tax and that was considered not be a State aid on the reasonable assumption that the returns of credit union members are liable for tax.</P>
    <P>There are two new complaints from the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association under State aid and under a European consumer directive. If one were to continue to exempt credit unions from corporation tax and accept Senator Costello's recommendation, which is the view of the majority of the working group, more than 98% of credit union members would be exempt from any tax. It is reasonable to assume that that would trigger another batch of complaints to the Commission because its original decision was made on the basis that the exemption from corporation tax was satisfactory on the basis that the returns to members were taxed. It is proposed not alone to maintain the corporation tax exemption but also to set a limit which would exempt 98% of all credit union members.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, even when the EU complaint is disposed of, other considerations must be taken into account, which have been referred to by me and in the statement issued by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste following the meeting with the ILCU. They relate to the integrity of the tax system and the position regarding other financial institutions. Surveys carried out by the ILCU show that people deposit money in credit unions for more or less the same reasons they do in any other financial institution, namely to get the best rate of return. Again, one does not need to be <Col N="1076" /> Einstein to deduce that if one institution exempts the first £375 of interest and another institution down the street does not provide the same concession, an Irish person, from whichever walk of life, will transfer his account because for a funny reason, which is not peculiar to Ireland, people do not like to pay tax.</P>
    <P>This may be a surprise to Senators on the left but it is no surprise to the rest of us. People do not like paying tax in Germany, which is why there are so many accounts in Luxembourg that nobody knows about, nor do they like paying it in Holland and they might have foreign bank accounts. It is not an uniquely Irish phenomenon. People evade tax for many reasons but we are trying to implement a system whereby one can deposit £7,500 or £8,000 in an institution and be exempt from tax. A great deal of gobbledegook has been spoken in this House and elsewhere about this matter.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind the establishment of credit unions and savings have been mixed up. People borrow from credit unions for a wide variety of purposes and credit unions do outstanding work throughout the community. However, we are not dealing with the borrowings of credit unions members and what they are used for but their savings in deposit and share accounts. Surveys carried out by credit unions show that people deposit money in credit union accounts for the same reason that they do in any other institution, namely to get the best return.</P>

      <P>This issue must be addressed when the Commission makes its decision and I must take all these matters into account when I make a decision. It would be easy for me to accept the recommendation because most people do not want any hassle, but it would be irresponsible. I will not make decisions on the basis of a political whim which will satisfy the loud volume of abuse which has emanated from certain quarters on occasion. That has not been, is not and will not be the role of the Minister of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello referred briefly to betting tax. I remind him, in case he is not aware, that it is not an offence, and never was, for the punter not to pay betting duty because the onus is on the bookmaker to collect tax. It is similar to buying a pint in a public house. One assumes that the publican pays VAT at 21%. It never was an offence for any punter not to pay betting duty but it is for a licensed bookmaker. One can walk into any bookmaker and assume that the individual behind the counter pays the betting duty. It has nothing to do with the punter. Perhaps people on <Col N="1077" /> the left do not frequent betting offices because they live in a high-faluting tower from which they like to preach to others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Deputy's ignorance in this matter is astounding. I will further correct him. This was the time when off-course betting tax was 20% and after some lobbying by myself and other Deputies, including Deputy Brendan McGahon, the then Minister, Deputy Alan Dukes, reduced it from 20% to 10% and the yield doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>And who reduced it to 5%?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, and the yield is up as well, which proves something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My only statement was that when the Minister came to power it was 10% and he halved it to 5%, so my ignorance is not as wide-ranging as the Minister might have thought. The Minister is on the record as saying that he did not agree with the high taxation on betting. That was at a time when it was 10%. It had been reduced already from 20% to 10% and the Minister took steps to reduce it further to 5%.</P>
      <P>The Minister is well able to act when he wishes to do so, yet he will not act when we are talking about a meagre £375. He talks about equity but £375 is not in the big league. It is a very small amount of money for anybody to have exempt from tax. The Minister put his finger on the matter when he said that 98% of all the members of credit unions would benefit from this measure. Surely that makes the point we have been making, namely, that these people are small savers who would not have to pay any tax if this amendment were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it strange that the Minister should talk about the integrity of the tax system as being his primary consideration. There are all sorts of anomalies in the tax system. The tax liability for companies in the International Financial Services Centre is 10%. Multinational companies selling out of the country pay tax at 10%. The European Union has taken us to task because we have discriminated between indigenous producers of goods and the way we treat multinationals. I cannot remember this Minister or any other Minister for Finance saying that they will no longer allow <Col N="1078" /> a 10% corporation tax to companies in the IFSC, financial institutions and the multinationals because the European Union expressed a concern about it. The integrity of the tax system did not come into play then, but now the integrity of the tax system is being called into question when we are talking about a modest £375 for Seán and Mary living in some disadvantaged area in the city of Dublin, Cork or Limerick or some rural community.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is saying does not add up. He talks about equity and integrity but that has nothing to do with this case which involves small savers. We must remember that one can only be a borrower in a credit union if one is already a saver, and one can only borrow a certain proportion <i>vis-à-vis</i> the amount one has saved, so clearly the whole purpose is to save so that one can borrow. That is the reason so many people who do not have bank accounts or investment accounts of any significance use the credit unions.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the reason the Minister cannot accept this amendment. If he is so concerned about it, let us wait and see if there will be a European Union ruling. What we have heard to date would indicate that Europe might express some concerns or suggest parameters. The people who complained to Europe are the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association and the banks, but what else would one expect? These are the big boys in the big league. Why should the Minister listen to the boys in the big league all the time? Why will he not listen to the ordinary person and give them an advantage? If he is subsequently compelled to make a change, he can do that at a later stage but he should not always put the argument in terms of providing equity and integrity in the context of somebody who is in need of a break. He should not say he cannot make concessions because he is concerned about the whole system falling apart when in our Finance Acts, urban renewal Acts, etc. we are making major concessions which could be described as anomalous and over which, if the European Union were to examine them as a result of complaints made to it, one could find major question marks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go down the road of the betting tax because more people who are members of credit unions are beneficiaries of the reduction in betting tax than anybody else. I agree with what Senator Costello said. These people are small savers who can borrow against those savings when family needs arise. They are different from the people who frequent other financial institutions. The Minister might ask the reason these recommendations are before him today. They are before him because he has refused to meet the credit unions. The Minister should not turn away from me. What has he got against the credit unions? He made a case here today. Why can he not make that case to them? When I met representatives of the credit unions at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service they told me they had made many <Col N="1079" /> requests to meet the Minister. If he does not meet them, the only other avenue is for public representatives to put down amendments to the Finance Bill. I ask the Minister again to meet the credit unions and explain the case he has made in the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The working group discussed this matter over a number of meetings and the chairman of the working group came forward with the report on 1 October 1998. When I initially put forward my proposals in the Finance Bill, 1998, I had a number of meetings with the credit unions. This matter has been debated <i>ad nauseam</i> with the Irish League of Credit Unions. They know my views and I know theirs, but they want to get their viewpoint on the Statute Book without any concessions. No person in Leinster House knows better than I about this particular matter and the views of the credit unions. I know every innermost detail of the proposal of the Irish League of Credit Unions and they know my views as well. There is no point in my meeting with the Irish League of Credit Unions.</P>
      <P>Currently the credit union member has the best of all possible worlds. I am not too certain whether ordinary credit union members &ndash; I mean people who do not go to meetings of their credit union and who are not actively involved &ndash; understand the view being put forward by the Irish League of Credit Unions because the current position suits him or her quite well, and I will explain the reason for that. Under the current system, no corporation tax has to be paid on the surplus profits of the credit unions. The dividends or interest in the hands of the credit union member is not reportable to the Revenue and DIRT is not deductible either. I believe the ordinary credit union member is quite happy with that, so why does the Irish League of Credit Unions want to change the system? They want DIRT on deposits and they want these exemptions as well.</P>
      <P>In December 1998 I was asked to meet with the Irish League of Credit Unions. I told the person representing the league that I had no proposals to do anything in the Finance Bill about the Irish League of Credit Unions. I met the league, largely to oblige him and it. It wanted to have DIRT on deposit interest, to have some exemptions &ndash; it was a different proposal to the current one but was in the same area &ndash; and to continue the corporation tax exemption. I put DIRT on deposit interest at the league's request. I said I would have reportage of dividends but I did not give it a concession in relation to an exemption. The league allowed the impression to be created in the next few days that I was the one who thought up the idea of DIRT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People need to step back and remember what the big issue was on 13 February 1998, the day after the publication of the Finance Bill, 1998. Senators should be well aware of this because some of them screamed a lot about it, as did Deputies and the media. The headline was that <Col N="1080" /> I had imposed DIRT on interest. Credit union members and Deputies went on the radio to complain about that. That was the big issue of the day. A few days later, it turned out that the Irish League of Credit Unions had looked for this&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;in the first place. What stirred up individual credit union members around the country was the proposal to impose DIRT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister corrected that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just did away with it. The imposition of DIRT was requested by the Irish League of Credit Unions. The ordinary credit union member &ndash; who I defined in an earlier contribution &ndash; was not aware of those proposals. I bet Senator Doyle was quoted in the days after that as giving out about the imposition of DIRT. Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not make any representations because I was Lord Mayor that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Senators and Deputies did. That was the issue. I just withdrew the proposal because I had had no proposal to make in the first place. I thought I was obliging them.</P>
      <P>One might ask why the league wanted the imposition of DIRT. Some of the bigger credit unions had obvious good reasons for it. The credit union movement in Ireland is no longer a small group of people. The total assets of the credit unions are well in excess of £2.3 billion, perhaps up to £2.5 billion. That is the amount of money on deposit. The ten largest credit unions have assets in excess of £50 million. One can get all this information from the annual report of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the latest of which was published a few months ago. It contains information on the size and number of credit unions and everything to do with friendly societies. There is no great mystery about it. It states that the ten largest credit unions have assets in excess of £50 million and it details those with assets in excess of £30 million, £20 million and so on. There are 438 credit unions in Ireland. I would guess that their total assets are in the region of £2.4 billion or £2.5 billion. Some of these bodies are no longer small institutions.</P>
      <P>The current position suits the ordinary credit union member quite well. There is no corporation tax, no DIRT on his interest or savings and no reportage. One then asks why the league of credit unions wants this exemption. The Irish League of Credit Unions allowed a considerable number of days to pass in February 1998 without saying that it had looked for DIRT in the first place. The headlines on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday were all about that issue. They were the people who wanted it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> As I explained earlier and on previous occasions, this matter is quite complex. A number of factors must be taken into account. I am sure we will return to this matter again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying there is a stand-off between him and the league of credit unions because, as it publicly misrepresented the position as he understood it, he will not talk to it again and that that is justified. None of us welcome such a &ldquo;High Noon&rdquo; style stand-off or showdown. We want a modest amendment to the Finance Bill which will take into consideration the fact that the vast majority of credit union members are small savers, depositors and borrowers. They should be given a concession. There is nothing in tax law, tax equity or European Union rulings to prevent the Minister doing that. He should do that as an indication of the direction in which he sees this society, with its surplus wealth, going. Most people who contribute to credit unions are at the lower margins of society. The Minister should be sympathetic and generous in that respect. There is absolutely no reason for not doing so.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the total assets of the credit union membership are £2.5 billion. That is tiny, when one considers that the annual profits of AIB and the Bank of Ireland are in the region of £2.5 billion. Total assets of £2.5 billion are very small in terms of the league of financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Everything the Minister said does not ring true, in terms of providing a valid reason. There may be some logic here and there, but he has no valid reason for not going down this road. This seems to be largely due to stubbornness on his part. He had a bad experience with the league of credit unions. He is now digging in his heels and saying there will be no further concessions, that he is the Minister, that he is going to draw the line and dictate policy, that he is not going to meet the league, that he does not care what it says or how often it meets with other public representatives, including the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, and that is his position, full stop. That might be all right for a while, but it is time he got it out of his system. It would be a very good move on the Minister's part to accept this proposal.</P>
      <P>If there is a final ruling this time next year from the European Union on the complaints that have been made to it, does the Minister envisage making some concessions &ndash; if he is free to do so, in terms of EU concerns &ndash; in regard to an exemption for savings or dividends of the credit union membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to encourage savings. I spoke yesterday of my fear about the extent of private borrowing in the economy at present. People should be encouraged to save with credit unions. I understand the Minister's position quite well, but I have a difficulty in <Col N="1082" /> relation to the recommendation of the working group. Was the Minister responsible for setting up the working group? What were its terms? Why did he not accept those terms? This must the first working group set up by a Minister, the terms of which were not accepted. That is my great difficulty with this, which was put to me at the joint committee meeting with the credit union personnel. I would be satisfied if the Minister clarified the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the working group and its recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very simple. The terms of reference of the working group were to examine the taxation return on credit union savings, bearing in mind the special and particular nature of the credit union movement, its contribution to Irish society and the wider taxation issues involved. That is all it was asked to do. There were nine people on the working group, two of whom did not agree with the other seven and dissented from the report. The chairman came up with a compromise to which the two members also did not agree. The two members were the person from the Department of Finance and the person from the Revenue Commissioners. That is all they were asked to do, therefore, I was under no obligation to accept the recommendations of the chairman of the working group because they were asked, as I explained, to examine the taxation of credit union savings.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the working group was to examine this matter and much useful information is contained in the report of the working group, but I was under no obligation to accept it. The Irish League of Credit Unions &ndash; I draw a distinction between that and the credit union members &ndash; wishes to bully its way into a position to get a competitive advantage over others. When I make comments across the House to Senator Doyle or Senator Costello people seem to understand these things a little better. The same points were made to the league of credit unions who still want to have their own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle asked about the position when the Commission reports. I make this point again, which I have made about 50 times in the past year. The Commission is examining the present favourable position before we make it any more <Col N="1083" /> favourable and its decision will be based on that. In my reply I indicated our understanding of how it made the previous decision, which most people accept is reasonably logical. It may be that it is all right to have the corporation tax exemption on the basis that the money coming out is taxed in the hands of the members but this recommendation and what the Irish League of Credit Unions wants is to exempt all the money coming out, although I have the corporation tax exemption as <Col N="1084" /> is. As I said previously, the Commission investigation is one aspect of this matter, and I will bear it in mind when the Commission makes a decision. I give no commitment other than that.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>his proposal arises from the tax proposals published by Fine Gael. It is our contention that the Minister got it wrong when introducing individualisation into the tax structure and had to bring in a voluntary measure to pacify his own backbenchers. We propose a different method for reconstructing the tax code as set out in this amendment, with deletions necessary to insert it.</P>
    <P>Our tax proposals are based on a number of principles to introduce a fair and equitable tax system where the burden of income tax is singularly reduced for low paid and middle income taxpayers and to give back a fair share of the resources available to those who work hard and who have contributed to Ireland's current prosperity. A long-time grievance with the tax system, particularly among young people, is that people enter a high rate of tax at too low a level of income and the jump of 22% from the standard rate to the higher rate is too steep at the level of income they enjoy. The main emphasis of this amendment is to show that if one simply increases the rate of the standard rate bands from £17,000 for a single person and £34,000 for a married person one gets the same benefit in terms of equity and female participation in the labour force. There would then have been no need for the controversy over individualisation.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will tell us this measure would be significantly more expensive than his measure &ndash; I understand the cost of this measure has been estimated at £130 million. However, the Minister was forced to introduce the £3,000 allowance for stay at home spouses in caring positions, which I believe has an estimated cost of £125 million. On one hand the Minister is saying that £130 million is too expensive, while he is giving £125 million away with the other hand. That does not make sense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> The jump in tax rates from 22% to 44% is too severe, so we propose introducing a middle rate of income tax at 33%. The amendment favours those on lower incomes, who did not benefit from the budget in the same way as the 10% of top earners. We feel this amendment proposes a fairer tax system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendation concerns income tax rate and band structures that are to apply for the year 2000-01 and subsequent years of assessment. We had a comprehensive discussion of this both on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil. The structure envisaged by the recommendation is one which would contain a standard rate band of £17,000 for single persons and £34,000 for all married couples and it would use a new third intermediate rate of 33% which would apply to a tranche of taxable income of £8,000 for single people and £16,000 for married people above the standard rate band and retain the standard and higher rates proposed in the Bill, with the higher rate applying to taxable incomes of £25,000 for single people and £50,000 for married couples.</P>
      <P>The proposals in the recommendation would result in a setting aside of the radical change I am introducing this year, the move to individualisation of the standard rate band. One of the main difficulties with the current band structure is that the single person's standard rate band is doubled for all married couples, whether there are one or two incomes involved. No Member needs to be reminded that patterns of work in Ireland have been transformed in the last decade, with female labour force participation rapidly approaching the EU average. An increasing number of households where both spouses work outside the home find themselves liable to pay income tax at the higher rate of what are modest incomes. The tax system must recognise and be flexible in response to this change.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Government is committed in An Action Programme for the Millennium to working towards having 80% of taxpayers taxed at the standard rate. The Government believes the introduction of a single standard rate band for each individual taxpayer is essential to meet that commitment. Now that allowances have been effectively converted to tax credits, the only way to get the numbers in the top tax rate down and to reduce high marital rates on average incomes is to widen the standard rate tax band. The most effective way to widen that tax band is to put it on an individual basis and to tax a person on what he or she earns as an individual, whether single or married. This is what the Government has set out to do and section 3 is the first move in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If tax reform is to be meaningful, it must involve making radical change and that is what I am proposing in section 3. I will be happy to be judged on the combined effect of the five budgets I will have brought forward by the time of the next election. Each of my budgets &ndash; this is no <Col N="1087" /> exception &ndash; must be taken as part of a sequence and not considered in isolation. The Government's tax strategy will bear fruit in terms of higher take home pay and increased incentives to work. I am confident the considered judgment of the electorate concerning this record will be favourable at the next election.</P>
    <P>I take satisfaction from the fact that the policy of individualisation has been supported by people outside the political spectrum. Representatives of the social partners endorsed the proposals in the recently published Programme for Prosperity and Fairness when stating that the social partners support the policy of establishing a single standard rate income tax band for all individual taxpayers. They also agreed that the standard rate income tax band should be kept under review in light of increases in income levels and the objective of ensuring that, over time, at least 80% of taxpayers are not subject to the higher rate of income tax.</P>
    <P>In addition, the results of an MRBI opinion poll in January indicate that the proposal was broadly well received by the public, while the chief economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers stated recently that economic growth is dependent on the implementation of the Government's current tax policy and especially the tax individualisation scheme.</P>
    <P>Regarding the introduction of a third, intermediate rate of income tax, I indicated during discussion of this matter in the Dáil that in principle I would have no great objection to it and I would not disagree with the contention that the jump from 22% to 44% is too much in one go. However, I am not one for doing a little bit all over the place and achieving nothing substantial. I am currently engaged in a radical overhaul of the income tax system which, over the life of this Government, will see the introduction of tax credits, individualisation and a significant widening of the standard rate band as well as substantial reductions in both existing rates of tax.</P>
    <P>I said in the Dáil that our current attitude to a third tax rate would tend to be Augustinian &ndash; not just yet. I would only be prepared to consider a third rate when the standard rate of income tax is down to 20% and the top rate is down to 42% or, if possible, 40%. I also have to bear in mind that the introduction of a 33% rate at this stage, as proposed in the recommendation, would mean, in effect, a cut of 11% for higher rate taxpayers at a time when the Government is trying to assist lower income taxpayers by removing as many of them as possible from the tax net. The next Administration, in which I hope also to be Minister for Finance, can consider the question of a third rate of income tax. In the circumstances I have no option but to reject the recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into the merits and demerits of individualisation and other tax measures. Yesterday and today the Minister relied heavily on a survey which showed public <Col N="1088" /> support for those measures. When speaking here on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness he ended on a bullish note when saying we were in a win-win situation. I hope there are no own goals, but I think this measure will be one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not support Senator Doyle's proposal as such. It is not that I disagree with his point that there would be less payment before one hits the top rate of 44% and that there would be a certain equity provided there. Our approach would be to have the two rates and a widening of the bands to a greater extent.</P>
      <P>The minimum wage is set at £4.40 per hour and will not rise to £5 until 2002. Taxation kicks in when one earns approximately £107, so that almost £70 will be taxable at the rate of 22%. Approximately 200,000 people will be affected by this. Will the Minister consider another zero rate for people on the minimum wage? Perhaps his next budget will include the 22% and 44% rates and a zero rate for those on the minimum wage.</P>

      <P>I referred to the matter of individualisation in December and in my reply last night. Until the change as a result of the Murphy judgment, there was a single rate tax band. The married allowance and personal single allowance were different but the bands were the same. This was at a time when Ireland was supposed to be very conservative and the country did not fall asunder. However, this was lost during the screaming and shouting which occurred following the budget in December.</P>

      <P>I take that point. It is the job of the Opposition to oppose issues, but I did not think it was the job of Members of other parties to oppose issues also. I accept that times have changed in Irish politics.</P>
      <P>I would say to Senator Costello that it is a priority in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that those on the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net over the lifetime of the programme. This objective is to be aspired to, but in the third week of March 2000 I cannot predict what will be included in the budget later in the year. However, I will take this commitment into account when preparing next year's budget, together with the proposals in relation to the standard bands and tax rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxation section of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness recognises that taxes can be reduced by way of bands, allowances and rates. There was a belief from 1993 onwards that rate changes would reduce people's tax. There was a consensus among opinion formulators, including the media, that there was just one way of doing this &ndash; bands and allowances. I have argued consistently for a number of years that this is not correct. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to bands, allowances and tax rates. It is a priority and a firm commitment over <Col N="1089" /> the lifetime of the programme to work towards relieving people on the minimum wage of the liability to pay tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 24, before section 12, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>12.&ndash;Section 848 of the Principal Act shall extend with any necessary modifications to such charities recognised for the purposes of section 486A of that Act as are certified for those purposes by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to give tax relief on charities other than Third World charities, to extend the tax relief to domestic charities. It seems strange that we are prepared to give relief on Third World charities while not on domestic charities. I understand that section 486A allows tax relief on corporate donations to charities. This amendment requests the Minister to extend this relief to personal donations to charity. I am always amazed at the generosity of people who contribute to charities. Many charities are solely dependent on the personal donations of the public and I ask the Minister to consider this pro<Col N="1090" /> posal sympathetically, which I believe is reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a reasonable and modest proposal. The previous Administration introduced tax relief on Third World charities and this was extended to corporate donations to all charities. However, to date personal donations to domestic charities are not subject to tax relief. The initial decision was desirable because the people have a great reputation for contributing to Third World and domestic charities. However, it seems unfair that the corporate sector is stipulated in the Bill because most contributions are of a personal nature. Very often significant personal donations to charities are made which should also be subject to tax relief. This is in line with what the Minister said in relation to my previous amendment and the credit unions. He was anxious to ensure equity in terms of how the taxation system operated. Surely if the corporate sector will benefit from its contributions to domestic and Third World charities, individuals making personal donations should also benefit as a result of their generosity. I hope the Minister will extend to this amendment the same principle he accepted in relation to the credit unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation by the Senators, which was tabled by way of an amendment on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil, proposes that the tax relief for individual donations to Third World charities should be extended to include all the charitable organisations which are currently approved for the purposes of corporate donations under section 486A. This latter provision covers both domestic and Third World charities and the effect of this recommendation would be to extend tax relief to donations to domestic charities.</P>
      <P>The tax relief in section 848 for personal donations to designated Third World charities was introduced in 1995 to mark the 150th anniversary of the Famine and in recognition of the particular type and scale of the human tragedy in the Third World. The Minister for Finance made it clear at the time that it was not the intention to extend the tax relief to domestic charities.</P>
      <P>In 1998 following representations from the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group I introduced the tax relief in section 468A for corporate donations to charities. When I agreed to introduce the relief I did so on the explicit understanding that it would not be extended to personal donations. The reform group, which was delighted with my response to its representations, accepted this and indicated that it would not press for its extension to cover personal donations. As I indicated on Committee and Report Stages, I am disappointed to note that this is precisely what it is now seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other Members, I have the greatest admiration for the work done by Irish charities at home and abroad. I firmly believe we should actively encourage people to give to chari<Col N="1091" /> ties and if the tax system can facilitate this, it should do so. However, there is no proper regulation and supervision of charities in this country although I understand my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, proposes to bring forward legislation later this year which will provide a statutory basis for this. Once this has been done I am prepared to give further consideration to the question of tax relief for personal donations to domestic charities. Furthermore I gave an undertaking during Committee Stage to have officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners look at the area of Third World charities, corporate donations, donations to universities etc. with a view to some rationalisation which may be considered for next year's Finance Bill. In the meantime I am not prepared to accept this recommendation.</P>
    <P>I am well disposed to this idea but I have to explain the background to this recommendation. When my predecessor introduced the Third World charities tax relief he said it was only for Third World charities and did not extend it. I had tabled amendments at that time on foot of a request from the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group to have tax relief for corporate donations to charities. When I became Minister for Finance I fulfilled my promise and introduced tax relief for corporate donations to Third World charities. The chairperson of the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group thanked me publicly for doing so. In view of all the difficulties with that Finance Bill involving credit unions etc. I welcomed his support at that stage.</P>
    <P>The records will show that when he lobbied me and other Deputies and Senators he said the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group wanted the relief only for corporate donations and not for personal donations, and that was agreed. I am a little taken aback that a few years later it is seeking exactly what it said it would not seek. As I indicated on Committee Stage, I intend to review all this area not for the purpose of disadvantaging any of the existing reliefs but with a view to rationalisation.</P>
    <P>Given that we have an income tax code, a corporation tax code, donations to universities, corporate donations, Third World relief and a whole clatter of other reliefs, I intend to bring some rationalisation to this area.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty is that there is no regulation of charities here. The Costello report was published many years ago. I have been assured that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform proposes to bring forward later this year legislation on foot of the Costello report which will provide a regulatory framework for charities. That would be necessary if there is to be further tax relief in that area. I am well disposed to this recommendation. I gave an undertaking to have my officials look at this area with a view to some rationalisation which may be considered for next year's Finance Bill on the proviso that my colleague has brought forward a regulatory framework for the charities sector.</P>

      <P>In page 24, lines 17 and 18, to delete &ldquo;(other than the spouse of a qualifying claimant)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This recommendation seeks to have the allowance paid to the working spouse in circumstances where another relative is performing the caring function. Where a spouse is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity and where there is a residential carer, usually a member of the family, the spouse who is the sole income earner for the family should qualify for the allowance of £3,000. Where one of the parents is incapacitated a daughter may give up work to look after him or her but the Minister's provision is available only where one or the other spouse is the carer. Where an adult child or another relative undertakes the caring function the allowance does not apply. There is an anomaly here and I ask the Minister to address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Doyle. It is anomalous that there should be an exemption in respect of the spouse of a qualifying claimant. The effect of this would be that a husband or wife could not qualify for the proposed carer's allowance. It seems unnecessary to include it in this section. I cannot see what it hopes to achieve and I suggest it be omitted.</P>

      <P>These recommendations relate to the new home carer's allowance that is provided for in section 12. The person being cared for, the dependent person, is defined to mean a child for whom social welfare child benefit is payable or a person aged 65 or over, or a person permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity. The spouse of the claimant is specifically excluded from this definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recommendation No. 4 is designed, in order to facilitate recommendation No. 5, to set aside the exclusion of a dependent spouse from the scope of the relief. Recommendation No. 5 proposes to <Col N="1093" /> introduce a further category of dependent person so as to bring within the relief an incapacitated spouse who is cared for by somebody other than the qualifying claimant.</P>
    <P>This proposal was comprehensively discussed on Committee and Report Stages in the other House. It is worth reminding the House that this measure was introduced to specifically recognise the role of spouses who work in the home caring for children, the aged or handicapped persons. The emphasis is on care being provided by the spouse in the home.</P>
    <P>It was never envisaged that this allowance would be available where a person other than a claimant or his or her spouse would provide the care or where one spouse is incapacitated. Section 467 of the Taxes Consolidation Act is specifically designed to deal with the situation where a taxpayer employs a carer to look after himself or herself or another family member, including a spouse, who is totally incapacitated. There is relief, at marginal tax rates, for expenditure of up to £8,500 per annum in that instance and the employed person can be another family member.</P>
    <P>In discussing the matter in the other House, it was agreed that this offered a technical solution, but it was suggested to me that it might not work in practice in a family where, for example, a father might be reluctant to or may not want to pay his daughter to look after her mother. I do not fully subscribe to that proposition &ndash; the experience of Revenue, particularly in regard to the dependent relative allowance in past years, is that taxpayers are more than willing to claim any tax reliefs that are available, much more so than they would avail of social welfare assistance. I have some sympathy with the kind of case which the recommendation is designed to cater for but I have to restate that the change being proposed is not in keeping with the underlying reasoning behind the home carer's allowance, which, as I have indicated, was intended to cater for a couple where one worked outside the home while the other cared for a dependent person. In the circumstances, I am not prepared to accept the recommendations.</P>
    <P>However, there are a number of areas in the tax code that I intend to examine over the coming 12 months with a view to streamlining and rationalising them. This will include various reliefs in the area of &ldquo;caring&rdquo; such as the £8,500 allowance for the employment of a carer to look after an incapacitated person, the dependent relative allowance and nursing home expenses in the context of medical expenses relief. I will examine the type of case prompting this recommendation in the context of this overall review.</P>

      <P>This recommendation relates to section 21 of the Bill which introduces a new tax relief, that is, relief for post-graduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in the European Union and also in private colleges in this country. The recommendation proposes a widening of the scope of the measure to include publicly funded colleges in the United States of America or universities or similar institutions approved by the Minister for Education and Science elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the free fees initiative, a number of tax reliefs have been introduced for undergraduate students who have to pay fees. In 1995, tax relief at the standard rate was made available for full-time undergraduate courses in private colleges in the State. Since 1996, tax relief is also available for part-time undergraduate courses in private and publicly funded colleges in the State, while last year relief was introduced for full-time undergraduate courses in publicly funded colleges in other EU member states.</P>
      <P>As I explained in the other House, the introduction of tax relief for the fees of post-graduate students was intended to mirror broadly what was available to undergraduates. The institutions which have qualified in the context of undergraduates are those situated here and in the European Union. Students in third level colleges in other EU member states can only get the relief if the college is a publicly funded one. We have very little information on the funding of universities in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland, private colleges and their course must be approved by the Minister for Education and Science. Similarly, private colleges and their <Col N="1095" /> courses in other countries would have to be approved by some authority such as the Minister for Education and Science. Our understanding is that the Minister for Education and Science would not have the capacity to approve large number of colleges or their courses in other countries such as the United States. It is also felt that it is likely that post-graduate students in America would be in receipt of a scholarship in respect of their fees.</P>
    <P>I propose, before the next budget, to look at the whole area of tax reliefs for the fees of undergraduate and post-graduate students, with a view to rationalising the sections. At that stage I can consider fully the Senator's proposal as to the scope of such relief.</P>

      <P>Senator Doyle's recommendation refers to a university or similar institution of higher education approved by the Minister. Should the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Education and Science not be in a position to approve an insitution in another jurisdiction, the relief would not apply. This does not appear to be a major hurdle for the Minister. Obviously, there are institutions in jurisdictions of which the Minister for Education and Science would not have an intimate knowledge, but in most jurisdictions to which Irish students travel, universites are well known and accredited and their status is easily determined.</P>

      <P>I introduced tax relief last year for undergraduates studying in another EU country. The relief for post-graduate students in the current Bill mirrors that. The condition has always been that the colleges attended must be publicly funded and the courses approved by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science is not in a position to monitor courses and colleges in the United States. Most third level institutions in the United States are not publicly funded, which creates an added difficulty. In addition, many taxpayers might not be happy to see tax relief granted in respect of fees paid to certain American universities. I can think of a number of examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of reliefs have been granted in recent years and I intend to rationalise some of the rules in next year's Finance Bill. There are some differences in the qualifying rules and these must be examined. In that context, I will examine the possibility of extending tax relief on post-graduate fees for colleges in the United States. In making these rationalisation proposals, it is not my intention to reduce relief for anyone who is studying in the United States at present. There are practical difficulties in extrending this relief <Col N="1096" /> to post-graduate fees paid in the United States but I will look at the matter.</P>

      <P>I neglected yesterday to compliment the Minister on introducing this measure. Unfortunately, I feel a small degree of envy because, as a parent, I have missed out on tax relief for third level fees on more than one occasion. I was too late to benefit from tax relief on undergraduate fees and for the last five years I have been supporting my eldest son while he completed a PhD in the University of Aberystwyth in Wales. The cost of fees, accommodation and travel is an enormous burden on any parent and the tax relief granted in the Bill is very welcome.</P>
      <P>The relief is granted for four years. Most postgraduate students must complete an MA before undertaking a PhD so that a course of postgraduate study usually takes five years. I ask the Minister, when he reviews this provision next year to extend the period of tax relief to five years. Relief at the standard rate is granted on £2,500. It costs parents three times that amount if their sons or daughters are studying abroad. The Minister might bear that in mind. Many Irish parents have sons or daughters studying at universities abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect relates to the scheme of capital allowances for expenditure on private convalescent facilities which was introduced in section 48 of last year's Finance Act. This section proposes to treat a convalescent home as if it were a nursing home within the meaning of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which provides a statutory basis under which nursing homes are regulated. By including convalescent homes within the terms of the Act its regulatory provisions will also apply to convalescent homes. The regulation of convalescent homes in this manner will mean that guidelines will no longer have to be issued by the Minister for Health and Children with my consent as previously envisaged before <Col N="1097" /> convalescent homes can avail of the capital allowances provided by section 48 of the Finance Act, 1999. The aim of these capital allowances is to free up hospital spaces by encouraging the private sector to provide alternative facilities for those recovering from treatment in an acute hospital.</P>
      <P>The background to this provision is that in my first Finance Bill I introduced an incentive to build nursing homes by providing accelerated capital allowances similar to those available for urban renewal. I extended this provision last year to include convalescent homes. The purpose of this section is to treat a convalescent home as if it were a nursing home within the meaning of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which provides a statutory basis under which nursing homes are regulated.</P>

I am very pleased that my suggestion in regard to convalescent homes has been accepted. The extra expenditure involved in providing such facilities can be prohibitive. The provision of capital allowances, therefore, is an important development.</P>
      <P>Although I am not certain how it can be dealt with in the tax code, I reiterate my suggestion that the position of retirement homes, a concept that works well in the United States and other jurisdictions, be looked at. There is a category of persons who are willing to move to a more secure environment in a retirement village or home provided the required facilities are available. It is not practical however to invest in the provision of such a complex. It is not simply a matter of providing sleeping and dining facilities. One is also talking about the provision of leisure facilities. The provision of such facilities would have a positive effect in tackling the housing shortage. The provision of a tax break may encourage the private sector to put them in place.</P>

      <P>This section extends film relief for a further five year period to 5 April 2005. It also increases by 10% the maximum amount of the cost of the production of a film which can be met by tax relief funding. The European Commission required that some amendments be made to the scheme. These are included in the section. They allow a company incorporated and resident <Col N="1098" /> outside the State to be a film company for the purposes of the relief as long as the company carries on a trade of film making in the State through a branch or agency. They also remove the statutory requirement that the maximum percentage of tax relief funding available matches the percentage of the work on the film in the State where that percentage is less than 50%.</P>
      <P>This was known as section 35 film relief when introduced in the 1987 Finance Act and was improved by Deputy Michael Higgins, then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. The purpose was to encourage investors, be they corporate or individual, to invest in the film industry. I extended the relief last year for another year pending the consideration of a number of reports. I signalled at the time that it was the best tax relief available to individual investors. If Senator Doyle has a few quid available having finally put all his children through college &ndash; I know how difficult that can be &ndash; there is no better tax break. It is brilliant. Between 70% and 80% is tax free. If one goes to one's local friendly bank manager one will have no bother borrowing a few quid &ndash; one cannot miss.</P>

Given that they were so successful our ideas were copied in the United Kingdom where tax breaks are now available. There was also evidence that the Irish film industry was in need of a boost. It has been doing well. I hope this provision will lead to increased activity.</P>

Are there structures in place, such as the St. Laurence O'Toole Trust in Dublin, which could benefit from the relief? What about the church buildings of which the Church as a body is divesting itself, once they cease to be used for religious purposes? They lie unused where there is no trust or mechanism in place to operate them. In some cases this has led to demolition. Others simply remain idle, although some are used for commercial purposes.

      <P>This section amends section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which provides relief from tax in respect of the cost of the repair, maintenance or restoration of approved buildings which are of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest and to which reasonable access is afforded to the public. The relief itself also applies to the maintenance or restoration of gardens which are of significant horticultural, scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest.</P>
      <P>The specific change being introduced at this time relates to the days on which these buildings and gardens are open to the public. Under the current arrangements these buildings and gardens must be open to the public on at least 60 days per year, of which at least 40 must be between 1 May and 30 September. There has been criticism that the buildings and gardens are open on inconvenient days to the general public. I propose to deal with this criticism by requiring that at least ten of the 40 summer days must be at weekends, that is, Saturday or Sunday. This change will further enhance public access to these properties in the future. The change will apply to newly approved properties immediately and for properties already approved in respect of expenditure incurred in chargeable periods beginning on or after 1 October 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can summarise the specific points made by Senator Costello as follows. A tax relief or tax break is of no use unless one has a taxable income <Col N="1100" /> and I would imagine that many of the problems which the Senator had in mind are those of bodies, such as charities which would have tax exempt status, which would not have a taxable income.</P>
    <P>However, if one does have a taxable income and the church or whatever other building is deemed by Dúchas to be of aesthetic, historical or significant interest along the lines I outlined, then it would qualify for tax relief, subject to the access rules. There is no difficulty with that. The body need only apply in the normal way, Dúchas recommends it and it falls within the remit. As I have said, most of the churches to which the Senator referred are probably owned by organisations, such as charities, which do not have a taxable income.</P>

      <P>In page 176, line 39, after &ldquo;audit&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the number of accounts which give rise to this additional tax&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Public Accounts, Sub-committee on Certain Revenue Matters, made a number of recommendations in its report, one of which was that the banks should pay back the full amount of the DIRT owed and that the Revenue Commissioners would make an assessment of that. This recommendation provides for the Revenue Commissioners to report on the number of accounts which give rise to this tax.</P>
      <P>I was a Member of the other House, as was the Minister, when the legislation for DIRT was first introduced in the mid-1980s. Its purpose was to put an end to the extensive abuses in relation to interest on deposits. Under this legislation the banks were obliged to deduct DIRT from deposit accounts and return it to the Government. When that legislation was passing through the other House I had no reason to believe that the banking institutions would fail in their responsibility to uphold the legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, and I am disappointed that has happened.</P>
      <P>As I said, the recommendation of the sub-committee was that the banks should pay the full amount on the DIRT owed and that the Revenue Commissioners should make an assessment of that. Will the Minister indicate the progress which has been made on the sub-committee's findings in this matter?</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan put forward the text of this recommendation as an amendment to the Bill on Report Stage in the Dáil for debating purposes and in order to get a statement <Col N="1101" /> on what the Revenue Commissioners were doing in assessing the financial institutions on DIRT arrears. The purpose of Senator Doyle's recommendation is to allow a debate on the matter. I hope to give to this House the clarification which was given to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Section 904B, which is contained in section 68 of the Bill, will empower and require the Revenue Commissioners to report before 1 November 2000 to the Committee of Public Accounts the results of the look-back audit in the case of each financial institution, specifying the DIRT arrears levied, interest charged and penalties imposed, any comments considered to be appropriate and whether any appeal has been lodged against an assessment raised. This is, in essence, what the Committee of Public Accounts recommended in its report.</P>
      <P>The power given to the Revenue Commissioners to conduct DIRT audits is set out in section 904A, which was included in last year's Finance Act. The focus of DIRT audits, under that section, is the checking of a sample of non-resident accounts in the financial institutions. There are close to 40 institutions involved and I understand that the Revenue Commissioners are carrying out a stratified sampling exercise whereby there is a weighted concentration on accounts with a greater quantum on deposit. The information gathered from checking the sample of non-resident accounts, together with the other information obtained by inspectors in the course of their audits, will lead to the estimation of the level of DIRT under-deducted by the financial institution. I understand that the Revenue Commissioners hope to have completed that exercise by the middle of the year.</P>
      <P>I imagine they would then have discussions with the financial institution concerned to seek its agreement as to the DIRT liability together with interest and penalties. If such agreement is forthcoming the Revenue Commissioners can settle the case without reference to the Committee of Public Accounts. I should point out that the Revenue Commissioners have the power to mitigate penalties which happens frequently in relation to individuals and other institutions. They will continue to have these powers. If agreement between the Revenue Commissioners and a financial institution is not forthcoming, an assessment will be raised by the Revenue and if the assessment was appealed by the financial institutions, it will be necessary for each side to put their case to the Appeal Commissioners for determination.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners can publish the results of their audits at any time. They will, however, report to the Committee of Public Accounts before 1 November next on the progress at that time. One hopes that all negotiations will be completed and all cases settled at that date but that may prove not to be the case. I should add that it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners as to how cases are settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The focus of the report to be made by the Revenue Commissioners to the Committee of Public <Col N="1102" /> Accounts is on the DIRT arrears, interest and penalties arising from the look-back exercise and fully reflects the recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts.

      <P>While I welcome the principle of the town renewal scheme, there are a number of items which will not work in my county. Some 22 towns in Donegal were designated as qualifying, but unfortunately under the criteria laid down we were only allowed pick six. We had another difficulty in that two of the major towns which were slightly under the 6,000 limit &ndash; Ballyshannon and Ballybofey &ndash; were rejected under the urban renewal schemes early last year. Because of this they were almost certain to be included in this year's scheme, so the number was reduced to four. There are six electoral areas in the local authority area and because of this the local authority decided to allocate one town in each of the electoral areas. Ballybofey and Ballyshannon were automatically picked in their electoral areas. Our difficulty is that most of the towns in the west and south-west of Donegal, from Donegal town to Glencolmcille, are in dire need of renewal and an injection of funds.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is probably aware, at 22%, we have one of the highest rates of unemployment in the country. West Donegal is totally reliant on the fishing industry which is experiencing knocks due to the CFP. The agricultural industry has more or less collapsed and we are relying on a tourism industry which is trying to develop. However, there is very little incentive to build the tourism industry simply because the day of grants is gone. The south gained in terms of tourism while, unfortunately, the north-west, due to the troubles in the North and other factors, never really availed of the funding that was available. I have discussed this with the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and I hope when the new operational programmes are set up there will be much more assistance for the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty in terms of the town renewal schemes is that we have so many towns but only a small number have qualified. The scheme is good, but some counties with, for example, only three towns have had each of those towns picked for the scheme and it is possible that such towns are in no great need of renewal. There is no dif<Col N="1103" /> ferential between counties in dire need of investment and others which are not too badly off.</P>
    <P>I raised this issue when the pilot scheme for the upper Shannon region was introduced. We would prefer to see rural renewal applied more commonly to the west or south-west of Donegal rather than being associated with individual towns. Donegal County Council made a great effort to try to produce the report to show what towns and what areas within towns should qualify. However, I found most of it was geared towards residential property because clearance on the commercial aspect has to be received from the EU. The initial instructions from the Department were geared mainly to residential accommodation. This is something we do not necessarily need in west Donegal. High prices are being paid for property and sites, but we do not necessarily have the huge housing crisis being experienced by some of the bigger cities. To date the scheme has been geared to residential property and I am seeking some relief, be it by way of tax relief, investment or grants, to generate new industry and regenerate the tourism and other industries. We will not have a huge amount of inward investment due to our road structure and our location on the periphery of Europe.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to reconsider the scheme in terms of areas such as west Donegal. While I accept it is a good scheme in many ways, it does not suffice. This scheme will do absolutely nothing for most of Donegal and the Glenties electoral area, which I represent. I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of extending it. Two years ago I asked him to do so when the pilot scheme in the upper Shannon region proved successful. The benefits of that scheme are only being reaped now and many of the towns in the region will be completely rejuvenated by 2003. However, I do not refer to towns which have already qualified under various urban renewal schemes but large areas of west Donegal that have suffered over the years and which are suffering even more now because the fishing industry is hindered by the CFP. Will the Minister examine this again?</P>

      <P>The section is concerned with tax reliefs for certain towns with populations between 500 and 6,000. We have reached the stage where no urban and rural renewal incentives should be provided unless they are part and parcel of an integrated area plan. Providing blank incentives to the business and development communities without striking a balance in terms of social and community gain should be a thing of the past. It has led to disproportionate development in Dublin, at seaside resorts and in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Urban renewal incentives were introduced last year and 49 areas were covered under the integrated area plan. There are five such plans in Dublin, two of which, unfortunately, cover Smithfield and O'Connell Street which do not really <Col N="1104" /> qualify under integrated area plans. The other three contain large disadvantaged communities and the local authority is seeking to improve their lot. Dublin is dotted with villages which have populations of between 500 and 6,000, such as Chapelizod, Stoneybatter, Ballybough and the East Wall. Integrated area plans are needed for these areas which would provide incentives in the context of the overall development. The number of incentives provided to the business community should be reduced while the number given to owner occupiers should be increased. The local authority should have greater input so that it drives the overall development rather than an investor or developer, as has been the case in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the urban renewal scheme and how it dovetails with the upper Shannon region, particularly in Roscommon. Four of the six electoral areas in Roscommon were included in the upper Shannon tax relief area. The people in the other electoral areas were very aggrieved and have never received an adequate explanation as to why the areas were not included. They highlighted the fact that up to 25 years ago some villages in the region had up to 30 families but only one or two houses are occupied now, particularly on the banks of the River Suck, and because of that they thought their regions were ideal for the development of tourism and regeneration. However, as it is a pilot scheme, it cannot be changed.</P>
      <P>To add insult to injury when the urban renewal scheme was introduced originally, Roscommon was the only town in the region which failed to achieve renewal status, although it qualified in 1993. It seems as if there is a vendetta to some extent against one half of the county. When I attend public meetings in that area, people still find it hard to understand why they lost out on both counts, and I am not able to give them an adequate explanation. I read the expert group's report on urban renewal and it found no convincing reason for the inclusion of Roscommon town. Either that is right or somebody was wrong in 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the decision was wrong in 1993 because the scheme was an absolute success in Roscommon. It is generally believed that it provided a £10 million boost to the town. The refurbishment of Church Street and Abbey Street is a credit to those involved. An application has been made under the lesser scheme and, I hope, we will be successful. Otherwise, people will think that it is intended to maintain the vendetta against that half of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This area is located between the Rivers Shannon and Suck and I hope it can be developed under the rural renewal scheme. Towns and villages, such as Lecarrow, Gallagh, Athleague and Ballyforan, could be developed as all of them <Col N="1105" /> qualify under the scheme. People are ready to develop them but there is no incentive for them. While the schemes are welcome in much of the county, the only drawback is the restrictions on planning. Planners are not tuned into Government policy on this matter. They still adopt copybook planning by not allowing developments to be undertaken if they can be seen from either river. They take a boat out on one river and judge whether a proposed development can be seen from the other one. That effectively means that no development can proceed. Somebody somewhere must link Government policy and the bible of the local authority planner.</P>

      <P>Urban renewal schemes have changed the face of Ireland for the better since they were introduced in the mid-1980s. The current economic boom has not been enjoyed by all sectors of the community, which Senator Costello referred to in the context of integrated area plans. The areas involved experience high unemployment and social exclusion and deprivation. The EU is allowing residential relief for such areas. However, will it allow relief on commercial development in these areas? I am a member of the docklands authority and relief will only be provided for residential development in this area. What is the position regarding integrated area plans accepted by the Department of the Environment and Local Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section introduces a new scheme of tax reliefs for the renewal and improvement of certain towns. It is aimed at towns with populations between 500 and 6,000. However, towns which benefited under the 1999 urban renewal scheme or the seaside resorts schemes or which are in the areas covered by the rural renewal schemes are excluded as are towns covered by Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county councils. The central aim of the scheme is to bring about the restoration, consolidation and improvement of the built fabric of towns, to promote sensitive infills and, in the course of this, to revitalise the centres of small towns. The scheme requires relevant county councils, together with local, community and business interests, particularly property owners, to identify areas which can benefit effectively from the scheme, to prepare a town renewal plan for the area and, within that plan, to identify buildings, groups of buildings and key interest sites where effective improvement may be achieved with the aid of tax incentives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this scheme is aimed at addressing dereliction in small towns at local level, county councils have a pivotal role, initially in selecting areas for inclusion in town renewal plans and subsequently in ensuring that they are successfully and proactively implemented. An expert advisory panel will assess the completed town renewal plans and advise the Minister of State for housing and urban renewal in relation to proposals for <Col N="1106" /> designation, having regard to guidelines published on the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will make orders applying one or more of the tax incentives now being provided for to areas designated by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The tax incentives will include capital allowances up to 100% for the cost of construction or refurbishment of industrial buildings, such as factories, with up to 50% in year one; similar allowances for the construction or refurbishment of commercial premises; section 23 type relief for expenditure incurred on the construction, refurbishment or conversion of buildings in residential accommodation and relief for owner-occupiers for expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of residential accommodation. The relief will apply over ten years at 5% per annum in the case of newly constructed accommodation and 10% per annum in the case of expenditure on refurbished accommodation.</P>
    <P>Due to the EU Commission's objection to issuing other incentive schemes, no double rent allowance is being provided for. The scheme will last for three years beginning on 1 April 2000 and ending on 31 March 2003. EU Commission approval will be required, however, before the business reliefs can take effect. Accordingly, provision is being made to activate these by means of a ministerial order.</P>
    <P>The Senators made some relevant points regarding this and other incentive schemes in this general area which have operated for a number of years. Senator Bonner has impressed upon me, inside and outside the House, that a boost in economic activity is needed in certain parts of County Donegal and I take his point in that regard. He gave a good outline of the way some towns were included while others missed out. The Department of Finance did not draw up the guidelines in this regard &ndash; it was the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The guidelines were as follows. The number of towns that could be selected in counties with less than six eligible towns was three. In counties with six to ten eligible towns, the number that could be selected was four, counties with 11 to 20 eligible towns could select five and counties with more than 20 eligible towns could select seven. That is how the problem arises in Donegal. The Senator referred to the problem of Ballyshannon and Ballybofey missing out on the urban renewal scheme. As they had to be included here, it reduced the number in County Donegal to four.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner mentioned also the question of urban renewal and differentiating between the areas or counties that should be included. This matter was also referred to by Senator Finneran in respect of County Roscommon. On many occasions last year and the year before, Senator Finneran came to my office complaining about the area of County Roscommon which was not included in the urban renewal scheme. It is always the case that when one draws up a guideline in respect of an area or a sum of money to <Col N="1107" /> be allocated, someone will lose out but I must point out that there was no discrimination against any part of County Roscommon, nor was there any discrimination against parts of County Sligo which will not be included in the rural renewal scheme. In fact, I have partitioned the parish of a well known Deputy &ndash; one part is included and the other is not &ndash; because we proceeded on the basis of district electoral divisions.</P>
    <P>Senators Bonner and Finneran raised the question of the integrated area plans and perhaps there are better ways of doing that. I committed myself in Opposition to rural renewal programmes, a tax incentive idea that was very successful in respect of urban renewal, as Senators Joe Doyle and Costello pointed out. I could have opted for different ways of doing that but I decided to have an upper Shannon rural renewal scheme. We then had to decide the areas that would be included and, effectively, it is a circle with Carrick-on-Shannon as the point of the compass. It is based on district electoral divisions and, unfortunately, some areas have lost out. The Senators wondered whether some schemes would be in operation by the deadline set in light of the planning difficulties. I accept that point and we will see how we are progressing as we move along.</P>
    <P>I also accept the point made by Senator Finneran that the rural renewal scheme has really only taken off in the past year or so. Some areas have been more successful than others. One particular town, Leitrim, seems to have got ahead of everybody else and it had good news yesterday also. It is nice to know that County Leitrim, where the population has been declining, will get a boost. This was meant to be a pilot rural renewal scheme and we will have to see how it works out. I accept the point made by Senator Bonner about it being done in a different way. That was tried in relation to the town renewal scheme and the last urban renewal scheme, that they would become part of the integrated area plans. The Senators and I might have different ideas of the integrated area plans, and our ideas might be far different from those of the planners who draw them up, but that is the way it was done.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to what has happened in the city centre. As Senator Doyle pointed out, the urban renewal scheme has been very successful. I have been coming into this city every working day since October 1967, mostly along the quays as well as through other areas. I know the area Senator Costello represents as well as he knows it because I worked there for a long time. Every time I go into that area I can hardly believe what has happened in the past seven or eight years. It is truly remarkable. Planning experts might say that much of the development was badly planned but compared to places I used to run by 20 years ago&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the transformation has been remarkable. I cannot believe what has happened to parts of Dublin, particularly along the quays, in my working lifetime.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from people complaining about the rural renewal schemes on environmental grounds. I received one within the past number of months complaining about what might happen as a result of rural renewal. It is always a question of striking a balance between what is environmentally correct while giving areas a boost. I am on record as saying that the extremes of both positions have to guarded against. The extreme environmental position is that, say, County Leitrim should be left more or less as it is, that there should be no economic regeneration and that we should just drive out to see these places on a Sunday in our big cars. I have lived in rural areas all my life and that is not my idea of what rural Ireland is all about. On the other hand, there are those who say we should erect buildings of every possible kind which would ruin these areas. A balance must be struck.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle raised the question of the EU Commission approval. In general, we have reached an accommodation with the EU Commission regarding these State aids. Each scheme must be notified to the Commission, as I pointed out in the other House in emphasising the point about credit unions and the Commission. The proposal to provide capital allowances for crèches had to be notified to the Commission, and we only received approval a few months ago. That is an indication of the serious view the EU takes of all of these matters.</P>
      <P>Regarding the urban renewal and rural renewal schemes, except in the most exceptional cases it is no longer possible to allow rent and rates relief because they would be regarded as operating aids. Anything that relates to the profit and loss account is out and anything that relates to the balance sheet can be in. Therefore, capital allowances on the assets would be allowed. There are rules for assessing the effect of capital allowances. I cannot make an absolute commitment that all types of assets in that area are automatically in. However, it can be taken that anything relating to profit and loss accounts will be regarded as operating aids and will be out, but anything relating to the balance sheet has a chance of staying in. Therefore, rent and rates relief are not being provided for anymore but the incentives regarding capital allowances, which most people think of because that is the big break which investors can write off against their income, are in. That is the general guideline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred on Second Stage yesterday to an idea we copied from the last Administration, which was to have an expert advisory panel. That was a good model to follow. Strictly speaking, under the Act the Minister for the Environment and Local Government recommends and the Minister for Finance sanctions. Technically, the Minister for Finance could sanction Senator Costello's backyard as eligible for a special scheme. However, it <Col N="1109" /> would not be good to allow politicians do that in the current climate.</P>
    <P>The previous Government recommended that local authorities would send their recommendations for the last urban renewal scheme to an expert advisory panel of architects, engineers and other consultants. I do not know the names of anyone on that panel because it was in place before I became Minister for Finance. This Administration thought that was a good idea. The panel made recommendations on the urban renewal scheme to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who, without changing a comma, sent it on to the Minister for Finance to be put into legislation. That was a good model to copy. I know it takes power away from elected representatives who, as I have argued on other occasions, should be prepared to make decisions. However, there was a good reason for going that particular route in an area as sensitive as this.</P>
    <P>I might not necessarily agree &ndash; Senator Bonner undoubtedly does not &ndash; with some of its recommendations. Senator Finneran said he read some of the recommendations and did not agree with leaving out Roscommon town. It is difficult to know, on the face of it, why that town was included previously and then excluded. However, the expert panel made the recommendation to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, which he automatically brought to the Government. It sanctioned his recommendations and I brought them into effect. There also will be an expert panel for the town renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>The town renewal scheme is very attractive because, as a result of having to knock out rent and rates, the capital allowance breaks are considerably higher. I explained to Senators about the guidelines of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The scheme is based on town renewal plans. Provision for such plans will be made in a Bill to be brought forward by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the urban renewal and seaside resort schemes. I welcome those schemes and Donegal has had its share of them, particularly Letterkenny and Bundoran. However, as a practising accountant, I have seen where the benefits of those schemes have, sadly, gone. Those paying high rates of tax got the tax advantages. Property developers and speculators made the real gains. While the towns received some benefit from the implementation of the schemes, Donegal needs employment and these schemes have done nothing in that regard, except for the building industry while the properties were being developed. I am looking for something that will bring industry to the rural parts of Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred earlier to the tourism industry, which is totally neglected and has never been <Col N="1110" /> developed. I am disappointed there is no cross-Border body in this regard, although a company was set up under the Good Friday Agreement. I hope that when peace comes to our land, whether we have one or two states, the whole of Northern Ireland and Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan can eventually be treated as one area in terms of tourism.</P>
    <P>The first people to jump at these town renewal schemes are the speculators and property developers. A town renewal scheme will not create jobs. I am looking for something broader to cover rural areas, including smaller rural towns.</P>
    <P>We are disadvantaged in Donegal in that we have two development authorities. Údarás na Gaeltachta deals mainly with west Donegal and the IDA deals with east Donegal. The Tánaiste has been in Donegal quite a lot due to the position in Fruit of the Loom. I appreciate the effort she is making on behalf of the people who lost their jobs in that company. However, I sometimes wonder, when listening to her contributions, if she realises there is a west side to Donegal. People are pushing for the development of Derry airport. The Tánaiste and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation always speak about Derry airport but they forget there is an airport in west Donegal.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to develop an in-between scheme for Donegal or to at least give us the same rural renewal scheme that was given to the upper Shannon. If possible, he should broaden that scheme to include tourism. The tourism industry is not being serviced in Donegal. Údarás na Gaeltachta is not in a position to do anything for tourism in west Donegal. Bord Fáilte and the IDA are not based in the county and have neglected it. Unless we get a fantastic deal when the CFP is renewed in 2002 which will get our fishing industry back to full strength, the only hope for Donegal is the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I am looking for tax incentives, grants or whatever it takes to develop the tourism industry. I appreciate the Minister gave reliefs for the hotel industry in his first budget. I discussed that with the Minister, Deputy McDaid, before it came up in the budget. However, we do not need large, four star hotels in Donegal. We need the refurbishment of smaller, family run hotels which have become run down and have been struck off the register by Bord Fáilte. We also need the development of smaller tourism infrastructure which will provide something for tourists other than scenery. I am looking for something like the rural renewal scheme in the upper Shannon region for west Donegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's intention is to get the maximum benefit from any tax incentives. The urban renewal schemes for the smaller towns represent a new approach which is more focused than the tourism resort scheme. It is worth giving it a try for the first three years to see how it affects the areas. I think it will play a very important part in the regeneration and sus<Col N="1111" /> tainable development of the small towns which we are finding it difficult to make economically viable. We can learn from the previous schemes.</P>
      <P>The Minister has outlined previously that he is open to taking into consideration the position of the European Commission on competitiveness and tax incentives. However, given the national development plan, it is important for the Minister to focus on development, particularly of the regions, and to give the necessary capital tax breaks. Knock Airport is strategically positioned for economic development. We will have to devise systems to develop those centres. Our national spatial policy will give us a greater understanding of how we wish to develop and the incentives that are necessary.</P>
      <P>I welcome the commitment in relation to the renewal of small towns, which is positive. It will not solve all problems but it will underpin the economic viability of smaller towns. It will provide an investment package that will largely benefit the residents in those places rather than outside investors. It is positive and we must remain focused on it.</P>
      <P>As the previous speaker said, there is a need for the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Department of Finance to focus on tourism from the perspective of people who have been in the industry and have made contributions to it. We are not suggesting massive schemes but small refurbishment schemes to give those people the opportunity to update their premises with the modern conveniences that are necessary for the demands for the services they create, in order that the people can themselves benefit rather than outside investors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take on board what Senator Bonner has said. There are other parts of the country like west Donegal. There is a group in the south which has been trying to achieve a measure such as he suggested which is a type of incentivisation but one linked to creating employment in the longer term, rather than just giving the benefit of a boost of economic activity. It depends on the part of the country in which one lives and what type of economic activity is most desirable. We have looked at some ideas over past years following the very active group in the south which has more or less the same idea as the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Chambers also referred to this matter. There are parts of the west of Senator Chamber's home county with which I am quite familiar and which could do with the type of activity suggested. It is very similar to west Donegal, about which Senator Bonner has been speaking, and it needs a kick-start. A measure is needed to attract development there to kick-start a number of activities. I am conversant with the issue and if we can come up with some better and more innovative ideas, I will consider them. The schemes we have had have worked well in some areas and not as well in others, but if anyone has <Col N="1112" /> better ideas I am always willing to consider them. I will consider the comments of both the Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the increase of 50 pence excise duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes. It is unfortunate that this is passed on to the consumer but it does not really penalise the producer in terms of the profits of the tobacco company. An estimated 6,000 people die from the effects of tobacco smoking, an enormous figure. Would the Minister not devise a mechanism whereby there could be some penalty imposed, rather than the normal corporation tax, on the tobacco companies or would that be discriminatory?</P>
      <P>Would it be permitted, for example, to impose the full amount of corporation tax which originated at 40% rather than the reduced one that we introducing now &ndash; 20% to 12.5% &ndash; to make it unprofitable to carry on producing these products, which are enormously dangerous to the health of the nation? If it could not be done in that way, could a tax be imposed relating to the detriment to the health of so many consumers who are the users of such products, in terms of the health service costs currently borne by the taxpayer? Has the Minister any imaginative thoughts on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for an excise duty increase in tobacco products which, when VAT is included, amounts to an increase of 50 pence per packet of 20 cigarettes with pro-rata increases in other tobacco products. This section confirms the budget day increases. New rates are set out in the Third Schedule. The increases are expected to yield £132 million this year. The estimated increase in the consumer price index is 0.756%.</P>
      <P>In response to the increasing cost to the Exchequer caused by the adverse health effects of smoking, an amount equivalent to the extra yield from this increase will, with effect from 1 January this year, be paid by the Revenue Commissioners by way of appropriations-in-aid to the Department of Health and Children to help fund a national cardiovascular health strategy. It is expected that this significant increase of 50 pence will reduce projected cigarette consumption below what it would otherwise have been, particularly among younger smokers who may be more price sensitive than other persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unusual for the price of tobacco to be increased in budgets, even though in recent years we have not increased it greatly. This is by far the biggest increase ever made but it is different this year as the money is dedicated to the Department of Health and Children to deal with the national <Col N="1113" /> cardiovascular health strategy. I note that my counterpart Mr. Gordon Brown, by putting 25 pence on a packet of cigarettes yesterday, has taken the same approach and the revenue will go to the UK department of health.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello made the point about the number of deaths caused by smoking or smoking related ailments. I would not describe myself as a person who has given up cigarettes but I have been off them for a little over six and a half years and I admit that I could be back on them tomorrow. I would not like to make predictions about staying off cigarettes forever as someone who was a very heavy smoker up to that time.</P>
    <P>The joint committee on health will consider a wide variety of measures relating to the tobacco industry. Reports in the newspapers indicated its intention to bring persons before it. To do as the Senator advocates and target the tobacco manufacturer directly would be impossible under EU legislation. It would constitute unfair treatment of a particular industry. We could apply the same thinking to the alcohol industry. I am afraid it is not possible to do it that way under present EU legislation. I sympathise with the motives behind the Senator's suggestion but it not possible to do that at present.</P>

It has one beneficial effect but the other effect is to increase inflation. The theme of my Second Stage contribution yesterday was the danger of inflation. I was not being critical of the Minister or the Government but I witnessed the terrible effects of inflation in the 1980s. It is a cancer in society and a tax on the poor.

This year I decided for health reasons to add 50 pence to the price of a packet of cigarettes which had, as Senator Doyle pointed out, an adverse effect on the consumer price index. As I pointed out earlier it adds 0.756% to the consumer price index. That has contributed to the <Col N="1114" /> upward spike in inflation at present, but I considered it was time to send out a clear signal with regard to health that tobacco is harmful and that we must start doing something about it. I bore in mind the effect it would have on inflation.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, coupled with the increase in the excise in the budget is the continuing weakness in the euro against the dollar and the strength of sterling against the euro, added to which is the continuing price increase of oil over the past 12 months or so. In that period the crude oil price rose from $10 to $29 a barrel. If one adds the effect that had on oil and oil-related products, the weakness of the euro against these currencies and the tobacco price increase, it makes up roughly half the 4% increase in the CPI in recent months.</P>
      <P>As I have said elsewhere, all things being equal, we expect the consumer price index to spike upwards from the middle of the year and then work itself backwards. We are not predicting a continuing increase at the same levels in oil and oil-related products. We also expect the euro to recover somewhat against the other major currencies. The consumer price index figure includes both tobacco and mortgages. In the 1970s, a predecessor mine, Richie Ryan, initiated the use of mortgages in the CPI but nobody took much account of it. The people one may wish to take account of it in wage negotiations do not do so.</P>
      <P>The CPI is based on a basket of goods and people's spending habits. It is reviewed every few years in CSO surveys. Unfortunately, tobacco makes up a large proportion of people's spending and consequently the CPI reflects that.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator Joe Doyle's point that spiralling inflation is something we had to live with in the past. However, Senator Doyle and I could not have envisaged many years ago, when we got to know each other first, that we would now be worried about an inflation rate of 4%. At the time it was three or four times that rate, which proves that all things are relative. Hopefully, the peak in inflation will more or less pan out as I have predicted, that it will spike upwards a bit more and then work itself backwards.</P>

      <P>I have already written to the Minister concerning coach operators, particularly in the west. Due to emigration, coach operators in north Donegal and along the west coast have traditionally transported people to Scotland. Twenty or 30 years ago the service provided by CIE was minimal while the cost was high, which led to the development of independent coach operators. Nowadays, such operators provide daily services to Belfast, Dublin and Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> When this provision was announced in the budget speech, the difficulty the operators had was the fact that there was not a great supply of low sulphur fuel. They were perturbed and felt that CIE or Bus Éireann, who appeared to be the only importers of this kind of fuel, had got at the Minister. As far as I recall, in his reply the Minister said he would not introduce the order until he was happy that a supply of such fuel was available to all areas of the country. I would ask the Minister to delay introducing the order until every area is covered.</P>
    <P>Another issue arose concerning these bus operators, which perhaps should be dealt with under the section relating to value added tax. Coach operators who service the Donegal to Belfast route have visited the Department of Public Enterprise. They have experienced difficulties in obtaining a rebate on fuel used when they cross the Border. They have no difficulty with the run from Donegal to Dublin, but those operating from west Donegal to Coleraine and Belfast have a difficulty in claiming the duty rebate. I have discussed this matter with the Department of Public Enterprise on a number of occasions but there does not seem to be any way around it. These operators feel that CIE has an advantage. I have not received a reply from the Department of Public Enterprise as to whether or not CIE obtains such a rebate. This matter, coupled with the anomaly of the Belfast run, would be a bit hard to take if the fuel was not readily available.</P>

      <P>This section amends section 99 of the Finance Act, 1999, to clarify the scope of the mineral oil tax relief for fuel used in passenger road services and to seek to give relief to low sulphur diesel. I have already answered some parliamentary questions on this matter and I have also written to a number of Senators and Deputies about it. When I announced this measure in the budget CIE did not jump with joy either. The company was not mad about having it at all, so while the private operators might think it was done at the behest of CIE that was not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this is an environmental measure, I recognise the problem regarding the supply of low sulphur diesel. There is a subsection in the Bill which provides that this measure will not take effect unless and until I sign a ministerial order. In replies I have already given, I said I will not sign such an order until I am satisfied that there are adequate supplies of low sulphur diesel. On the other hand, I am not prepared to wait forever, otherwise nobody will start stocking low sulphur diesel fuel. I will consider the situation over the coming months and I will give a guarantee that I will not sign the order until I am happy that adequate supplies of low sulphur diesel are available. I want to encourage people to move in this direction. I noted that in his budget yesterday, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Gordon Brown, also introduced a concession regarding <Col N="1116" /> low sulphur petrol. I am glad to see that the UK is following our initiatives.</P>
    <P>I will further investigate the matter the Senator raised regarding the fuel rebate with my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>

      <P>This section gives effect to my budget announcement to extend relief for transfers of land to young trained farmers for a further three years to 31 December 2002. Since the budget and arising out of discussions on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, I have decided to increase the relief from two thirds to 100% of the duty that would otherwise be payable. The relief currently costs £4 million in a full year and when this further change is estimated, giving 100% relief, it will cost an additional £2 million bringing the total cost in a full year to £6 million.

      <P>In this section &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;residence&rdquo; for capital acquisitions tax. I read in a consultant's document recently that this was one of the most substantial changes introduced by the budget. Switching the basis of capital acquisitions tax from domicile to residence could cause considerable concern among foreign executives in Ireland as their estates could come under the scope of Irish gifts and inheritance tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 137, 138 and 139 give effect to the proposals in the budget seeking to change the basis on which gift and inheritance tax are charged on assets situated outside the State. Under the existing rules liability for tax can arise <Col N="1117" /> for either the disponer who is domiciled in the State or the property comprised in a gift or inheritance situated in the State, regardless of domicile or residence of disponer. Property situated in the State remains liable for tax, but I am replacing the general domicile rule with a residence rule so that foreign assets will now be liable for tax whether the disponer or beneficiary is resident or ordinarily resident in the State. Gift or inheritance tax will be contingent on the residence criteria, which brings them into line with the general basis for liability in tax systems both here and abroad.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle referred to persons working here for foreign companies. A foreign domiciled person will not be considered to be resident or ordinarily resident in the State unless he or she has been resident here for five consecutive tax years before the relevant date. This five year condition started to run from 1 December 1999 so that a foreign domiciled person living in this State would not be affected by the new residence rule until 2004, giving them time to take full account of the new rules. To ensure that an Irish domiciled non-resident person cannot evade a charged tax by artificially changing the location of Irish assets by transferring them into a foreign, family-controlled, private company, the new residence rules contain provisions to maintain a charge of tax of such assets. The measures contained in sections 137, 138 and 139 apply to gifts and inheritance taken on or after 1 December 1999 except in the case of gifts or inheritance taken under a trust in existence on that date for the present domicile rules to begin to apply. Section 137 sets out the circumstances under which a person will be regarded as resident or ordinarily resident in the State for the purposes of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976. The section has effect in relation to gifts and inheritance taken on or after 1 December 1999.</P>
      <P>Some concern was expressed when I referred to this in the budget, particularly in relation to executives living here, as the Senator said. However, if they are foreign domiciled they will not be regarded as resident until they have been here for five consecutive tax years. Those five years started on 1 December 1999 and it would not take a lot of planning for them to ensure they would not get caught &ndash; the period is five consecutive years and the residence and ordinarily resident rules apply. There should be no difficulty for persons like that.</P>

Taken together, the new group threshold, particularly the group 1 threshold of £300,000, and the 20% rate of tax will substantially reduce the liability of beneficiaries under capital acquisitions tax. When the dwelling house exemption in section 151 is also taken into account, the package of measures in the Bill constitutes the single biggest reduction in the incidence of capital acquisitions tax since its introduction in 1976. Accordingly, I must oppose this recommendation.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to change the group 2 category to £30,000 for brother or sister of the disponer. Does the Minister consider that adequate, particularly if the brother or sister is elderly and unable to contribute much income if he or she is living in the home?</P>

      <P>Senator Bonner raised the matter of the principal private residence being inherited and this is now exempt. The thresholds apply after that. I have also made a significant change to the aggregation rules, which are desperately complicated. I had to get expert officials to explain how they used to work. The new aggregation rules deal with aggregation within classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator is correct. If the then Minister, Richie Ryan, had provided for indexation from 1976 the present threshold limits would be approximately £900,000, as someone showed <Col N="1119" /> recently. I have changed the rate also by reducing it to 20%, which is far more agreeable to most people. There may be other significant changes and it is now reasonable to have a class 1 threshold at £300,000.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello makes a good point about the class 2 threshold, which I have increased from £20,000 to £30,000. The reason is that when adding up the cost of the changes we were making, I decided not to increase it by a greater amount because the vast bulk of the money we get under capital acquisitions tax comes from people at the class 2 threshold, brothers and sisters.</P>

Class 3 deals with other categories such as strangers, and that threshold has been increased to £15,000. Before the budget Deputy Noonan suggested there should only be two classes, which would make it far neater, but the reason I did not raise the class 2 threshold any higher this year is that I added up the other changes. As this is where the bulk of the money comes from, I decided not to increase it on this occasion. I may revisit the issue again.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 281, before section 154, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>154.&ndash;Section 944A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 (inserted by section 134(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Finance Act, 1998) is hereby amended by the deletion of 'may make arrangements for the publication of reports of such of their determinations as they consider appropriate,' and the substitution therefor of 'shall make arrangements for the publication of reports of their determinations,'.</P>
      <P>I am seeking that, in the event of an appeal to the appeal commissioners in relation to a tax liability, the decision be reported and published. The appeal commissioners exercise a quasi-judicial function in relation to Revenue liability which is being contested and the decision taken by them is in the public interest. I am not saying we should be given the names of the people involved or any personal details in relation to a decision. However, if Revenue believes that a tax liability amounting to millions of pounds is involved, in the interests of transparency and accountability whatever point of law is brought to bear in making the decision should be a matter of common knowledge. The findings of reports, as distinct from their details, should be made available.</P>

      <P>This recommendation proposes that, first, the appeal commissioners must, rather than may, publish their determinations and, second, that they must publish all their determinations rather than those they consider appropriate. The role of the appeal commissioners is that of a fact finding body. They make their determination in relation to a tax appeal on the basis of the facts found at a hearing before them. The taxpayer is entitled to seek a re-hearing before a judge of the Circuit Court, while both the taxpayer and the inspector of taxes can appeal points of law, by way of a case stated, to the High Court. Some of the appeals on which the appeal commissioners make determinations find their way into the public arena if they reach the High Court. Hearings at the Circuit Court are held <i>in camera.</i> However, many of the appeal commissioners' determinations are of no practical importance to anyone other than the taxpayer and the inspector of taxes, for example, a determination on whether a taxpayer is entitled to a sub-contractor's certificate or whether a taxpayer lives on £15,000 or £20,000 per year. If the appeal commissioners were required to publish all their determinations it would be wasteful of their time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Finance Act, 1998, I introduced legislation, with the approval of the appeal commissioners, to allow them to make public the <Col N="1121" /> determinations which they consider appropriate. I understand that with the assistance of the Institute of Taxation, a website is available on which the appeal commissioners can make determinations public. In the past ten days or so I understand they made 25 determinations available on this website. This is the first time this took place.</P>
    <P>It is preferable that we allow the appeal commissioners to exercise their judgment as to what determinations they consider should be made public. Now that publication has commenced, some time should elapse before any changes to the present arrangement should be considered. In any event, I would not make any change to the legislation without further consultation with appeal commissioners. For these reasons, I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>
    <P>Before there was any hullabaloo, I determined in the Finance Act, 1998, that the facility would be provided for the appeal commissioners to put their determination. It was lucky I did so because of subsequent events when appeal commissioners' determinations in the past 18 months caused debate inside and outside the House. Under the Finance Act, 1998, appeal commissioners are entitled to publish their determinations. The first batch of determinations were published in the past ten days. A matter of public controversy can be isolated in the determinations even though no names are published. It would not take a genius to work out to which case this refers. We will await the new process because I believe the changes are adequate.</P>

      <P>No, the 1998 Act provides that this is at the discretion of the appeal commissioners. I am sure Senator Bonner had many cases going before the appeal commissioners. Ten years ago under the old system one would spend a lot of time going to appeal commissioners seeking appeals. Nowadays appeal commissioners are more likely to determine issues of substance. Many appeal commissioners' decisions would be of no practical significance to anyone bar the taxpayer concerned. They are not points of law, they are points of determination.</P>

      <P>There is always a right of appeal beyond the appeal commissioners to the next court or the High Court. These cases are heard in public. The reason I included this provision in the 1998 Act had nothing to do with the subsequent issue which became a matter of public controversy. Many tax practitioners thought it would be a good idea to be aware of the pre<Col N="1122" /> cedents being set by the appeal commissioners on points of law. The Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, was a tremendously worthwhile initiative. The previous consolidation Act was enacted in 1967 and there were many Finance Acts in the interim. Many people, including myself, thought that some of the major rulings of the appeal commissioners would help tax practitioners. Given that the Revenue Commissioners' tax practices, notes, guidelines and statements of practice can be looked at by the tax practitioners and the taxpayer, I thought it would be a good idea if the appeal commissioners' precedent rulings should also be available. This is the reason I included this provision in the Finance Act, 1998. I believe the cases of significance will be published.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will refresh me in relation to where it states, &ldquo;publication will be prohibited in cases involving a voluntary disclosure&rdquo;. Most of this arose from the Revenue audits commenced in the late 1980s. When the taxpayer received notice of the Revenue audit, the Revenue auditor sat down with the taxpayer and one of the first issues that arose was voluntary disclosure. In most cases where no tax arose, other than what was disclosed at that discussion, the practice was that publication did not take place. In recent years due to Ansbacher accounts, DIRT tax and CMI the Revenue will probably write to certain taxpayers. At what stage will the Revenue regard a voluntary disclosure as a voluntary disclosure? Will the taxpayer have to go to the Revenue first on notice from the Revenue that it wishes to inquire about certain matters? Should the taxpayer come clean at that stage where would he stand in regard to voluntary disclosure?</P>

      <P>I presume, sooner or later, the Senator and I will be back practising that particular profession so we had better know what the rules will be. I am aware that some of the concerns he has raised are engaging the minds of some tax practitioners. Recent events have led to some tax practitioners and the Revenue officials asking how this will operate in the future. Everybody is so particular now that they will make sure <Col N="1123" /> they are covered, irrespective of the consequences, and maybe irrespective of whether they collect the money. When the Senator and I were young chartered accountants the attitude of many of the Revenue officials was to keep the file right. They did not care whether the taxpayer paid the money, that was not their job. It was the job of somebody else to collect it.</P>
      <P>In the past 12 years there has been a totally different and far better way of doing things which has led to greater compliance. The Revenue have brought the affairs of most people up to date and everybody has done well. The good co-operation between tax practitioners and inspectors of taxes has worked well. I would hate to see, due to recent events, that everybody would be worried about keeping things right. The compliance culture has been brought about by a pragmatic approach by inspectors of taxes. Credit must go to the Revenue Commissioners for the changes that have taken place in this area. The Senator and I will remember the nonsense which took place in 1987 and 1988 and how the whole system did not fall in on top of itself is mind boggling. When one looks back on it now one realises it was ridiculous. The changes brought about by the Revenue certainly deserve a chapter in the growth of the Celtic tiger and have resulted in the burgeoning Exchequer finances. I have said that on a number of occasions but I am not sure if I said it in the House. It is important to say it now given some of the criticism from ill-informed sources &ndash; politicians and others &ndash; about the activities of the Revenue Commissioners in recent years. The changes that have taken place in the past 12 years in the whole Revenue area have been extraordinary and are up to the mark when compared with anywhere in the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Under the code of practice for Revenue auditors a voluntary disclosure takes place where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that, before any investigation or inquiry has been commenced by them into any matter occasioning a liability, the person has voluntarily furnished to them complete information in relation to, and full particulars of, that matter.</P>
      <P>The effects of voluntary disclosure are as follows: publication will not arise &ndash; see section 1086 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997; penalties are mitigated unless prohibited by law or otherwise considered inappropriate; while no absolute assurance can be given, it is normal practice for Revenue to be influenced not to seek prosecution, as outlined in section 1067 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, and a monetary settlement is accepted.</P>
      <P>In the case of audit based on a notice under section 956 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, the disclosure can be made after the audit notice has issued, but it must be made before an examination of the books and records has begun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following are the conditions for voluntary disclosure. Complete information must be given. <Col N="1124" /> This means not just information for the tax head and years or periods indicated in the audit notice but also information in relation to material amounts of all tax for other years or periods. Liabilities to gift and inheritance taxes should be included. Full co-operation throughout the audit must be provided. This includes dealing fairly and honestly with Revenue, supplying the information and explanations sought in a complete manner and without delay, providing documents and explanations necessary to assist in any verification process, and at the end of the investigation, providing prompt payment of tax, interest due and penalties offered, to facilitate consideration and, if deemed acceptable, agreement at the appropriate level with Revenue.</P>
    <P>Given the various investigations and reports I am of the view that in the next couple of years we shall return to this matter. The Senator and I are aware that the number of man hours that must go into one individual audit by both the Revenue official and his superiors and the accountancy practice is considerable. If one was to multiply it by a couple of hundred or a thousand taxpayers it would be a millennium hence before there would be any decisions.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has clarified the issue of voluntary disclosure. However, he said it would be before examination of the books begin by the Revenue. What does that mean? If the Revenue initiate the procedure and have reason to believe a person has defaulted, but have not examined the books, is that the cut-off point in respect of voluntary disclosure? If incorrect information was given in relation to the tax amnesty surely&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>An audit notice is usually sent out saying an audit will take place. Usually a date is arranged to meet in the accountancy firm or in the person's premises. Before the actual audit takes place the taxpayer must comply with the voluntary disclosure conditions and say, &ldquo;Here are my sins, I want to own up to them before you start the audit.&rdquo; That is a voluntary disclosure.</P>

Items are cropping up that are not necessary under the Revenue audit such as CMI &ndash; and without anticipating anything &ndash; the DIRT investigation. When is the taxpayer sure he has made a voluntary disclosure? Has he to go before he receives these <Col N="1125" /> notices? Maybe this has not been thought out yet within the Revenue.</P>

      <P>I also compliment the Minister on his contributions to this debate. As I said at our parliamentary party meeting when the budget <Col N="1126" /> was announced, this year's budget was excellent and this is an excellent Finance Bill. I have a slight reservation about the fact that the £3,000 tax free allowance has not been extended to non-caring spouses. This measure would not have been costly. Many of these spouses are now in their late 50s and will qualify for the old age pension within ten years. I hope the Minister will examine this suggestion in the longer term. Having impressed on the Minister on numerous occasions the need to take measures to help the west of Ireland, particularly the west of Donegal, I am confident he will introduce such a measure before next year's budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann congratulates the Minister for Public Enterprise on the largest ever capital provision for public transport, in the form of the £2.2 billion commitment in the national development plan, and in particular welcomes:</P>
      <P>&ndash;the £1,600 million allocation to transform the public system in the greater Dublin area;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" />&ndash;the £500 million commitment to the revitalisation of the mainline railway;</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>&ndash;the £150 million being provided for the upgrading of national public transport services.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for Public Enterprise. When she took office in the summer of 1997 public transport was at a crossroads, which was a maze. There was no clearly defined direction on the role of commercial semi-State companies, particularly public transport which had contributed much during the decades to our economic prosperity. The motion, which is timely, rightly pays tribute to the Minister for the enormous work she has done in the development of a national public transport infrastructure, not just in its planning and policy making but in the commitment of money now and in the future. That is the most significant element. A total of £2.2 billion is to be invested under the national development plan. This represents an investment on a scale undreamed of previously which, when fully committed, will transform the public transport landscape through the provision of a fully integrated system.</P>
    <P>Everyone agrees that following many years of neglect the public transport system was awash with deficiencies. A strategy had to be put in place and huge capital resources allocated to achieve revitalisation. Those who suggest that there is a quick fix solution to traffic gridlock fuelled by the booming Celtic tiger are living in the land of make believe.</P>
    <P>Shakespeare once said, I think in Hamlet, &ldquo;There is something rotten in the state of Denmark.&rdquo;  I will not use that phrase in referring to CIE, although I am tempted to do so. From personal and inside knowledge, it is a sick, troubled company which rakes over old coals in press releases and leaks. For years management blamed successive Governments for starving it of money. It now has money upfront, yet judging from recent happenings there is a serious malaise at its core and this must be rooted out. I am fully confident that the Minister's radical approach to public transport will work and eradicate this stultifying, self-strangulating culture of dangerous irresponsible brinkmanship and malpractice from the company. I regularly travel around the country and have heard many stories which I will save for another day.</P>
    <P>A total of £1.6 billion is to be spent under the national development plan to radically transform public transport in the greater Dublin area. Proposals already approved in respect of Luas include the Tallaght to Connolly light rail line and the Sandyford to Dublin Airport line. The statutory procedures have been completed in respect of the light rail order for the line from Tallaght to Abbey Street and the order for the line from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green. The feasibility study of the section from St. Stephen's <Col N="1128" /> Green to Dublin Airport has been completed. This shows that the underground section from St. Stephen's Green to Broadstone is feasible in engineering terms. This knocks on the head Opposition assertions that it was a con job and could not be built. It has been costed at approximately £300 million. There has been preliminary public consultation on possible routes north of Broadstone.</P>
    <P>There is £185 million available for a short-term suburban rail programme. There is to be major investment in the phased purchase of 46 additional DART cars and 58 diesel rail cars. Improvements are being made in signalling, new stations are being constructed and platforms of existing stations extended to cater for eight car trains. Work is in progress at Raheny DART station in my constituency.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of expanding light rail, thereby increasing potential carrying capacity. This will involve an element of segregation. This is to be warmly welcomed and will only be achieved progressively. Those who have, naively, attempted to criticise the Minister for introducing modifications as the programme develops have their heads in the sand. Where modifications are meritorious one should have the courage of one's convictions and proceed with them. That is what the Minister is doing.</P>
    <P>There have been rumours that the light rail programme is to be scrapped. These can only be described as mischievous and do not merit further comment. A total of £430 million has been set aside to implement the surface elements of the programme. For some time the cynics have been rubbishing the prospects of an underground section for which a total of £500 million has been set aside. This is a clear vote of confidence on the part of the Minister who is determined to proceed with the programme.</P>
    <P>A total of £50 million is to be allocated to promote and improve the integration of the public transport system to be spent on such matters as integrated ticketing, additional park and ride spaces, public transport interchange and real time passenger information. These measures are designed to make it easier and more attractive to use public transport.</P>
    <P>On Dublin Bus, the Government funded the provision of 150 new buses last year. This year the company will purchase 225 new buses, of which 100 will replace buses currently in use. It is to be agreed that, slowly, the company is making efforts to clean up its public image. Every new bus purchased from here on will afford access to the disabled. I commend the Minister on pursuing this issue with determination, often against the odds. She responded promptly and effectively to the calls of those who were of the view that a terrible injustice had been inflicted on them during the years.</P>
    <P>The company will provide a service which respects the equal rights of access of people with a disability. That is a most important principle which the Minister has enshrined into the public <Col N="1129" /> transport development plan. The subject of people with a disability is a hobby horse of mine and of everybody in this House. I commend the Minister and warmly welcome her decision to set £10 million aside for the work to improve access to existing public transport, to which I referred earlier, for the mobility impaired and people with a disability. I note that she is seeking the advice of a new public transport accessibility committee on how this money should be spent and that is commendable. I welcome the fact that all new urban buses, DART and suburban rail cars will be fully accessible to people with a disability, as will new stations and the Luas light rail network. That is real progress in two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Bus has employed consultants on an important study to redesign the network so as to provide a mesh of services. At present the network is largely radial in that it provides services into and out of town and across town. The purpose of creating a web is to link suburbs, thereby eliminating much of the unnecessary through town traffic. That has been one of the big bugbears; therefore I welcome that study. Many more quality bus corridors are being developed, and better and extended cycling and pedestrian facilities will be provided also.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that the Minister has stated that her preference is the break-up of CIE into separate individual companies and that this is the best way forward for the national development of public transport. If that is her view, she has my full support based on my knowledge of what goes on.</P>
      <P>There is a commitment of £150 million for Bus Éireann and the provincial bus services. My colleague will refer to the railways. I do not know what the amendment means. I am sure it was tabled with the best of intentions and in the best interests of those who use public transport, but I do not understand it, given the progress made and the money which is already being used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontaíom leis an rún agus cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire ar ais go dtí an Teach seo. Molaim í as ucht an iarracht atá á dhéanamh aici agus an airgead atá á chur ar fáil do Iarnród Éireann chun an ábhar seo a chur chun chinn. I second the motion. Undoubtedly it is timely. Transport and infrastructure are top of the Government's agenda and these are among the main challenges facing us over the next decade or two. The way we deal with it will influence economic growth to a significant degree in the future also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a dearth of investment in road infrastructure and in the rail system over many decades. I join Senator Fitzgerald in applauding the Minister for the tremendous effort she is making to try to redress the neglect of several decades and ensure that we will have both road and rail <Col N="1130" /> transport systems commensurate with the requirements of the modern economy.</P>
    <P>By any standards, the national development plan, which is the most ambitious and comprehensive attempt to achieve investment in this island, is significant and augurs well for the future. It will take time for the comprehensiveness of, and enlightenment contained in, the plan to be seen and recognised. The overall investment involved is about £46 billion and the significant sum of £2.2 billion is being set aside to address the transport initiatives which need to be taken, particularly in the rail sector.</P>
    <P>It is simple enough to address the transport problem. If we are to succeed, it will require money, energy and a well structured corporate system. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has certainly played her part in setting out a blueprint as to how it should be tackled and ensuring that the necessary resources will be made available to implement the plan. Her record since coming into office two and half years ago is evidence of her absolute commitment to redressing the shortcomings in that company and, indeed, in the transport system. The sum of £185 million will be spent on suburban rail and already there are 73 new DART cars. There is to be further investment in 100 new cars. I welcome this because the DART has played a significant part. If there had been a little more enlightenment at the time the DART was constructed its tentacles might have been much more extensive. This would have assisted the traffic flows in Dublin and would have attracted people to the service. Therefore, I welcome the courageous decision of the Minister within the last year on Luas. As I have said here previously, she displayed considerable courage in backing the proposal to place underground a proportion of the Luas project. If one was designing Dublin again and looking to present needs, not to talk of the future, undoubtedly there would be a complete underground rail network.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The first step has been taken and it is essential. If the Minister had opted for an over-ground system, particularly in the city centre, obviously the prospect of ever having an underground system would have been lost forever. I compliment the Minister's initiative and all sides of the House should support it also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald dealt with the park and ride facilities. These will be extended and that is essential. A major part of the national development plan involves addressing these and having other satellite towns around Dublin taking some <Col N="1131" /> of the population. The efficient and cost effective movement of people between those centres and the capital is essential for future generations.</P>
    <P>There is a real need for extensive investment in the national rail network, both in the rail lines and the rolling stock. Through the various reports on rail safety, the Minister identified the need for such investment. I know from contacts with Iarnród Éireann that the company is importing and laying more rail and I welcome this. The emphasis which has been laid on regional centres, like Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford, is necessary but it also needs to be done within the framework of updating the culture of the company. I travel to Dublin from Waterford only very occasionally because often the schedule is not suitable. For an additional £5 one may upgrade to first class and that is useful because one may have breakfast on the train. However, there is a caveat, which is that one gets breakfast if the catering staff turn up and that is not always the case. If the company is to entice people to travel by rail, it needs to treat them better than that.</P>
    <P>On investment in rail, some of the poorest sections of rail are in Wexford, which is developing as a major centre of population. Many Dublin people are coming to live in towns like New Ross, Enniscorthy and Gorey and want to commute to Dublin. Therefore, it will be essential that there is attractive rolling stock. People are prepared to pay if they get a quality service.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned rail safety and I think the Minister is playing her part in this regard. Undoubtedly, we must ensure the contents of the national development plan are fully implemented and that the time schedule is adhered to. The Minister must also create a climate in which the company must compete. Competition will be the essence of quality and of raising standards and will ensure unions and management focus on the objective of serving the customer. Ultimately, companies should not exist unless they provide a proper service for customers at competitive rates. Competition is necessary. It will be difficult in terms of the rail network, but there is no reason we should be trying to protect State monopolies in terms of the Dublin and national bus routes. I would like to think the Minister will bring with her the management and board of CIE who should see the merits of pursuing that policy.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on her efforts and think she has the good wishes of the House in securing her ambitions and plans for a much better rail infrastructure and transportation system which are badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;condemns the Minister for Public Enterprise on her failure and that of the Government to adequately deal with the problems of deteriorating traffic gridlock and <Col N="1132" /> specifically deplores the lack of adequate financial subsidies to public transport services annually, to reform the Road Transport Act, 1932, the lack of any transport White Paper and the conflicting statements in relation to the future of both the Luas project and the CIE Group.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The current Dáil and Seanad will shortly be in existence for almost three years. If we examine how we travel to Leinster House, can we say that things have got better or worse? Have our commuting times got longer or shorter? Are our trains safer or more over-crowded? Are our buses as regular as we need them to be? There is gridlock not just in Dublin and our major cities but in towns throughout the country. There has been an explosion in car transport which is something we are not sufficiently addressing as a society. People want to bring their cars everywhere &ndash; if they could they would drive them into the local supermarket. We must change our thinking on how we shop, go to work etc.</P>
    <P>My commuting time to the House, regardless of the route I take, has certainly increased over the past three years. The park and ride facilities on the northside of the city were used by fewer people last Christmas than Christmas 1998. Things are not changing sufficiently on the ground. The complete and abject failure of park and ride facilities in Dublin is a disgrace and we must blame ourselves for not thinking about our journeys beforehand and using other means of transport. The Government's policy has failed in terms of existing park and ride facilities, irrespective of the new facilities which are promised. Nobody is using the park and ride facility in Whitehall, for example. Rather, we are all using our cars.</P>
    <P>The train from Drogheda to Dublin, which I took today, was more overcrowded than a year ago. Increasingly commuters are travelling by rail, but trains are seriously overcrowded. We have no problem with the plans to increase the amount of money invested in public transport, but we want to see a more significant change or effect which will be evident more quickly.</P>
    <P>Should we ban cars from the main streets of our towns and cities? I think it would make a lot of sense to examine this rather than building new car parks or attaching additional car parking spaces to planning permissions. In cities such as San Francisco permission is not given for developments if car parking is provided because the move is away from the individual and towards the public transport service. This is something we should examine. It will require a change in mindset but it will have to be done.</P>
    <P>Another issue is incentives for people who wish to provide car parks on the periphery of towns at important strategic access points outside but near shopping areas. I would like to see a plan which encouraged, through Government subvention, etc., the provision of these facilities.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the question of CIE. As the Minister is aware, we were to sit all day tomor<Col N="1133" /> row, but sadly this has been altered due to the tragic death of a Member of the other House. I do not wish to raise all the issues I wanted to raise tomorrow, other than to say that in fairness CIE gets a lot of bashing, much of which is undeserved. Certainly those who work for the company are very committed to it. We must encourage more use of better public transport rather than bashing existing companies.</P>
    <P>The regulator for our public transport is very important, particularly in terms of safety. The report which was circulated is extremely critical of the safety culture in Iarnród Éireann. The Minister has taken much criticism over the issue of safety on public transport. A regulator for all transport by air, water and land should be separate from the Department of Public Enterprise and be vested in the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister said that as it is very important. It will certainly increase the confidence of people in the safety of all forms of transport.</P>

      <P>We ought to have a parallel movement encouraging the larger commercial enterprises in the city, such as office providers and insurance companies, to relocate in the provinces to areas such as Drogheda, Dundalk, Kildare etc. Making it attractive for such companies to relocate would make a lot of sense.</P>
      <P>The reality is that when we travel on the chaotic roads we are all moving in the one direction while practically nobody is going in the opposite direction. We must, literally, have two way traffic.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. I welcome the Minister to the House for this debate and look forward to her response to the various questions raised. I support and endorse fully the views of my colleague, Senator O'Dowd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was sorry to miss the comments of Senator Liam Fitzgerald &ndash; later I will read the Official <Col N="1134" /> Report. I agree with Senator Walsh that competition is vitally important in this sector and I accept everything the Minister has said about safety recently. &ldquo;Safety&rdquo; is the watch word and no short cuts can be taken in regard to this important issue. Sadly, I share many of Senator Walsh's experiences in regard to the availability of food on trains. It is great that vast numbers of people are using the rail network but overcrowding is a very serious matter and officials should be appointed to prevent people from accessing overcrowded trains. I cannot understand why an extra carriage or two cannot be made available. I look forward to the day when the people of the south-west will no longer be treated as second class citizens and proper rolling stock will run between Kerry and the capital, which is not the case currently.</P>
    <P>Traffic gridlock is increasing and there is a question about the adequacy of the annual financial subsidies for public transport subsidies. The Road Traffic Act, 1932, should be reformed and a White Paper on transport should be published. Conflicting statements have been made recently regarding the future of both Luas and the CIE group. The public perception of the group is that it is a mess because of all that has gone on internally. I look forward to the Minister addressing these points in her contribution.</P>
    <P>The perception is probably true that CIE has been treated as a political football and recent events have demonstrated that this is unfortunately the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The feeling is mutual. I am learning all the time. The Minister was quoted recently as saying that CIE had been broken up into three separate companies. I understood that was the case already and the three organisations operated under one umbrella.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was attributed to the Minister, perhaps incorrectly, that this was the answer to the gridlock. The break up of the group may be good and I await the Minister's comments with interest. However, it is not in itself the answer to the gridlock. The public interest is all that needs to be served. Sadly, there is some truth to the perception that people were appointed to the board of CIE as a reward for services rendered to party rather than country. CIE needs people with the necessary capability and expertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> Documentation has also been leaked on a regular basis and I invite the Minister to outline definitively her proposals for the future of the company. It is looked upon as a dinosaur but recent events have been akin to back stabbing. CIE's role should be defined and it should then be given the freedom to get on with the job without ministerial interference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>I did not call on the Minister to do so but I will address that issue later. CIE does not enjoy autonomy. How much freedom from Government involvement in industrial relations should CIE enjoy? What are the lines of demarcation between the roles of the shareholders, board and Executive? I want the Minister to outline her views on this key issue.</P>
      <P>The substance of both the motion and amendment is vital for all of us. I am delighted that the use of public transport is increasing. I agree with the Minister in regard to safety but overcrowding is the most serious problem faced by CIE. It is in evidence on a daily basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for tabling the motion and affording me the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I commend colleagues for their fine contributions, including those on the amendment, which was ably proposed and seconded. I will address the promotion of public transport in a proper manner, as Senators and I have a common interest in this regard. It would be remiss of me not to make some straightforward comments.</P>
      <P>CIE has given long and honourable service to the State and the nature of its work is not a source of disharmony in the House. However, for many decades CIE's mantra has been to give it the money and everything will be all right. Successive Governments of all persuasions decided that they would provide a Cinderella public transport service. I have reviewed records and letters pleading with Ministers of different parties to provide various resources and read the bland refusal of successive Ministers and Government to view public transport as a necessary part of everybody's life. I sometimes wonder how they slept at night given their knowledge of the condition of the rail network. However, that is how public transport evolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first rail line was built to Dún Laoghaire in 1838 and the network expanded after that <Col N="1136" /> throughout the land. Every Minister over the past 25 years allocated £100 million annually to CIE and trundled on. I was in office for only a few months when there was a major fatality at Knockcroghery in Roscommon. I visited the site of the accident and decided that I would not remain as Minister unless I was allocated the money to commission an independent study into rail safety. A total of £350 million has been provided and ring-fenced for rail safety over five years. A sum of £86 million was spent last year and £100 million will be spent annually over the next two years on various aspects of rail infrastructure, including signalling, rail stations and level crossings.</P>
    <P>Some people were extremely interested in safety but I was obsessed by it. I was deeply upset when the annual report I published on spending on rail safety was dismissed as a fig leaf last week. A total of 34 unreasonable risks were identified and only three were addressed. The Senators should remember that. Very positive measures were taken by the workers but a great deal was not done and rather than pretend everything is perfect, it would be better if the company concerned said that it has done some good and it will do more.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service asking if a day could be set aside to peruse this book. Last year, when I was looking for the money, safety was the most important issue. Now, when I have the money, everybody wants to dismiss it. We hear talk of a fig leaf and that everything is all right &ndash; until an accident occurs. The chairman of a State company will not be required to come into Dáil Éireann if a train accident occurs, but I will have to do so. I have provided the money. I cannot transform the 34 unreasonable risks. That is a matter for the company, which got the money to do it, but the minute an accident occurs, the person who is in charge is asked to come before Dáil Éireann, and rightly so, and be democratically accountable to the Parliament.</P>
    <P>Am I to be just a source or money, to dole out the money without ever opening my mouth? Is the company saying that if I give it more money it will be the most perfect railway company ever? I can tell Senators that I intend to take my duties seriously.  I intend to intervene if necessary. I do not intend to act like a zombie and simply say, &ldquo;How many millions do you want this year, boys? Do you want £500 million? You can have it all, just do not bother me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to take up the points about intervention and interference. I listened with great interest to this House this morning which demanded that I intervene to settle the bus strike. Last week, despite the fact that I did not intervene, I was hounded throughout the land for daring to intervene. I thank RTE for its apology on Tuesday night for the barefaced untruth that I had intervened with the Labour Court. In all my life I never went to a court to intervene about anything. Am I to shut up and give out money, but <Col N="1137" /> to intervene only when others want to hear me? That is not the way I do my business. I want to know where the nation's money is being spent, if it is being spent well and if there is a decent return for it. I want to know what CIE is doing with its money. Why should I not? I commend Mr. Fergus Finlay who wrote an article in <i>The Examiner</i> to the effect that I am not intervening enough and who went on to list out the areas in CIE where there needs to be a nanny in every corner. I am not taking at all from CIE. Why should I? It is the public transport company. I was raised five yards from the railway station in Athlone beside the sidings, the trains, etc., but I know that in modern life the rail service has to serve the customer as well as its employees.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked about competition. We do not intend to privatise the heavy rail system. We have a different gauge from the rest of the world. We had an Irish solution to an Irish problem when the rail tracks were being built, we were a united Ireland at that time and one could travel North-South, from Dublin to Belfast as we do today. We will not privatise that system simply because it gets a public subsidy of £100 million. It is a social as well as a practical service and it should be kept that way. That is what is needed in a country with very remote areas.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that this is the only Government that took the decision to keep all the operating tracks in operation and provide £350 million in five years, £500 million over seven years, to repair the rail network. Other Governments shied away from doing that. They did not take the decision to close the lines but they did not provide the money to repair them. I do not know how those Ministers responsible for transport put their heads on their pillows at night because it would be enough to give one a seizure before morning if one thought about it. The money has been provided but the emphasis has gone away from safety, that is until there is an accident.</P>
    <P>I want to come to the question of interference. I was highly amused when the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, got a telephone message from the chairman to Deputy Yates on her telephone. Was that not a delicious turn of events?</P>

Be that as it may, intervention is my middle name and I do not intend to become demure.

      <P>The original Luas idea was petty and paltry. I do not know what party will be in Government but the plan we will unfold very soon is for a comprehensive, completely underground system. In that regard, people have asked me how I could put a woman underground. That was said to me by a woman Deputy. How do they do it in London, where the underground was built 150 years ago? They were having palpitations about it. I regard it as sexist to ask me if I would put a woman underground. I do not mean when she dies but on an underground tram.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Liam Fitzgerald said one changes one's plans as one sees the need. Almost every city and large metropolitan area I have been in abroad has a very advanced public transport system. We do not because, for some mad reason, we fell in love with cars. Households first had one car and then had to have two and three cars. Senator O'Dowd referred to this. It is as if cars became gods to us and we neglected our public transport system. We now have the money and we intend to do what needs to be done.</P>
      <P>Competition is needed for Dublin Bus. The Cabinet took a decision on that last November. I have a paper for the 11 April meeting setting out the interim steps we can take before we change the legislation. We have received all the submissions. Competition would make Dublin Bus a better company. I am quite sure that will happen. I do not have time for a White Paper, unfortunately, because I want to get to work. White Papers require long consultations with everybody solemnly putting up their hands and fighting about it. We need to get to work on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> The money is there to be spent. My fear now is that CIE will not spend the money in time. It has spending plans and is ordering train and DART carriages and buses. The buses will all be accessible by the disabled. That issue has suddenly died away. Disabled people are trebly disabled if they cannot get to where they want to go. They are diminished as people if they do not have the freedom to get from point A to point B. I saw two of the low floor buses when I was coming to the House. They are not just for the disabled but also for parents with prams, older people who cannot manage the higher steps and so on. Every new bus &ndash; 235 will be bought this year &ndash; will be accessible by the physically disabled. Platforms are being lengthened around the country to accommodate the new train carriages. While there are still huge gaps, the necessary money is available and the work will be done. Public transport should be attractive, available and accessible &ndash; the three As.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

However, they decided to have a protest and they stopped every car leaving the premises to ask people to sign a petition. I refused. It is a rule of life, as far as I am concerned, that one should never sign anything when there is a gun to one's head. I said I would not sign it because they had delayed me for half an hour, but that if they posted it to me I would consider it. There was rabid fury among the people because we were delayed for 30 or 45 minutes. That is what happens.</P>
      <P>Everybody in this city has a direct interest in the conveniences afforded to us by an efficient, affordable and reliable public transport service, which is what I think these plans will give us. The Government has tabled a very clear and specific motion which is itemised and costed. It tells the House what we are getting, what is being applied for and so on and it congratulates the Minister. That is fair enough. However, I am an Independent Member and I do not belong in either main grouping. How could I support the amendment tabled by the Opposition? In the first place, there is a split infinitive in the opening sentence, which rules me out immediately, where it states &ldquo;to adequately deal&rdquo;. What would Kevin Myers say if I were to support this? He would go on again about my grammar and so on. More importantly, while it &ldquo;condemns&rdquo; and &ldquo;deplores&rdquo;, there is very little in it that is specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tone of the excellent contributions of Senators O'Dowd and Coghlan was very interesting. They were prepared to accept the Minister's correction on the hoof when she supplied the information. That is what good democracy and Parliament is about. When a serious question is raised and a Minister who is in control of the subject is able to deliver the answer straightaway, a gentlemanly Opposition spokesperson says he accepts the answer. That is what democracy is about. It was noticeable that the <Col N="1142" /> two Senators indicated they welcomed elements of the plan. There was none of the sharpness, tetchiness and partisan feeling one gets where there is a real issue of difference.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the amendment was tabled just for the sake of it and because that is what Opposition parties do. Unfortunately, Deputy Dukes, who is a decent man, created a crisis in his party when he took a different line and created the Tallaght strategy. One does not get rewarded in political life for agreeing with a Government when it is doing the right thing. I think the Government is doing the right thing here.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the technical details because, first, there is not much time and, second, in the three major debates we have had on this subject, particularly the Luas proposal, over the past five years, those of us who were pushing for this idea at least to be considered put a vast amount of technical, detailed information on the record. It would be fatuous of me to rehash all that, except to say that the principal arguments have been vindicated.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech, she makes the point that the geological survey proves we were right. CIE and the DTO said we were not. They damned us black and every way but sideways and said we were amateurs and knew nothing about geology and that the geological construction under the city of Dublin made it impossible to build an underground. Where are those arguments now? I will not try further to embarrass those people because I am a Christian and I know the old parable that there is more rejoicing in Heaven over one sinner that repents than over the 99 that are already saved. I rejoice and give thanks to God &ndash; Hallelujah &ndash; that some of the people in CIE have now turned completely around on their heads and they are coming out with the arguments which they derided in this House over the years. Thank God they have accepted the main outline which is perfectly clear.</P>
    <P>Pedestrians need to be favoured in the city centre. It is an eighteenth century city and the streets are narrow and twisted. The obvious place to put at least one element of mass transport is underground where, among other things, there is the advantage of being able to increase the frequency and the length of the trains. The passenger capacity can be massively increased and the surface of the city can be left to be fully enjoyed by the commuting public.</P>
    <P>The Minister also introduced a number of very important elements. She is absolutely right to make the point that the five-year railway safety programme is being introduced now before there is a really serious crash. Nobody will come in whinging afterwards. Fatalities happen regularly and are reported on the European television news in Germany, Italy, France and Britain. We have luckily escaped a major catastrophe which is amazing when one considers the appalling nature of much of the rolling stock, much of which <Col N="1143" /> will be replaced under these schemes. The Minister is absolutely right and it shows how on the ball she is that before there is a tragedy and not in response to a disaster, she comes in and provides the money.</P>
    <P>I was quite shocked to hear that there were 34 major risk elements isolated by a report and with the money provided by the Minister only three have been dealt with. Let us have the other 31 dealt with. If she wants to chase them and ask why they have not done this, present them with her shopping list and say that they should have done it, we will support her in this House on all sides &ndash; Senator O'Dowd is nodding. Of course we will.</P>
    <P>The Minister took the point on intervention I was going to make but she made it with such flair, saying that she is attacked for intervening and then called upon to solve the bus strike. Why should she not intervene? I listened with interest to a remark made on the Order of Business by my friend and colleague Senator Shane Ross who pointed out that she is the single shareholder. If she is to behave responsibly she has to intervene. There would be questions raised if she did not intervene and she is perfectly right.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the underground developments should be put out to public tender. We should maximise the private-public participation. Particularly in the light of the DTO's and CIE's lamentable performance, it is obvious that we should do this. Currently the DTO is using the excuse for upgrading it to a metro that traffic flow has increased unexpectedly, but in these sorts of transport circumstances one is required to plan for a 20-year advance period. If they did not foresee it why are they involved in this at all?</P>
    <P>I raise the question of the Assistant Secretary of the Department. I will not name the person who is a very professional man. There is an anomalous situation with which I would be uncomfortable and which is invidious for him because he is both project director and also on the two LRT monitoring bodies, which is unfortunate. I make no criticism of the person involved but it is a rather dangerous position.</P>
    <P>We in this House can claim credit because it was this House that amended the Dublin Transport Bill which permitted this wonderful development but do not let us forget that we were all briefed and provided with technical information by the people from the unified proposal. They were the people who were proved right above CIE and I hope they will be fully consulted and that the immense amount of time and energy and intellectual brilliance they showed will be rewarded by a role in the development of what they foresaw when the people in CIE could not do so.</P>

It is really invidious when one has to <Col N="1144" /> follow two of them. I will follow in a much more humble fashion. I wish I had the opportunity to welcome the Minister here but I welcome Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob. He is used to listening to me on many occasions.</P>
      <P>The Minister had the good grace to tell us &ndash; and I was glad to hear it &ndash; that she has read the transport document which I produced on behalf of the Progressive Democrats. I have, on a number of occasions on behalf of our party, introduced the blueprint of our ideas for the future of public transport in Ireland. I advise Senator Norris that I must claim some credit concerning Luas and that I completely agree with the remarks he made as well.</P>

      <P>More Ministers should behave in that open fashion. We are agreed that we need a major overhaul of our public transport system. We cannot deal with our increased prosperity and accommodate our full economic potential unless we do that. I welcome the commitment of the Government to public transport in the national development plan. Our view, the Minister's view and the view of everyone in this House, is that public policy has to centre on the needs of the consumer. We know, and it has been said, that for far too long the consumer was ignored by successive Governments. In the past there was a CIE policy, not a public transport policy. I have firm ideas about how we change that. The Minister has the courage to take on those people who have vested interests in order to implement exacting public policy.</P>
      <P>I put forward three key initiatives which are required if we are serious about developing public transport. A public transport authority should be established that will regulate all aspects of bus and rail transport on a national basis. Obviously, competition should be introduced in the bus market both in Dublin and other parts of the country, which is coming in at last but very slowly. The Minister will promote that as well. We need the complete restructuring of the appalling monolith that is CIE. Despite the comments made by the Minister on its long and honourable service of the past, it is not a suitable vehicle for the future.</P>
      <P>Each of the main subsidiaries, Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus, should be established as a separate and autonomous trading entity. I agree with the Minister who asked what the point was in having one chairperson over three bodies. It is crazy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> The first job of an independent regulatory body for the sector is to design the national public transport network. Currently we do not have a national network. There are no bus links between some neighbouring towns, while many of our larger urban centres have no local bus services. The authority could also be responsible for managing the State subsidy for public transport and ensuring that it is allocated as efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>The most important role for a public transport authority is in the area of competition. We need to repeal the outdated legislation of the 1930s which governs bus transport in Dublin. Much legislation which currently governs bus transport dates from the early part of the last century. We must empower the independent regulator to act as the licence-issuing authority for the sector, to set standards for the frequency, quality and reliability of services and to ensure that these standards are met. The issue of safety is paramount and I agree with what the Minister said earlier in that regard.</P>
    <P>Real competition in the bus market will offer great benefits to consumers. The Progressive Democrats Party believes the best way of achieving this is through re-regulation, not deregulation. We have seen from the British experience that full deregulation generated an immediate increase in competition, with several operators fighting it out on major routes. Over time, however, the strongest firms won out, leaving the consumer with a new monopoly which was worse than the old one. We do not want that to happen here.</P>
    <P>We propose a franchise-type system instead, with the regulator awarding licences for particular routes or areas via a competitive tendering system. The licences would cover set periods of time, perhaps five to seven years, and could then be re-advertised for competition. Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus could compete for the franchises on the same commercial terms as anyone else and, therefore, the system would be geared to the needs of the consumer.</P>
    <P>Competitive tendering would transform the bus market, bringing in new investment, new routes and new ideas for meeting the needs of consumers. God knows, our transport system needs that. It would also help to address the pressing public transport needs of major cities outside Dublin. In recent years much of the debate on public transport has focused almost exclusively on the needs of the capital. While that is understandable, Dublin is not the only city concerned. There are also serious public transport problems in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. In addition, there is a need for improved public transport services in places like Tralee, Clonmel, Sligo, Carlow and Letterkenny&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;all of which are growing into major urban centres in their own right. I am sure <Col N="1146" /> other Senators can quote similar examples elsewhere. If we had such a new regulatory regime it would create a transparent system whereby taxpayers and consumers could see precisely what services were being delivered in return for State subvention.</P>
      <P>Nobody could disagree that CIE is badly in need of restructuring. Thirteen years ago the group was split into three main operating units but, for a variety of reasons, that structure has not worked and CIE has not shown the flexibility of response required to meet the demands of a dynamic and rapidly changing society. There is insufficient management and financial autonomy in each of the operating companies. There is over-centralisation of decision-making at the group's headquarters in Dublin and industrial relations problems in one company tend to spill over into the others.</P>
      <P>There is also an amazing lack of integration in public transport, despite the fact that virtually all services are operated by the one group. In many parts of the country, buses do not connect with trains and<i> vice versa. </i> The most extraordinary sight at Blackrock DART station is to see the train pulling in just as the bus moves off. Where is the consumer service there? In some cases it seems as if CIE's road and rail companies are in competition with each other. For instance, the group's Rosslare-Wexford-Arklow-Dublin express bus service is in direct competition with the Rosslare-Wexford-Arklow-Dublin train service. Remarkably, the bus service is faster than the rail service.</P>
      <P>The three companies, larnród Éireann, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus, should be freed from the embrace of CIE. Each company should have full operational autonomy, financial independence and commercial freedom, including the freedom to compete with one another. There is a strong case for creating separate business units within Iarnród Éireann to deal with the management and development of infrastructure and the operation of train services.</P>
      <P>larnród Éireann has a major job of work to do if it is to deliver all the rail projects set out in the Government's ambitious and worthy national development plan. Early indications, however, give cause for concern. It has taken nearly four years to get the DART service extended to Greystones. Back in the 1840s it took William Dargan little more than that to build the new railway from Dublin to Cork.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important that the rail projects in the national development plan are delivered as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships can be used to achieve these badly needed projects. The DART is our flagship public transport service but, unfortunately, it has deteriorated in recent times. We need a customer-focused rail service that is competitive by international standards and able to deliver the type of quality service that is the norm in other countries of similar size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> I favour the concept of employee ownership which should be promoted within the CIE group of companies. In addition, we need to make public transport an integral part of the planning process. I welcome the fact that traffic impact was one of the principal grounds on which An Bord Pleanála rejected the application for the extension of the Liffey Valley centre this week. I hope this is a sign of a more integrated approach to planning in our major urban areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a shame the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, missed the <i>tour de force</i> we had from the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke. Even the Opposition would agree it was a joy to witness her competency in handling the matter without once glancing at her notes. However, I have a problem with the motion which concentrates only on money without saying whether we are spending it in the right way. That is the real challenge. We have never had a transport strategy in this country and we have underfunded road and rail transport, whether public or private. The only reason we got round to considering such expenditure was that a few years ago the EU suddenly gave us a lump sum. It told us what we could do with it and we came up with the idea of Luas which otherwise would never have seen the light of day. The irony is that we are now spending far more money to tamper with a system that would never have come about without EU aid.</P>
      <P>Senator Keogh was right when she said that we do not have an integrated transport strategy or system. Basically, Luas was a good idea and many European cities have such light rail or tram systems. In principle, such trams would also be a good solution for Dublin but only if they address the city's entire transport system. I am critical of the strategy because it does not integrate the whole system by linking all its elements together.</P>
      <P>When the Dublin Transportation Initiative started its work, light rail seemed an attractive option but because it was not driven by the underlying needs of how to spend EU money, it only designed part of a system rather than an entire one. The DTI made the merest genuflection to a light rail system to meet the needs of Dublin. Since it could not even build the tiny system envisaged at that stage, before the EU money ran out, it decided to go for only two southside lines, leaving the northside lines to be built sometime in the future. I am biased in favour of the northside of Dublin. As has been pointed out many times in the House, the Luas proposal was totally inadequate for Dublin's needs. A third line, which was not even envisaged four or five years ago, was, in the first instance, not designed to go to the airport. Most people would now admit that by ignoring the airport, the Luas project represented an amazing lack of foresight. It also showed a lack of vision in covering such a small part of the city and by failing, unbelievably, to integrate properly with the existing DART service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> In a series of influential newspaper articles, the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, pointed out that Luas showed a lack of vision because it would actually have added to traffic congestion rather than alleviating it. Under this Government we have action. I am not happy with this motion, but I must admit we have had action and I welcome that compared to what we had before. We have seen today the serious commitment to spending money and I welcome that also in comparison to what we had before. However, this is all useless if the central ingredient of strategy is not looked after, and sadly, that is the case.</P>
    <P>There is a huge transport problem in Dublin and throughout the country which has largely, although not entirely, been created by the unexpected scale of national growth in the last ten years. Our road system is inadequate and I hope we are long past the day when we thought more roads was the answer. That was a mistake many of us made &ndash; we thought that all we needed were more roads to solve the problem. However, we must also use roads, those in existence and those we need to build, with far more efficiency than we ever have before. This means diverting as much traffic as possible off roads and onto trains, whether local or national. We must use roads efficiently by encouraging the maximum possible use of public transport. This will not be achieved by squeezing motorists off the road. That will help, but it will only be achieved by providing a good attractive public transport system. As Senator Ryan said, it must be affordable.</P>
    <P>Allied to this must be a pricing system for roads and public transport that makes the latter an offer that the public cannot refuse. We have talked about pricing on roads, which is a dangerous topic because people think we are going to charge people to drive on roads. We have spoken before about the system in Singapore whereby if drivers insist on coming into the city at the peak period of 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. they have to pay, say, £1 to pass a toll. If they are willing to adjust to coming in after 9 a.m. they pay 50 pence, while it is free to come into the city before 7 a.m. or after 10 a.m. If this is possible in other countries it should be possible here.</P>
    <P>Our problems demand a holistic approach rather than a bitty one. Unless and until all the pieces come together this will not work. If we do a little it will not work. Unless we do it all it will not work at all. It is no good doing a little bit and hoping it succeeds, rather we must do the whole task and we are not doing so at present. That is the importance of strategy and an overall viewpoint. All the money the Government is boasting about will not solve our problems&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, on her continuing commitment to solving the transport problem in the city. I have said before that she is the first Minister with a visionary, strategic plan for the traffic situation that is not only being experienced in Dublin but throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The level of financial commitment that Senator Liam Fitzgerald outlined and to which the Minister also referred &ndash; £1.585 billion &ndash; is confirmation that she is seriously committed to solving the dreadful problems we have experienced. The extent of the problem is probably best gauged if we examine the progress of the DTI strategy which began in 1990. That strategy had broad support from all political parties and the public when it began. It was an integrated, comprehensive strategy to tackle the transport challenges then facing the city. Our experience since the strategy was adopted has been extremely disappointing, primarily because it had a very pessimistic basis. The demand for transport in the city has increased dramatically in the meantime and this is in some way due to the extraordinary economic growth the city has enjoyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The completion of various elements in the strategy have also been slowed down by localised opposition to various major infrastructural projects, with Luas being a case in point. Luas should have been up and running years ago, but unfortunately, due to ongoing pressure from local groups, it has been put back on many occasions and continues to be a bone of contention in many areas of the city. The tortuous planning and public consultation process has also slowed progress with major infrastructural projects, while the enthusiasm of the courts to entertain judicial review proceedings has also played a part in slowing the process. If we are to allow every crank and headbanger to hold up the progress of major infrastructural change to the extent that it has a major impact on traffic, then we must examine <Col N="1150" /> matters. The Minister has looked at the matter and I do not doubt something is afoot in this regard.</P>
    <P>Traffic congestion in the city has increased which has resulted in the average speed of cars being reduced dramatically. There has been an increase in journey times and morning and evening peak times have almost become afternoon and late night peak times. One can come across the tail end of peak morning traffic at 10 a.m. any morning one is coming to the House &ndash; it has often happened to me at Fairview. The same is true in the evening. This matter must be and is being addressed. The Minister confirmed tonight that £1.6 billion is going into solving the traffic problem and that is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The environment is deteriorating as a result of all these cars and people also have their mobility restricted because of all the cars in the city &ndash; it is now impossible to walk around the city without stepping between cars. This is part of the network of problems being caused by heavy traffic. All these problems mean the competitiveness of the city's economy may suffer. People have longer work days although they are spending the same time in their offices. They must leave for work earlier and get home later. However, the Minister has made significant progress on major infrastructural projects, as she pointed out.</P>
    <P>The slowdown in the progress of major infrastructural development means that we have had to concentrate our minds on the lesser infrastructural elements. I refer to the traffic management which has taken place in the city by Dublin Corporation. The quality bus corridors are a major feature and have proved to be a complete success. Even though certain commentators bemoaned the fact that the Stillorgan quality bus corridor was a complete mess, it has since proved to be an outstanding success, as is the bus corridor on the Malahide Road. When the 11 QBCs are operational there will be much greater control of traffic in the city.</P>
    <P>Parking policy and enforcement has also played a part in the management of traffic. The clamping and towing services set up in October 1998, together with other measures, have eliminated much of the on-street free parking. As a consequence, traffic congestion has been eliminated in certain areas. The traffic congestion which is experienced at present is not caused by illegal parking. The major work which has taken place on roads coming into the city has also played a part in alleviating the traffic problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that she is making a serious commitment to transport for people with disabilities. I welcome this more than any other measure. I am pleased she made the statement that as of now all transport will be accessible to people with disabilities. This will level the playing field and I hope we can then move on from transport to education and so on in relation to people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>The Minister was correct about the record of previous Governments. The baleful influence of the Department of Finance has been obvious in the area of public transport for the past 20 years. It believed in private choice as the most efficient way to allocate resources. In its most recent strategic statement, the Department of Finance forgot to mention sustainable development as part of the national strategy. That Department has never been able to handle the idea that some things do not work well if left to the forces of the marketplace. Officials sat on their hands in that Department and advised a strategy of benign neglect for the railways and an equally benign neglect for the bus service, as the country ground to a halt. This can be seen in the struggles that have been evident and in the great delight of the Minister at the levels of funding she has achieved.</P>
      <P>What is obvious to 166 Members of Dáil Éireann and 60 Members of Seanad Éireann is that public transport still needs huge investment. The Minister has received a significant level of investment for which she obviously had to fight hard. Somewhere within the ranks of decision-making there are those who believe this is not the way to go, and this is difficult to believe. However, if one has free parking in the centre of Dublin as a perk, one probably does not want to get away from this idea. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated that he is having difficulty establishing an interdepartmental working group to draw up a report on free parking for senior civil servants in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is awash with money. This is a result of the success of previous Governments, of which Fianna Fáil was not part, which were able to pursue prudent and sensible policies, particularly the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, who laid the basis for the prosperity which Fianna Fáil is now enjoying. Fianna Fáil inherited the most glorious opportunity and it is in grave danger of blowing this in a number of areas such as housing and public transport. We still have a dreadful rail service. The service between Cork and Dublin has deteriorated and the quality of service is worse than it was ten years ago. The train has been speeded up <Col N="1152" /> dramatically and a car parking system organised in Cork which means it now takes longer to get out of the car park than it does to travel from Dublin to Cork. This is absolutely superb management on the part of Iarnród Éireann. Many stations are too small and cannot accommodate more passengers. We should not believe there are only two major train routes in the country, that is, Dublin-Cork and Dublin-Belfast. The longest train leaves the station in Sligo on Sunday evening to bring people to Dublin.</P>

      <P>We lack a strategy to keep people where they should be instead of everyone having to travel to Dublin and, second, the whole strategy is a catch-up operation. For example, there will be an allocation of £1.6 billion for public transport in Dublin. As every penny of this is needed, and much more besides, it is not nearly sufficient and will do little more than prevent the situation in Dublin from getting much worse. This is not good enough. It is possible in a civilised society to deal with traffic congestion and public transport in a city the size of Dublin provided the will is there, therefore much more money is needed. The problems currently in Dublin will soon exist in Cork, Limerick, Galway and all the other growing cities and towns throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced with a flourish that £50 million was being spent to upgrade public transport in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. These four cities between them have a population of approximately 250,000, which is either one fifth or one quarter of the population of the greater Dublin area. This compares with the allocation of £1.6 billion. We will wait until the same problems confront all these areas and then try to catch up. Have we not yet learned that public transport must be built in anticipation of need, not by way of follow up? It is cheaper and easier to do this beforehand and create a climate of acceptability of public transport which reduces the car culture. We now have to do two things, build a public transport service in Dublin in competition with the car culture. Every step, from the construction of Luas to the use of Luas, will cause another howl from the car lobby because it will interfere with what they believe are their God given rights. It would have been better to build these systems before the lobby was as large and vocal as it currently is.</P>

The definitive statement about the disastrous inadequacy of the current transport system is the number of carriages being bought for the railway system, as announced in the national development plan. Outside the Dublin-Belfast route the carriages are at least 20 years old and 20 new carriages are being bought. This shows that under the gloss, when the safety issue is dealt with, the rail system will be, as it has been, inadequate, slow and under-resourced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an tAire agus comhgháirdeas a ghabháil léi as an deá-obair atá á dhéanamh aici chun na deacrachtaí a bhaineann le Córas Iompar Éireann a shocrú. It was amusing to listen to the last speaker. The Minister dealt with the matter well when she referred to the previous Ministers in her portfolio and questioned how they did not develop permanent insomnia because of what they did not do. How in God's name can Senator Ryan, albeit he is a latecomer to the Labour Party, defend a Government which did absolutely nothing and seemed to wallow in it? That is why, when the matter was raised here, I welcomed the Minister telling the House and the country exactly what she was doing in relation to public transport and to point out the policy of abandonment of the rail services indulged in by the previous Administration.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been proactive with regard to safety. When one is being reactive it is too late, an accident has already happened. She instanced Knockcroghery. There is a train driver in Mullingar who can give a graphic account of an accident in which he was involved. Senator O'Dowd referred to the increased numbers on the trains. The simple reason for that is the renaissance of public confidence in the transport system because at long last the Government has invested not only in the permanent way but in the rolling stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be remiss of me as a rural Senator not to refer to regional transport and the investment therein. A sum of £650 million is being made available for regional public transport. About £460 million is being made available for the southern and eastern region, £180 million for the Border, midlands and Ulster region, and £54 million for rolling stock which is not allocated by region. The £650 million is being allocated as follows &ndash; £350 million to complete the implementation of the railways safety programme from <Col N="1154" /> 1999-2003, £150 million for mainline rail renewal and upgrading and £150 million for regional public transport.</P>
    <P>Under the railways safety programme 490 kilometres, over 300 miles of track, will be renewed. Signalling and track work at Heuston and Limerick will be renewed. In excess of 530 level crossings and about 100 bridges will be improved. That is music to the ears of people from rural Ireland. In excess of £40 million will be spent on improving railway safety management systems. The main lines to benefit from track renewal will be Dublin-Waterford, Mallow-Tralee, DublinSligo, Athlone-Westport-Ballina, Dublin-Rosslare, Limerick-Ennis, Limerick Junction-Waterford and Cork-Cobh.</P>
    <P>The track I know quite well, the Dublin-Sligo line, goes through Mullingar. I recall Members from the Opposition and Westmeath County Council lambasting CIE &ndash; one person said he would get to Dublin faster on a push bike. If Percy French was alive, the west Clare railway would never have been enshrined in song. He would have talked about the Mullingar-Sligo and the Sligo-Dublin routes. Going back a couple of years, when the Opposition parties were at the helm, Michael would have been far from right.</P>
    <P>The matter of accessibility has been referred to by my colleague, Senator Kett. The Minister has not only provided the money but has adopted a hands on approach to this matter. It does not matter what the Minister does as far as certain Members in this House and the other House are concerned. She is damned if she does and she is damned if she does not. She has done the right thing and we are all behind her. I compliment a fair-minded person, such as Senator Norris, and other fair-minded people opposite who have rightly pointed out what the Minister has done.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a fantastic job for the disabled. Last week in Mullingar a meeting took place of people with disabilities. It was refreshing to hear what they had to say about public transport and what was and was not being done. I wish those people could have been here today to hear what the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has done about accessibility. The committee on accessibility will be chaired by the Department of Public Enterprise and will include representatives of the CIE operating companies and the National Disability Authority, an organisation representing mobility impaired and disabled persons. That is what I call commitment and delivery.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for safety. Given what she said, and it has been echoed by others here, it is a nonsense that three companies have one chairman. While some people speak of double jobbing, this is treble jobbing. It is not the fault of the chairman but that of the system. Senator Quinn said the policies could be compared with a drift in a bath-tub. Going back three or four years it was comparable to being up the creek without the proverbial paddle. As one might say in another forum, I rest my case. The facts speak for themselves. The Minister, Deputy <Col N="1155" /> O'Rourke, will go down in history and in the annals of the Oireachtas as one of the best and most caring Ministers in the context of public safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who uses public transport a great deal it is immaterial to me whose fault it is that we have this terrible mess. The stress of driving has pushed more of us on to public transport. While I am pleased at the huge amount of money that is to be spent I would like if there was more evidence of a plan.</P>
      <P>Some Members may have noticed that I walk to and from the House. That is because I live within a couple of miles of the House. We have a policy in this city regarding public transport which I do not think is in any way connected with the reality of how we have to live here. Even if we could get a few simple things right, such as the ticketing service, it would be a great help. I wonder if there are others in the House going around with tickets such as I collect all the time. I agree with the idea of tendering the exact fare. It may be fine for me to be left 40p short every time if I have only a £1 coin but that is a lot of money to some other people who have to save up the tickets until they can go to the central office in O'Connell Street to claim the refunds. People ask whether it is cost effective to go in to collect the refunds. Fortunately I work in the Rotunda Hospital. Sometimes when I walk up O'Connell Street I go into the office and claim whatever is owed. For many people this is very difficult. It would be very helpful for the ordinary paying public, for whom the price of tickets is considerable, if other outlets were available where the price of unused tickets could be reclaimed. It would also be helpful if a ticket could be provided which could be used on another route by passengers who change buses.</P>
      <P>As Senator Kett said, bus lanes have made it easier to get into the city centre rapidly. However, the extension of bus lanes has been remarkably slow. The provision of more bus shelters would also be very helpful in Dublin. I realise that the erection of bus shelters would be impossible in some places but they could very easily be provided in Dawson Street and Kildare Street. If the bus stop in Kildare Street were moved to the entrance to Agriculture House we might shelter there from the rain while waiting for the No. 10 bus, which comes with much greater regularity now than it used to. As things are, we must stand in the rain while waiting for the bus. Why are simple things like these not done which would be helpful to people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have travelled on the railway lines from Dublin to Cork, Galway and Limerick within the past two months and on each occasion people were standing in the carriages. I was not travelling on a busy 5 o'clock train. I try to avoid early evening trains because they are always full but at 2.30 in <Col N="1156" /> the afternoon people were standing on the train to Limerick. What good will 20 carriages be in these circumstances? Senator Glynn said that people are now using public transport because it is so reliable and efficient. I cannot agree. I do not know when I heard of a Galway train being on time in the recent past. People are using public transport because the situation on the roads is so appalling. If one takes a train one at least has some idea of when one will arrive.</P>
    <P>We are not considering the serious economic effects of our ineffective transport policy. I have been contacted by a mushroom producer who finds it almost impossible to deliver lorry loads of mushrooms in time for boats to Britain. Mushrooms cannot be kept waiting when they are on their way to Tesco in England. Nor are we considering the number of people who have secured high powered jobs in Ireland but do not stay here because of the price of housing and the traffic chaos in Dublin. One man said to me that although he could afford a house in Leixlip he could not bear to spend three hours travelling from Leixlip to the centre of Dublin. He decided to stay in Canada where he could buy three houses for the price of one in Dublin and travel to and from work in 20 minutes on public transport.</P>
    <P>We are spending money but we are not taking account of these important issues. I hope Luas comes at least as far as the canal because from there people can walk. It should be our aim to get people in as far as the banks of the canal on &ldquo;Go minic &ndash; Go tapaidh&rdquo; buses and let every man and women fend for himself or herself in the city centre. Although the Government is spending a great deal of money, there is a great shortage of planning. I share Senator Quinn's concern that a great deal of money may be spent with very little to show for it.</P>

      <P>This is a dreadful time to be in Opposition and a wonderful time to be in Government. The Government will spend £2.2 billion over the next seven years. This is the largest investment ever in public transport since the railways were built in the 19th century. A total of £1.6 billion of this will be spent in Dublin and the surrounding counties of Kildare, Wicklow and Meath. Of this, £185 million will be spent on short-term improvements to the suburban railway system and more than 100 extra DART and diesel rail cars will be ordered. This is in addition to the 73 already delivered or due to be delivered by the end of this year. New stations will be opened&mdash;</P>

      <P>A sum of £430 million has been set aside to implement the surface elements of the revitalised light rail project which was announced in May 1998. This relates to the line from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to Dublin Airport. A contingency sum of £500 million has been set aside for the underground element of the light rail project. A sum of £50 million will be spent to improve the integration of the public transport system. This will include the provision of almost 4,000 additional park and ride spaces and £200 million will be spent on traffic management.</P>
      <P>Many calls have been made in this House for more quality bus corridors. We all remember when Deputy Albert Reynolds opened the first quality bus corridor at 7 o'clock one morning and some people told us it would not work. Seanad Members insisted that it would work and its success is now to be seen. The quality bus corridors are being extended to Lucan, Malahide and Stillorgan.</P>

      <P>A total of £500 million is to be spent on revitalising the railways. This sends a <Col N="1158" /> clear and unambiguous message that the mainline rail network has a safe and assured future. Of this, £350 million will be spent on the completion of a five year programme. The railway safety programme which the Government approved more than a year ago will include 490 kilometres of track renewal right across the network. All the main lines will benefit, including Waterford to Dublin, Sligo to Dublin, Westport and Ballina to Dublin, Rosslare to Dublin, Mallow to Tralee, Limerick to Ennis and Limerick Junction to Rosslare.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Minister to the House. It is fitting that the Minister who was appointed as the custodian of our heritage should be in the House to take this matter. Essentially this is about the protection and preservation of one of the most important parts of Ireland's living heritage, Mount Congreve Estate, County Waterford, which is under threat by the National Roads Authority's proposal to route a bypass road through part of the estate. I call on the Minister, in her capacity as Minister for heritage, to call on the NRA to put a halt to their current proposal. I also ask her to initiate steps to ensure that the Mount Congreve Estate will be dedicated as a world heritage site like Mount Stewart in Northern Ireland. In addition, I appeal to her to enlist the support of her Government colleagues in the request to the NRA to find a viable alternative to this route, known as route 17.</P>
      <P>The gardens at Mount Congreve are judged by experts to be the most valuable gardens developed anywhere in the world in the past century. Their survival is dependent on the retention of a shelter belt and the current proposed route would breach that shelter belt on the crest of a ridge some four or five miles from the sea as the crow flies. This is the shelter belt which protects the gardens from wind and sea spray damage, and provides the kind of micro-climate where the exotic plants and shrubs can thrive. To breach the shelter belt is to deliver the kiss of death to the gardens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These gardens were developed by Mr. Ambrose Congreve over 70 years. He has spent his adult life planning and perfecting this most magnificent garden. He has decided to leave the garden as a legacy to the State after his death. This is a profound gift to the people of Ireland. The Office of Public Works has become a trustee of the estate and has accepted his gift in principle. Is it not ironic that one organ of State has <Col N="1160" /> accepted the gift while another agency of State is putting in place something that would lead to the long-term and inevitable destruction of the estate? I find this very difficult to accept.</P>
    <P>I remind people, including those in Waterford, that gardening is now the second fastest growing leisure activity in Europe. To illustrate my point I remind people that more than 100,000 people visited Mallow last summer in the course of three days during the garden festival. This shows the extent of public interest in gardening. If the people of Waterford fully appreciate the asset in their midst and look to the future they will stand up and say to the NRA, &ldquo;Hands off, we want this garden preserved for our county and our city&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Waterford has developed very well in recent times. The Association of Businesspeople Against Litter has designated it as one of the most litter free cities in Ireland. Therefore, it has the capacity to be a beautiful city and to sustain a huge tourism trade attached to this garden, if it is preserved. If the NRA proceeds with its current proposals the gardens will inevitably die. This is an essential part of the inheritance of the next and following generations and I ask the Minister to move quickly to ensure the gardens and the estate remain intact for generations to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quill for sharing time with me. I also welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>I cannot overstate the importance of this matter. Waterford city has had the distinction over the past number of years of having the support of the local county council and Bord Fáilte in pursuing its objective of being part of a crystal clear county. It has been trying to emphasise this aspect in terms of tourism, and has been so successful that it is now considered the cleanest county in Ireland, which is no mean boast.</P>
      <P>There are many measures on the Statute Book regarding the protection of the built environment, some of which are extremely important and have worked very effectively over the past number of years. We all know cases where this protection has been particularly successful. However, it is equally important that we protect the context of the built environment, that is, the land on which it is situated.</P>
      <P>Mount Congreve is a garden of international repute. As a practising landscape architect I have some interest in this area and it is fascinating that on the banks of the Suir river we have the largest single collection of tree magnolias in the world. Many of these magnolias have come from as far away as New Zealand and the Himalayas. We are now proposing to put a road adjacent to these gardens which will put them under great threat. It is inconceivable that we could countenance such action. I fully accept that the bypass of Waterford must go ahead, but I am suggesting that the NRA has a responsibility to find an alternative route to that which has been recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the gardens, there is a nursery in <Col N="1161" /> Mount Congreve which employs 105 people on the edge of Kilmeaden, a small town. It would be catastrophic for that town to lose those jobs and that is a possibility as the nursery, which has put its emphasis on developing, breeding and propagating ericaceous plants, could move outside the country. It exports many of its products internationally and people from all over Europe come to Mount Congreve for ericaceous plants. The importance of this, given that the industry is growing at a rate of 13% to 15% per annum, cannot be overstated.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the NRA concerns me greatly. I have spoken to the authority at length about its proposals. It describes the recommended route as passing through farmland. It passes through the farm of Mount Congreve, but there are consequences in putting a road adjacent to the very important shelter belt which creates the micro-climate in which these plants can flourish, not to mention the effects on the water table. The authority will cut into the ground adjacent to the shelter belt to a depth of 25 metres, which is inconceivable and without parallel in the country. The shelter belt will be left, the water table will be adjusted and the trees will consequently die off over time.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to the NRA and asked it about its procedure regarding the route. It has recommended this route and carried out various studies. The authority acknowledges the importance of the shelter belt which consists of many trees. The loss in tree numbers would be in the region of 4,500 mature trees and about 25,000 saplings, the next generation of mature trees. Can we allow this happen? The NRA has recommended the route without carrying out a hydrological report. It is carrying out institutional vandalism of the area. The shelter belt will die if the route is developed.</P>
    <P>The NRA has employed independent experts to carry out an EIS and a landscape assessment. I ask the NRA whether these experts have concerns about the proposed route. If so, what are they? Is the NRA prepared to ignore these concerns? I appreciate that the Minister has a great interest in this area. We need statutory protection for our public parks, gardens and domains of special interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. It has been a very useful debate, particularly for me. We know that the Mount Congreve estate is very special. It comprises the mansion house and gardens and was transferred to the Mount Congreve Trust under a deed executed in 1979. The deed provides that 66 acres of the trust property, which includes the gardens, will transfer to the State 21 years after the death of Mr. Ambrose Congreve. Thereafter, the mansion house and adjacent five acres will transfer to the State 80 years from the settlement deed or 21 years after the death of the last to survive Mr. Congreve, his wife and any child of <Col N="1162" /> hers or of six named persons, whichever of these periods is shorter.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, as Mount Congreve is currently managed by the trustees with the advice and assistance of Mr. Congreve, my Department has no formal role in the management of the estate. However, it has contributed to the maintenance of the gardens by sponsoring trainee gardeners on one year contracts. There are also close associations between the National Botanic Gardens and Mount Congreve in the form of plant and information exchange and staff from the botanic gardens regularly visit there.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the proposed route of the Waterford bypass is a matter of concern to Mount Congreve trustees. Officials from my Department have been in contact with Waterford County Council and the roadway design team regarding the possible impact on Mount Congreve Estate of the proposed bypass. They have availed of every opportunity to stress the importance, both nationally and internationally, of the Mount Congreve Estate and gardens and to oppose any plans which would have a major negative impact thereon.</P>
      <P>I understand that Mount Congreve trustees agreed last year to the undertaking of various tests and surveys on the property and their results will be incorporated in the environment impact statement, which is due to be published shortly. The EIS will be examined by my officials to ensure that the proposed scheme does not have a significant negative impact either on Mount Congreve Estate and gardens or on the natural and built heritage of the area.</P>
      <P>Mount Congreve contains a superb collection of shrubs and trees, including one of the largest collections of rhododendrons in the world. Mr. Congreve's philosophy that shrubs should be planted not in ones or twos but in hundreds has the effect of producing spectacular bands of contrasting blossom. I am delighted these gardens of international significance will transfer to the State to ensure their preservation for future generations to enjoy their magnificence. Any proposed scheme which could have a significant negative impact on these gardens will be opposed by my Department.</P>
      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service, is involved in ongoing discussions and we hope there is a positive outcome for both the estate and the gardens, which are an important part of the estate. Senator Quill queried whether the estate could be designated a world heritage site. I will examine that issue and come back to her on it. Further discussion is required regarding the viability of route 17 and the gardens. I understand, although I am open to correction, that a compromise has been proposed for the route because other proposals for it were not accepted by a number of residents in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the concerns of the Senators with regard to the shelter belt of the trees which protect the gardens from wind and the salt sea climate. I assure them that this issue must be addressed to <Col N="1163" /> our satisfaction before we agree to it. I agree with their comments on the importance of gardens and niche tourism. Statistics have borne out their importance, particularly the number of Europeans who visit in order to seek out gardens. It is a growing part of the tourism industry which should be recognised and encouraged.</P>
    <P>When a development is undertaken a balance must be struck. All Members representing the area realise and accept that a bypass is needed but it must be ensured the best approach is adopted for motorists while at the same time maintaining our heritage. The two should not be mutually exclusive. There must be a means whereby a positive resolution can be found to this issue. I thank both Senators for raising the issue and I have been made aware of it by other interested groups and individuals from Waterford. I am pleased I had the opportunity to hear from both Senators on the issue and I assure them I will keep in touch with them regarding developments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister. Both of us are vastly encouraged by her comments. It is heartening to know that the Department will oppose any <Col N="1164" /> measure that would have a significant impact on the gardens. That is all we ask. There must be development and we are the first to recognise that Waterford needs a second bridge and a bypass to enable further economic growth in the area. However, such development cannot take place at any price.</P>
      <P>This issue is reminiscent of Hugh Lane's bequest to Ireland before the foundation of the State when we were told that we could not house the collection because we could not provide a gallery, and also of the searing lines written by W. B. Yeats:</P>
      <P>What need you, being come to sense,</P>
      <P>But fumble in a greasy till</P>
      <P>And add the halfpence to the pence</P>
      <P>And prayer to shivering prayer, until</P>
      <P>You have dried the marrow from the bone?</P>
      <P>We do not want that to be said of our generation. We have gained independence in the meantime and a de Valera oversees our inheritance. This element of our inheritance is in good and safe hands.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 March 2000.</P>
