    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Leader of the House and on behalf of Fianna Fáil, on the sad occasion of the death of John Boland I wish to extend my sympathy to Kate, John and Grace Boland and their family and friends, to John's brother, Cathal, and to the Fine Gael Party. I knew John very well. What I most remember about him was his passionate commitment to public service to which he dedicated 22 years of his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>John was first elected to Seanad Éireann in 1979 where he served for eight years. He was the youngest ever Member of the Upper House as he was only 24 years of age when elected. John went on to serve in the Dáil for 12 years where he was best known for his enthusiasm and dedication to areas such as public service reform and for the abolition of corporal punishment in schools, for which generations of young people have reason to thank him. John became chairman of Dublin County Council at the age of 26 where he performed his duties with great distinction. He is still spoken of with great admiration in council <Col N="2" /> circles because of his initiative which set up the first parks department in any council.</P>
    <P>John Boland enjoyed life to the full, whether sailing, having a pint or enjoying a day at the races. He was a gifted person with a sharp mind, which could cut through the difficulties that faced him. The rejuvenation of the Dublin quays and the introduction of urban renewal schemes resulted from John's tremendous foresight, his belief in what could be done and a commitment to ensure that urban renewal could take place. May he rest in peace.</P>
    <P>I also express my sympathy on the untimely death of Deputy Theresa Ahearn, a young mother struck down in the prime of life. We all witnessed the enormous courage with which Theresa battled a very serious illness. That courage was, perhaps, the greatest inspiration to anyone whose privilege it was to meet her during her trying and difficult years. I offer my deepest sympathy to Theresa's husband, Liam, her four sons, Patrick, Liam, Garret and Scott, her colleagues and the Fine Gael Party which she served so well.</P>
    <P>I also express the great sadness felt in the midlands on the death of the legendary former <Col N="3" /> Member of this House, Deputy Joe Sheridan. Joe was a distinguished and respected representative for the constituency of Longford-Westmeath and for the entire midlands. He hailed from Drumlish in County Longford, moved to Kilbeggan and then to Mullingar. He was well known in the agriculture industry in which he was a legend.</P>
    <P>Joe entered public life and was successful as a member of Westmeath County Council. He became a Senator in 1958 and entered Dáil Éireann as an Independent in 1961 where he served for 20 uninterrupted years. Throughout his time in politics, Joe worked tirelessly on behalf of the people of Longford-Westmeath, Roscommon, Offaly and the neighbouring counties. He was one of the most powerful public figures of the time and was seen by many as an authority on many issues, particularly those concerning rural life and rural families.</P>
    <P>Joe earned a great reputation as an honest, loyal and hard working man. Everyone knew him on the basis of &ldquo;vote for Joe, the man you know, the man who knows you too&rdquo;. He was a man apart who made a great contribution to the people of his constituency and will be remembered in the midlands for many years. I offer sympathy to his five sons, four daughters and extended family.</P>
    <P>I also offer the House's sympathy to the Clerk of the Seanad, Deirdre Lane, on the sad death of her brother yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Leader's tributes. I first knew John Boland when we were students in UCD where he was editor of the student newspaper <i>Awake</i>. He was a very good editor and had flair, imagination and a very good nose for a story. He did not take hostages. Had he stayed in journalism I am certain he would have ended up as editor of one of our national newspapers. However, at a very early age John chose politics and became a Senator in 1969 at the age of 24. He remained in politics for the next 20 years and was still in his 40s when he left to take up a new and successful career at the Bar.</P>
      <P>John Boland made a very real difference in politics. He was courageous and far-sighted. He believed in politics and that politics was about changing things for the better. In his years as Minister for the Public Service, Minister for the Environment and Minister for Education he made many changes, introduced many innovations and left things very much better then he found them. He was not afraid to take on vested interests no matter how powerful or how painful the consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>John Boland was a great servant of Fine Gael. He was a superb strategist and a great organiser. He had a great sense of loyalty and pride in the traditions of his party. He could be great company or, at times, he could be explosive company. He called things as he saw them and, as someone who was occasionally on the receiving end of his candour, it could be bruising. <Col N="4" /> However, there was never a grudge, normal service was always restored and his wicked sense of humour would soon be in evidence.</P>
    <P>John Boland died just has he was making a real impact in his new career at the Bar. He died young but, young as he was, he had made a real and lasting difference. To Kay, Grace and John Paul, I extend the sympathy of my party and all Members of this House.</P>
    <P>It is over 20 years since the late Joe Sheridan was Member of either House of the Oireachtas. Few of the current generation of politicians served with him but to those who knew him he was a memorable and deeply likeable person. A friend of mine who knew him well said he was a great man for his own people. He worked tirelessly to bring industry to Longford-Westmeath and he supported every local initiative aimed at bettering that constituency. Whether it was the building of the first swimming pool in Longford, the introduction of new industry or the building of housing for the people, Joe Sheridan was always there to lend his support. Most of all, he had a great understanding of people. He was generous, helpful and wise. He knew how to help people and he did so quietly and without fuss, and in return the people of Longford-Westmeath sent him back to the Dáil time after time, sometimes at the head of the poll.</P>
    <P>Joe Sheridan came from the Fine Gael tradition. He was a great follower and friend of the late General Seán MacEoin but when he fell out with us, he retained his personal friendships within the party. Among his great friends was the former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave. I have never heard a bad word spoken about Joe Sheridan by anybody in the Fine Gael Party. It was our loss that he left us and became an Independent. Those good words continued even when he supported and kept in power the Government &ndash; a good Government &ndash; of Seán Lemass. Joe Sheridan did not do deals but he understood Seán Lemass and Seán Lemass understood him and it worked for both of them. Those who knew Joe Sheridan talk of a man of great warmth, a great storyteller, a fountain of great memories and a good man who served his people to the best of his ability.</P>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, with your permission I would like to ask my colleague, Senator Taylor-Quinn, to pay the party's tribute to the late Deputy Theresa Ahearn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great sadness that I rise to express sympathy on the death of our Oireachtas colleague, Deputy Theresa Ahearn. Theresa was an extraordinary woman who over the past three years fought a very serious illness with great bravery, courage and exceptional dignity. Her attitude and approach as she faced into that illness confounded everybody who came across her during the past three years. She was a great source of inspiration and a strength to everybody who came across her. Her extraordinary zest for life, good humour and positive approach were particularly amazing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> Her greatest focus of interest was south Tipperary. That is where her heart rested. It is extraordinary that somebody should be taken from her family and constituency at this early age. Dáil Éireann has lost a great Deputy. They have lost a great woman who respected and valued fully the honour bestowed on her by the people of south Tipperary on being elected to Dáil Éireann. She represented south Tipperary with great dignity, total commitment and absolute resolve in what she was about to do. She was an intelligent articulate woman who brought common sense to bear in all the debates to which she contributed. She served effectively on various Oireachtas committees, particularly on the committees on foreign affairs and women's rights.</P>
    <P>During her time in the Oireachtas, she also served on the Fine Gael front bench. She was particularly proud of the Fine Gael Party and its ethos. She first stood as a Fine Gael candidate for Tipperary South Riding County Council and was elected. At one time she simultaneously served in Clonmel Corporation, Tipperary South Riding County Council and Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Theresa broke the mould in south Tipperary and was successful. It is not easy for a woman to succeed in a rural constituency &ndash; it can be quite difficult. The people of south Tipperary remained loyal and committed to her right to the time of her death. As I canvassed for the recent by-election her name was repeatedly mentioned with affection and respect throughout south Tipperary. During her time in Dáil Éireann she forged many friendships across party lines. For many, this is not just the loss of a colleague but also the loss of a very good friend. That was evident by the wonderful turnout at her funeral in Grange.</P>
    <P>The greatest loss of all rests with her husband, Liam, and her four sons, Garret, Patrick, Liam and Scott. She was extremely fortunate in having in her husband Liam an extremely devoted man who was completely committed to her political career. He supported her effectively in all her political duties and was a great source of strength to her during her final illness.</P>
    <P>Her husband and sons can be extremely proud of what she has left behind. She has left a great legacy of honesty, integrity, value for public office and respect for serving in public office. That is something of which everybody can be proud. Her high values and honesty and her bravery in her final days are an inspiration to all. I extend sympathy to her husband, sons, sisters and brothers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We on the Independent benches also wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy made by our colleagues. The people we are remembering today had much in common. They were people who took the unpopular stand. John Boland, in particular, was never afraid to take the non-populist view or decision and take on interest groups. I know that because I was involved in one of those interests groups. He <Col N="6" /> made life very difficult for me in his work as a Minister and I could do nothing but admire him, except the time when he called me a Fianna Fáil hack, which had an immediate impact when my mother changed her vote from Johnny Boland to Mark Clinton. He did what he thought was right. That was one of those issues in primary education on which we had a number of arguments with him, but at no stage did anyone think other than that he was acting as Minister in the best of interests and that differences were issue-based and no more than that. His commitment to his point of view was extraordinarily strong, forceful and powerful and it did not finish when the meeting was over. He certainly carried it right to the end of the issue and that was an admirable quality.</P>
      <P>Representing the interests of Members of both Houses in recent times, I had occasion to refer to John Boland more than once. He was courageous in implementing a salary increase for Members of the Houses, which I hope will be reciprocated by the Government when that comes up.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that not in an attempt to say something topical but to make the point that he always took the strong line which he thought was correct. Before taking those decisions to which I referred he knew he would encourage public criticism but nonetheless he took that line.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say he was the person who initiated the debate which finally led to the strategic management initiative in the public sector. He left a legacy which is highly respected on all sides. He was the type of public representative of whom we can all be proud.</P>
      <P>I did not know Joe Sheridan but as I passed Lyneen Bridge near Kilashee recently I read the words &ldquo;Vote No. 1, Sheridan&rdquo; and wondered how long that was there &ndash; it is there at least 20 years.</P>
      <P>I remember his extraordinary courage during the Lemass Government, when he took the line on an issue and supported the turnover tax, as I recall it, in the middle of a very difficult debate when the country was divided even at village level. I recall that he called a meeting of his supporters in Mullingar where he made it quite clear that the decision he would reach, whatever it was, would be that of an Independent. He took a strong line. In those ways these were public representatives who we could take as role models.</P>
      <P>I should have said, in referring to John Boland, that I was a constituent of his and he was my representative in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was extraordinarily saddened by the death of Deputy Theresa Ahearn. I was shocked to hear in July or August that her illness was terminal because she had been so open and brave about it. She had discussed it on many occasions, was clearly ready to fight it and was not prepared to be in any way oppressed by it. She fought it to the very end. She deserves our admiration for her courage and the way she spoke out openly and <Col N="7" /> helped many people with the same condition. I had a long conversation with her two years ago after one of her many difficult times. She was ready to move on, return to the House and do her work as well as she could. She was a model of an efficient, effective and deeply committed public representative.</P>
    <P>Speaking as an Independent, the kind of leadership we need in political life is people with the courage of their convictions, who live what they say, put forward a point of view and stick with it. Those three people were the epitome of that. Ar dheis Dé go raibh siad. We express our condolences to their families.</P>
    <P>We on the Independent benches also wish to be associated with the expression of condolences to Deirdre Lane, the Clerk of the House, and her family on their recent bereavement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated, on behalf of the Labour Party, with the expressions of sympathy to the family of John Boland &ndash; Kay, John and Grace &ndash; and to acknowledge his enormous contribution to public life. He came the traditional way to the Dáil, through the county council and Seanad, and finally became a Minister. He then returned to his profession of barrister and died, unfortunately, a young man.</P>
      <P>John Boland was an extraordinarily talented, committed and single-minded man. Like Senator O'Toole, I knew him in the educational sphere and found him to be a very tough and single-minded opponent. He was, however, a very fair opponent and would always have a chat and a drink afterwards.</P>
      <P>He was Minister in three Departments and he left his mark on each of them. He was instrumental, as Minister for Education, in abolishing corporal punishment, which was opposed by a huge number of vested interests. However, we now regard it as one of the major steps forward in the educational sphere. As Minister for the Public Service he was responsible for a reform which was strongly opposed by various vested interests but which has been to the enormous advantage of the entire public service and the country as a whole. He was also a reforming Minister for the Environment. My constituency of Dublin Central owes a lot to him in terms of urban renewal as an incentive package was put together to revitalise the quays in the 1980s, which led to the Financial Services Centre and so on. I admired him very much. He was a man of very strong views and was a credit to all parliamentarians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I offer my sympathies to the family of Joe Sheridan and acknowledge his enormous contribution to public service. He came the same route as John Boland through local politics, the county council and the Seanad to the Dáil. He operated in the rural sphere. I still hear people speaking about him in Smithfield, where he used to come to the mart and the horse fairs. He was very interested in <Col N="8" /> agricultural matters and is remembered for his great sense of humour and wit. He was a tireless campaigner for his constituents and a very colourful person. I could do worse than adopt his slogan, &ldquo;Vote for Joe, the man you know&rdquo;, which might be very useful to me in the future. I offer my sympathies, on behalf of the Labour Party, to his family.</P>
    <P>We all knew Theresa Ahearn very well in this and the other House. We offer our sincere sympathies to her husband, Liam, her four sons and Fine Gael, the wider family of which all those people were members. She endured a very long illness very courageously. She was a woman of tremendous commitment. It is ironic, poignant and tragic that south Tipperary has lost two out of three Deputies in the same year. I met her during the by-election and she was as bright and cheerful as if she had never had a moment of illness in her life. She was an inspiration to us all to fight to the last and take an active, open and confident part in what is going on. She was involved in a number of committees, but I remember her most from the committee on women's rights. She was a very distinguished parliamentarian, as were the other two people. They are examples and models to all of us in public life.</P>
    <P>I also express, on behalf of the Labour Party, my sincere sympathies to the Clerk of the House, Deirdre Lane, on the death of her brother.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I join in the vote of sympathy to the families of the late Deputy Theresa Ahearn, Joe Sheridan and John Boland and to Deirdre Lane, the Clerk of the House, on the death of her brother.</P>
      <P>There was widespread shock in the Houses when Theresa Ahearn died, although we knew she had been ill. That shock and grief extended well beyond party lines and was universally felt. We had all got to know Theresa well and knew her qualities of determination, dedication and commitment to her constituents and her party. Those qualities were very obvious in her attitude to her illness, which she treated with cheerfulness and determination. We knew at an early stage that she was ill and she seemed to recover very well. It was not obvious from seeing her in Leinster House, not long before her death, how ill she was. I extend our sympathy to her husband, Liam, her four sons and the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Manning, I was in University College Dublin at the same time as John Boland, although I am somewhat younger. My abiding recollection of him is that he had almost a permanent office in Newman House, which seemed to act as his constituency office, his mailbox and probably his editorial offices for <i>Awake</i>. He had a great gift for bringing gossip to the back page of <i>Awake</i> and could probably have become like Nigel Dempster of Fleet Street if he had continued. He could be aggressive and <Col N="9" /> argumentative, but in the very best sense, and he did not hold grudges.</P>
    <P>John Boland's public career speaks for itself. It is a measure of the quality of the person he was and his talent that he achieved so much in the ministries he held. He fundamentally reformed attitudes within the public service, which is one of the lasting testimonies to him. He was widely respected. Senator Cassidy spoke about his record as the youngest Senator until the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, was appointed to the Seanad. He was also chairman of Dublin County Council at the age of 26 years. At the end of his public career he became successful at the Bar and renewed his journalistic links. He was obviously a very talented person who put those talents to very good use on behalf of the State. I extend my sympathies to his family and the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>I know three of Joe Sheridan's daughters quite well and, although not knowing him, I would have heard stories about him over many years. It was recalled on one occasion that he had been accused of visiting the Taoiseach's office on six occasions before a vote. He said he had never been in the Taoiseach's office. Perhaps there is a lesson there in the modern day context &ndash; the difference between Deputies of that time and the present time. It was a formidable political achievement for him to win a seat in a constituency which went from being a five-seater to a four-seater as an Independent Deputy and to hold it successfully for 20 years. He had a formidable political brain and he put it to good use on behalf of his constituents.</P>
    <P>I have also heard from Deputy O'Malley, who, I understand, was Fianna Fáil Whip at that time, about some of the difficulties of getting Joe Sheridan to Leinster House to ensure the numbers were stacked up on the Government side. As Senator Manning said he supported the Lemass Government which was a successful Government. He will be remembered for that.</P>
    <P>He was active in farming and auctioneering circles and was known to people well outside his constituency in those roles. He was a member of several prominent farming organisations, the Irish Cattle and Livestock Traders Association being one. To his family, particularly, to Cathy, Brigid and Mary T. and his sons and other daughters and brothers and sisters we extend our sympathy.</P>
    <P>I join also in the expression of sympathy to Deirdre Lane on her recent bereavement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to echo the words of the Leader of the House and the leaders of the other groups pertaining to the sad passing of Theresa Ahearn, Joe Sheridan, John Boland and the brother of the Clerk of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I knew Joe Sheridan very well. I want to be <Col N="10" /> closely associated with the tributes paid on his sad passing. He was a remarkable man. He won five general elections in a row as an Independent candidate. At the height of Fianna Fáil's popularity in 1977, Joe Sheridan headed the poll in the constituency of Longford-Westmeath. If Joe Sheridan had met you in Tooreendathaneybeg or Ballydehob five years ago with your wife and three sons it is a sure bet that he would have remembered all the names. His remarkable memory was one of his great strengths. He was also very entertaining and was marvellous company. Another of his strengths was his capacity to identify with almost every section of society.</P>
    <P>He will be remembered for his great contribution to the agricultural scene. As a member of Westmeath County Council, where agricultural matters played a pivotal role on the agenda, Joe was foremost in those debates. I worked for some time with his son Pat who was a valued colleague but went on to do other things. Public life will be very much the poorer for the passing of Joe Sheridan. While he retired a number of years ago he remained active. Not long ago Joe lobbied me and other members of the council on matters of concern to him.</P>
    <P>My first encounter with him was in 1973 at the time of a general election. Joe met a lady at the polling station on Mount Street, Mullingar and asked if there was any chance of her No. 1. She said she was not from the constituency and did not have a vote. Joe, never short for a word, said, &ldquo;You might know somebody who has a vote and perhaps you will ask them for me.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not many months ago that I spoke on the vote of sympathy following the death of Michael Ferris. Little did I know when we resumed after the summer recess that my first duty would be to pay a tribute on behalf of the people of south Tipperary to the late Theresa Ahearn.</P>
      <P>My memory of Theresa Ahearn goes back a long way. I was born only a mile up the road from where she was born. Our families had many associations over many years. Many tributes have been paid to Theresa Ahearn, all of which are worthy. One thing I always noticed about her was her determination to succeed in whatever field she was involved, whether at Golden national school or the Presentation Convent in Cashel where she was prefect and year head. She attended University College Dublin where she got involved in the students' union. She was involved in Macra na Feirme where she achieved distinction in public speaking and debating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following her entry to politics she was a shining example, particularly in Tipperary South Riding County Council. She was a committed south Tipperary person and fought on behalf of her constituents. I often saw her take on officialdom, red tape and the bureaucracy with which public representatives have to deal and she did so with vigour and determination. Many <Col N="11" /> people experience much happiness in their lives because of what she achieved in her role as a public representative. She was extremely popular in the constituency and never lost an election.</P>
    <P>She will be sadly missed by the Fine Gael Party in Tipperary South but most of all she will be missed by her family, her husband and four sons, her brothers and sisters and by all the people in Golden and Grange, areas which she cherished and loved. Everybody knew she had been ill. I visited her only a week before she passed away and could see her determination to live on despite being worn away. She has left her mark on everyone and her passing is regretted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a friend and near neighbour of the late John Boland for the past 30 years I join in the tributes to him. It is difficult to believe it is 11 years since he retired from politics. He believed passionately in the commitment to public service. It can certainly be said that he led by vigorous example. He was fair, fearless, articulate, compassionate and blessed with intelligence and a breadth of vision which he was able to bring to bear on the various political offices he held, starting with the old Dublin County Council. His record there has already been mentioned.</P>
      <P>When one looks at his achievements in the different Departments in which he served the extent of his vision is clear. The abolition of corporal punishment in schools was a radical step but it is hard to imagine how the difficulties in that sector, particularly during the past ten years, could have been so different if corporal punishment had not been abolished by the visionary that was John Boland. We are all aware of his unique achievement in the Department of the Public Service. He was the only Minister to serve as Minister for the Public Service. His achievements were remarkable.</P>
      <P>If I can be parochial I will refer to his achievements in the Dublin area. He was a Clondalkin man by birth and a Skerries man by adoption but, above all, he was a Dubliner and a proud Dubliner. I remember particularly John the sports fan during his term of office as chairman of Dublin County Council in 1974 and the tremendous kick he got from the rejuvenation of Heffo's army. He had great fun following Heffo's army around Leinster when it was not particularly fashionable to do so &ndash; it did not become fashionable until after they won the All-Ireland. However, John travelled with them throughout the province during that campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He will also be remembered in Dublin for the tremendous contribution he made to the rejuvenation of the docklands, particularly Custom House Dock, in conjunction with his great friend and colleague, Fergus O'Brien, and for his legacy in the area of urban renewal generally. In Fingal and Dublin North he left the immense legacy of one of the most enlightened parks departments in any council in the country. <Col N="12" /> He was a pioneer in that area. There are approximately 1,200 acres of parkland in north County Dublin which people throughout the northside have enjoyed for years. They are a lasting testament to John.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to his interest in sport and I noted Senator Manning's comments on John Boland's candour about his political views. As one who was on the receiving end of his candour in the sporting area, I can testify that his powers of critical analysis were as strong there as they were in the political arena.</P>
    <P>John Boland believed in the nobility of politics as a profession and it is a privilege to state that the profession of politics was ennobled by his contribution. On behalf of my colleagues in Fianna Fáil in Dublin North and of the people in Dublin North, I extend sympathy to Kay, John and Grace, his colleagues in Fine Gael and in particular his brother, Cathal Boland, who serves on Fingal County Council.</P>

      <P>As a colleague of the late Theresa Ahearn in south Tipperary, it is a privilege to join in the tributes which have been paid to her today. Tipperary and Ireland have lost an effective advocate. She was a public representative of sterling qualities.</P>
      <P>She came from the old school of decency, and public life needs that quality today more than ever. Her concern for other people was genuine and Christian. It certainly superseded personal ambition and even political affiliation. A few weeks before she died, Theresa, with members of her family and some college friends, attended a function I organised in Cashel. I thought she was in particularly good spirits that night. She sang a song about her native Tipperary with such passion and determination that she made a huge impact on the international audience present. It was only afterwards I learned from her family that that was the day she had received the bad news of her deteriorating medical condition. However, she did not show it that night and, in a way, it was an example of her great strength of character.</P>
      <P>Her constituents are much poorer for her passing. She was always accessible and available. She was one of those people in public life who are quite comfortable in any political company. One always sensed a warmth where Theresa was concerned. Down the years and throughout the cut and thrust of politics I never saw her lose dignity. There was always a sense of dignity about her, which should recommend her to any young person today who might be seeking a role model in public life.</P>
      <P>I extend my sympathy to her family, the Fine Gael Party and her constituents in south Tipperary. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam uasal.</P>

      <P>I express my deepest sympathy to the families of the late Deputy Theresa Ahearn and former Deputy John Boland and to Deirdre Lane on the death of her brother. I did not know <Col N="13" /> Theresa well except to say hello to her. I had the pleasure of having a few good sessions with John Boland, especially at rugby internationals. I am not likely to forget them or him and Fergus O'Brien, one of his closest friends.</P>
      <P>Joe Sheridan was my close friend for over 30 years. Like me, he came from the hungry hills of north Longford. He started his career as a cattle dealer or, as it was known then, cattle jobber. He went on to better things but he never lost touch with the people he dealt with throughout his life. He was a man of the people and that is no exaggeration. I was close to him for all those years.</P>
      <P>His memory was unbelievable. Regardless of how many years had passed he could inquire about the health of his constituents and ask if young John or Mary had recovered from whatever ailment they had suffered from when he had previously met them. Joe never forgot his roots. He did a huge amount for Longford and Westmeath when both counties were a single constituency. Later he represented Westmeath. He did more for the two counties than any other politician. His house was open seven days a week, 24 hours a day. I often wondered how he managed to rear such a wonderful family and still look after his constituents so well.</P>
      <P>One needed a lot of patience when Joe started to tell a story because he could go on and on. A few months ago I met him at the funeral of the late Joe Kelly in Longford. We went for a few drinks afterwards and he had not changed a bit. His memory went back beyond 40 years as he enjoyed his few pints. I never expected to be at his funeral some months later. His funeral was huge. Several former Taoisigh attended, as did people from all branches of politics and other walks of life. He richly deserved that massive funeral.</P>
      <P>Joe was a legend, certainly in Longford and Westmeath. Hundreds of people came to the Bloomfield House Hotel after the funeral and everybody had good stories to tell about Joe and what he did for them when he was in politics. He leaves a fabulous family. I shall miss him as if he were my brother.</P>

      <P>I believe the House would like to send its sympathy to the people of Scotland on the death of Donald Dewar early today. He was one of the finest politicians of his generation and <Col N="15" /> an outstanding First Minister in the new Scottish Assembly. He had many associations with this country and was a very good friend of Ireland. His loss is not just a loss to the people of Scotland but to politics in general. I am sure all Members of the House would like to express their sympathy to the Scottish people.</P>
      <P>I am aware the Leader of the House has had difficulties with his new office, as many of us have had, therefore I will not be too hard on him today in asking about proposed legislation. There seems to be a dearth of legislation and perhaps the Leader will indicate tomorrow what legislation he intends to take and over what period during the coming session.</P>
      <P>All of us would like to congratulate those who won the seat for Ireland on the Security Council, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, his predecessors, the Irish Ambassador, Mr. Richard Ryan, and the other members of the diplomatic service who played such an important part in winning this hugely important seat for Ireland.</P>

      <P>It would be appropriate to have a debate at the earliest opportunity on the future role of the UN, including Ireland's attitude and role in the UN and the major problems which the UN now faces. I suggest that we invite as a distinguished visitor to this House one of our most distinguished former Members, the UN High Commissioner, Mrs. Mary Robinson, to speak to us on UN affairs. I will ask the Leader to consider that proposal.</P>
      <P>Many people are filled with disquiet and disgust at the squabbling and bickering surrounding the Irish team at the Olympic Games. There is something seriously wrong with the way in which the affairs of the Irish Olympic Council are being run. This sort of public squabbling has been going on for a very long time and now is the time to call for an end to it. I agree with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation that every row seems to centre around one person. I would like the Minister to come to this House to tell us what is happening as far as the expenditure of public money is concerned, what the policy is and what future he proposes, given that we are four years away from the next Olympics.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong to pass today's Order of Business without referring to the extraordinary situation which has arisen because of the refusal of a Member of the other House to attend the tribunal set up by both Houses. Will the Leader make time available tomorrow to discuss No. 19, motion No. 4, on the Order Paper? This would give Members an opportunity to debate that issue, including the running of the tribunals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of the death of Donald Dewar and I concur with what Senator Manning has just said. I knew him very well, not in his capacity as a parliamentarian but because of his involvement in education at European level. He had a great level of commitment and I share the views expressed about him. We should express our condolences on the death of the man who has been described as the father of Scottish democracy. What he stood for is something about which we must be very clear, that is, the positive image of public representatives.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that a Member of the Oireachtas is currently refusing to co-operate and is not attending at a tribunal. I do not wish to embarrass you, a Chathaoirligh, in terms of straying from our responsibilities, but Senator Manning referred to No. I9, motion 4, on the Order Paper relating to tribunal procedures. I ask the Leader to include this as a matter for discussion tomorrow. I have made this point on many occasions and I have not been listened to on the issue. I do not think this is a party political matter. I do not want it to become a squabble between one party and another just because the person involved happens to be a member of one party. There are decent people in every party who should be allowed to express their views on this type of issue. This is an embarrassment and unacceptable. At a time when we are looking for proper rewards and compensation for public representatives, this is the last type of thing we wish to see in the media.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to item No. 73 of the papers laid before the House, that is, &ldquo;A New Era for Sport&rdquo;&ndash; The Irish Sports Council's Strategy, 2000-2002. I suggest we should have a discussion on the issue for the reasons raised by Senator Manning and many other reasons. We had a discussion previously in this House on the Sports Council's earlier strategy paper. That debate highlighted the difficulties being encountered by Irish Olympic qualifiers in getting time to do their work to represent Ireland, including the non co-operation of Government Departments. It is time these issues were put on the record and dealt with in this House. I ask for an early debate on the difficulties being experienced by tribunals and the policy paper on a new era for Irish sport.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to echo what has been said by Senator Manning on the success of the Irish Government and diplomatic service in securing the seat on the United Nations Security Council. This was one of two seats and was won against very stiff opposition. The members did us proud by securing such a high vote and leading the field in the election. As a former Senator, I would like <Col N="17" /> Mrs. Robinson to come to this House to address it on the role of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Manning's proposal, seconded by Senator O'Toole, that we should have an extensive debate tomorrow on the serious issue of a Member of the Oireachtas thumbing his nose at a tribunal which was unanimously established by all parties in the Oireachtas to deal with matters of grave concern to the people. An example should be set by all Oireachtas Members to co-operate fully in regard to the matters before the tribunal. We should be exemplary when called before a tribunal. There should be a full discussion on this at the earliest opportunity. I hope the Leader will oblige us by giving such a commitment.</P>
    <P>We have considerable difficulty with Nos. 1 and 2 on the Order Paper. We are unhappy that motions of this nature are brought before the House and the Leader requests us to take them without debate. The motions are substantial. One relates to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997&mdash;</P>

      <P>I join in the tributes to Donald Dewar who was the quintessential Scotsman and who was described as the father of parliamentary democracy in Scotland. It is a mortal blow to the Scottish Parliament, its members and the Scottish people and all of us will grieve about that.</P>
      <P>With regard to Nos. 1 and 2 on the Order Paper, I wonder what is the point of empowering committees to undertake certain tasks if we again debate what they have debated. The Oireachtas Joint Committees on Finance and the Public Service and European Affairs are competent and the matters can be debated fully by them. You are aware, a Chathaoirligh, that the Committee Stages of Bills are dealt with by select committees. The large Planning and Development Bill, 1999, was processed that way.</P>

      <P>I wonder about the point of having committees if we debate what they have already debated.</P>
      <P>It is important that we join in the congratulations to everybody concerned in securing a seat on the United Nations Security Council, particularly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, his predecessor, Deputy Andrews, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, and acknowledge the much wider effort made by our diplomatic service in securing the vote to attain a seat on the Security Council. Ireland will ensure it is used to vindicate human rights, the rights of small nations and the matters to which it has been attentive in the General Assembly over the years. It would be useful, as Senator Manning suggested, if we debated Ireland's role in the UN and how it should use the seat on the Security Council in the near future.</P>
      <P>I know, a Chathaoirligh, that you would stop me from intruding into the area of the tribunal but the Taoiseach accurately summed up the matter earlier when he said everybody had a democratic, legal and moral responsibility to attend the tribunal and give evidence. His attitude on the matter is quite explicit.</P>
      <P>It would be appropriate for us to discuss sport in general and in doing so to congratulate Sonia O'Sullivan on winning a silver medal at the Olympic Games. It was a marvellous achievement but all our Olympians should be proud that they attained the standard to compete in the Olympic Games. Competing in the Olympics is something to celebrate and that was most evident in the swimming pool where one contestant took much longer than anybody ever before to complete the course but, nevertheless, he completed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also examine how public funds are spent in this area, the role of the Olympic Council of Ireland, whether the Comptroller and Auditor General has any function with respect to any moneys expended and the question of how elections are undertaken by the OCI. These <Col N="19" /> matters should come within the scope of the debate and I hope the Minister will be available to come to the House to discuss these and related matters.</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues in congratulating those involved in securing the important position for Ireland at the United Nations. Its importance cannot be exaggerated and it presents an opportunity. We won the draw but we still have to play the game. We are in a good position to do this because our representation there will not be clouded in the same way as that of some of the bigger countries by vested financial interests. This gives us the opportunity to go to the heart of human rights and to ensure that issues such as East Timor and particularly Tibet are addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tibet has been treated shamefully by the United Nations. It recently held a conference of world religious leaders on peace, but the one person it excluded was his holiness, the Dalai Lama. If Ireland had strong representation, surely it would kick out against such a decision. I support the mooted invitation to the former <Col N="20" /> distinguished Member of the House, Mrs. Mary Robinson, to address the Seanad. She spoke to the Irish people generally on the radio recently and her comments were informative and useful. Senator Manning referred to the move of offices. This issue should be considered in some form by the House because it was done largely without consultation. The lives of the secretarial staff were made hell on earth. I strongly support the claim for disturbance money because there was disturbance. One of our colleagues in the other House collapsed from the strain.

      <P>I join other speakers in complimenting and paying tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, his predecessor, Deputy Andrews, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, the ambassadors, the chargés d'affaires and the honorary consuls throughout the world on securing through their efforts for the past number of years a seat for Ireland on the Security Council of the United Nations. I agree with Senator Manning that a debate on the role of the United Nations would be opportune and I support his call for such a discussion.</P>
      <P>This debate should include a discussion on Ireland's diplomatic service throughout the world. It was a unique achievement given that Ireland has the smallest diplomatic service in Europe. This is an opportunity to examine fully how the diplomatic service can be used to greater advantage and the possibility of upgrading some of the chargés d'affaires offices to ambassadorial positions. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House for such a commendable debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced recently that the entire decentralisation programme has been either abandoned or shelved. This is a serious matter, particularly for rural towns. If that is the case and there is a change in Government policy, a debate should take place. I ask the Leader to make time available either tomorrow or next week for such <Col N="22" /> a discussion. The Minister for Finance should be invited to take part in a full discussion on the Government's decentralisation programme. It has huge implications for towns such as Kilrush and Ennis in County Clare and other towns throughout Ireland. There could be huge fallout from such a decision and there is grave disappointment at the announcement.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Government and the diplomatic corps on securing a seat on the United Nations Security Council. I support the call for a debate on this area. Such a discussion would be timely. It is a great credit to Ireland and shows what can be achieved if minds are focused.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the work of Ireland's sports agencies and how they operated in Sydney. I congratulate Sonia O'Sullivan on the second highest achievement of the silver medal. She is a great credit to Ireland. I also congratulate all the other competitors. It is a pity that we appear to be airing our dirty linen in public. It shows that something is not right in the administrative world of sport. Given the debate in the Lower House last night, I am sure the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation would welcome an opportunity to come to the Seanad and discuss at length where we go from here and how we can prepare for the next Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the recent report of the Higher Education Authority regarding third level access. It is disconcerting that a large section of the population is still not represented in third level institutions. We need to consider how best to address the issue of third level access and the policies that are in place with regard to the changing labour market. Such a debate could have an impact on the implementation of future reports. A wider is issue involved. An expert group is considering this problem but the issue lends itself to a long debate in the House. While the Leader has been asked to place many items on his list, perhaps he could include this matter in the future and arrange a long debate on the wider strategy in this area and the implications for third level institutions and the Government.</P>

      <P>In conjunction with other Members of the House, I met members of the new Scottish Parliament at the meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body earlier this week where they attended as observers. I wish to be associated with Senator Manning's request that our condolences be sent to them on the death of their First Minister. It is a dreadful blow to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children on two initiatives yesterday. One was the establishment of Breastcheck, the breast screening programme, and the other was a new attack on smoking among teenagers. Like Senator Hayes, however, I would query the initiative of going to the Indian sub-continent to <Col N="23" /> recruit junior staff, which has been described as only a stop-gap method of solving problems in our hospitals. Perhaps we could debate that matter.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask the Leader if we can debate item 60 on the papers laid before the Seanad today, which concerns the 1999 report of the inspector of mental hospitals. This report is extraordinarily important, particularly in view of the slow progress being made with the Mental Treatment Bill in committee. I hope this report can be debated within the next couple of weeks.</P>

      <P>I join with other Senators who called for a full debate on the future of the Olympic Council of Ireland, with the participation of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid. I compliment all our athletes who participated in the recent Olympic Games in Sydney. I congratulate Sonia O'Sullivan for bringing honour to the country. There must be a full debate, however, on the future of Olympic sports in this country.</P>
      <P>I am also seeking a debate on Bord Gáis in view of the announcement that over £100 million is to be invested in new gas pipeline infrastructure. With that kind of investment being made, we would like to see the gas pipeline being extended to all parts of the country and in particular my constituency in Kerry, which seems to have been overlooked. A full and frank debate is required in the House concerning the future of Bord Gáis.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House for a debate on the atrocities that took place on Bloody Sunday. I am seeking this, in particular, in view of the recent release of tape recordings of the British Army commander in charge and his senior staff, which imply that they were in favour of civilians being killed in Derry on 30 January 1972. A full and open debate on this issue is required in the House. The British Army commanders who were in charge of operations in Derry on that day should be charged and brought before the UN war crimes tribunal in the Hague for that type of atrocity. Day after day we support calls for the perpetrators of such atrocities in other countries to be brought before courts or tribunals. This matter should be debated on behalf of the people of our country.</P>

      <P>I join in congratulating the achievement of the Government in securing a place for Ireland on the UN Security Council. Perhaps the fact that, of the three candidate countries, we were not members of NATO did us some good. Those who would have bounced us into military alliances should think about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to refer to issues which are outside the Order of Business, but an issue has arisen which should provoke us into a discussion about how the Houses of the Oireachtas regulate their Members so that they do not behave in a way which brings the Houses into disrepute. How <Col N="24" /> can we ensure that acceptable standards of behaviour in public life are enforced on Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas? That is a legitimate issue for discussion.</P>
    <P>Your rulings, a Chathaoirligh, are usually so succinct and clear that I never have any trouble with them, but I cannot understand how item 2 cannot be discussed since it is a proposal that Seanad Éireann approves the terms of the agreement establishing the advisory centre on World Trade Organisation law. I fully accept that the detail of many of these matters are best discussed in committee but there are principles involved here, as there are on Second Stage of legislation, which deserve to be discussed in some fashion on the floor of the House. While there may be an area of specialisation, anything to do with the World Trade Organisation, as with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, is now politically sensitive material which generates huge passions and divisions. It would be unwise of us not to be aware of these matters and to discuss them. I am a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs so I am not in the least bit deprived, but item 2 should be debated either now or at the conclusion of the committee's deliberations. The same applies to item 1. I ask the Leader to give a commitment that both matters will be discussed, even for 50 minutes or an hour, at some stage, once the business of the committee has been concluded.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that I am the first person to raise this matter but we should discuss the situation in Palestine as a matter of urgency and, in particular, the massacre of more than 80 Palestinians in the past two or three weeks by a country that claims to be part of the democratic world. This issue should be discussed in detail. I share the Government's position but the Houses of the Oireachtas ought to be involved as well.</P>
    <P>As I have done for the past two years, I again ask the Leader what is happening to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill. Before we reassembled after the summer recess, the Dublin City Manager announced that 11 separate telecommunications companies were digging up the streets of the capital. Later today, we will debate a motion about traffic in Dublin. The telecommunications business is contributing its fair share to the traffic chaos in most of our cities.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader, once again, if we can have a debate on the enlargement of the European Union. I raise this matter particularly in light of Mr. Romano Prodi's speech to the plenary session of the European Parliament on 3 October. We should include in that debate a discussion, as Senator Haughey has sought, of the draft charter of the fundamental rights of the European Union. The Joint Committee on European Affairs was given to understand that some of the charter's provisions may be repugnant to our Constitution. The debate will be an important one and we should have it prior to the Biarritz summit so that, for once, we can discuss something before it happens rather than afterwards when it has become a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>

      <P>In recent weeks Ireland has witnessed an appalling tragedy. A young mother, father and two young boys all met with violent deaths. It is no exaggeration to say that the whole nation was shocked, indeed traumatised, by what happened. One can only imagine the pain suffered by the remaining members of that family. It is customary at such a time for the whole community to rally and give sympathy, comfort, consolation and support to the bereaved family. However, one newspaper broke ranks with that tradition and set out to sensationalise this tragedy. It published intimate and private alleged details of the personal relationships within that family. Can anybody imagine the extra suffering and pain that has been placed on that family as a result of such revelations?</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to organise a debate on press accountability. I know the newspaper in question received many letters, some of which were published, from readers disowning what happened, but what about the journalists? Why do they not stand up and be counted? What about the NUJ? Does it accept this derivation from ordinary decency, which no society can accept? I seek this debate as a matter of urgency. As a Members of the Oireachtas and as a citizen, I feel ashamed about what happened. It behoves this House to provide leadership in matters of this kind. Cowardice was involved in that reportage because it would not have been published if those people were alive. It is time for the newspaper to issue an apology and give an undertaking that it will not happen again.</P>

I support the comments of Senator Coghlan who raised this <Col N="26" /> matter. As I have said in the past, there will be adverse consequences and implications for small grocery shops. Before the Minister makes any decision on the recent review presented to her, I would ask the Leader to arrange some form of debate so that Members will have an input into the Minister's final decision.</P>

It is appropriate that the House should congratulate not only Sonia O'Sullivan on her two magnificent performances and the credit she brought to the country but all athletes who made it to the Olympic Games. It is a phenomenal achievement for any individual and they all deserve our congratulations.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that those congratulations cannot be extended to officialdom, and that is an issue which we must deal with as a matter of urgency. We all speak of the cynicism of young people towards politics and politicians in general. It is regrettable that young athletes share that cynicism towards those involved in sport administration, the &ldquo;blazers&rdquo; as they call them. It has got to a stage where we must question our presence at an important event like the Olympic Games if we are unable to provide the appropriate level of preparation and administration which athletes deserve. I look forward to the Minister coming to the House to debate this issue.</P>

    <P>Some Senators congratulated the Government, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the former Minister, Deputy Andrews, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and all the officials who played a significant and successful part in Ireland's bid to gain a seat on the UN Security Council. I wholeheartedly congratulate all involved and I will take up Senator Manning's proposal for an address and statements on the UN. I intend to make a proposal to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that the European Commissioner, David Byrne, be the next person to be invited to the House and to update us, hopefully, on an annual basis. That would allow us to highlight the <Col N="27" /> achievements of the Commissioner's and Ireland's work within Europe and to have a question and answer session which has been successful in the past.</P>
    <P>Senators Norris, Ormonde, Dan Kiely and Glennon called for a debate on sport in the aftermath of the Olympic Games and on future policy. Some Senators called for a policy paper. I congratulate Sonia O'Sullivan and all who represented Ireland. It is an achievement to be the best in one's parish or one's county. However, to be the best in one's country and to represent Ireland is an exceptional achievement and a tremendous honour. Some expect Irish athletes to be the best in the world. Sonia O'Sullivan has proved time and again that she is one of the greatest female athletes of all time and I wholeheartedly congratulate her. It was wonderful to see her taking two laps of honour in Croke Park on All-Ireland final day. How wonderful it is to see a very successful sportsman in the Gallery. He is a man of his time and none of us has ever seen the likes of his performance in the All-Ireland Hurling Final. Perhaps he is considering becoming a Member.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the Minister, Deputy McDaid, in anticipation of the Order of Business and he has agreed that we will forgo Fianna Fáil Private Members' Time next Wednesday. Perhaps the leaders will agree to extend the time by an extra hour so Senators can express their views in the presence of the Minister to assist him in formulating whatever policy he and the Government hope to put together in light of his past experiences.</P>
    <P>The House must also offer its congratulations to the RTÉ sports department on its magnificent coverage of the Olympic Games which most agree were the best ever. RTÉ excelled itself and I congratulate those in charge of the sports department and the presenters. They were very professional and once again rose to the challenge. It is a pity other departments in RTÉ do not take a lead from the sports department.</P>

Senators Coghlan and John Cregan called for the retention of the groceries order and for the Minister to ensure that small businesses survive. All Members would agree with this motion and I will pass on their renewed requests to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senators Haughey and Lydon called for human rights to be enshrined in legislation. The Bill will come before the House this session. I will inform the House tomorrow of the 15 Bills which will be considered this session, the first of which is being initiated in the House today.</P>

A judicial inquiry is taking place in another jurisdiction but perhaps we can review the situation over the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>I will make inquiries for Senator Ryan about the telecommunications Bill to see what will happen in that regard in this session. Senator Lydon called for a debate on the enlargement of the European Union and I will provide time for this debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Murchú expressed serious concern regarding the inappropriate coverage of the tragedy which took place in the south east. I could not agree more with the sentiments he expressed. The more we see such misuse of privilege and appalling abuse of power, the more we should debate the possibilities of setting up a press council. Senator Ó Murchú stated that he would like to know the views of the NUJ in this regard and asked whether it has a role to play in dealing with sensitive issues, whether what happened was in the public interest and whether it should have happened.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option, provided by Article 3 of the fourth Protocol set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam, to notify the President of the Council of the European Union that it wishes to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measure:</P>
      <P>a proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) on the mutual enforcement of judgments on rights of access to children (O.J. No. C234, 15.8.00, p.7)</P>
      <P>copies of which proposed measure were laid before Seanad Éireann on 3 October 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin): The need for this motion arises because of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution which enabled Ireland to ratify the Amsterdam Treaty and also allowed the State to exercise certain options contained in that Treaty, including the option in the fourth Protocolumn. Under the terms of the consti<Col N="30" /> tutional amendment, such exercise is subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam, which came into operation on 1 May 1999 added to the EC Treaty a new Title IV which deals with visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to the free movement of persons, including judicial co-operation in civil matters. The fourth Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty establishes the positions of Ireland and the United Kingdom in relation to the issues arising under Title IV. Its effect is to exempt both countries from all the provisions of Title IV but to permit either or both to opt in to particular measures under the terms and conditions set out in the Protocolumn. Under Article 3 of the Protocol, the State has three months from the date a proposal or initiative is presented to the Council of Ministers to notify our wish to take part in the adoption and application of the measure. We may also accept a measure any time after it has been adopted.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the conference which adopted the Amsterdam Treaty took note of a declaration by Ireland that it intended to exercise its right under Article 3 of the Protocol to take part in the adoption of measures pursuant to Title IV to the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of the Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom. It follows from this that our predisposition in relation to measures such as the one we are now discussing is to participate in their adoption. This will be the seventh occasion on which the approval of both Houses will have been sought for the State to exercise the option provided in the fourth Protocol in respect of a proposal for an EU legal instrument.</P>
    <P>Under Article 65 of the Amsterdam Treaty, judicial co-operation in civil matters includes, among other things, measures aimed at improving and simplifying the recognition and enforcement of decisions in civil and commercial cases. Formerly, judicial co-operation in civil matters was dealt with under the Third Pillar of the Maastricht Treaty, which was largely intergovernmental in nature. The Amsterdam Treaty changed that by including this subject in the EC Treaty, that is, the First Pillar. For a transitional period of five years from the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty member states share with the Commission the right to table new initiatives. The draft regulation we are now discussing is an example of a proposal made by a member state, in this case France which, as it happens, currently holds the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The consequence of the presentation of this measure by France to the Council is that if the State wishes to opt in to its adoption, we have until 13 October to inform the President of the Council of our intentions. Failure to opt in at this time does not prevent us from participating in relevant meetings of the Council working parties which will discuss these proposals. However, we would not be able to opt in until the negotiations <Col N="31" /> were concluded and the measure adopted, and our ability to influence the outcome of the discussions would be correspondingly limited.</P>
    <P>In October 1999, the European Council, at a meeting in Tampere, Finland, on the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice, highlighted the need to establish a genuine European judicial area. In that regard, the Council endorsed the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and judgments. Judgments in the area of family litigation, including those relating to access rights, were considered by the European Council as being appropriate for early action to promote this principle.</P>
    <P>This draft regulation aims to ensure the effective exercise in one member state of rights of access ordered in another member state and the return of the child to the custodial parent once rights of access have been exercised. The scope of the regulation as it stands is confined to marital children. The regulation addresses the right of children to maintain regular contact with both parents, whatever the parents' place of residence. The draft regulation is essentially a modification of the Brussels II Regulation on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for joint children: Article 14 of the draft regulation provides that Brussels II shall apply to the judgments covered save where otherwise provided in this draft.</P>
    <P>The principal features of the draft regulation are, first, it relates to marital children under the age of 16 when enforcement of a judgment is sought; second, a judgment on rights of access which has been given and is enforceable in a member state, even provisionally, can be enforced in any other member state without the need to obtain a declaration of enforceability in the latter state &ndash; this is a derogation from Brussels II which requires a declaration of enforceability; third, enforcement of the access order may only be suspended in limited circumstances, namely, if enforcement of the order would put the child's interests at serious risk or if there is another enforceable judgment which is irreconcilable &ndash; however, while enforcement may only be suspended in these circumstances, the custodial parent can bring proceedings for a decision that the order should not be recognised or enforced on the grounds set out in the Brussels II Regulation but, unless and until the court decides in the custodial parent's favour, the order will not be suspended and will continue to be enforced; fourth, if the child is not returned to the parent with custody rights at the end of the period of access, the custodial parent may apply in the host state for the prompt return of the child and the court must order the return of the child notwithstanding grounds of local jurisdiction or grounds under the Hague Convention on child abduction, to which Ireland is a party, which may exist for refusal; and, finally, central authorities are to be established by member states to exchange information, to encourage voluntary <Col N="32" /> return of children and to arrange any necessary legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>This measure will supplement existing international and EU law in the area. Many Senators will be aware that Ireland is, with the other EU states, a party to the Hague and Council of Europe conventions on child abduction, which provide for the return of children to the place from which they have been wrongfully abducted by a parent but also cover the case where a child is wrongfully retained under access arrangements in another state. Those conventions, particularly the Hague Convention, which are administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have operated with considerable success over the years. A difficulty with the Hague Convention is that, although it is intertwined with international abduction cases, it does not adequately address the problem of enforcing access rights.</P>
    <P>Certain of those difficulties are addressed in the 1996 Hague Convention on the Protection of Children. Ireland has taken a leading role among EU states and elsewhere by bringing forward legislation to enable ratification of that convention. Australia and New Zealand are preparing similar legislation. Our legislation is the Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill which is at present before this House, having been passed by the Dáil. The EU proposal we are now discussing is framed in a different way from the 1996 convention and, as I have said, is confined to marital children. Nevertheless, the EU initiative proposed by France is indicative of the importance that attaches to the subject of access orders.</P>
    <P>Having been presented to the Council of Ministers, work on the draft regulation is now to proceed in a Council working party and the outcome of negotiations in the Council framework will be submitted, in due course, for decision by the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that, based on the discussions which have taken place to date, two aspects of the proposal which are giving rise to some concern on the part of at least some member states are the provision that a declaration of enforceability will not be necessary in the requested state and, second, the exact circumstances in which enforcement of an order can be suspended. It is clear that a good deal of revision will be required of the regulation before it is acceptable in full to member states, including Ireland. I will, of course, take account of points that may be made by Senators on any aspect of the proposal.</P>
    <P>Opting in at this stage, then, does not imply that we will approve of everything in the proposal as it now stands but it does give us the scope to participate to maximum effect in the development of the measure. It is important that Ireland responds positively by exercising its right to opt in now so that we can play a full and constructive part in the negotiations at working party level and, ultimately, in the Justice and Home Affairs Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House, particularly in view of the fact that she is presenting this draft regulation, which arises from article three of the fourth protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam, in relation to the enforcement of custody orders across the European Union. However, much discussion and refinement of the regulation is needed before it finally becomes part of European law.</P>
      <P>We are right to opt in at this stage so that we will be able to participate fully in the making of the final draft. The Minister of State rightly made the point that if we opted out at this stage, while we would be part of the working group negotiations, our next opportunity to opt in would be when the draft is finalised. At that stage, we would have had no influence over the shape of the final draft.</P>
      <P>The major shortcoming of the draft is, as the Minister of State said, that it applies only to marital children. Not only is that a very serious shortcoming, it also amounts to serious discrimination. I hope that, as we are opting in so that we can be part of the negotiations on the final paper, we will argue very strongly that the terms must be broadened to include children born inside and outside marriage. We cannot forget that one third of all births in this country today are outside marriage, which is a social phenomenon of our time. Battles are fought in our courts on a daily basis over the custody of non-marital children.</P>
      <P>The other major shortcoming is that it applies only to children who are under 16 years of age when the enforcement judgment is applied for. Many people would say that is at least one year too young and would argue it should apply to children under 17 or even 18 years. I ask the Minister of State to take these serious points on board.</P>
      <P>Legal actions in regard to the custody of children often centre around the right of the mother to be the guardian of children or to have the greater access to them. This kind of culture has grown up in law. The Children Act, 1997, gave fathers of non-marital children the right to seek guardianship of their children. The mother is the natural guardian of children. That legislation addressed a major gap in the law. However, in the legal culture fathers are often discriminated against, in terms of the language used and the attitudes displayed. We should argue along those lines in our contribution to the final draft.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal that legal action for the enforceability of access need only take place in one country, which I know there is debate about, and that there would be no need for further legal action in the other state involved. For example, legal action taken in France in regard to the abduction of a child would be legally binding in Ireland. However, there is rightly a derogation from that in special circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned two areas which could give rise to a lot of concern among many member states. They are the provision that a declaration of enforceability will not be neces<Col N="34" /> sary in the requested state and, second, the exact circumstances in which enforcement of an order can be suspended. These are two major issues. However, while not wishing to take from those two major concerns raised by the Minister of State, an even more important point is that this regulation only provides for the children of married couples.</P>
    <P>I was quite surprised to hear on a radio discussion this morning that there is very little reporting of family law cases in the Irish courts because of the <i>in camera</i> rule, which is for the right reasons. I am not talking here about press reporting but the normal reporting of judgments, in which a lot of wisdom is contained and from which much good law proceeds. This is in contrast with the position in the United Kingdom where there is very comprehensive reportage which protects the identities of the people involved. The UK judgments are published and are a great source of information for legal professionals and the public. We need to look at that.</P>
    <P>There is a huge number of family law cases in our courts. I was surprised to hear there are two Circuit Court sittings in Dublin, with a third to be added, five days a week dealing with family law cases. They cover divorce, judicial separation, custody &ndash; which we are dealing with today &ndash; guardianship and so on. That does not take account of the fact that there is at least one High Court judge in Dublin alone dealing with family law cases, nor does it take account of the amount of time the District Court in Dublin and throughout the country spends on family law cases, all of which are held <i>in camera.</i>A huge amount of jurisprudence arises from all that legal action but it is not reported. This is a matter that needs to be seriously looked at. We always try to protect the names of the victims in the same way as in criminal cases involving rape and sexual abuse which are heard in open court and are reported in the media without revealing the names to protect victims. The Court Services Board is having a look at this issue but the Minister's Department should be active in relation to it. I am in favour of retention of the <i>in camera</i> rule but the problem is that much of what should be reported in the official legal journal is not reported. I ask the Minister to look at that issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this motion is being debated today. It has to be finished by 13 October. I sincerely hope before the final draft is signed the Minister will report to the House and give us an opportunity to comment on it before it becomes part of European law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion. I welcome also the Minister of State to the House. This is my first opportunity to welcome her here. It is my wish that she will return to this House over many years with further motions and Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Connor said, this motion has to be passed by Friday. It allows us to sit down at the table with the other EU member states, except Denmark and England, to discuss ways and <Col N="35" /> means in which access orders, granted in one member state, can be enforced in other member states. I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has said central authorities are to be established by member states to exchange information to encourage voluntary return. That is and should be the underlying tenet behind all these discussions. We all know that when family disputes enter the law courts the children suffer most. We are here to give the Minister permission to negotiate on behalf of Irish children or children born in Ireland who may be domiciled in other states of the EU. I have sympathy with Senator Connor's view that all children of a union should be included rather than merely marital children. It is possible when the discussions begin and they get down to teasing out the nitty gritty that we and all the other member states may be of the view that all children should be included.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion and wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to see the Minister of State getting so much support, given that this is an issue into which she and her officials have put a great deal of time. This motion is important and I am pleased she has taken the initiative and will be involved in the discussions on the resolution. Those discussions cannot but be helped by her input.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the words that struck Senator Fitzpatrick were exactly the words that struck me as being the most important. They are that central authorities are to be established by member states to exchange information to encourage voluntary return of children and to arrange any necessary legal proceedings. Perhaps because of our professional backgrounds, Senator Fitzpatrick and I have seen too much of what happens to families when the law has to be invoked.</P>
      <P>The European President's representative for transnationally abducted children is an Irish MEP, Mary Banotti. When she commenced work in this area she thought she would have to deal with cases only once or twice a year. There is an amazing number of cases within the European Union each year, not to mention those in Ireland. There are over 100 cases in Ireland every year, most of which are settled amicably. Children are taken from various parts of England or Northern Ireland to Ireland by grandparents because parents have had a falling out. Some 50% come in here and 50% are taken out. Fortunately it has not become a <i>cause célèbre </i>in the newspapers. I view this as an important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad when a marriage breaks down. Not only is it tragic for the children but they are used as weapons within the marriage. A court makes a decision on who should have custody of the children and on the visiting rights. The partner who may decide to go against the court decision uses the children against the other partner. Grandparents also get involved. This is an area for <Col N="36" /> which we must try to set up the structures. What we seek is a voluntary return of the children, not more court cases. However, there will be further court cases. That means the structures will have to be set up here for whatever number there are. Not all cases will be from England or Northern Ireland. Some will be continental cases for which the facilities of interpreters and translators will be required to ensure the judgments of the various courts are accessible to those dealing with the cases here. I hope the necessary resources will be made available to the Minister's Department to ensure the structures are put in place.</P>
    <P>Like Senators Connor and Fitzpatrick, I am concerned that the scope of the regulation is confined to marital children. I cannot see why that is the case because it is at the end of a divorce settlement that problems occur. Perhaps we can discuss the position of non-marital children under the Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill. While the abduction of children transnationally can be by criminals, as in the recent dreadful cases in Italy, for child prostitution or involvement in pornography, as in the Russian cases, it is important to remember that in general these are family cases. They are the children of a marriage or the children of perhaps a long-term relationship.</P>
    <P>Senators have pointed to the high level of births outside marriage. Senator Connor put the figure at 30%, whereas I would have thought it was 25%. It could have increased during the course of the summer. People in long-term relationships, particularly men, do not fully understand they do not have the same rights regarding their children as if they were married. Young people who have two or three children and whom I try to address regarding the advisability of marriage see no good reason they should be married. We do not want to point out to them the problems they may encounter on breaking up when we are trying to encourage the relationship but the view abroad is that it makes little difference to the parents' position. We have to be aware of questions regarding total equality of rights in this situation. What about a child whose mother was raped? Does that father have the same rights to access to the child? I do not know. If he goes before the courts, what will his rights be? </P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister of State teasing out these matters and I hope she will return to the House to discuss the resolution. I congratulate her and her officials on the initiative they have shown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Connor, Fitzpatrick and Henry for their contributions. It is important that we exercise our option within the three month period for the reason the Senators have outlined, to ensure we can participate in the debate. I thank the Senators for not expecting me to have all the answers <Col N="37" /> today. These issues can be teased out in the course of the debate on the resolution.</P>
      <P>It is an instrument which will facilitate access to children by their parents. It will clarify the law in member states in the European Union and it should have long-term and tangible benefits in terms of the time and expense involved in access proceedings in the civil courts.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor referred to the fact that it applies to children under the age of 16 years and said that a number of people were of the opinion that the age should be 17 or 18 years. The age of 16 years is in line with two international conventions, the Hague convention and the Council of Europe convention. However, the Senator's views can be debated further and taken into consideration during the negotiation of the regulation.</P>
      <P>The main issue of concern was the exclusion of non-marital children. As is the case here, this issue has caused great concern for many member states not least the French, who have indicated that they would like to extend the scope of existing instruments to address the legal needs of non-marital children. I am sure this will be reviewed and that the scope of the regulations for judgments concerning children will be central to all future discussions on this.</P>
      <P>It is expected that these new procedures for co-operation will result in the more efficient and effective functioning of judicial proceedings. It is my hope in relation to rights of access, irrespective of where judgments are made, that the interests of the child will be paramount at all times. Go raibh maith agaibh.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne): Molaim an Bille um Dhumpáil ar Farraige (Leasú), 2000, don Teach.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on the lack of facilities in the House. I understand the delay this evening was due to monitors not working. On the second week in the session that should not be happening. I commend the Government Whip on <Col N="38" /> the grace with which he asked me, and I agreed, to wait for the Opposition Members. No blame attaches to the Opposition Members.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to clarify the law as enshrined in the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996, in a number of important respects. First, in so far as it concerns the protection of important natural and archaeological heritage, the Bill specifically includes the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in the list of Ministers to be consulted by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in relation to all applications for dumping at sea permits and specifically includes any likelihood of interference with important natural or archaeological heritage in the particular matters to be considered by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources before making a decision on any application for a dumping at sea permit. Sections 2 and 4 of the Bill refer. They copperfasten long-standing practice and remove any doubt about the proper protection of important natural and archaeological heritage in the context of the operations covered by the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>Second, in the interests of transparency and fairness of procedures, the Bill imposes a statutory requirement, in place of the present non-statutory one, on applicants for dumping at sea permits to advertise their applications in a local newspaper. Interested parties will have 21 days after publication of the newspaper advertisement in which to comment to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources on the proposals in the applications, except in urgent cases involving navigational safety where public advertisement only is being provided for. These comments will be referred to the applicants for their response within a reasonable time, which will depend on the particular circumstances of the case. Both those comments and the response of the applicants will be carefully considered by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources before he makes a decision on the application. Section 3 of the Bill refers.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections are sections 1 and 5. Section 1 updates the definition of &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; in the 1996 Act, for enforcement and related purposes simply to take account of later legislation, including the recent Harbours Act, 2000. Section 5 is a standard provision for the short title for the Bill when enacted and for its construction and referencing with the 1996 Act.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to the detailed explanatory and financial memorandum which was published with the Bill. The Dumping at Sea Act, 1996, has stood the test of time, a tribute to its sponsors. The Act strengthened considerably and replaced earlier legislation for the control of dumping at sea, in line with updated international obligations of the State. The Act bans incineration at sea, the dumping of radioactive waste and offshore installations and all toxic harmful and noxious substances. It also extends the limit of Irish jurisdiction in relation to dumping at sea from 12 miles offshore up to 200 miles and, in some cases, <Col N="39" /> up to 350 miles offshore to coincide with Ireland's portion of the Continental Shelf. The Act enables the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to grant permits for certain dumping, as specified in the permits and subject to such conditions as the Minister may specify in the permits. It also empowers the courts to impose such monetary penalty and-or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, as they may decide, on conviction on indictment of any person for illegal dumping as defined by the Act. Up to now those essential penal provisions have deterred illegal dumping at sea.</P>
    <P>All applications for dumping at sea permits are carefully considered by my Department, with the assistance of specialist advisers who form the Marine Licence Vetting Committee which meets frequently, as business demands. Detailed guidelines have been published by my Department to assist applicants. Copies of those guidelines are available in the Oireachtas Library. Applicants are obliged to consider thoroughly all non-dumping at sea options and, in particular, other beneficial uses such as beach nourishment and land reclamation. Non-dumping solutions have been successfully pursued in a number of cases and more will be pursued in the context of five year rolling dredging plans being prepared by ports and other harbour authorities at my Department's insistence. Such five year plans will yield obvious benefits to those authorities in terms of assisting necessary business development. Material for dumping at sea is thoroughly assessed prior to dumping. Dump sites are monitored before and after dumping takes place to ensure that any dumping is properly carried out.</P>
    <P>Approximately 20 dumping at sea permits are granted each year, mostly for port and harbour dredging for essential maintenance and development purposes and, occasionally, for the disposal of fish waste from industrial fish processing operations. Details are published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on an annual basis and kept in a public register in my Department as required under the 1996 Act. Thus, for example, details of all dumping at sea permits granted in 1999 were published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on 8 February 2000.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is designed to improve the 1996 Act and should be enacted at an early date.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and apologise for not being here on time. I have been running from one office to another since 4 p.m. and I missed the deadline. That indicates the value of the monitors and how difficult it is to operate without having the systems in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> This Bill is an amendment to the 1996 legislation introduced by the previous Minister for the Marine, Deputy Seán Barrett. This was substantial legislation which went a long way towards bringing our laws in relation to dumping at sea into the 20th century and in line with the OSPAR Convention which laid down laws for dumping at sea. The stories we heard in the past about dumping at sea would make one quiver and worry about the unauthorised dumping which was taking place for years by various European Governments. The biggest offenders were possibly our neighbours across the water. When we hear stories about the Beaufort Dyke, the munitions dumps and so on, the Dumping at Sea Act was not before its time. The fact that it extended the jurisdiction from 12 miles to 350 miles in some cases was a major and necessary improvement for the protection of our marine environment and the laws in general in relation to the environment.</P>
    <P>I am sure the amendment was an oversight at the time the Bill was going through both Houses and would not merit a lot of time and discussion at this juncture, except to say that it is possibly a welcome amendment. I am not too sure about the implications of involving the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. This would probably be involved more in relation to the issue of landfill. Nevertheless, I am sure the Minister has a reason for including it. It is questionable whether dredging, particularly limited dredging in harbours and ports, would constitute an offence in relation to dumping at sea. There is also the question of sand and gravel extraction from the sea. We are all aware that sand and gravel sources are becoming scarce on the mainland, therefore, it will just be a matter of time before developers and contractors resort to the sea for gravel and gravel deposits, as well as other deposits.</P>
    <P>We are grateful in County Mayo for the recent discovery of gas off our shore which has been there for thousands of years. This will be brought ashore in 2002 and we welcome the development in this regard. As the Minister of State will be aware, there is an ongoing debate in the west as to how and who will benefit from this major natural resource. No doubt the debate will continue for a considerable period. Last week a delegation from Bord Gáis outlined its plans for the massive discovery in the Corrib field. We were pleased with the presentation although it was vague in many areas. We have been led to believe that the pipeline from Pullathomas to Craughwell, County Galway, will commence when the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources gives it his <i>imprimatur.</i> I hope that will happen sooner rather than later because both Enterprise Oil and Bord Gáis are extremely anxious to get this major project under way, although Enterprise Oil has not ultimately declared the financial viability of the project. However, we are led to believe it is only a matter of time before this announcement is made. All plans are contingent on the announcement and I urge the Minister of State to exhort his col<Col N="41" /> league to make the necessary decisions forthwith and not to delay this major infrastructural development for the west.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a technical amendment to the original substantial legislation which was introduced in 1996 and which covered all the necessary areas at the time. The Minister of State has outlined its function in relation to the overall Act and I welcome it. Since the 1996 Act legislation has changed the status of some ports and harbours and this amendment is necessary to bring those changes into line. The Minister of State wishes to enact the Bill as soon as possible to eliminate any loopholes in original Act. I welcome the amendment, we have no problem with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and commend the Bill to the House. I fished in Bantry Bay in the late 1970s and early 1980s when I was young. Marine matters played second fiddle to agriculture for many years but in the past decade the corner has been turned and some eminent people, such as Deputy Barrett, the Ministers, Deputies Woods and Fahey, and former Deputies Coveney and Pat the Cope Gallagher, have held the ministerial portfolio.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State who is from Wexford has extensive knowledge of seafaring matters. I pay tribute to him because on the few occasions he has visited us in west Cork, he has brought good news and it is appreciated. Marine matters had taken a back seat but this Government, in particular, is extremely committed to marine, natural resources and related matters. My colleague mentioned the gas find off the Mayo coast and I hope the west and north-west reap the rewards of such a find as Cork did following the gas find near Kinsale.</P>
      <P>I offer my sympathy and condolences to the families of the fishermen who were lost off the west coast this year. When there is a tragedy at sea, such as a trawler sinking, a tingle goes through everybody in fishing towns and villages, whether they are in Cork, Kerry, Galway or Mayo, and it reverberates through the fishing community. Only one fisherman survived following the two latest incidents. Many people were lost and such tragedies affect marine communities not only in Ireland but also in Spain, France and England. I pay tribute to the marine rescue organisations. The sea can be cruel and no year passes without loss of life at sea. Every county on the coast has felt such a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill relates to the 1996 Act, which was welcome at the time. It transposed the OSPAR Convention which was adopted by Ireland in 1992 and ratified in 1998. Pollution and dumping at sea, including the reckless abandonment of vessels along the coastline, were major problems off the south-west coast for a number of decades. Some of the main navigation channels from Central and South America and the United States pass along the south-west coastline. There was a series of devastating tragedies in the late 1970s and 1980s and vessels were abandoned. The <i>Bardini Reefer,</i><Col N="42" /> which was deliberately scuttled between Bere Island and Castletownbere, is still in Bantry Bay. It is an eyesore and a nuisance and is a danger to fishermen, and there is still a possibility of diesel and oil pollution.</P>
    <P>One will never forget the famous <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> which anchored in Bantry Bay more than a decade ago near where the Minister recently opened a fish processing plant. Thankfully this massive ageing vessel sailed out into the bay and when it was in danger of sinking the few remaining sailors were airlifted, but it should never have been permitted to sail into Irish waters. It was condemned apparently in Scotland prior to its last voyage. It was an enormous iron ore tanker and when the sailors were eventually successfully rescued, it was left rudderless drifting on the open sea. The winds blew the tanker onto the Stags close to Union Hall, an important fishing port near Baltimore. It spilled its cargo of iron ore, damaging sea life and prominent herring beds in that area. If the vessel had not hit the Stags, the experts say it would have continued on to either the Waterford or Wexford coast. If it had landed elsewhere, it would have been disastrous.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, it caused pollution. The ore from it is now lying on the sea bed in west Cork. The vessel is still an impediment to fishermen because part of it is submerged. One could say this matter is not relevant to the Dumping at Sea Bill or dredging a harbour and bringing the silt out to sea. However, it demonstrates that until the 1996 Act, Ireland had no modern legislation to deal with such an event.</P>
    <P>In another incident, the infamous <i>Ranga </i>came ashore on the Dingle peninsula. It was allowed to rot there until storms eventually tore it apart. Pollution arises as a result of such incidents. Some of this is accidental and in some cases it is covered by insurance. However, other incidents, such as those involving the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> and the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> were acts of piracy because the vessels were not seaworthy and Ireland was left with the wrecks.</P>
    <P>Many vessels off the west coast often shelter in Bantry Bay and there was another famous incident involving the <i>Tribulus,</i> which was a huge oil tanker. Thankfully, the <i>Tribulus </i>was saved and although there was some oil pollution, it was contained by the Department and the council. However, if this huge oil carrier had run ashore or been destroyed, it could have had a devastating effect. Bantry Bay depends to a large extent on tourism as do the adjoining Kenmare Bay in County Kerry and Dunmanus and Roaring Water Bays. News of pollution at sea causes shock waves because there is an important multimillion pound mariculture industry in the area. Any incident involving oil or other pollution creates a sense of unease.</P>
    <P>There has been an oil terminal in Whiddy for many years and I recall two major spillages, including one in 1974 which took six months to clean up. I dread the consequences if something like that happened again given that there is a <Col N="43" /> major mussel farming industry and urchin and scallop farming. There are also natural scallop beds and herring. There is much inshore fishing of lobster, cray fish and other species. The impact would be phenomenal.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the important Act in 1996 and this Bill have ensured that the problem of pollution has been controlled and curtailed. One cannot legislate for major accidents at sea. They can happen, but it is important that legislation is in place to deal with such incidents. The Bill will copperfasten the existing legislation. It is a safeguard for coastal communities and harbour boards along our coastline.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has updated the definition of harbour authority to include port companies under the Harbour Acts, 1996 and 2000. This is crucial because, as a result of a thorough report carried out by KPMG, a number of ports, including my port of Bantry, have opted, with the sanction and goodwill of the Minister and Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, for corporatisation as opposed to staying as harbour boards. I am a member of the Bantry harbour board and although some people had reservations about the possible impact, the more I thought about it, the more I felt the decision was correct.</P>
    <P>It is important that the legislation recognises the impact port companies will have. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources recognises that authorities such as Bantry harbour board, Arklow and others will be stand alone corporate entities. They will not rest on the local councils or the Department. Obviously, they will be under the direct control of the Minister, but in the main they will run their own services. Such a development is welcome.</P>
    <P>In terms of dumping at sea, there was a port, which I will not identify for obvious reasons, where a licence was either not sought or refused. Tests were carried out on the material that was to be dredged and brought out to sea, but traces of mercury were found. It was felt that bringing the material out to sea could cause damage to other sea life and it was decided that it should be left <i>in situ</i> in the harbour or alternatively dredged and put on a landlocked site. This demonstrates the importance of this legislation. The Minister, the Department and the Government recognise the difficulties faced by harbour boards.</P>
    <P>Other issues arise in relation to dumping at sea such as the major worry of Sellafield. There are reports that nuclear waste is filtering into the Irish Sea. We are not certain what damage this will cause in the long term to the health of the public, our children and fish life in the Irish Sea. This aspect is of major concern. The Government is committed to dealing with this matter and I favour the closure of Sellafield. I hope this will come about, but any pollution caused by radioactive substances in the sea is of great concern to the community, particularly along the east coast.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Act prohibits the dumping of sewage <Col N="44" /> sludge in the marine environment. I have been a member of a local authority for almost 15 years and people along the coastline are concerned about pollution that may be caused by antiquated sewerage systems and the lack of treatment plants. In many cases, raw sewage is filtering into bays and causing pollution. I ask the Minister and the Department to ensure that proper treatment plants are built in all the towns along our coast, particularly where fishing, marine life and beaches are important. These are required under European regulations and they should be put in place sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>My council is attempting to find a central location for the disposal of sewage sludge from places such as Skibbereen, Clonakilty, Bantry, Schull and Castletownbere. This would also involve other counties because a central location with new treatment plants and sewerage systems would ensure that pollution at sea is controlled. This is a most important aspect and it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I hoped to deal with other aspects of it, but time constraints do not allow me to do so. I thank the Minister of State and my colleague, Senator Caffrey, for their important contributions. I hope the Bill will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and the content of the Bill. We are trying to enact worthwhile legislation to protect our lands and seas and this Bill is an integral part of preserving one of our finest natural resources. The legislation provides us with the opportunity to put in place a structure to streamline the management and utilisation of our marine resources. The Bill takes a comprehensive approach involving Dúchas in recognising and dealing with the archaeological heritage around our shores. The Department will work closely with Dúchas in seeking to preserve certain sectors within its responsibility.</P>
      <P>One has only to witness public concern about dumping waste at sea to realise the importance of this legislation. Debates are taking place around the country concerning waste management plans that have been drafted in different regions. There is a great amount of public awareness and anxiety about this matter. It is, therefore, important to recognise our responsibility in legislating for the dumping of waste at sea.</P>
      <P>The Bill extends our responsibilities in this regard right along the continental shelf and, thus, also extends the areas for which we will issue dumping licences. In so doing, the Bill establishes the area for which we will have responsibility and which we must manage well. Under the terms of the Bill, anyone applying for a licence to dispose of waste will have to issue a public notice in local newspapers in the relevant area. The public should know what is taking place and should have an opportunity to respond to such applications. In that way members of the public can voice their opinions and one expects that they will respond in a sensible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> It is the responsibility of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and local authorities to see that waste is disposed of in a properly planned manner in the best interests of the public. Strong concerns have been voiced about the disposal of radioactive waste and our close proximity to discharges from the Sellafield reprocessing plant. We have heard serious reports of toxic waste that has been returned to Sellafield which is now having great difficulty in disposing of it. Issues of public health are central to this matter.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that approximately 20 waste disposal licences were applied for in 1998, but it would be interesting to know exactly what they were for. I understand that some of them related to dredging which is very necessary. I also understand that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources will be working out a five-year plan for dredging activities. A new dredger has been purchased in County Mayo so we look forward to a planned dredging programme in our ports. It is important to have people who can undertake that work in a responsible way now that we are beginning to develop piers, harbours and larger ports.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should work in tandem with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. The Bill promotes the idea of disposing of sewage sludge as dry waste. A ban on such sludge has been in effect since December 1998 and it has been both timely and necessary. Our marine resources are vital for the sustainability of coastal communities and as a food source. It is recognised that while fish stocks have become depleted to some extent, the Atlantic Ocean is still regarded as one of the best fishing areas both for volume and quality.</P>
    <P>In recent months we have witnessed the tragic loss of trawlers and crew off the western seaboard. Domestic and foreign fishermen work those areas and they need to be protected. In addition, water quality needs to be maintained in order to conserve fish stocks.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey mentioned the west coast and the proposed pipeline from Pullathomas. We must recognise the importance of our shorelines and seas. This legislation, in tandem with the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996, will help to put a strong structure in place which in the long term will be of benefit to the fishing industry through promoting the sustainability of our marine stocks. We should accept this Bill as being in the interests of the public and the fishing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is very important. People sometimes regard the sea as being so large that anything can be dumped in it anywhere. However, coming from the port of Killybegs, I know that this is not the case. In addition, anyone who has been to the Mediterranean will be aware of the amount of pollution to which that region has been subjected over the last 15 or 20 years. It used to be a clear blue sea that one could swim in, but it is now a cloudy mass that rolls ashore. <Col N="46" /> It is polluted daily by a huge amount of sewage that pours into it. The situation is no different along our coastline because with the actual and predicted increase in population there will be an increase in sewage. I am not sure if this is dealt with in the Bill, but sewage should be disposed of further out to sea to avoid pollution of inshore fish and shellfish.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned that the Bill extends our territorial area to 200 miles and 350 miles in some areas. Does this include Rockall? If the area extends 200 miles, does it reach the Welsh coast or could it prevent Sellafield pouring radioactive waste into the Irish Sea? Coming from County Wexford, the Minister of State knows of the lies told every year by the British nuclear authorities claiming that no sewage or nuclear waste is discharged only to find that such waste is being dumped. I would welcome any measures which could prevent the disposal of such waste.</P>
      <P>This may be contained in sections of the existing Act, but it will be difficult to enforce the measures in the Bill, particularly when it comes to dealing with foreign powers. However, there is a need for this Bill. I am also concerned about the dumping at sea of vast arsenals of out-of-date arms. Certain areas around Ireland have traditionally been used by the British to dump old mines, all kinds of arms and so on, some of which have been dredged by trawlers, no matter how deep they were lying. Others have been washed up on the shore. This problem might be tackled by this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Bill involves the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and that it takes account of archaeological areas around the coast. There were recent discoveries of cities off the coast of Egypt and north Africa which were submerged under silt for hundreds of years. I do not think we will find anything like that off the Irish coast but there may be wrecks, rock formations worth preserving and so on.</P>
      <P>An important measure in the Bill is that it prohibits the disposal of waste from ships within our waters. This is an important issue even if it does not seem so. What is the Minister of State's view on the fact that the Japanese market will only take fish over a certain size? Many of our trawlers dump thousands of tonnes of smaller fish before putting into port. Is this considered waste or is it a prosecutable offence under the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Licences are granted to all kinds of authorities &ndash; local authorities and so on &ndash; and may also be granted to fishing vessels and various other kinds of marine vessels. If so, the more we examine this issue the better. The sea is not just a vast area in which one can dump anything without producing adverse effects. Gradually, over the years, such effects emerge. One can see this in the quality of fish in some areas, perhaps not around the coast of Ireland. Some areas are polluted by fish farms, the effects of which can be seen immediately. One can also see the effects of pollution on fish further out to sea. These fish were traditionally <Col N="47" /> able to feed in our waters but are now feeding on rubbish and dirt.</P>
    <P>In general this Bill is to be welcomed but I hope the enforcement provisions are strong enough. I read the Bill briefly but did not see much in it. However, amending Bills such as this are underpinned by many existing Acts in which, I suppose, enforcement provisions are contained. However, I hope the measures are sufficiently strong.</P>
    <P>Many seafarers regard it as their right to dump whatever they wish at sea. This waste can be washed ashore even if the dumping takes place far out to sea. I recently visited the shoreline near Killybegs and the whole area was littered with waste from ships &ndash; plastic and flotsam and jetsam which had been washed ashore. This material was not produced locally but was dumped at sea and washed ashore by the tide. I hope the Bill will strengthen the Minister's hand in dealing with this kind of problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State who brings us good news whenever he comes to the House. This legislation amends existing good legislation and gives certain powers to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to protect our important and natural archaeological heritage. Some might think this Bill is a little over the top. However, work was carried out on the sea bed in Dingle and we thought it was a bit of a joke that Dúchas had to be brought in and that divers had to go down to see if there were artefacts and so on.</P>
      <P>This legislation is a little late for us because the history of Dingle tells us that in the 15th and 16th centuries there were old piers on the west side of the current pier. When the development of the harbour began eight or nine years ago these old piers, walls and, perhaps, artefacts were dredged and dumped at sea. I do not know what was there but if this legislation had been in place at that time it would have given people an opportunity to examine the area. It would not necessarily have delayed the development of the works for any great length of time but it would have given Dúchas time to document and preserve anything of value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the first section of the Bill which gives powers to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. From experience I can say what might have been the case if this legislation had been in place some years ago. My only concern about the Bill is that it slows down development on land and at sea because the same laws apply to archaeological or old ruins being knocked down on land. This slows down the operation as it involves a slow process. It may not be too slow where the job is being carried out on land and where if an old ruin is being knocked down all that has to be done is for people to watch and wait and document any old artefacts which are found. However, that seems an imposs<Col N="48" /> ible task in the case of a sea or harbour bed which has not been disturbed for a few hundred years and where there is much silt, sand and all kinds of rubbish. I am not against this legislation but I would like the Minister of State to examine ways of speeding up such surveys. I am being fiercely parochial on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>All the examples to which I can refer relate to matters with which I have been dealing and the honourable civil servant accompanying the Minister will know what I talking about. There was also new legislation on the disposal of fish offal from processing factories and this is not now allowed into the most modern sewage treatment plants. Oil contained in herring and other fish prevents the sewage treatment plants from operating properly. That left us back at square one, wanting to know what to do. In Dingle the solution involves laying a pipe from a central point to dispose of the fluid from fish waste, which is treated first in the fish processing plant. This is happening in Killybegs also. It only needs to be piped to a tidal part of a harbour and flushed out to sea with the tide in the normal way. There is really no great harm in it because, once it is out at sea, crabs and fish feed on it.</P>
      <P>That problem has arisen in Dingle and also in Killybegs in Donegal. I will not mention anybody by name, but the council is putting severe pressure on the processors in Dingle to get the job done. It has nearly got to the stage where the council must almost threaten these people with the law, but in the Dingle case the hold-up in putting down the pipe relates to an archaeological survey which Dúchas cannot undertake for three months. That is my only recommendation, that in the event that there are hold-ups in such works, the council involved would allow a little leeway. In the Dingle case, the council is not doing so and I am talking to the county manager about that. Although the processors have agreed to put down the pipe, the archaeological survey to which I refer forms part of this process.</P>
      <P>Over the years dumping at sea occurred in many areas, including along the east coast, and we knew nothing about it. In particular I am referring to the wrongful dumping by the British Government of ammunition and old explosives, etc., off our coast. This practice was wrong and I have said so on many occasions.</P>
      <P>I proposed at the time of the Harbours Bill, 1995, that no ship carrying nuclear waste should be allowed use Irish harbours and that is something I am proud to have achieved in this Chamber. Deputy Gilmore, then Minister of State, accepted the amendment, although he applied the departmental wording to it. Therefore it is written that all our ports are protected in that nuclear waste and other such substances cannot be transported through them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish waters extend for 12 miles. On the east coast, Irish waters extend further than this 12 <Col N="49" /> mile limit to the middle of the channel. I would like to see the Minister of State declare a nuclear-free zone in these Irish waters. He would be covered by the legislation introduced by his predecessor, Deputy Gilmore, in that there are certain radioactive materials, such as those related to X-ray and some other areas, which must be allowed into the country. Those materials do not worry me in any way. What worries me is Sellafield and the problems which it creates for us.</P>
    <P>I was advised by a person who knew what he was talking about. If the Minister imposed a nuclear-free zone extending to the 12 mile limit and on the east coast to the centre of the channel, we could then take the British Government to the European court for polluting our waters and breaking our laws. Even if my adviser is wrong, I would still like to pursue it because the Minister of State, judging from where he lives, and everybody in the Seanad would welcome such a declaration. The world would applaud such legislation to declare a nuclear-free zone.</P>
    <P>A few years ago everybody laughed at a former Taoiseach when he declared the west coast a sanctuary for whales and dolphins. I have read about it since and watched programmes about it on the National Geographic Channel. People thought it meant nothing and wondered what was so important about whales and dolphins. However, it is now recognised throughout the world as one of the few whale and dolphin sanctuaries.</P>
    <P>That has nothing to do with the Bill but my point is that we should extend the nuclear-free zone, which exists already in our harbours and ports, to the 12 mile limit. If we did so, people throughout the world would congratulate us. It would protect the environment and, although the Minister's official may say it cannot be done, I would say that nothing is impossible and it is only that it would be difficult.</P>
    <P>I welcome this amending legislation. I did not refer to pollution from oil tankers, etc., and other waste matter which has been dumped at sea. We must be more vigilant. Although I have no proof, the level of waste floating around at sea leads me to believe that rubbish is being dumped by quite a number of vessels. That places more pressure on the Naval Service to be vigilant also.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time with me. The Bill is very welcome and I have no argument with the changes. The extension of the range of Ministers who must be consulted to include the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is correct and any movement in the direction of transparency is to be welcomed greatly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, since the original legislation was enacted in 1996, a new view of the world has developed and the concept of sustainable development has become part of the philosophy of successive Governments. While, therefore, I sympathise with the practical concerns of Senator <Col N="50" /> Tom Fitzgerald in Dingle, for obvious reasons and because of my well advertised affection for the area, I must say that this legislation does not address a fundamental issue.</P>
    <P>We have built this planet on the assumption that dilution is a solution, which is a phrase I use when talking to my students about the environment. We spent a long time believing that simply by putting noxious gases far enough into the atmosphere, dilution would solve the problem. We believed we could deal with our sewage by dilution. We are accepting now that neither of those works. This is equally true for the oceans, which are not infinite.</P>
    <P>Nobody would have believed 25 or 40 years ago it was possible the world could run out of marine fish stocks because we thought there was such a huge expanse of ocean. We now face the situation that we will run out of fish. The same is true of the assimilative capacity of the ocean, which is not infinite. That is the first fundamental issue. The principle of using the sea as a dump for anything cannot be maintained indefinitely and we must find a different way to deal with our waste.</P>
    <P>The second issue concerning the deliberations about the prohibition of toxic dumping is that the question of what is toxic is far from closed. There are 80,000 chemicals in use in the world today, of which less than 500 have been properly tested for their toxicity. Therefore, there are 79,500 untested chemicals in the world, most of which are synthetic chemicals the planet did not have in its portfolio until recently.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot find an expert in the world who can tell him those 79,500 chemicals are not toxic. All the experts can tell him is that we have not proved they are toxic yet, which is a huge difference. I heard an eminent German scientist say 15 years ago that 25% of the list of dangerous chemicals in Germany were carcinogenic, that is, they caused cancer. He expected that within the next five years another 25% would be proven to be carcinogenic, but he had no idea which of them would be.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the welcome decision to ban the dumping of toxic material can be interpreted in as many different ways as one wants. Ultimately, it means we will ban the dumping of things we know to be toxic. However, we have no idea what harm will be done by the huge populations of western Europe, North America and the increasingly affluent regions of China and South America operating together, even if they operate with the level of scrupulous care with which successive Irish Governments have operated. By the time we know what harm they will do, it might be too late to do anything about it. Therefore, the ultimate long-term objective must be an international decision to end dumping in the sea.</P>
    <P>The basic philosophy that everyone articulates nowadays about waste generally is that one owns one's own waste and one deals with it oneself &ndash; one cannot make it someone else's problem or hand it over to someone else. Ultimately, everyone will have to accept that the waste they gener<Col N="51" /> ate is part of the price they pay for whatever they do and they must dispose of it in a way where the only threat is to those who benefit from the development. This is not the current philosophy and it is very difficult to see it happening in the short term. However, in the longer term we will need to have a global convention, enforceable universally, banning dumping at sea because we do not know the effects of it.</P>
    <P>Currently, we cannot do anything about matters more than 350 miles from our coastline. That leaves a huge expanse of unregulated ocean inviting unregulated dumping. I know many countries are very conscientious and try to prevent this. However, we do not know what is being done, particularly in less developed countries and countries such as China, which do not have an open functioning democracy where one can know what is going on. By the time we know what is being done, it may be too late. Whole areas of the former Soviet Union are environmental wastelands and resemble places in some of the more horrific futuristic novels. We do not know what is happening in places such as the Barents Sea, where they may have dumped hundreds of defunct nuclear reactors.</P>
    <P>The Bill and the principles contained in it are welcome. However, the long-term solution and objective, in terms of sustainability, in the best sense of that word, must be a decision that no dumping will be permitted in the future in any of our oceans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan is quite right about the problem of dumping. This Bill really just tidies up some things and makes others more explicit. It requires clarity, in terms of advertising in the local community, which is a very good idea because it means the people most directly affected by the possibility of commercial dumping will get an opportunity to have their voices heard. That is part of our democratic system and is welcome.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in the list of Ministers is also a good idea. The <i>Lusitania</i> wreck is only one example of the many opportunities for people to dive further, with increased technology, and recover objects. There are substantial wrecks which contain artefacts which may be of world cultural interest and may be looted by the 21st century equivalent of grave robbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> However, the principal issue is pollution. None of us is under the illusion that this will stop pollution. We can rehearse measures about non-dumping solutions, banning incineration at sea and banning the dumping of radioactive waste, yet the worst source of radioactive dumping in Europe is across the Irish Sea in Sellafield. Senator Ryan is right about the Russian situation. The tragic sinking of the submarine was the first one we heard about, but there is a lot more we do not know about. There is a lot of these submarines decaying on the ocean bed and they are time bombs.</P>
    <P>All of these matters affect fish stocks. Senators Fitzgerald and Ryan were right to sound a warning note in this regard. European countries that have successfully fished out their own stocks by lamentably bad management now have their eyes on Ireland. Unfortunately, for political reasons, we have left the door wide open for them. They are even going to places such as Gambia. When I was abroad recently I listened to a programme in which an appalling scenario was depicted, where people in Gambia, who have lived decently, simply and in a traditional manner from harvesting fish, now have factory fishing trawlers operating there. Large trawlers with no lights are crashing into their path and destroying them. Entire villages are being wiped out.</P>
    <P>In addition, Shell Oil wanted to sink damaged oil rigs. Greenpeace exaggerated the extent of that, which is a pity because it damaged its credibility. However, there was the potential for very serious damage in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is a problem that I am sure Senator Fitzgerald is well aware of, the flushing of tanks by large ships just outside our waters, or even inside the waters, which creates pollution. I am not sure if this is covered. Obviously people do not apply for a licence to flush their tanks or to spill sewage or whatever it is they do. We need some way of monitoring and being able to punish these people because it is unacceptable that large commercial concerns should be allowed to flush their tanks to the disadvantage of people like ourselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>We condemn the Government on its approach. There is a touch of Pontius Pilate in the Government's approach to the major and continuing difficulties with traffic congestion, not only in Dublin but in practically every town and village. The most annoying feature is the number of reports followed by strategy plans regarding traffic in Dublin. They could be the making of a small Brazilian forest. The new strategy plan promises a travelling Utopia which I forecast will never be delivered because it is impossible. Even our youngest citizens will probably be entitled to free travel before the master plans clicks into place.</P>
      <P>I am perturbed that I am addressing these words to the Minister of State, who is not the architect. The two Ministers involved, namely the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, are out of touch with the realities of life on the ground. One of the reasons is that public representatives, the humble counsellors, those who know what is happening on the ground and who are in touch daily with those who experience the difficulties, no longer have a committee. It was disbanded. People were asked to come back again but there has never been a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the steering committee I had the honour of representing local authorities on the Dublin Transportation Initiative. That was a misnomer because I have not seen any real initiative in eight years, having been first appointed in 1992. I am sorry to say that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, axed public representatives, possibly because he did not like what they were saying. The role of public representatives is to do the best for those they represent. To be charitable about it, what we have is a complete and utter mess. This started eight and a half years ago when I was a member of the DTO. I was party to the interim report, the final report and all the other reports it produced. There was never a shortage of reports &ndash; just a complete shortage on implementation. Eight and a half years later there are some groundworks for the Luas line to <Col N="54" /> Tallaght, but I cannot predict when the first tram will travel in that area.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the most ridiculous issue, the park and ride facilities in many of the outer urban areas that could be renamed &ldquo;park and joy ride&rdquo; because no secure parking facilities are provided. I have not heard of any sites being designated, although I have heard mention of sites which might be designated. For example, the Red Cow interchange would be an important stop-off point for people coming up the Naas Road, but we do not have the land there for it. The whole situation is an absurdity. How can one expect people to access a Luas system if they do not have a place to park their cars? Nobody can disagree with me on that issue.</P>
    <P>As a member of the DTO I visited two other cities of comparable size that had light rail systems. In each case major park and ride facilities were provided at each end of the line and smaller facilities at the interim stops as part of the whole system. Nobody tried to acquire the land at a later stage; it was an integrated package.</P>
    <P>In my area of Clondalkin we have access to the Arrow service only if one walks or uses a bicycle, and somebody takes care of it, because the parking area at the railway station has not changed from the time the main Cork-Dublin line was built about 1850. We have a Victorian amenity. Nobody can leave their car there. Thousands of people would be delighted to hop onto the Arrow but what is the point? There is no room to leave one's car and if one happens to get one of the four parking spaces, there is no guarantee that the car will be there on one's return or that it will not be clamped or burnt.</P>
    <P>The entire system is ridiculous. I am annoyed about it because everybody started out with high hopes that we would deliver a package that would work for the people. I am particularly perturbed about the long-term nature of the strategy and the possibility that it will change yet again. Under the original strategy, a second or spur line was to go from the Red Cow to Clondalkin. That has been axed and what we are to get is, believe it or not, Le Metro. This metro is a line on the map but there is no acquisition of land and no in-depth studies. It is the long-term fatuity of the strategy that is so annoying.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of how the transport services have declined. I am from Dublin and when I was a child one could get on the train at Ballyfermot &ndash; the railway station was in the CIE works &ndash; and not get off again until one got to Bray. That cannot be done now. We could go under the park and on to the Amiens Street line. The deterioration of the transport system would drive one to despair. It is a reminder of how bad things are now to realise that what could be done 40 years ago cannot be done now.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to integrated ticketing. I do not think there is such an animal. We have had repeated promises of integrated ticketing which, obviously, is a good idea and would save passengers a great deal of time, annoyance and running <Col N="55" /> to shops for tickets. However, the integrated ticketing as described by the DTO has not yet arrived.</P>
    <P>Reference should be made to the concept of making journeys quicker. The side doors of the buses are still kept closed. If I remember correctly, the reason is that the Labour Court made a ruling that the driver could make the decision as to whether the side door should be opened or closed on the basis of safety considerations. Why has this not been reviewed? If I were a bus driver, I would be equally concerned about my safety, but we have a ridiculous system whereby we build buses with doors that are not used. This is just another practical issue that could be tackled.</P>
    <P>Any normal citizen would be delighted with a quality bus service. Even the term &ldquo;quality bus&rdquo; sounds wonderful. As far as I can see, however, the only people who have derived benefit from the quality bus so far are the &ldquo;quality&rdquo; or the people living in Dublin 4, Donnybrook and along that route. They have an accessible and realistic quality bus. Where I live there is a bit of a bus lane followed by no bus lane, another portion of bus lane and then none.</P>
    <P>It is even more annoying to drive out from town along Kevin Street. There is a small sign pointing out that the bus lane is not yet operational. It is so small most people cannot see it. As a result there is an exceedingly long queue of traffic even though people can legally drive in the bus lane. That situation has not changed over the past three months. The sign has not been increased in size and people only discover they can use the lane by accident. That is pathetic. I do not know why the lane is not being used and the Minister might not know either. Either it is or it is not a bus lane and it should be removed if it is not available for use. The motorist is faced with Hobson's choice. People have no wish to clog up their city and they are fed up being taxed and clamped. They would be happy to use a viable alternative but it is not available.</P>
    <P>Cycle lanes are most welcome. Even at my advanced age I would use the bicycle in my area, but I cannot because our cycle lanes are full of travellers' caravans and trucks. Having checked with several authorities, nobody appears to have the power to remove them. How can we be asked to use our bicycles on the main road, with the danger of getting killed, when for more than 200 yards at one location and at various other places in Clondalkin the cycle lane is blocked?</P>
    <P>The taxi problem is like a long playing record. Everybody is aware of the rights of taxi drivers, but nobody is aware of their obligations. The four local authorities in Dublin worked together hard and long to arrive at realistic proposals but were then stymied by the Taoiseach's taxi forum, a red herring if ever there was one. We are approaching the festive season again, but it will not be festive for people depending on taxis to get home.</P>
    <P>Rail safety is another issue. There is still no voice-over on the DART and the visually <Col N="56" /> impaired are still obliged to count the stops. What a service. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, are presiding over a dangerous and explosive situation in Dublin. It is, in the words of Seán O Casey, a &ldquo;state of chassis&rdquo;. Grandiose, pie in the sky, long-term schemes will bring no relief. I urge the Minister to reassess the situation before the city explodes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and welcome the opportunity to speak on this topical issue. Unfortunately, one of the reasons it is topical is the tragic events that have occurred late at night in the city involving young people who are unable to get public transport. I am not apportioning blame to anybody for what happened.</P>
      <P>I have two daughters who use public transport all the time. They come into town for their nights out and so forth. My husband and I bought them mobile phones so they would always have a link to home. We could not tolerate the worry of their being in town, trying to get to a public telephone and not knowing when they would arrive home. It is a problem experienced by every family, not being able to let one's children out at night without worrying about them getting home safely or at all. They are dependent on taxis and the nitelink service.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;nitelink service&rdquo; is an oxymoron. The bus runs on the hour. One can only get the bus in town, from where it departs for selected areas. It is dirty and unsafe, according to my girls, and I do not envy the bus drivers who operate the service. It only operates on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. Perhaps Dublin Bus does not realise that Sundays are big nights out as well. Nothing has been done with bus schedules to acknowledge that Sunday is the second busiest retail trade day in Dublin. We still have the old Sunday service that existed when we used it to visit our grandparents across the city, and that was nearly 40 years ago.</P>
      <P>There are short-term problems that can be dealt with in the system. Of course there must be a long-term strategy as well. I would be delighted if there were a metro and if Dublin had the public transport systems that exist in every other major city in Europe. A friend of mine who has just returned from New York told me today that one hardly sees a private car on the roads in New York city because of the excellent public transport system. That city has a population of 12 million people. Why can we not manage such a system here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of the position with bus services has to do with competition. The sooner private operators are allowed to operate various routes throughout the city, the better. Services are being provided in a very stingy manner at present. The bus that goes to the airport had to weave its way round the legislation in order to obtain a licence. That is daft in this day and age. We are currently looking for short-term solutions because of the <Col N="57" /> horrendous traffic congestion. If there is a shower of rain in Dublin everything stops. I know someone who took two hours to get home to Bray on a Friday evening just because it happened to be raining. This is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>We must consider the points highlighted in the motion, such as integrated ticketing. This is a total joke. A student can get a monthly ticket to use on the DART and buses. That is fine, but ten journey tickets do not exist any more. There is the &ldquo;2 easy&rdquo; ticketing service which is useless and cannot be used on the various services. If one gets a ticket for the DART, one can use one of the feeder buses. If one arrives at Dún Laoghaire or Blackrock DART station one can get the feeder from there. However, if one gets one of the other buses from Dún Laoghaire one must pay the fare. That is crazy and off-putting for people.</P>
    <P>An integrated ticketing system is 20 years behind, not just nine years behind. Every other transport authority in the major cities in Europe has this system, so why cannot Ireland have it? There is just one shop in Dún Laoghaire where one can buy these tickets, therefore, there is no worthwhile service available.</P>
    <P>I do not think the public transport authorities realise that what people want is a reliable service whereby they can get from A to B and know, within a reasonable time, when they will arrive at their destination. It seems extraordinary to have the time the bus leaves the depot on the timetable at the bus stop. Perhaps the traffic causes some difficulty, but would it not be better to try to keep to a regular time where one would have some inkling that a bus was arriving at a certain time?</P>
    <P>In relation to quality bus corridors, the one with which I am most familiar is the Stillorgan QBC. The 46A bus is the only one that uses that corridor regularly. Other buses use it only during rush hour. There is no feeder service to the QBC, therefore, how does one get to that service? The park and ride facility is a total joke. There is talk of extending the QBC towards Bray. There are no facilities in place for that service, including no park and ride facility. The car park at Foxrock Church which was being used by commuters is now closed during the day.</P>
    <P>There may have been long-term planning but it seems to me that the issue was not thought through. I sometimes wonder if those who plan the system ever use it. I am forced into using my car much more than I would wish. My children and their friends are dependent on public transport and they find it is utterly unreliable. Given that there are simple solutions, why do we not use them? Why are consumers not asked what they want because they are the people who are in the front-line, having to stand in the rain and put up with the traffic congestion and long delays to get to their place of study or work?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" />&ldquo;, welcomes the recently published DTI strategy update &lsquo;A Platform for Change' which provides a comprehensive, updated framework for responding to the immediate transport requirements and for long term planning of transport network development and also:</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that the National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for investment of £1.6 billion in public transport and traffic management in Dublin in the plan period, including provision of £200 million in respect of traffic management grants;</P>
    <P>&ndash;supports the ongoing implementation of the Dublin Transportation Office short-term action plan, designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures consistent with the DTI strategy which can be completed by end 2000;</P>
    <P>&ndash;supports the Government's commitment to provide a light rail system for Dublin, with the city section underground, and notes that work has already commenced in the Tallaght-Abbey Street and Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green lines;</P>
    <P>&ndash;supports the Government's approval of the development of a metro in Dublin on a public-private partnership basis;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the acquisition of additional DART rolling stock with delivery of 26 new carriages already in 2000, and the construction of new DART and suburban rail stations, including the commencement of services to Greystones and Malahide;</P>
    <P>&ndash;welcomes the continuing progress in upgrading the Maynooth-Clonsilla suburban rail line which is scheduled for completion by end 2000, notes that 20 railcars for use on the line have been delivered and that a further 60 have been ordered;</P>
    <P>&ndash;supports the Government's commitment to provide key additional road infrastructure for Dublin &ndash; in particular, the southern cross and south-eastern motorways to complete the Dublin C-ring, the provision of a second Liffey valley bridge on the M50 construction of the Dublin port tunnel which is due to commence in several months time, and the decision to proceed with the planning and design of the eastern bypass;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the Government's commitment to fund road schemes associated with traffic management measures such as the Coombe bypass, and North King Street;</P>
    <P>&ndash;endorses the policy of promoting better use of road space in Dublin through implementation of a range of traffic management measures and intensified enforcement of traffic regulations;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" />&ndash;notes the Government's provision of over £25 million in 2000 to the Dublin Transportation Office in respect of traffic management grants to the local authorities in the greater Dublin area;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the issuing of guidelines to local authorities by the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the developing of park and ride facilities and the provision of funding for these facilities through the Dublin Transportation Office;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the purchase, by end 2000, of 225 new buses by Dublin Bus at a cost of £48.8 million;</P>
    <P>&ndash;welcomes the implementation of the auality bus corridor programme which is proceeding as quickly as possible consistent with the need for adequate public consultation and compliance with relevant tendering and contract procedures, and notes that four quality bus corridors have been opened to date (Lucan, Malahide Road, Stillorgan and Finglas), that a further four will be completed by end 2000 and that four more will be substantially completed by mid-2001;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes the substantial increase in buses scheduled on quality bus corridors;</P>
    <P>&ndash;welcomes the extension of the strategic cycle network to 280km track by end 2000;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes that the committee established to recommend the preferred way forward in terms of introducing an integrated ticketing system is due to issue its final report shortly; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;welcomes the Government's proposals to provide for an increase of some 3,100 taxi plates in the Dublin taximeter area, subject to the outcome of the present court proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I note that the motion condemns the Government for failure to take practical short-term action and then almost incredibly suggests a ban on the publication of a long-term strategy. I do not believe that those who welcome the initiatives taken by the Government and are looking for further initiatives to be implemented would welcome such a policy of inactivity. Senator Ridge mentioned that Ministers are out of touch. I suggest the Opposition is totally out of touch if it is unaware of the many initiatives taken by the Government in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to point out that there is no quick fix for the transportation system in Dublin or throughout the country. An integrated, comprehensive and multi-agency approach has been the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Government in this matter. There are many reasons for this, <Col N="60" /> including the rapid growth in the economy in recent years which has given rise to a significant increase in the numbers of heavy goods vehicles and other motor vehicles being registered, and that figure is increasing monthly. Traffic through Dublin Airport has doubled during the 1990s and there has been an unprecedented level of activity at Dublin Port in recent years. All of this is systematic of the very significant growth in the economy, which is welcome. However, one of the down sides of this is the traffic congestion which has ensued as a consequence.</P>
      <P>There are other reasons for this problem, including the failure to invest, particularly during the 1980s. When other European economies were developing, there was no investment in transport in this country. During 1982-87, the national debt increased from £12 billion to £24 billion. I am sure Senator Ridge will agree with me that Garret FitzGerald has a lot to answer for because of his failure during that era.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>He was ably assisted at the time by being weighed down by Dick Spring and other elements of the Labour Party who were looking for investment in areas which were non-productive. Unfortunately, the Government is now in a position where it must meet this challenge and try to redress the inactivity of that particular era. If only 10% of the increase of £12 billion in the national debt during that era had been invested in this area, we would have nothing like the current difficulties.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Opposition Members that if one studies the initiatives taken by the Government in recent years, one cannot but be impressed by the level of activity in tackling this problem. The amendment seeks to delete all the words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following, &ldquo;welcomes the recently published DTI Strategy Update &lsquo;A Platform for Change' which provides a comprehensive, updated framework for responding to the immediate transport requirements and for long term planning of transport network development&rdquo;. I will come back to the DTI Strategy Update later. The amendment notes that the national development plan provides for significant investment of £1.6 billion in public transport and traffic management in Dublin in the plan period, including provision of £200 million in respect of traffic management grants. This is very significant investment in tackling this area in which there has been a dearth of investment in the past.</P>
      <P>The amendment also supports</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the ongoing implementation of the Dublin Transportation Office Short Term Action Plan, designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures consistent with the DTI Strategy which can be completed by the end of 2000 . . . supports the Government's commitment to provide a light rail system for Dublin, with the city section underground, and notes <Col N="61" /> that work has already commenced in the Tallaght-Abbey Street and Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green lines . . .  supports the Government's approval of the development of a Metro in Dublin on a Public Private Partnership basis . . .  notes the acquisition of additional DART rolling stock with delivery of 26 new carriages already in 2000, and the construction of new DART and suburban rail stations, including the commencement of services to Greystones and Malahide.</P>
    <P>I listened to a radio programme recently on which many people in Malahide welcomed the initiation of that service. Initiatives are being taken, which the public has welcomed, and they are evidence of the Government's commitment and determination to tackle the shortcomings in this area.</P>
    <P>The amendment continues: &ldquo;welcomes the continuing progress in upgrading the Maynooth-Clonsilla suburban rail line which is scheduled for completion by end 2000 and notes that 20 railcars for use on the line have been delivered and that a further 60 have been ordered; supports the Government's commitment to provide key additional road infrastructure for Dublin &ndash; in particular, the Southern Cross and South-Eastern Motorways to complete the Dublin C-Ring, the provision of a second Liffey Valley bridge on the M50 construction of the Dublin Port Tunnel which is due to commence in several months time, and the decision to proceed with the planning and design of the Eastern By-Pass&rdquo;, which has been left in abeyance for many years by successive Governments. A decision has been made in that regard.</P>
    <P>The amendment further states: &ldquo;notes the Government's commitment to fund road schemes associated with traffic management measures such as the Coombe By-Pass and North King Street; endorses the policy of promoting better use of road space in Dublin through implementation of a range of traffic management measures and intensified enforcement of traffic regulations; notes the Government's provision of over £25 million in 2000 to the Dublin Transportation Office in respect of traffic management grants to the local authorities in the Greater Dublin Area; notes the issuing of guidelines to local authorities by the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the developing of park and ride facilities and the provision of funding for these facilities through the Dublin Transportation Office.&rdquo; The Government is using every means to try to ensure that as soon as possible it will be able to issue guidelines for the approval of commercial park and ride facilities but European Union approval is also needed.</P>
    <P>The amendment continues: &ldquo;notes the purchase, by end 2000, of 225 new buses by Dublin Bus at a cost of £48.8 million; welcomes the implementation of the quality bus corridor programme which is proceeding as quickly as possible consistent with the need for adequate public consultation and compliance with relevant tendering and contract procedures, and notes that <Col N="62" /> four quality bus corridors have been opened to date &ndash; Lucan, Malahide Road, Stillorgan and Finglas &ndash; that a further four will be completed by end 2000 and that four more will be substantially completed by mid-2001; notes the substantial increase in buses scheduled on quality bus corridors; welcomes the extension of the strategic cycle network to 280 km track by end 2000; notes that the committee established to recommend the preferred way forward in terms of introducing an integrated ticketing system is due to issue its final report shortly; and welcomes the Government's proposals to provide for an increase of some 3,100 taxi plates in the Dublin taximeter area, subject to the outcome of the present court proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is evident from that list that significant and far-reaching initiatives are being taken by the Government, which will go a long way towards remedying the current problems. The DTO update strategy, which was published recently, contains many fine initiatives. It projects that by 2016 traffic in Dublin at peak hours will have increased by 72%, which is significant. That will require a radical transformation in the quality and quantity of public transport services.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the strategy include public transport, which will require a much expanded network; an integrated mesh or radial and orbital services and a substantial increase in passenger carrying capacity; an improved DART suburban rail network, including improved passenger carrying capacity on the existing network and development of more tracks on existing alignments; and new rail lines, including an underground interconnector linking Heuston Station with East Wall junction via Pearse Street station and the docklands.</P>
    <P>The initiatives in the rail network are overdue and need to be accelerated and improvements are needed in road infrastructure, traffic and demand management. A sum of £14 billion will be invested, half of which will be expended between now and 2006 and the remainder by 2016. Undoubtedly, the motion demonstrates a total lack of awareness of the tremendous initiatives and hard work undertaken by the Government and reflects 1980s thinking in Fine Gael rather than the new millennium.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 reads:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;plates&rdquo; in the last line of the motion to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;; and, moreover, that in the restructuring of Dublin Bus, a significant role be given to the Dublin local authorities and the Director of Traffic for Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who was a Member of the House in the 1980s I am intrigued that Senator Walsh, who was not here, seems to remember that time much better than I do. Fianna Fáil, which has been in <Col N="63" /> Government more than any other party over the past 60 years, has a great reluctance to confront issues until they hit us between the eyes. We do not plan and, therefore, we run into obstacle after obstacle.</P>
    <P>We seem to confuse planning with projecting. Planning means taking decisions to deal with anticipated issues before they become huge problems, and we are not good at that. There is an issue here about which everybody is aware. I left Leinster House last Wednesday at 6.40 p.m. endeavouring to drive to Donnybrook, but 20 minutes later I had travelled 100 yards. I cancelled that appointment and then headed for south Kildare to visit my mother and it took me two hours and ten minutes to travel the 40 miles. There is an immediate problem which requires short-term, not long-term, solutions.</P>
    <P>Let me suggest a few solutions. First, deliveries could be banned in Dublin city centre, similar to other civilised European cities, when there is traffic pressure. I suggest a ban between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. To allow deliveries during those times, as any economist will point out, is to provide a public subsidy to private enterprises. The large-scale disruption to traffic caused by such deliveries is a price other people pay. Should those who run businesses or the community at large pay for it?</P>
    <P>Second, the necessary resources could be provided to ensure that junctions, traffic lights etc. are observed. A recent letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> commented on the changes to the Road Traffic Acts which seem to allow at least two cars to go through traffic lights after they have turned red. Yellow boxes are decorative effects to improve the otherwise bleak appearance of our roads. They are never observed. No one has ever been prosecuted for non-observation of yellow boxes unless another offence had arisen. That means that ignoramuses block access etc. and it can only be dealt with through a large-scale increase in the resources available to enforce traffic management. Traffic cannot be eliminated through traffic management but one can make what is there work better. This is a problem not only in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The second traffic issue is the use of routes through the city by heavy goods vehicles that could use an alternative route. A by-law should be introduced stating that where an alternative route is available &ndash; for example, the M50 in the northern part of the city &ndash; heavy goods vehicles must use it and must not travel through the city centre unless they have business in the city. Such initiatives have been taken in many other cities in Europe. One will not observe delivery trucks or heavy goods vehicles travelling through these cities at rush hour.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting spectacle to leave Heuston Station most Wednesday mornings and to be confronted by two lanes of heavy goods vehicles heading for Dublin Port, which cause incredible mayhem and threaten to cause enormous damage to the health of Dublin citizens because of the <Col N="64" /> emissions they generate. A great deal could be done in the short term while a great deal should have been done up to now. Pusillanimous indecision resulted in nothing being done.</P>
    <P>We have been presented with wonderful multicolour plans, such as that published by the Minister for Public Enterprise. I am fascinated that on the map included with her plan it states &ldquo;metro stations are indicative only&rdquo;. The entire plan is indicative only because the rail lines that are already there are the only things guaranteed in the plan. The rest of it is an aspiration for Dublin, not a plan. I wish Dublin well. Every penny of the money to be spent is necessary, but it is not a solution to the immediate problem. The solution, or at least the alleviation of the problem, must be immediate. This means there must be buses on quality bus corridors. I will have no sympathy if I hear again that the trade unions in Bus Éireann or CIE are the cause of the problem. The first time I spoke at a Labour Party conference, in my first year as a member of the party, the first thing I had to do was tell the CIE group of unions that I would not do as they wished with regard to a motion. They did not want it passed because they did not like it. Trade unions are an important part of our society, but they do not run transport policy. It is not the role of social partnership to give transport unions a veto. Their interests are sacrosanct and I do not wish to deprive anybody of a livelihood or the right to earn an income. However, the fundamental issue of the quality of public policy is not an issue on which they should have a veto. I do not want anybody to suggest that either my party or anybody else is hiding behind them. That is not the way to go forward.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment is wonderful, but although it is meant to deal with immediate problems almost all of it relates to things that will happen in the indefinite future. Everything in it is worthwhile, but none of it will make much difference to the quality of life of citizens in Dublin. One would hope in any such process that the local authority involved would be part of the solution. I assumed the lesson would have been learned from the debacle of the transfer of Members of this House that if one does not involve everybody who will be affected by something, one ends up with problems that are worse than those one is attempting to solve. There has been a classic example of this in recent times.</P>
    <P>I wish to advert to an aspect which appears to be missing in these debates. The transport problem is not unique to Dublin. Only 40% of the population lives in Dublin; 60% of the population lives outside the greater Dublin area. By 2010, I estimate that the population of the greater Cork area will be approximately 400,000. Expenditure on the transport problem in Dublin over the next ten years will be approximately £10 billion. A considerable portion of this will be on public transport, including the metro, buses, etc. Every penny of that sum needs to be spent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise said in the House that under the national plan public trans<Col N="65" /> port in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick would be allocated £50 million. The idea appears to be to sit back, not learn from Dublin's chaos and wait until equivalent chaos arises in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. It will then be necessary to retrofit a proper public transport system when it is vastly more expensive to do so. The solution is to plan, build and implement a proper public transport system for each of the major urban areas now.</P>
    <P>I am not a provincial yokel seeking the same as Dublin, but I know that what has happened in Dublin will happen everywhere else. Ultimately, it will have to be solved and it will be up to five times more expensive to do so if we wait until later. It can be done now as part of an integrated plan. The resources to do it are available now.</P>
    <P>Regarding public private partnerships, my party's official line is that we do not approve of tolling, etc. I do not wish to make fun of the official line but my concern is that no performance criteria are built into such partnerships. If people wish to run a toll road, I would set the condition that they must guarantee that they will not cause a disruption to traffic. It is simple &ndash; the people on the West Link bridge can be told that they can charge a toll as long as they do not cause a delay of more than ten minutes. Once the delay goes above ten minutes, they must lift the barriers and allow traffic through.</P>
    <P>If these people want to make money, they must run it efficiently. They are supposed to be efficient but they should be told that if they cannot run it efficiently, they will not be allowed to run it. The aspect missing from our understanding of public private partnerships is a tangible, quantifiable measure of efficient performance. They are supposed to be good at that, but they are only good at creaming off effective monopolies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who have contributed to the debate so far and I wish to advert to a number of points that have been made. Senators Ryan, Ridge and Keogh asked why all these measures were not taken before now. I am amused when I hear that question because everybody thinks these problems should be solved now. It would be wonderful if that was the case, but the difficulty that existed until relatively recently was that our economic development was so far behind and there was a huge lack of money. One could talk about plans, but there was no money to implement them.</P>
      <P>We have tended to lose the run of ourselves over the past two or three years. Everybody appears to think that the type of economic performance over the past three or four years has existed since 1921. The answer to the question as to why measures were not taken is that money was not available at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ryan to some extent regarding his assertion that we do not plan. We did not plan in the past and this is the reason for <Col N="66" /> the current situation. The DTO's strategy from the mid-1990s and its projections are totally outdated now. Even if it had been possible to deliver everything it suggested in the mid-1990s, it would have been difficult to avoid most of the problems that currently exist. There is a need to plan. This was not done in the past and we are suffering now as a result.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity not to repeat the mistakes of the past. This is why I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the House on this particularly important issue. I am disappointed, but not surprised, at the terms of the Fine Gael motion. For some reason, they appear to think that the solution to Dublin's transport problem is to put our long-term transport planning on ice so that we can focus on short-term actions instead. This is precisely what was done in the past and what got us into the current situation.</P>
    <P>According to Fine Gael, we should bring down a magical shutter on our time horizons at a point called &ldquo;the short-term&rdquo; and we will have the solutions to all our problems. If it was that simple, one must wonder why Fine Gael did not manage to address the problems when they were in Government. Did they even realise there was a traffic problem in Dublin before Deputy John Bruton got stuck in traffic? Their answer then was Operation Freeflow, a worthy initiative in its own right. It copied many of the suggestions published a month previously by Fianna Fáil for short-term solutions at that particularly difficult period.</P>
    <P>However, it suffered from the same short-term frailties that are so evident in the motion before the House. I accept Senator Ryan's point that short-term measures are important. Some of the things he mentioned could be done with increased enforcement and a certain amount of co-operation. I have listened to the views expressed by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the city centre business organisations have produced many good documents and suggestions in relation to transport in Dublin and the various infrastructural needs that exist and which must be addressed urgently. They have lobbied strongly for them to be put in place and many of them are in the current plan or were in the previous plans.</P>
    <P>I was horrified, however, to see that in one of their documents they talked about the necessity of the Government delivering over £4 billion in infrastructural investment &ldquo;yesterday&rdquo;. Their contribution to all this was that in three years time they would consider ways and means of doing what Senator Ryan suggested, that is, convincing their members that there should be off-peak deliveries in their shops. They are very fine ideas and publications concerning the traffic problems in Dublin, but they could take a lead in that area and it might be helpful to all of us.</P>
    <P>In talking about the Fine Gael motion, I wish to mention the short-term progress that Fine Gael is advocating. It seems to think that short-term progress has to be at the expense of our longer and medium-term planning. Since when, <Col N="67" /> however, did our transport planning become split into two or three mutually exclusive time horizons? Such an approach could more accurately be termed short-sighted rather than short term. It is a fundamentally flawed approach to transport policy to talk in terms of freezing long-term planning and implementing short-term measures. If that is the best Fine Gael can come up with, it is just as well it is occupying the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>The Government's transport policy recognises the need to deliver in the short term but to do so against the background of a vision for where we are going in the medium and longer terms. Clearly, Fine Gael has no such vision and one certainly will not find it in the party's document entitled Getting Dublin Moving, which, rather than the White Paper it purports to be, is more like a piece of clingfilm, useful for holding many disjointed bits and pieces together but completely see-through. It is certainly nowhere near robust enough to provide a basis for catering for the projected 72% increase in the peak hour trip demand mentioned earlier by Senator Walsh, which will see close to half a million trips in the morning peak hour in 2016.</P>
    <P>The Government's long-term vision for transportation in Dublin has its roots in the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative published in 1995 and endorsed since then by successive Governments. While economic circumstances have changed radically since 1995, the basic principle of sustainable transport, which is at the core of the DTI, remains as valid today and perhaps even more so. Of course, the vision needs to take account of our much changed economic situation and we have addressed this through the major review of the DTI strategy which has now been completed.</P>
    <P>The DTO update document, which we published recently on foot of the review, has a number of key elements. These include a radical transformation in the quality and quantity of public transport services; strategic but limited improvements to the road network; improved traffic management and control measures; development of a demand management policy to reduce the growth in travel while maintaining economic progress and to encourage modal shifts in favour of public transport; and better integration of land use and transportation planning. The strategy also offers some preliminary advice, based on DTO experience since 1995, regarding future institutional arrangements for strategic land use and transportation planning and co-ordination in the greater Dublin area. That will be considered in the context of further related work which is being undertaken for submission to the Cabinet committee on infrastructure.</P>
    <P>While the strategy is obviously an integrated one, I would like to single out for special attention its proposals in relation to public transport, given the crucial role which it will play in meeting the travel demands of the future. The public <Col N="68" /> transport elements of the strategy aim to cater for approximately 300,000 trips in the morning peak hour through an integrated public transport network, compared to just 70,000 today. There are a number of key elements, including a much expanded bus network, comprising an integrated mesh of radial and orbital services and a substantial increase in passenger carrying capacity &ndash; that is a priority as part of the short-term measures to switch passengers to public transport; improvements to the DART-suburban rail network, including improved passenger carrying capacity on the existing network and the development of more tracks on existing alignments and new rail lines, including an underground interconnector linking Heuston Station with East Wall junction via Pearse Street and docklands; an extension of the Luas on-street light rail network; a higher capacity segregated light rail network or metro; and a package of measures designed to improve the integration and attractiveness of the public transport network, including park and ride facilities, integrated fares and ticketing, quality interchange facilities and improved passenger information.</P>
    <P>The total estimated capital cost of the strategy is £14.2 billion. Its implementation is expected to result in a high quality public transport service being available to most people within ten minutes walking distance of where they live; increase the share of the market accounted for by public transport from 35% to 65%; reduce congestion; improve accessibility; and result in significant environmental gains, including reductions in energy use and emissions. Obviously, that also would have a beneficial effect on the citizens of Dublin and surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>My aim is to emphasise that the Government is conscious of the need to plan ahead for the short, medium and long terms. That does not mean that everything is to be done in the future, however. Many steps and actions have been taken or are in the pipeline, guided by the DTO's short-term action plan published in 1998 and the Dublin transportation blueprint published last year.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to put these achievements on the record of the House, looking first at the bus service. The fleet has been significantly increased. In 1997, the year we came to office, it stood at just over 900. By the end of this year it will have increased to 1,100. As well as these additional buses, a significant bus replacement is also under way. The quality bus corridors are coming on stream, four are operational, a fifth is expected to start up next month, the physical work on three others are expected to be finished by the end of the year and the remaining four are expected to be complete or substantially complete by mid-2001.</P>
    <P>In addition, a consultation document setting out proposals for a new regulatory regime for public transport has been published by my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. The rail service in Dublin has also been considerably improved since we came <Col N="69" /> into Government. The DART fleet has been increased from 80 to 106 carriages, initial services have commenced on the Greystones and Malahide extensions and a further 12 carriages are scheduled to come on-stream in 2002. Some 27 diesel railcars have been delivered and are in operation and 60 more have been ordered. The Maynooth line upgrade is on target for completion by the end of this year, with improved services commencing early next year. Some 20 railcars for use on the Maynooth line have been delivered.</P>
    <P>Major progress has been made on Luas which is adhering to the timetable laid down by Government. The Tallaght-Abbey Street line has started and is scheduled for completion at the end of 2002, with services commencing early in 2003. Preliminary clearance work has started on the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line, construction of which is to be completed in early 2003. The Lower Abbey Street to Store Street section of the Abbey Street to Connolly Station line has been approved and the inspector's report on the public inquiry into the Store Street to Connolly Station section is awaited. A consultancy group has been appointed to design and conduct a competition to select an operator for these lines and the operator is expected to be in place by autumn next year.</P>
    <P>While park and ride is an important element of the overall public transport strategy, its role seems to have escaped the previous Government's attention. It fell to this Government to introduce tax incentives to encourage park and ride facilities. We have also provided £2 million directed specifically at the Dublin area and we have made significant progress. By the end of this year, 2000 park and ride spaces will have been provided. Furthermore, the removal of benefit-in-kind from public transport passes provided by employers for their employees should encourage greater usage of public transport.</P>
    <P>There are a number of major roads projects which are critical to managing Dublin's transport. The southern cross section of the C-ring is well advanced and is expected to be completed early next year. In addition, the South Eastern Motorway, the last leg of the C-ring, is due to commence in early 2001, as is work on the Dublin port tunnel. Part of the Northern Motorway, linking the airport to the Balbriggan bypass, has already commenced and the second phase will get under way in 2001. These major improvements are vital for improved road capacity and they will substantially complete the major road network around the city area.</P>
    <P>We have also taken a number of short-term measures designed to reduce congestion. These include the construction of free-flow slips at the N4, N7 and Ballymount interchanges on the M50. In addition, access to Dublin airport will be improved as a result of a co-operative, cost sharing effort between the NRA and Aer Rianta involving the construction of free-flow slips at the airport roundabout which should be completed <Col N="70" /> shortly. Funding is also being provided for new roads associated with traffic management measures, including the Coombe by-pass and the North King Street project.</P>
    <P>Improved traffic management also has an important role to play. The Director of Traffic appointed for Dublin city has brought a greater concentration and efficiency to traffic administration and has implemented a strong enforcement policy. Progress is also being made on making the city more cyclist friendly. Some 140 kilometres of cycleways will be in place by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The taxi situation in Dublin also comes in for special reference in the Fine Gael motion. Once again it is a pity that their concern in relation to taxis did not manifest itself during their last term in Government when not one taxi licence was issued in Dublin. Instead they chose to let the situation drift and left it to this Government to pick up the pieces. That we did with courage. Since coming into office taxi numbers in Dublin have gone up by 750 and we announced last November that we were taking the radical step of issuing 3,100 additional taxi plates, more than doubling the existing fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators will know, High Court proceedings have been taken in relation to last November's decision and a range of provisions contained in the related regulations. Pending judgment in this <Col N="71" /> case, which I understand will be given next Friday, the court granted an interim injunction preventing Dublin Corporation from granting taxi licences. While the Fine Gael motion appears to call on me to defy the High Court and issue more licences, I am sure other Senators will understand that the Government must respect the court's order and await the outcome of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that this Government is committed to dealing with the traffic problem in Dublin. We have shown our commitment through the very substantial funding we have provided and by ensuring that we have in place a comprehensive transportation blueprint and a framework for future action. We have already shown our capacity to deliver on the major ingredients of our strategy and the Cabinet committee on infrastructure will continue to drive the process with a view to ensuring that there are no avoidable delays.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House represents nothing more than flawed, simplistic Fine Gael thinking on how to deal with the issues. While they claim to have all of the answers, their record in government shows nothing more than an abysmal failure to face up to their responsibilities to deal with the transport situation developing before their eyes.</P>
    <P>While Fine Gael talks a lot about Dublin's traffic problems, this Government is more concerned about taking action to improve the situation. The amendment to the motion sets out in very specific terms our record of significant progress on this issue and the framework we have in place for continuing that progress. Contrary to what has been said by a number of Senators, the measures we are taking and that I have outlined are not in the dim and distant future. Many of them are taking place currently. Many of them will be completed before the end of this year or before the end of next year.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to two points Senator Ryan made which are worthy of a brief response. The point he made about planning ahead now for places like Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Galway has been recognised by the Government. I have made money available for proper transport planning and transport management planning in the roads allocations that I made earlier this year. I intend to continue doing this in the years ahead because he is right, we should plan ahead.</P>
    <P>In relation to the PPPs, the Senator seems to be under a misapprehension that the private sector will only be asked to provide money for the PPPs, build and run, whether it is roads, water or sewerage, and that they will be left to their own devices. Central to the whole concept of the PPP and what will happen is that the private sector operator will have to meet criteria. In relation to water it will be the quality and quantity of water. In relation to roads it will be the level of service, maintenance etc. It is not simply a case of getting them in to build the road and paying them or <Col N="72" /> allowing them to earn money from tolls. They will be tied to performance contracts and it is most important that we do that.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chathaoirleach for the opportunity to address this motion. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion proposed by Senators Ridge and Keogh. I thought I was in a very good position following the Minister's speech because I had expected him to make a very positive response. I am extremely disappointed with his response to the motion. All he has done is indulge in a tirade on the proposals it contains. He made no constructive proposals whatsoever in relation to the immediate problem. He referred to Fine Gael as nothing but flawed and simplistic in their thinking in relation to transportation. At least Fine Gael are thinking. The Minister is just ranting on without presenting anything solid.</P>
      <P>The extensive amendment presented by his party to this House leaves much to be desired. Of the 17 points in the amendment, 15 deal with the situation in Dublin. One would think that the rest of the country did not exist. The reality is that there is an area outside Dublin and the greater Pale area and I hope that the Minister will take that into account. It was briefly referred to by Senator Ryan when he referred to Cork.</P>
      <P>The bottom line is that traffic congestion is not unique to Dublin. It is a national problem. Right across Ireland there is traffic congestion in practically every town and city, in Cork, Galway, Limerick, Sligo or any of the larger towns such as Tullamore, Kilkenny, Carlow, Wexford, Waterford and Ennis in County Clare.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Minister said that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in his last budget, introduced tax incentives for park and ride facilities. He took on board a Fine Gael proposal. Unfortunately, the Minister for the Environment and Local Govern<Col N="73" /> ment has not taken any concrete action on this issue to make these incentives work, to entice people to provide facilities and to encourage local authorities to put this plan into action.</P>
      <P>Every town is short on car parking facilities. There is a lack of car parking and total congestion as a result. Nothing positive has been done by the Government to encourage and enhance facilities. No less than a few days ago, and to add fuel to the fire in terms of the congestion in the Dublin area, the Minister for Finance decided to shelve his decentralisation programme and, in the process, force more than 10,000 public servants to remain in this congested city and to spend two to four hours in their cars going to and from work. They could have a better quality of life and a better way of life if they located to some of the rural towns. The Minister does not see this as being related to traffic congestion. If the Government took a positive approach on this issue, it could help to relieve traffic.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan made a number of proposals in relation to trucks delivering supplies to towns during peak periods. That is something which should be examined. He made a recommendation which may not be that acceptable to various organisations, but we must face reality. It is extremely important that hard decisions are taken. The Government has done nothing substantial. All it has done is compile report after report while matters are grinding to a halt.</P>
      <P>There is a huge fallout from traffic congestion, including a huge economic fallout. For instance, a young mother whose children are at school has to get up at all hours of the morning to take her children to a child minder who, in turn, takes them to school because if she takes them, it will take another hour or hour and a half to get to work. These are just some of the issues. This problem leads to a lot of stress and stress-related illnesses. In addition, because of the continuous congestion, there is a lot of pollution in the air caused by emissions from vehicles as they run their engines rather than motor along. This results in a lot of respiratory illnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure meet more regularly. The Minister should speak specifically to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, about the type of public transport system being put in place not just in Dublin but throughout the country. The train service to Cork, Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Drogheda and Dundalk is a disaster. Given the service provided, people are not encouraged to use the public rail service. The bus service from the capital to rural areas is a higgledy-piggledy operation. Buses sometimes run, other times they do not. There is no such thing as a three or a three and a half hour journey. A three hour journey could end up being a six or seven hour journey. This is totally unacceptable and it in no way encourages people to use public transport. The Cabinet sub-committee should examine this matter very closely, put forward immediate concrete proposals and provide an efficient service. That is <Col N="74" /> not happening currently. The situation is a disaster and it is time the Government recognised this.</P>

      <P>The motion was proposed and seconded by Senators Ridge and Keogh who referred exclusively to the traffic situation in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this important issue. I congratulate the Minister on the tremendous initiative he and his colleagues have taken. The future of transport in our capital city is an issue which has a bearing not only on the lives of the citizenry of 40% of the country, but on everybody who comes to the city from around the country and abroad, the number of which is ever-growing.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the motion, it is important to consider the inheritance this Government received in terms of strategic plans. We had a Luas plan which involved three separate free standing lines &ndash; one from Sandyford in the south, another from Tallaght in the west and a third from Ballymun in the north. That Government could not even see the small picture never mind the big picture. Luas was its Holy Grail and anybody who criticised it was deemed to be a wrecker and a negative thinker. The view abroad was that it was far more important to get the project completed even if it was wrong. Even the eloquence of their former leader in <i>The Irish Times</i> did not seem to change their determination to get the project completed.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on the far-sighted approach he is bringing to the problems of transport in Dublin. I have certain reservations about it which I will go into later, but the park and ride aspect of the transport plan, which seems to exercise the minds of Senators Ridge and Keogh to a great degree, was not thought up in the past year or two. Park and ride, as a concept, has been around for a considerable number of years and it is good to see it being addressed in a proper manner. It is a very complex operation to put in place but at least with a plan of this nature, there is an opportunity for it to be successfully put in place rather than as outlined in the short-term plans about which we are hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reservation concerns, not surprisingly, the plans for the northern side of the city. There is a proposal in the plan for a line to Dublin Airport and onwards to Swords, and that is to be commended. That in itself would have a huge effect <Col N="75" /> on the availability of taxis in the city. I would question why it stops at Swords. From Dundalk to Swords, along the railway line, there are thousands of people who work at Dublin Airport. At the moment the only means of access to their workplace is by road. Great improvements have been made to that road over recent years but a continuation of the loop on the proposed line from the airport to Swords to join with the Dublin-Belfast line around Malahide would be not only of huge benefit to the workers, but it would hugely alleviate the traffic problem from Dundalk and particularly Drogheda and the towns of north Fingal to the airport. Senator O'Dowd will be fully aware of the difficulties encountered daily. Given the amount of capital expenditure on this overall plan, it would be a very cheap and valuable addition if this loop was to be completed. It would alleviate huge problems on that side of the city.</P>
    <P>It would also create a significant knock-on benefit in that the number of travellers using Dublin Airport from Belfast and its environs has increased dramatically in recent years with the expanded range of services from the airport and also with the availability of cheaper air fares. These people invariably drive their cars to Dublin Airport and take up a carpark space for two or three weeks, thereby contributing to the current immense infrastructural problems at the airport. We are blessed with a very efficient train service between Belfast and Dublin, which is probably the most efficient in the country. The simple extension of the loop from Swords to the Dublin-Belfast line, somewhere around Malahide, would have a tremendously positive effect on the growth of passenger numbers from the North.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment further on the motion rather than the amendment. As we approach Christmas, wish lists will probably come into fashion and the motion is a quintessential wish list. The people of Dublin and, in deference to Senator Taylor-Quinn, the country generally are very exercised about the difficulties with the transport system. However, we have heard nothing but negativity and carping from the proposers of this motion. Senator Ryan made a couple of very positive points in relation to heavy goods vehicle routes and unloading periods for these vehicles in the city centre. Does the Opposition favour the plan in its entirety or, if not, what parts of the plan will it retain and what parts will it do away with it? People are entitled to those answers.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Leader was at his eloquent best when he recently referred to this plan as a mish-mash of previous plans. I suggest he knows it is the best and the only plan, but his only response was to deride the proposal. I will adapt something once said by a friend of mine, who was the rugby correspondent for the <i>Belfast Telegraph, </i>an unlikely source to be quoted by a Fianna Fáil Senator in this House, and apply it to Fine Gael <Col N="76" />&ndash; Fine Gael and its leaders are not bereft of any ideas on transport, they just do not have any.</P>

      <P>I am rather disappointed by the Government's response to the Fine Gael proposal, which seems very simple and does not require the enormous number of amendments tabled, although I am delighted to see some of them. It is important to take note of the words of a colleague of mine in Trinity College Dublin, Dr. Seán Barrett, an economist with a special interest in the transport sector. He said that the various plans the Government has for transport in this city and around the country were splendid but that we also need to look at the short-term situation. I feel that this Fine Gael motion concentrates on the difficult short-term problem.</P>
      <P>My husband and I must have been very far-sighted because when we lived in Killiney almost 20 years ago we decided that the traffic coming into Dublin was becoming too difficult. I had to leave at 7.30 a.m. to travel the nine miles to the Rotunda Hospital if I had a lecture at 9 a.m., which did not seem a very productive way to spend my time. I am delighted that all those years ago we decided to move into the city centre.</P>
      <P>I am something of an expert on Dublin traffic problems because I am one of the few Members who either walks or takes the bus to the House. I rarely use my car to get here because it would take at least as long, so it is no great virtue on my part to walk here. I usually take the bus back because one of the intriguing aspects of the No. 10 bus is that it takes about three miles to get to the city centre but the route home takes only about four stops. Dr. Barrett's concentration on the issue of buses in the city centre is important and needs to be paid more detailed attention than the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, gave it this evening.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the quality bus corridors are to be extended because they have made a huge difference, particularly on the Stillorgan Road and the route from Malahide, where Senator Glennon lives. They have been a great success. However, are the buses which have been ordered all the same size or do they include smaller buses which could be used at off peak periods, which would be more economic, both in terms of passenger numbers per litre of fuel used and the amount of pollution caused by the increase in traffic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A simple matter in the Fine Gael motion which I am sorry the Minister did not address is integrated ticketing. The Economic and Social Research Institute told me that one of the big transport problems in the city at present is that a very large number of people traverse the city centre rather than travel there to work. There is very little incentive for such people to buy one bus ticket for £1.10 for part of their journey and then buy another for 85p to complete their journey. I do not know why one cannot buy a ticket for £1 that would take one around the city for a con<Col N="77" /> siderable period of time and which would be of great benefit to us all. I had hoped Bus Éireann would have been instructed to take on board the integrated ticketing proposal immediately.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has been to various European cities where integrated ticketing has been the norm for decades. When I was in Bologna 20 years ago one could travel by bus for two hours for about 20p, which allowed the vast majority of people to get to their workplace, even if they had to change buses. It was an extraordinarily good system and I do not see how it could have been any more costly.</P>
    <P>If I were in charge I would make bus tickets much cheaper and try to get as many people as possible travelling by bus. While buses are quite crowded at rush hour, they are not as full as they should be for a considerable amount of the day.</P>
    <P>We never really thought about the problem of providing areas for people to park before getting on public transport. We should have been thinking about this when I was thinking about leaving Killiney. We will have to think about it very fast because people who live near DART stations are becoming increasingly angry about commuters parking in suburban streets. Areas should be found for park and ride facilities as rapidly as possible. I am never sure how much power Dublin Bus has when I make these suggestions. I wish it had more power because it is the one trying to run the system.</P>
    <P>I recently attended the launch of a website for car sharing &ndash; I think the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, was the only other Member of the Oireachtas there &ndash; by the Dublin Transport Initiative at the Dublin Chamber of Commerce in Nassau Street. I thought something might come of that and I was very disappointed to learn that only 47 people have clicked on the website to say they might become involved in car sharing. The one problem is that there is no incentive for people to car share, apart from the money they would save on petrol. I talked to people there about allowing such people use the bus corridors. I am sure the Minister has been in cities such as Singapore and New York where cars with four passengers are allowed use certain bus lanes. However, those involved in the transport initiative seemed very resistant to this because they said it would be a great pity to make any change to the bus corridors as they were working so well.</P>
    <P>The airport is a very problematic area. Have any Members used the blue airport bus? I could hardly believe that it travels from Leeson Street to the airport in about 25 minutes for £4. However, why does Dublin Bus not allow that bus use its bus stops? Buses run every 15 minutes. To improve the position, there should be a better spirit of co-operation with this private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Another bugbear I have, of which Dublin Corporation is in charge, concerns bus shelters. There is no bus shelter in Kildare Street although the footpath is sufficiently wide to accommodate one. In the area where I stand near the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, <Col N="78" /> unless one takes shelter in the arcade one is out in the open. I raised this matter previously but without effect. Why can a few bus shelters not be erected given that there is always a crowd of people standing there? The same applies in Merrion Street where there are no bus shelters. It is discouraging for people if they get very wet.</P>
    <P>The effect of pollution from cars should assume more importance. We are doing our best to improve the quality of air in the city and the NCT is helping to ensure vehicles are in good working order. Given the number of trucks and lorries on the roads there are continuous problems with air pollution and we are frequently in breach of EU regulations.</P>
    <P>I will not dwell on taxis. As I have not been able to get one for so long, it would be pointless for me to discuss the matter. I have always managed to walk home before I could hail a taxi, or the No. 10 bus passed me on the way. Recently I encouraged the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, by saying I thought the service had improved. I know the Minister has had problems but she said that was the best news she had for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the opportunity to debate the problem of traffic congestion. One would be foolish to say there is not a traffic problem not alone in Dublin but in all the major cities. One would think nothing was being done. At the same time if one travels the length and breadth of the country, north, south, east and west, one will see roadworks every inch of the way. Bypasses are being opened and major development works are taking place. Judging by the Fine Gael motion one would think nothing was being done anywhere.</P>
      <P>While it has been said that the motion concerns Dublin, Senator Taylor-Quinn said it concerned the rest of the country where no money is being spent. I draw her attention to the national development plan and, in particular, the region with which she is connected and which I am associated with as the representative on that body. I refer to one of her remarks about the lack of investment in other parts of the country. Under the national development plan a sum of £4.7 billion was allocated to the improvement and maintenance of national roads for the years 2000-06. Those works are in operation. Up to 2006 on the major inter-urban routes and the motorways a high dual carriage standard is being implemented. Grants of £1.5 million have been provided for traffic management in Limerick Corporation, Waterford Corporation, Galway Corporation and Cork Corporation. That is something in which the Senator's county is also involved. To say that nothing is being done is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Government on its determination to do something once and for all about the traffic problem in Dublin. For the past 70, 80 or 100 years nothing had been done. Dublin is the only city in Europe that does not have a metro <Col N="79" /> system in operation. The Government has announced a ten or 15 year plan, and it will plan properly. Whether it takes ten or 15 years to complete I welcome and support it. One cannot wave a magic wand and get all the work done overnight, neither can one get rid of the problem overnight.</P>
    <P>During the reign of the Fine Gael-Labour Government in 1983-87 at a time of high unemployment and high emigration, 80,000 to 100,000 people became illegal emigrants in England and elsewhere. People left the country in droves. A newspaper headline at the time of the election asked the last person leaving the country not to forget to turn off the lights. Now, due to good government and a vibrant economy people are being brought back from all over the world and, naturally, problems come with it. One such problem is the housing problem and there is also a traffic problem. Those problems are being tackled.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear the Minister say that not one taxi licence issued during the term of office of the last Fine Gael Government. I thought it had issued one or two licences. This Government has granted 3,000 taxi licences, but this is being contested in the High Court and a decision will be made on Friday. Yet Senators are critical of what is being done. They also say there are no short-term solutions. There are short-term solutions such as the quality bus corridors which are in operation and working well, an increased number of new buses are in operation, there are new taxi licences, new bus lanes and so on. Much is being done in the Dublin area to alleviate traffic congestion in the short term.</P>
    <P>The number of passengers who passed through Dublin Airport in 1991 was 5.5 million people. In 1999 almost 13 million passengers passed though that airport. That is an indication of the huge volume of traffic in a short time. The increase in car ownership is also due to the vibrant economy. A sum in the order of £14.2 billion, half the national debt, will be invested in a new metro and Luas system. I welcome that. A good transport system is the key to taking traffic off the roads. I am pleased the Government is taking this initiative. The completion of the M50 will be of major benefit to the city of Dublin. For me, coming from Kerry, the length of time it takes to get to the airport from the Red Cow roundabout is greatly reduced.</P>

I expect it will be an international airport in years to come and will be very important to us.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Government on what it is doing with the transportation system, not alone in the Dublin area but all over the country. There is a great buzz and great infrastructural work is taking place in the road network. I welcome particularly the Minister's announcement for the new metro system, the new Luas system and the extensions being provided. We cannot wave a magic wand. It was a pity Fine Gael, when in Government, did not put this programme into operation. Had it done so we would not have to wait until 2016, it would have been completed by 2010. Fianna Fáil always seems to be lobbied about problems and has to solve the problems put on our plate by other Governments. We have to clean up the mess, as we had to do in 1987 when the country was on the verge of bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I find difficulty with this amendment so I will probably vote with the Government on this issue. There are a number of reasons for that. The first is that the motion appears to be rather negative and shortsighted. It condemns the failure of the Government to take practical short-term action and, as a result, seems to be telling the Government not to do anything in the long term either.</P>
      <P>We must have long-term thinking. No amount of immediate difficulty should stop the Government having its eye on the target of making the transport system in Dublin fully operative. If this is what the Government is doing, and I believe it is making serious efforts in this regard, it should be supported. It was this House, at a time when it was extremely unpopular, which amended the Dublin transport Bill to require the examination of an underground option. The amendment was put down in my name in that glorious period when the Independent Senators held the balance of power.</P>
      <P>I well remember the opposition I encountered and the frantic telephone calls from Ministers and so forth who offered the earth, hypothetically, if I would withdraw the amendment. I also received abusive correspondence from some of my constituents. One man, a distinguished academic, wrote to say that unless I changed my mind immediately and announced the fact he would never again vote for me and would write to the newspapers to tell them I was responsible for the underground. In my reply I urged him to do that saying, &ldquo;I do not think you would have any respect for me if I just changed my vote simply because you were removing your support.&rdquo; I also said I would be glad if he wrote to all the newspapers because I did not think enough people knew of my involvement in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The environment correspondents of the newspapers, especially <i>The Irish Times,</i> were vehemently antagonistic to any underground option. It makes me laugh now to see them writ<Col N="81" /> ing in such glowing terms about the metro element. All the detailed technical arguments we used regarding traffic flow, the number of passengers, the type of rolling stock and the gridlock that would have been permanently imposed on the city are now being used by these people.</P>
    <P>However, I have a question about the timescale for the underground sections. Why is it so long? The Government is accused by its opponents of engaging in fantasy, that it is not just long term but will never happen. I believe it will happen. I take at face value the assurances given by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke. However, there is something worrying about the extraordinary length of time involved before the underground metro system will be in place. I am not alone in feeling this way. The people involved in the Moscow underground, for example, have said it is an extraordinary timescale and that they could put it in place in four to six years. That would certainly be the case in some far eastern countries.</P>
    <P>I was in Ankara some months ago with the foreign affairs committee. I asked to travel on the metro &ndash; I was the only one who did because it was regarded as rather boring &ndash; that had just been opened in Ankara. It has had a major impact, in precisely the way we predicted <i>vis-à-vis</i> Dublin, on traffic problems in the city of Ankara. I urge the Government to examine the timescale again. It is long-fingering this option too much, so to speak, particularly as, and I pointed this out in the House previously, a public private partnership is the likely way of proceeding. Groups like the Matsui corporation in Japan will put in the underground at very favourable terms for the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I will support the Government in this matter because of the useful and valuable work done by the Minister. I was going to use the word &ldquo;collaboration&rdquo; but it would be ridiculous to suggest that I was collaborating with the Minister from the backbenches of the Seanad. However, I believe we helped to strengthen her resolve. We had the right person that day &ndash; two or three previous Ministers had been turned around by people in the woodwork but this Minister stood her ground. It is vital that Dublin gets this underground railway. It is the obvious thing to do. We were always told in the past, after we had won every other argument about geology and so on, that we could not afford it. Now there is a public private partnership, a group of people who are prepared to invest their money in it in return for being allowed to run the system for a while. We also have a buoyant Exchequer so there is no excuse for not doing it.</P>
    <P>There are short-term measures. The corporation could be persuaded to stop trying to constrict traffic in Dublin. As I have said many times previously, it is trying to drive the cars out of the city by aggressively and in a hostile manner turning the infrastructure of the city against the motorist. One can see it in the way the kerbs are creeping further out onto the roads. Look at the bus system. The one place one will not find a bus <Col N="82" /> is in the bus lane &ndash; one will find them everywhere else. Of course, we are tantalised by being excluded from the bus lanes &ndash; that includes the hackney cabs. Why not make an arrangement to allow hackneys use the bus lanes? Motorbikes should also be able to use them. That would make them a little more efficient.</P>
    <P>One regularly sees buses double parked &ndash; something none of us would get away with &ndash; or parked with their backsides sticking out and preventing traffic from passing satisfactorily. Something needs to be done about the behaviour of the bus drivers and those in charge of public transport in the city. On the other hand it is a stressful occupation and many of them are decent people. Too often, however, they are very cavalier. The buses cause a great deal of the traffic congestion and problems.</P>
    <P>Why are deliveries allowed all over the city? I am aware that some of it involves money. One sees Brinks Mat and other security vans parked halfway on the pavement and halfway on the road. Nobody seems to be able to do anything about them. Have they got an exemption from the traffic regulations? The same applies to people making deliveries to pubs. They regularly block the roads.</P>
    <P>There are a number of serious problems. I am lucky to live in the inner city. I can come to the House on foot or on a bicycle. I also have a car, although I am not hit as badly as other people. Every day on the chat programmes one hears somebody describing how it took three or four hours to travel into the city from Stepaside or other places. The day before yesterday I heard about a student who was travelling into town for their first lecture in Trinity College. The student left home at 6.45 a.m. and missed the first part of a 9 a.m. lecture. That is dreadful.</P>
    <P>There are many criticisms of the taxis. I have been in situations where I required a taxi and it is aggravating when one cannot get one. There are large queues at King's Bridge station and at the airport but the taxis come very quickly. One is horrified by the size of the queue but it soon melts away. Things are not quite as bad as we sometimes imagine. Yes, criticisms can be made about taxis, but can we have some perspective? I go to a gym which is also used by many Dublin taxi drivers. They were incredulous at the newspaper headlines the other day. They were being blamed for the death of that unfortunate young man who was murdered in a road rage incident. There was no suggestion that he had even been looking for a taxi. We tend to line up targets too easily.</P>
    <P>I will vote with the Government on this because I believe it is doing something. In any case, the advice being given by this side of the House is dangerous. It is looking for a short-term policy but no long-term policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my fourth time to speak in the House on this subject. I am amazed <Col N="83" /> at the content of the motion given the reality of the situation.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment. It is a realistic appraisal of the overall traffic problem and sets out in clear and specific detail the plans and strategy which have been drawn up and announced by the Government for the short, medium and long term. The motion is misguided in a number of respects. In the first instance, it calls for no more plans or long-term strategies to be published. Perhaps there was a different intention when the motion was drafted but the literal interpretation is that all long-term plans or solutions, which are essential due to the complexity of Dublin traffic, should be suspended or set aside. Instead we should look at short-term measures and implement them. We should also consider putting long-term measures into action. The implication in the motion is that we are not doing so, but nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>I do not want to bore myself or other Members by repeating what I said on other occasions on this topic. However, a few simple statistics on the infrastructural problems of inner city Dublin might illustrate a few points to those who have not already grasped them &ndash; I am not looking at anyone in particular in the Opposition benches. There is no simple quick fix solution, given that it is a hugely complex problem which has manifested itself very rapidly. As was pointed out by previous speakers, nothing was done for decades about infrastructure in Dublin to deal with the increased car numbers. This Government is taking firm action in this regard.</P>
      <P>The centre of Dublin is guarded by the canals and the canal bridges or crossings dictate the volume of vehicles entering the city centre. Since everyone opposes highways and one cannot put airplane wings on cars to fly over the city centre, those who must go through the city centre do so by means of car or public transport. Yet the number of vehicles travelling into the city centre over the last 20 years or more years has increased by just between 2% and 3%. The bulk of that increase has been achieved through the introduction of the SCAT system which is a far more efficient traffic signal system throughout the city. Given the massive increase in cars travelling towards the city centre from all routes each morning, the increase in throughput over the 20 to 25 year period is just 2% to 3%. Obviously the solution lies in weaning people away from using cars and on to public transport of various forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most refreshing to listen to Senator Norris and the positive way in which he has approached this issue. We all accept, despite Professor Barrett's analysis, that even though buses have a vital role to play in the short term &ndash; I agree quality bus corridors should be included in the motion &ndash; their overall contribution to a rapidly escalating problem is minimal. Nevertheless, the development of quality bus corridors has been quite effective despite their limited overall effect. In relation to the four corridors in operation, the <Col N="84" /> increase in passenger intake at peak traffic times has been quite significant and is a success story in itself. The increase ranges from approximately 44% in one instance to approximately 190% in another. The quality bus corridors, though minimalist in terms of a solution to the very complex overall problem, are having an effect. If one takes the volume of vehicles on the roads, the low percentage of travelling public that represents and sets that against the huge physical and structural restrictions placed by the canal network around the inner city, one will get some insight into the massive problems.</P>
    <P>It seems to be forgotten that various forms of integrated ticketing are in operation by Dublin Bus. There is unlimited daily travel involving bus, DART and suburban rail. There is a family bus and rail ticket for two adults and four children. There is a transfer 90 ticket. There is a weekly adult ticket. There is a monthly bus, student and adult ticket for bus, rail and DART. We all accept that the availability of these tickets is far from satisfactory. The committee will report shortly on the effective state-of-the-art ticketing system which will be similar to the credit card system. Some people refer to it as the &ldquo;electronic purse&rdquo;. To be effective, this must be obtainable from vending machines and various locations throughout the city so that the integrated ticketing system can be easily available to all intending passengers.</P>
    <P>Experts agree that because of the security proofing and viability aspect of the system &ndash; there is no point producing something that will fail in six or 12 months &ndash; it will be used not just for Dublin Bus but for banks, supermarkets and as many other services as possible. It is forecast that it will take up to two years before the system is up and running. This is what the experts say. Perhaps Senator Ridge is an expert but I certainly am not; I just read what they say.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government on a very good plan. It is sad that no one else has come up with a medium to long-term plan to solve what is a huge problem in Dublin city and its surrounds.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if people live in the real world, particularly the Government, because every morning when I am driving into the city I see an empty quality car corridor. When travelling to Dublin city every morning between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the road leading out of Dublin is empty. A reversal of Government policy is <Col N="85" /> needed to reverse growth in Dublin. Industries and services should be located outside the city so that those who travel to Dublin, clogging the streets with traffic, will be travelling in the opposite direction. There is spare capacity in towns such as Drogheda, Dundalk, Navan and so on. The Government is not thinking strategically, it is not thinking for the provinces and this is why there is a major problem in Dublin. If the Government is to succeed in solving the traffic chaos, it must use the portion of the existing road network which is not being used by people travelling to and from work.</P>
      <P>Driving through Swords every evening is terrible. Thank God, the Garda have been directing traffic on the roundabouts for the last few days. However, there is very little traffic travelling into the city, while commuters travelling from towns such as Drogheda, Navan and so on would fill these roads. This would partially solve the problem of the volume of traffic and is a matter which the Government should consider.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated there will be 2,000 park and ride facilities by the end of 2000. The reality is that there are no park and ride facilities on the north side of the city. This has been the case for the last three years. If a quality bus service was available, I would gladly use it every day, as I know would Senator Glennon and others. The Government has no policy, it is just a sham.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I had prepared a different opening statement for the previous Minister. However, I must be nice to a Galway Minister, particularly given that Galway lost the All-Ireland.</P>
      <P>Traffic in Dublin and throughout the country is currently a major issue. Senator Fitzgerald referred to quality bus corridors having a minimal effect overall. Many small measures could have a major effect.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan's contribution was interesting. He referred to articulated trucks clogging up the city. I visited Moscow last year, which is in a struggling economy, yet one will not see an articulated truck on the streets nor will they be seen in any major European city. A fortnight ago I travelled along the quays into Dublin city centre at 11 a.m. and I counted 11 articulated trucks, one behind the other, in the lane beside me heading towards Dublin Port. They took up the space of approximately 44 cars. If the Government invested £20 million in a port in Galway or Mayo, that problem would be eliminated. Everything is transported from around the country through Dublin and the streets of the city are congested. The Minister must address these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traffic lights stop traffic in Dublin from moving. Major European cities use overpasses and underpasses, which are not major infrastructural developments, and what they do for the move<Col N="86" /> ment of traffic is unbelievable. If there were underpasses and overpasses at major junctions in Dublin traffic would move in a similar fashion to other European cities. Such infrastructure could be constructed in six months. It would relieve some of the key bottleneck areas in the city. Traffic lights generally are the bane of motorists' lives because they do not work most of the time and when they do, the sequence is wrong and traffic is held up. They do not add to the flow of traffic.</P>
    <P>The public transport service in the west operates at the whim of ILDA. When ILDA decides not to work, there is no public transport. No trains left Mayo for ten weeks during the summer. Traffic congestion in the west is becoming as serious as in Dublin. A bypass is needed immediately in my home town, Ballina, not in five years time as outlined in the national development plan, because the traffic there is clogged up.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and Fianna Fáil have the solutions to all the traffic problems in Ireland, as outlined by the Minister earlier. They have a monopoly on solutions.</P>

      <P>I thank the three Ministers for their attendance. I am amazed at the surprise and pretend indignation of Government Members because they must not have read the motion. We asked for a ban on any further long-term strategy plans until concrete action is taken, not on further works or developments. There is not a shortage of speeches, strategies and reports but we are slow on the ground. We ask for realistic relief in terms of the current situation which is appalling. One can talk about plans until kingdom come but I will place a bet, although that may be unbecoming in such an august place as this, that there will never be a metro in Clondalkin. No land has been acquired for it. These are ludicrous, off-the-wall plans.</P>
      <P>We are asking for a little realism. Nobody has all the answers. References were made to the former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald. He was writing as a newspaper columnist.</P>

      <P>I do not live in the past and I laugh when I hear references to the 1980s. I was not even a councillor at that stage. I am surprised at Senator Glennon. Did he think that we would praise the Government? Let us call a spade a spade. He should go outside Leinster House and consult the public to establish whether there is merit in us seeking immediate action on those four issues.</P>
