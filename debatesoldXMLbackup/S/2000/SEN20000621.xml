      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that a teacher (details supplied) who taught in Dún Chaoin national school, foinse na Gealainne, during the interregnum when the school was not endowed by the Department of Education and Science, be given full pension recognition for the period.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 2, 3, 9 and 18, motion 22: No. 2, Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 3, Planning and Development Bill, 1999 &ndash; Report and Final Stages to be taken at 2. 30 p.m; No. 9, Aer Lingus Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 18, motion 22, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., and business to resume thereafter, if not previously concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way I can accept the Order of Business. The Whips did not give notice last week that No. 9 would be taken today. The <Col N="1342" /> first I heard of this was five minutes ago and that is unacceptable. There are two weeks left of this session. We could look at this Bill if it was a national emergency rather than a matter of conveniencing the Minister for Public Enterprise. We will resolutely oppose No. 9 and, in the interests of the House, I ask the Leader not to go ahead with it today.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to cause distress to Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty for whom I have great respect. However, this story has become not just a tragedy but a farce and a scandal. This matter is bringing government to a low level and threatens the stability of the Government. This is a significant distraction and we need to get to the bottom of the matter immediately. This cannot go on and I ask the Leader to ask the Taoiseach to come into the House to explain what he meant during a radio interview yesterday when he said that perhaps Mr. O'Flaherty might explain what happened.</P>
      <P>If Mr. O'Flaherty is being appointed to one of the most senior positions the Government has to offer, surely he should have explained what happened before he was appointed. We should give Mr. O'Flaherty or the Taoiseach the opportunity to explain what happened, but we must resolve this problem quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's comments on the Aer Lingus Bill. This is an important matter involving the national carrier and it should be put back to another day. Has the Leader any information on the Trinity College, Dublin and the University of Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Bill, 1997? This is No. 1 on the Order Paper and I wonder if he has any progress to report on this delicate matter.</P>
      <P>The Leader indicated he would arrange an hour-long debate on the two motions on Tibet in my name and that of Senator Ross. When will this debate take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's comments on No. 9. There is no reason to rush legislation at this late stage but is seems inevitable as we come to the end of the session. There is plenty of time to take this item as the House will sit for a week after the Dáil and we should take our time on such important legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning raised the appointment of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty and the fact the Taoiseach has re-opened the issue and invited the former judge to make a statement. It is time this matter was laid to rest and a decision was made one way or the other. The former judge was invited to appear before a committee of the House and he and the Taoiseach should finally decide what they are going to do about this matter, rather than making statements to the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is beginning to look like the last days of the Roman Empire. A decision has not been made on our requests for debates on inflation and corruption and children are protesting outside the gates of the House. I do not know what is happening. I hope the Leader has something more <Col N="1343" /> specific to say on issues that we want on the Order Paper rather than proposing No. 9 without any warning and expecting us to deal with it today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>As Fine Gael spokesperson on public enterprise, I also object to No. 9 being put on the agenda without prior notice. I have made family arrangements and I do know if I can break them. The introduction of such serious and important legislation at five minutes' notice is an insult to every Member of this House. Aer Lingus is such an important issue that we should have proper debate, consultation and discussion on this legislation, as we would on every other Bill. I ask the Leader to change today's order. We would be happy to take the legislation with one or two days' notice. I have no problem with sitting an extra day. However, it is not possible to speak authoritatively on a Bill which we have not properly read, discussed or researched. It is no way for this Government to do business. I ask the Leader to reconsider the issue and perhaps put the legislation on the Order Paper later this week or early next week. We will be happy to take it given proper notice. It is unfair and unacceptable to put it on the Order Paper in this way. It is important legislation which will not be debated properly if we are forced to do so.</P>

      <P>The World Health Organisation report has ranked the Irish health service 19th of 191 countries worldwide. It is important that we debate this and invite the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on our health services. While there has been a great deal of criticism of the health service and its inadequacies, this report recognises the strong position of our health service in comparison with the British system and many of our European counterparts. We should recognise the positive elements of our health service and the beneficial changes in its structure and procedures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Aer Lingus Bill. Perhaps the Leader has a reason for putting it on the Order Paper today. However, I agree with Senator O'Dowd, especially as he is the Fine Gael spokesperson, that it is a shame to spring it on us when we are not prepared. I look forward to hearing the reason for this from the Leader.</P>
      <P>I asked about the e-commerce Bill last week. It appears that it will not get through the Dáil this session. It was passed here and it looked like it would go through. I am not sure why this has happened &ndash; perhaps the Government is blaming the other side for delaying it. A survey published yesterday found that only 8% of Irish businesses have an e-mail address. If we are to become the hub of the next generation of business, the e-business generation, we must move more quickly in these Houses as well as in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> Senator Chambers spoke about the WHO report. I listened to the radio this morning and it was interesting that we are rather proud of being 19th in the world health league. I get the impression that it is the same in this House &ndash; we are congratulating ourselves for being in 19th place. I listened to BBC Radio and they were ashamed to be in 18th place. We should set our sights higher and say we are not willing to be in 19th place. We should be a great deal better and we should do something about it.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed to see young children used outside this House today. Teachers have a very good representative in this House and at the negotiation table where conditions and wages are discussed. It is sad that children from infant class, certainly no more than first and second class, are dragged out to shout outside the House. That is sad. I have backed the teachers on every occasion but I am disappointed to see them using children in this manner.</P>

      <P>Apart from the lip service the Government has occasionally paid to combating social exclusion, what, if any, practical measures is it proposing or doing in that regard? I am not aware of any such measures.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with my Leader and other Senators on the way the Aer Lingus Bill has been plucked out of the sky and foisted on us today. The House is being treated with contempt.</P>
      <P>Is it intended before the House rises to take No. 18, motion No. 21, which is in the names of all the leaders, including the Leader of the House, and concerns the funding of our democracy, the regulation of lobbyists and a review of ethical standards?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, Costello, O'Dowd and Quinn expressed their concern at the short notice given for No. 9. The Bill was published on 12 June. I know it is very short notice but the timeframe changed after a discussion with the Government Chief Whip late last night. The Office of Public Works has said we are running behind on the timeframe that has to be complied with.</P>
      <P>I propose that the House sit on Monday week to conclude whatever business comes back to us from the Dáil. The Dáil will sit next Friday, although it had been envisaged it would rise for the summer recess on Thursday, 29 June. The Seanad will sit the following Monday and then rise for the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the short notice. Every Leader has found himself in this difficulty. This seems to be a very difficult time in terms of processing legislation. There is a lot of legislation coming before the House which will have to take priority over statements. I am endeavouring to see how I can facilitate the requests for debates on very urgent matters raised by Senators Manning, O'Toole, <Col N="1345" /> Costello and Dardis on the Order of Business over the past weeks. I will ask the leaders to meet with me as soon as I have the definitive list of legislation later today to agree the passage of these Bills through the House over the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to take Second Stage of the Bill before the House today, which I agree is being taken at short notice. The Bill has 13 sections. I will endeavour to allow as much time as Senators require for Second Stage this evening and for the remaining Stages when they are taken. I will give them ample notice, following the leaders' meeting later this evening, of when the remaining Stages will be taken.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Senator Manning on <Col N="1346" /> the appointment of Hugh O'Flaherty and I will relay it to the Taoiseach. In reply to Senator Norris, I am endeavouring to have a debate on Sierra Leone, which will definitely include Tibet, even if we have to sit two hours earlier next Tuesday to facilitate this commitment.</P>
    <P>Senators Chambers and Quinn asked for a debate on the world health report published yesterday. I can arrange such a debate but not during this session. I will return to Senator Quinn on the matter of the e-commerce Bill. I will pass Senator Farrell's views to the Minister. In reply to Senator Coghlan, I am endeavouring to have motion 21 included, as I have already stated during previous Orders of Business.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past decade, Irish society has undergone a palpable change. From being a struggling open economy on the north-western fringes of Europe, we have turned the economic corner. Ireland is now a vibrant and thriving place.</P>
      <P>For many years Ireland was a country of net, and often very substantial, emigration. That is not to say that immigration did not occur, rather that in past decades the scale of outflows of population far exceeded the inflow of non-nationals seeking to establish themselves here. One of the ways in which the new economic phenomenon manifests itself is that Ireland is now a magnet for immigration on a scale not experienced heretofore. More and more people see Ireland as a place where they can come not just for a holiday or to avail of one of the many excellent courses of education available in both the private and public sectors, but to establish a new way of life for themselves and contribute to the economic life of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have long seen ourselves as Éire na bhFáilte, Ireland of the Welcomes. Immigration policy over the years has been and continues to be informed by this perception of ourselves. We welcome those who wish to visit us and experience some of our cultural and social life. We welcome also those who come to Ireland lawfully as students or as workers to a land of economic opportunity, where they can share in the prosperity of the State and make their own contribution to that prosperity. We also welcome to our shores those who are in need of the protection of the State and to whom we owe the obligations reflected in the various international instruments <Col N="1347" /> to which Ireland is a party, chief among which is the Geneva Convention 1951 relating to the status of refugees.</P>
    <P>Our immigration laws have accommodated the needs of these various visitors to Ireland over the years, and they must continue to evolve to meet those needs. It is clear, however, that what served us in this regard in the past, when immigration was a trickle, is becoming less and less suited to meet the needs of modern Irish society, with its increased demand for immigration and the increased scale of abuses which unfortunately go hand in hand with that demand. That is why I have in course of development within my Department a set of comprehensive proposals to replace completely the Aliens Act, 1935, the present basis of immigration law and practice, with a new code of immigration and residence law which will provide a legislative framework for the development and implementation of modern immigration policies designed to meet the needs of Irish society now and into the future, and to respect the rights of those who seek to come to our shores.</P>
    <P>While these proposals are in course of development, however, difficulties are being faced in the operation of immigration law and practice. These day-to-day difficulties arise out of those who would seek to take advantage of Irish hospitality, by either outstaying their welcome or by circumventing or exploiting for their own ends the proper processes through which Ireland extends its welcome to the world. Accordingly, I have brought forward the proposals in this Bill, in advance of the comprehensive proposals, to be able to tackle now the problems which Ireland is facing on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>One of the more sordid aspects of these problems is that Ireland is now experiencing what our colleagues in the European Union have already been undergoing for many years &ndash; we are being targeted as a destination for illegal immigration, and that targeting is being done principally by international organised criminals with a network of resources and information at their disposal. I refer of course to the exploitative activities of those who traffic in human beings, people who have no lawful authority, no answerability and no concern for the good of anyone or anything except themselves and their wallets. This is a new phenomenon in this country, but internationally it is well known that organised criminal entities know well the profit potential in exploiting vulnerable non-nationals by flouting immigration controls here and abroad with absolutely no regard for the safety or well-being of their victims.</P>
    <P>Last weekend we saw in the United Kingdom an horrific example of the disregard shown for the safety of these vulnerable people. I can only imagine the horror of what these people suffered prior to their deaths and the great sadness which has been inflicted on their loved ones many miles away. We cannot allow the activities of people responsible for such callous disregard for the life <Col N="1348" /> of others to go unchallenged in this country. This activity must be recognised in our law as what it is &ndash; self-serving and inhuman criminality. Our legislative framework is not properly equipped at present to deal with these traffickers. There is no doubt that this weakness is being exploited and that people are continually being smuggled into the State.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the level of asylum applications has been increasing significantly. In 1992 we received 39 applications. By 1999 this had risen almost two hundred fold to 7,724. We are receiving approximately 1,000 applications per month, more in one average working day than the entire annual intake of eight years ago. This type of increase does not occur by accident. Asylum seekers, many of whom did not even know where their destination was to be, often tell of large sums of money paid to traffickers. Our procedures for dealing with asylum claims make inland applications possible. This is only right, because it would be untenable and a breach of our international obligations if we were to deny a person the right to access the asylum process in the State simply on the technical ground that the application was not made at the point of entry. However, less than one quarter of applications are made at points of entry to the State. The remainder, over 75%, are made at my Department's offices in Mount Street in Dublin by people who have entered the State illegally and who have evaded the normal immigration controls. We know from intelligence sources that taxis and private vehicles are travelling daily from Northern Ireland and discharging their illegal passengers in Dublin.</P>
    <P>These are but a few of the aspects of what is happening in this country which makes it difficult to avoid the conclusion that applicants are being smuggled across our borders in an organised, clandestine way by unscrupulous commercial traffickers. That our systems and our asylum framework are incapable of preventing this activity, and as a result offer the occasion for international people traffickers to endanger the lives of their victims while feathering their own nests, is clearly unacceptable. The Bill is intended to address the inadequacy in our legislative framework by criminalising the activity of these traffickers and providing necessary ancillary powers. As I said already, the problems we discuss are not unique to Ireland. However most other jurisdictions, including most of our EU partners, already have legislation of the type provided for in the Bill, and the lack of such provisions in our law makes Ireland more attractive to the traffickers.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning that the link between traffickers and organised crime has also been recognised at UN level, and work is now progressing on the negotiation of protocols to the draft UN Convention on Organised Crime to deal with the smuggling and trafficking in human beings. Most recently, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union at the European Council meeting at Lisbon on 19 June <Col N="1349" /> restated the commitment made at Tampere in Finland in October last to tackle the evil trade of trafficking in human beings and vowed to bring forward legislation by the end of this year to ensure that those who engage in this trade will face severe sanctions in all member states. Needless to say, we fully support this initiative. The EU legislation will prescribe a common approach to the criminalisation of trafficking in human beings. That is in no sense an argument for doing nothing for the present. We clearly need the provisions now to respond to the evil of trafficking occurring on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>Along with the measures to criminalise the trafficking of illegal immigrants, other important provisions of the Bill are designed to ensure a fair and firm set of procedures, including court procedures, which will allow for the provision of the protection of the State to those genuinely in need of it while ensuring that those who are not entitled to a welcome in the State, or who have outstayed their welcome, will be sent out of the State without undue delay when due process has been exhausted.</P>
    <P>I have taken the opportunity provided by this Bill to include proposals to provide for a statute-based scheme of judicial review for asylum and immigration cases at section 5 of the Bill, to make certain technical changes to the Refugee Act, 1996, necessary to facilitate the commencement of that Act in full at section 9 of the Bill, and to refine the deportation process under the Immigration Act, 1999, at section 10 of the Bill. I will come to the detail of those provisions later.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the central section of the trafficking provisions of the Bill. Subsection (1) of this section makes it an offence for any person to organise or knowingly facilitate the entry into the State of a person whom he or she knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, to be an illegal immigrant or asylum seeker. The term &ldquo;illegal immigrant&rdquo; is defined in section 1 as a non-national who enters or seeks to enter or has entered the State unlawfully. In general, there are three main categories of non-nationals who enter the State illegally. The first are persons arriving from a place other than the UK or Northern Ireland who do not present themselves to an immigration officer for leave to land. The second are persons arriving from the UK or Northern Ireland who are not citizens of states which are exempt from visa requirements and who do not possess the required visas. The third category are those people who may be the subject of a deportation or exclusion order.</P>
    <P>As the House will see, the offence also covers trafficking in asylum seekers. The House will, I am sure, condemn unequivocally the actions of those, many of whom may be part of international organised criminal gangs, who profit by exploiting asylum seekers and by flouting our immigration controls. The issue here is not whether the trafficker's cargo is an illegal immigrant or an asylum seeker but that the cargo is people &ndash; people who may be subjected to treat<Col N="1350" /> ment which runs counter to everything which we in the civilised world have tried to achieve in international standards for the safeguard of human rights. In the terrible case which occurred last weekend in the UK, I am sure it will not matter to the UK authorities whether these unfortunate people were asylum seekers or not. What will matter is that the person or persons responsible for their deaths should be made accountable before the law. That is the correct approach.</P>
    <P>The Bill will criminalise the activities of traffickers, including traffickers in asylum seekers, but such criminalisation does not in any way affect the rights of the individual asylum seeker. In so far as the asylum seeker is concerned, the position concerning his or her admission to the State and the processing of his or her application remains unchanged &ndash; he or she will continue to be dealt with in accordance with all the procedures and rights appropriate under the current arrangements or under the Refugee Act as soon as that comes into operation, which I expect will be shortly after the passage of this Bill &ndash; I will touch on that later. What comes within the scope of these provisions is the activity of the traffickers.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that the offence is committed only when the entry into the State of the illegal immigrant or asylum seeker is facilitated for gain &ndash; in other words the offence catches the profiteers only. Those who act for humanitarian purposes or because of family links etc. do not commit an offence under the Bill. This is an important aspect of this Bill and I ask Senators to be aware that this effectively ensures that the scope of the offence catches the profiteer and does not affect the bona fide activities of genuine people or genuine organisations.</P>
    <P>Nor will the legitimate operations of airlines and ferry companies be affected by the trafficking provisions of this Bill as these provisions create a criminal offence which requires normal criminal standards of proof and in this instance specific evidence of knowledge and intent. It is important to understand there is a difference between the criminal offence of trafficking and carriers' liability which is imposed by law in most other countries. Carriers' liability legislation imposes responsibility on carriers to check the documentation of passengers to ensure that they have the necessary authorisation to enter the State. If passengers are landed, and it transpires that they do not have the necessary authorisation, the carrier can be automatically fined. Such matters are not provided for in this Bill but I am considering whether such provisions should be a feature of our law and I hope to bring proposals in this respect to Government after consultation with carriers such as hauliers, shipping companies and airline companies.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) also provides that on conviction on indictment of a trafficking offence a person will be liable to an unlimited fine or up to ten years' imprisonment or to both fine and imprisonment should the court consider it appropriate. In <Col N="1351" /> addition, there is provision in section 3 that a vehicle suspected of having been used in the commission of an indictable trafficking offence may be detained, initially by the Garda and thereafter by order of the court, where it is necessary to ensure that it is available for the court on conviction to decide to order its forfeiture. In accordance with subsection (5) certain persons, including owners, part owners and drivers of the vehicles may apply to the court for its release and the court may release the vehicle in certain circumstances, including where the circumstances justifying its detention no longer exist and where security is given and a guarantee that the vehicle will be made available for forfeiture if such is subsequently ordered by the court.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides in section 4 that a court may, on conviction of a person on indictment of a trafficking offence, in addition to or in lieu of any penalty, order that the vehicle used in the commission of the offence should be forfeited. The possibility of forfeiture arises in accordance with subsection (2) of this section where the convicted person is the owner or part owner of a vehicle or is the director or manager of a company which is the owner or part owner of the vehicle. Where the convicted person is the person in charge of the vehicle, the vehicle can still be forfeited according to subsection (3) if the owner or part owner knew or could with reasonable diligence have discovered that the vehicle was being used for the purpose of the commission of the offence. I emphasise that there are safeguards for the owners of property in the section, including the provisions of subsection (5), which provides that owners or other persons with an interest in the property must be given an opportunity by the court to show why a forfeiture order should not be made.</P>
    <P>Other provisions of the Bill dealing with necessary ancillary powers in relation to the investigation and prosecution of the trafficking offence include section 6 which provides Garda powers to search vehicles and persons in vehicles; section 7 which provides for Garda powers of entry, search and seizure; section 8 which ensures that the offence of immigrant trafficking will be covered by the provisions of the Bail Act; and section 11 dealing with offences by bodies corporate.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the measures which I am proposing in this Bill are but one aspect of an overall strategy which the Government has adopted. This strategy leans heavily towards ensuring that our obligations under national and international law in relation to asylum seekers are fully met but it must also be underpinned by measures to ensure that our systems are efficient, effective and not open to abuse.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes to the deportation procedures set out in the Immigration Act, 1999, which are provided for in section 10 have been developed in light of the experience of almost 12 months of the operation of that Act. That experience demonstrates a pressing need to refine the <Col N="1352" /> deportation process to make it more effective. It would be helpful to Senators if I gave a brief overview of how things have operated to date. Under the Immigration Act, 1999, each person, with some narrowly defined exceptions, in respect of whom deportation is being considered is informed of that fact and invited to make representations in writing within 15 working days. A total of 1,394 notifications of this type have issued to date. The bulk, not all, of the notifications have been sent to failed asylum seekers, people whose claim for asylum have been rejected on appeal or have been turned down in the first instance and not appealed. Of the number invited to make representations as to why a deportation order should not be made, 847 people, or 60%, did not make any. In almost half of those cases the invitations to make representations, which had all been sent by registered post, were returned as undelivered. Some 532 people availed of the opportunity to make representations and 15 people either consented to deportation or left voluntarily.</P>
    <P>Once a deportation order has been made following consideration of the case by reference to the criteria set out in the 1999 Act and taking into account any representations made, the deportee is notified of the making of the order and instructed to report to a named Garda station at a specified time for the purpose of deportation. To date, I have made 399 deportation orders. Of that number, arrangements for removal have been made in respect of 233 persons. There have been supervised departures of 31 people and a further seven people left the State before deportation could be effected. In another 73 cases the deportation order cannot be executed pending the hearing of judicial review proceedings initiated by the deportees. In a further 14 cases, the deportation orders have been revoked, mainly on the advice of the Attorney General's office. Technical difficulties of various kinds, such as the need to obtain proper travel documentation, have held up the departure of the deportee in 49 cases. A further eight deportations are currently being arranged. In the remaining 98 cases &ndash; approximately 72% of cases &ndash; excluding the judicial review cases or cases where the order has been revoked, where arrangements for deportation had been made, the deportees have in each case chosen to flout the requirement to turn up at the named Garda station at the appointed time. In a further 119 cases removal cannot be effected because the persons are not at their last known address.</P>
    <P>One may speculate that a proportion of those who have disappeared from the system at the various stages along the way may have already left the country for unknown destinations. In relation to the 3,000 or so asylum applicants who have abandoned their applications and who are no longer in the social welfare system, that speculation may have a strong basis. It is also possible that some of those who have not availed of the invitation to make representations as to why they should not be deported or who have failed to <Col N="1353" /> comply with the requirements of a deportation order when made may have assumed fresh identities and reapplied for asylum, thus getting back into the social welfare system or are otherwise still in the State and making a living by working illegally.</P>
    <P>There are provisions in the Refugee Act for fingerprinting asylum seekers and those provisions &ndash; which are soon to come into operation along with the rest of that Act &ndash; will help in the identification of those who seek to flout the system. The provisions are of a kind which permit bilateral exchanges of fingerprint information with other EU states. I have already entered into such arrangements on behalf of the State with the UK and I am concluding arrangements with France.</P>
    <P>The figures demonstrate the need to ensure that the deportation process is adapted so as to make the requirement to leave the State realistically enforceable. Where a person fails to comply or there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that he or she will not comply with the requirements of a deportation order made after due process, including an opportunity for the person to make representations as to why it should not have been made, then the power must be there to ensure that the order is obeyed. I have accordingly brought forward the proposals in section 10 of the Bill to strengthen the deportation provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999, in order to secure a greater proportion of supervised departures of deportees than occurs under present law.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>a</i>)(<i>i</i>) of the section inserts in section 3 of the Immigration Act the general statement of principle that a person who is the subject of a deportation order is liable to detention in accordance with the provisions of the Act and that this detention is for the purpose of ensuring his or her deportation from the State. This makes it clear that the Minister's executive powers in these matters, which have been long recognised by the courts, are to be exercised in line with the policy, procedures and limitations set out in the Act.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>a</i>)(<i>ii</i>) of section 10 replaces the existing section 3(9)(<i>a</i>) of the Immigration Act with a much expanded version, setting out in a lot more detail the sort of practical arrangements that can be made to ensure the successful supervised departure of the deportee. Under the present section 3(9)(<i>a</i>), which sets out the content of the notice of the making of the deportation order, the only requirement that can be made is that the person concerned present himself or herself to an immigration officer or garda at a specific date, time and place for the purpose of his or her deportation.</P>
    <P>The amendment restates that requirement at subparagraph (<i>a</i>)(<i>i</i>)(l) of the amended section 3(9)(<i>a</i>). Along with that, the other sub-subparagraphs provide for a number of additional practical requirements that can be included in the notice, such as the production of any travel documents, passports, tickets or other documents required for deportation purposes that the person may pos<Col N="1354" /> sess; co-operation with a garda or immigration officer to obtain travel documents; the requirement to reside in a particular area or address in the State while arrangements are being made &ndash; this provision can be necessary where, for instance, there is likely to be a delay in obtaining a passport for the person from the country of origin; a requirement to report periodically to a specified Garda station or an immigration officer &ndash; this is designed to ensure that the person will continue to be available for removal once the arrangements are finalised; and the requirement to notify a garda or immigration officer as soon as possible of any change of address.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>a</i>)(<i>ii</i>) of the amended section of the Act enables a garda or immigration officer, for the purpose of the deportation of the person concerned, to make a further requirement or requirements of the kind set out in subparagraph (<i>i</i>). This is to cater for the situation where a deportee reports as requested to a Garda station for the purpose of deportation, but some impediment emerges which make immediate removal impossible for the time being.</P>
    <P>These are all very practical measures designed to minimise delays due to necessary administrative work, to ensure that the deportee can remain in his or her regular accommodation while awaiting the finalisation of the arrangements and to facilitate the return of the person as soon as that can be done. Any additional requirement must, like those in the notice of the making of the deportation order itself, be in writing, with a copy in a language that the person understands where this is necessary. Our experience to date shows that some combination of these requirements is likely to be necessary in each case to ensure that the deportee remains available for removal from the State on foot of the deportation order. Which requirement or combination of requirements should be applied in particular cases is a matter for decision in the circumstances of each case.</P>
    <P>Section 10(<i>b</i>) makes changes to section 5(1) of the Immigration Act dealing with the detention of a deportee. The existing section 5(1) provides that where a Garda or immigration officer with reasonable cause suspects that the deportee has failed to comply with any provision of the order or with a requirement in a notice of the making of the deportation order, the deportee may be arrested without warrant and detained. This detention is of course with a view to ensuring the deportation.</P>
    <P>Section 10 expands the grounds on which arrest and detention of a non-compliant deportee may arise. The present ground for detention is restated by way of paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the new section 5(1) of the 1999 Act. The additional grounds for detention are to be where a Garda or immigration officer, with reasonable cause, suspects that the deportee intends to leave the State and without lawful authority enter another state, in effect to abuse the common travel area arrangements between here and the United Kingdom &ndash; that appears at paragraph (<i>b</i>); the <Col N="1355" /> deportee has destroyed his or her identity documents or is in possession of forged identity documents &ndash; that appears at paragraph (<i>c</i>); or the deportee intends to avoid removal from the State &ndash; that appears at paragraph (<i>d</i>). Any detention under this provision is of course subject to the conditions and safeguards set out in the remaining subsections of section 5 of the 1999 Act. These deal with placement in a mode of transport about to depart, proper accommodation during the journey, the non-applicability of detention to persons under 18 years, provision for review by the court of a detention where the deportation is under court challenge and the overall limit on the period of detention in any case. I underline again the explicit provision that detention under the 1999 Act, as spelt out in this amendment, is for the purpose of ensuring the deportee's removal from the State and for no other purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as it stands, allows for service of notices either personally or by registered or recorded post. This can only work properly, however, where notice is sent to and received by the person at the address which that person has most recently supplied. The present provisions of Article 11 of the Aliens Order, 1946, and new section 9(4A) of the Refugee Act, which is being inserted by section 9(<i>a</i>), place a responsibility on the individual concerned to ensure that the appropriate authorities are kept abreast of that person's up-to-date address. This is essential to the serving of notices. It is open at present to an asylum seeker, a deportee or a potential deportee to try to delay or frustrate the process by avoiding acceptance of the notice, either by moving without telling the authorities or by simply refusing to accept registered post from the postman. In order to ensure that the process cannot be evaded in this way, section 10(<i>c</i>) modifies section 6 of the 1999 Act to provide that the person concerned will be deemed to have received the notice three days after that notice has been sent by registered post or any other form of recorded delivery to the last address provided to the immigration or asylum authorities.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, having consulted the Attorney General's office, that the modifications to the Immigration Act, 1999, provided for in section 10 are justified in the light of our experience of the practical operation of the Immigration Act to date. They allow for a common sense degree of flexibility in their operation, while remaining consistent with our human rights obligations under both the Constitution and international instruments to which Ireland subscribes. In particular, they are in line with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, which at Article 5.l.f specifically envisages the necessity of detention in contemplation of deportation of a person, subject always to the existence of proper conditions and safeguards. In conjunction with the recently announced establishment by the Garda authorities of the National Immigration <Col N="1356" /> Bureau and the assignment of additional resources to immigration matters generally, I am confident of achieving my aim to increase the proportion of supervised departures from the State of those who after due process are no longer entitled to be in the State.</P>
    <P>One of the features of our constitutional system of justice is the system whereby the High Court has power to review the administrative actions of public and private bodies. The judicial review system, although of long standing in Irish law, is not based on or regulated in any general way by a primary statute. The procedures and some of the principles governing the invocation of this jurisdiction of the High Court are set out in Order 84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1996, but there are no rules which are specific to immigration or asylum matters. The purpose of section 5 is to enshrine into primary legislation, for the first time, a code of law governing this essential element of our legal system as it applies in the case of a wide range of immigration and asylum matters.</P>
    <P>It would be useful for Senators if, before I get to the detail of the provisions in the section itself, I set out the legal context in which this proposal is brought forward. Some general points are worth making as a preliminary. Judicial review is the process whereby a person affected by a decision who considers that there was a procedural defect in arriving at it may ask the High Court to review that procedure. Judicial review is not an appeal against the substantive decision as such, and a successful application for judicial review, as well as quashing the decision reviewed, may result in the matter being referred back to the decision-maker. The court determining the review will not normally substitute its own decision on the substance for that of the decision-maker.</P>
    <P>Judicial review historically owes its roots to the common law, but in Ireland has been given added backing by Article 34.3.1º of the Constitution. That article invests the High Court with &ldquo;full original jurisdiction in and power to determine all matters and questions whether of law or fact, civil and criminal&rdquo;. Thus legislation which sought to exclude matters from the scope of judicial review would be probably struck down as inconsistent with that article.</P>
    <P>Current procedures generally for judicial review are, as I have said, set out in Order 84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1996. Some statutes provide exceptionally for particular variations on the procedure in particular types of case, and I will touch on these later. This order of the 1996 Rules of Court substantially implements the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in a working paper on judicial review &ndash; No. 8 1979 &ndash; a paper which characterised the system of judicial review remedies as having &ldquo;two outstanding merits &ndash; comprehensiveness and effectiveness&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Judicial review proceedings are instituted by the making of an application to the High Court for leave to seek judicial review, <i>ex parte,</i> that <Col N="1357" /> is, without notice to the other interested parties, except in certain cases, and supported by a statement of grounds and by affidavits setting out the relevant facts. The applicant must satisfy the court in a <i>prima facie </i>manner of the following: that he or she has sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates; that the facts averred in the supporting affidavits would, if true, be sufficient grounds for a stateable case for judicial review; that on the facts there is an arguable case in law for the relief sought; that the application is made promptly and within the time limit, which is normally three months, or the court is satisfied that there is good reason for an extension and that the relief sought is the only or most effective remedy available to the applicant on the basis of the facts averred. These criteria were identified by Chief Justice Finlay in the leading case of G <i>v. </i>DPP in 1994. While that was obviously a criminal case, the principles applying to judicial review apply across the board.</P>
    <P>A decision to grant or refuse leave to seek judicial review is, it appears, appealable to the Supreme Court except where statute otherwise precludes it. As I mentioned, the normal time limit for applying for leave to seek judicial review is three months from the matter giving rise to the application. That period is six months in the case of an application for<i> certiorari,</i> an order overturning a decision granted in excess of jurisdiction. There is a discretion to extend the time further where the High Court is of the view that there is good reason.</P>
    <P>Special time limits are provided for by statute in certain circumstances. Thus, for instance, legislation of 1963 dealing with planning approvals and permissions and 1993 roads legislation, covering motorway schemes and roads-related environmental impact assessments, provide that application for judicial review of a decision must be made within two months of the decision being made, with the possibility of an extension of time being granted. In the case of 1997 legislation dealing with the Irish Takeover Panel, there is a provision confining to seven days the time within which a rule made by the panel relating to a takeover may be judicially reviewed.</P>
    <P>This is the general procedural background against which the proposal in section 5 falls to be considered. The proposal will provide in primary legislation a set of procedures for judicial review tailored to the specific needs of cases in the immigration and asylum areas of operation. The aim is to achieve a balanced situation where those who have a substantial case that proper procedures were not followed in an immigration or asylum matter will have a defined statutory framework within which to have that question determined by the High Court, while the normal processes will not be delayed by the institution of court proceedings by those who do not have a substantial case which would justify such delay.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill achieves these aims by setting up a statutory procedure for judicial review of immigration and asylum matters with the fol<Col N="1358" /> lowing principal features. Section 5(1) lists the various types of processes to which the new procedures apply. Paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) cover the steps in the deportation process set out in the Immigration Act, 1999, which can arise in relation to any person liable to be deported, be that person a failed asylum seeker or someone whose deportation is being considered on one of the many other grounds for deportation set out in the 1999 Act. Paragraph (<i>d</i>) covers the refusal of leave to enter the State under the provisions of the Aliens (Amendment) (No 2) Order, 1999. Paragraph (<i>e</i>) deals with exclusion orders made by the Minister in relation to notorious international war criminals or the like, and paragraphs (<i>f</i>) to (<i>n</i>) cover steps taken in the asylum process, including the consideration of applications under the Dublin Convention, whether under the present administrative processes or under the statutory arrangements about to come into effect with the commencement of the Refugee Act.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5(2)(<i>a</i>) addresses the time within which an application for judicial review must be made in these types of case. The limit specified is 14 days, which reflects the reality of the situation in immigration and asylum cases. The time limits in most cases between steps in the asylum and immigration processes are of short duration. This is necessary given the nature of these cases. Many of these limits are set in statute and must be adhered to. There would be little logic in setting longer limits for judicial review purposes where the decision must be executed or the next step carried out in a much shorter period. The paragraph provides that the period of 14 days can be extended where the High Court determines there is good and sufficient reason to do so. This compares with the general current provisions for judicial review in rules of court which require that an application for leave to seek judicial review must be made promptly and allows the High Court to extend the outside limits set in the rules.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) provides that the Minister will be put on notice of applications for leave to seek judicial review in immigration and asylum cases. Unlike at present, the Minister will have the opportunity to be a party to proceedings from the very beginning and will thus have an opportunity as respondent to offer argument and facts at an early stage on the question of whether the application is based on substantial grounds. The High Court will have the power to refuse an application in those circumstances. This contrasts with the general position under the rules of court where an applicant for judicial review generally applies <i>ex parte,</i> that is without notice to the other side, and need only show there is an arguable case that the act which is the subject of the intended review was improperly carried out. While those with a substantial case to make will have full opportunity to make it, I am concerned to avoid a recurrence of the situation which has been experienced in a number of cases in recent years, where court proceedings have resulted in delays of over two years in circumstances where, had the <Col N="1359" /> court had the opportunity of hearing preliminary argument and facts from both sides instead of just one side, it could have decided early on that there was no substance in the case.</P>
    <P>Section 5(3) provides that the determination of the High Court will be final in these cases and no appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court except on a point of law of exceptional public importance and that an appeal is desirable in the public interest. Thus, having heard the preliminary arguments and presentation of the facts, if the High Court decides that the judicial review application should proceed to a full hearing, the Minister will not be able to appeal that decision to the Supreme Court unless the High Court is satisfied there is an exceptionally important point of law involved. If there is an issue as to the constitutionality of a law, the possibility of an appeal to the Supreme Court cannot be excluded. This is catered for in Article 34.4.4º of the Constitution and in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the subsection. Sections 5(4) and 5(5) are designed to ensure that the High Court will deal with these types of case as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out a system which provides for a coherent, fair and expeditious means of dealing with judicial review applications in the asylum and immigration area. Delay in such cases can result in a situation where even though the court finds the Minister's actions in, for example, making a deportation order were proper and lawful, the execution of that order cannot take place because of a change in the circumstances occasioned by the delay. Nor should the High Court's valuable time be taken up with applications which can be disposed of at an early stage in the judicial process where the necessary procedures can be put in place to allow for this. These proposals will ensure that where all due procedures have resulted in a determination that there is no basis for a non-national's continued stay in the State, the judicial review process cannot be used to delay that person's departure if no substantial case can be made which would warrant a postponement.</P>
    <P>The proposals contain safeguards to ensure that those with a substantial case to make have full opportunity to make it. It must be remembered that the judicial review process is not an appeal from the decision in question but is a means of testing whether the procedures leading to the decision were proper. My concern is to ensure that a person who no longer has good reason to remain in the State cannot prolong that stay by relying on the delays inherent in the institution of High Court proceedings, unless there is a reasonable case to be made for that prolongation. We must also remember that the experience of actual cases in these areas is that the decision to seek leave for judicial review usually arises only after all the normal procedures have been exhausted &ndash; procedures which, in the case of an asylum seeker, have involved State-<Col N="1360" /> funded legal aid and interpreter facilities at every step.</P>
    <P>These proposals have been developed in consultation with the Attorney General. They are fair, constitutional, consistent with the principles of natural justice and in compliance with Ireland's international obligations in the human rights sphere. They offer a statutory guarantee to those in the immigration and asylum processes of the opportunity to have the courts review any step in those processes where there is a substantial basis for doing so.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of Senators to section 9 of the Bill which makes some amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996. Apart from the proposal in paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the section, which I have already discussed, these amendments are purely technical in nature, but nonetheless essential to the proper operation of that Act when fully commenced. It is my intention to proceed with commencement of the Refugee Act in full on the enactment of the Bill, and publication very shortly of the detailed secondary legislation necessary for the smooth operation of the Refugee Act. The selection process for the first Refugee Applications Commissioner is already complete. The competition for the appointment of a chairperson to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is well under way under the aegis of the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    <P>I commend this necessary legislation to the House. The Bill updates our laws in many ways for practical and pragmatic reasons to ensure that our procedures are streamlined. The Bill also takes account of modern society and will ensure reasonableness, fairness, openness and transparency throughout the process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael has no difficulty with the general thrust of the Bill. The unspeakable and evil trade in the trafficking of human beings, particularly refugees and asylum seekers, must be fought and wiped out at all costs. Fine Gael will support the Bill is so far as it attempts to do so.</P>
      <P>However, in the Minister's most recent amendments to the Bill, particularly regarding asylum seekers' or refugees' rights to judicial review, which are different to those of any other category of person, he is in breach of the 1951 UN Convention on the Rights of Refugees and Asylum Seekers. Ireland is a contracting party to that agreement and the amendments may also contravene the Constitution. I will return to these issues later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appalling death at Dover of 58 people being transported in an airtight container clearly involves evil traffickers and has focused minds on the issue of the illegal trafficking in tragic and vulnerable people who are usually also penniless by the time they have finished with the traffickers. Of course, we can easily forget &ndash; and this Minister would obviously want us to overlook it &ndash; that states, including this one, have a share of the moral responsibility for these tragedies. We must always bear in mind, even if the Minister does not, that refugees and asylum seekers are <Col N="1361" /> forced into the clutches of these criminal traffickers by current law and practice in many European countries, including this one, because legal avenues of flight are being shut down, often in clear contravention of UN and other international conventions and instruments on protection of asylum seekers and refugees. In this and other states, desperate people are being forced to resort to these criminals to get around unjust laws.</P>
    <P>This side of this House recognises that the principles of refugee protection are clear. A refugee or asylum seeker cannot and should not be penalised for the manner of their entry to or presence in the country where they are seeking asylum or refugee status. That is the cornerstone of the 1951 convention and is effectively part of the law of this land.</P>
    <P>This country was held up to international odium last week by the Amnesty International Report 2000. Amnesty is recognised as the world's most objective, best informed and most respected NGO, monitoring and observing human rights practices in every country in the world. For the first time in the 40 years Amnesty has been monitoring human rights worldwide, Ireland came in for unfavourable notice in this year's report. In the paragraphs that deal with refugees and Ireland it states:</P>
    <P>The Immigration Bill, 1999, was introduced in order to amend the 1996 Refugee Act which the Government claimed was unworkable and which had not been enacted in full, leaving gaps in the legal framework for refugee protection. Amnesty International was concerned about various parts of the Bill, including its failure to recognise the fundamental nature of the rights of non-refoulement. Amnesty International was also concerned about the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill which failed to make the distinction between professional traffickers and assisting genuine asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister lecture Deputy Jim Higgins on non-refoulement. It was a great pity Deputy Higgins had not read that so he could respond to the Minister.</P>
    <P>When people like me expressed similar criticism of the Immigration Bill, 1999, during its passage through this House, the Minister described us as bigots. I fully support Amnesty's comments on this Bill but I want the Minister to respond to its adverse comments on his legislation. I hope he will not show contempt by pretending to ignore the comments of Amnesty on this legislation which has proceeded solely and completely from the attitudes and mindset of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In a newspaper article the Minister said the Dover tragedy could be repeated at an Irish port and he has offered that awful prospect as justification for some of the more draconian measures in this Bill, which have nothing to do with trafficking. What happened in Dover could happen here and we are right to do everything to prevent <Col N="1362" /> that, including the introduction of strong and adequate legislation to deal with traffickers and put them out of business. Equally, we must ensure that we do not make law which forces asylum seekers or refugees into the hands of these evil criminals. Unfortunately, the Immigration Act, 1999, and the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill before us today, along with some of the laws enacted in recent years in some other European countries, forces often desperate people into the clutches of these traffickers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's expression of horror at the Dover tragedy. I ask him to join with me in an equal expression of horror that an incident at Brussels airport in September 1998 and to ensure it will never happen here. I refer to the case of Semira Adamu, a young woman from Niger who died tragically as a result of the methods used to enforce an expulsion order against her. Her case is not an isolated one. There were others &ndash; one at Zurich airport in March 1999, another on a flight from Vienna to Niger in May 1999 and a third on a flight from Frankfurt to Khartoum. These people died while they were being expelled from Switzerland, Austria, Germany and, in the case of Semira Adamu, Belgium. They died because of the heavy-handed measures used to expel them.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree it is intolerable that this country would resort to such a degree of force in response to the often desperate attempts of asylum applicants and refugees not to be forced back to their country of origin where they might face persecution, starvation or worse? Violent refusal to board a plane is usually a sign of panic and distress rather than aggressiveness against the officer enforcing the expulsion order. All too often, persons being expelled are considered and treated as the wretched refuse of economic and political breakdown in their countries. They are looked on as far worse than criminals. The fact that so many of them commit suicide confirms the tragedy of their situation.</P>
    <P>Given the Minister's hard-faced and mailed-fisted attitude on the asylum, refugee and migration issues, one wonders if he ever for a moment considers or feels for the tragedy that is the background of the majority of people who flee their country and home and become refugees, asylum seekers or economic migrants.</P>
    <P>I am not being self-indulgent when I say I understand the plight of these people because I am sure every reasonable person in this country feels the same. I cannot escape this country's emigration history and experience. Irish emigration and the diaspora enriched many countries such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Argentina, to mention a few, but it was a tragedy and disaster for Ireland. Even the most cursory study of history shows that the main dynamic of human achievement was the migration of peoples. Last night in the Dáil, the Minister was in a sermonising mood and even preached on his definition of a responsorial psalm. He also gave a long sermon on the legal <Col N="1363" /> procedures in place which any asylum seeker or refugee can use to make their case for recognition in this country. I do not want the Minister to repeat them here because they are the minimum we are obliged to have in place under our international obligations.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will explain in detail the exact procedures in place when a rejected asylum seeker is being expelled or is having an expulsion or deportation order enforced against him or her. Can he guarantee the procedures have enough safeguards to be humane? Can he state unequivocally that all enforcement officers are fully <i>au fait</i> with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which the Taoiseach has promised will be ratified in our domestic law in October, under the recently passed Human Rights Commission legislation? Article 3 of this convention clearly lays down that any rejected asylum seeker or illegal immigrant cannot be subjected to discrimination, racist verbal abuse, abuse of authority, dangerous detention methods or any physical abuse. Can he state unequivocally that there is sufficient protection to ensure that the procedures and actions which led to the tragedy of Semira Adamu in Brussels can never happen here? What procedures are followed when a person is placed on a plane to affect their expulsion?</P>
    <P>For example, if a national airline takes an expelled person to London but he or she must take another flight to their home country, let us say Romania, where does the Minister's responsibility begin and end? Does he place the responsibility for the safety of the deportee on the flight captain? I am sure he is aware that under the Tokyo convention on air safety, any air commander or pilot may have any person or persons accompanying them disembarked if he or she considers that the presence of such a passenger or passengers could jeopardise discipline and order on the flight and that humanitarian considerations of immigration policy do not fall within the scope of any pilot's duties. It is clearly incumbent on every state which is party to the UN human rights conventions relating to the rights of asylum seekers that expulsions are never carried out in a legal vacuum or under legislation which does not expressly prohibit the use of force.</P>
    <P>Let us return to all the assurances the Minister states are in place to protect and guarantee fair procedures to a person seeking asylum or refugee determination. For instance, where an applicant makes a case that he or she faces the threat of prosecution if they are returned to their country of origin, is it recognised that in many countries prosecution may not necessarily come from the state or its agencies but from other entities which have no links with the state? Is it recognised that war and violence are used as instruments of prosecution against many ethnic groups in many of the countries from which we receive so many refugees and <Col N="1364" /> asylum seekers, including some European countries?</P>
    <P>Another question, which I put to the Minister during a previous debate but which he refused to answer, relates to safe countries of origin. Most countries receiving asylum seekers recognise a list of countries where there is a risk of persecution if people are returned to them, although the majority of countries are rightly recognised as posing no risk of persecution. Does the Minister recognise as a safe country of origin the Republic of the Congo, from which many people in this country facing deportation come? Does he recognise Algeria or Liberia as safe countries of origin? Would he regard returning Christians to certain parts of northern Nigeria or Roma people to certain parts of Romania or Bulgaria as safe practices? I hope the Minister will be able to answer those questions.</P>
    <P>There is an irony about this. I read in the Library a couple of weeks ago the report of a debate in the other House in the 1950s on the refusal of eastern European communist regimes to allow people travel from their countries. There was a lot of declaiming on the issue. The then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Frank Aiken, replied to the debate. He told the Dáil he had recently stood up at the General Assembly of the United Nations and addressed the Russian and eastern European delegations. Like Moses, he said to them, &ldquo;Let your people go&rdquo;. Forty years later, the opportunity suddenly arose. When the Berlin Wall fell and all the changes took place in central and eastern Europe, people were free to travel. However, when they present themselves here, we slam the door shut in their faces. Most of the people who seek asylum or refugee status here come from central and eastern Europe, the former communist countries to whom we appealed 40 years ago, like Moses to the Pharaoh, to let them go.</P>
    <P>That is the irony of the situation we face. It serves to illustrate our hypocrisy and our lack of sympathy and understanding for these people, which I have tried to outline. This country is in the worst possible position to adopt this kind of attitude to refugees, asylum seekers, economic migrants or whatever we choose to call them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill, which I commend to the House. It is important to put on the record the huge volume of legislation the Minister has introduced to these Houses. During the life of this Government, which is three years young&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;more legislation has been initiated by the Minister and his Department than in any time since the 1960s, and perhaps before that as my records and research did not go back any further than then. Tribute must be paid to the extensive work the Minister has done since <Col N="1365" /> he was appointed three years ago. That very important facet must be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>My impression from reading newspapers, listening to speakers in these Houses and travelling around my own and neighbouring constituencies, including Tipperary South, is that there is a widespread revulsion and concern among ordinary citizens, not at genuine asylum seekers or refugees but at the significant amount of trafficking of innocent asylum seekers and refugees from north Africa, eastern Europe and so on. Critics of the Minister's vision and foresight in initiating this legislation in the Dáil some months ago have been completely answered by the unfortunate and tragic incident in Great Britain last weekend, with the devastating discovery of 58 dead people in a container in a ship in Dover. That is what the Minister envisaged might happen in this country. I hope it will never happen, but he had the foresight and vision to see it could occur in Rosslare, Cork, Galway, Drogheda or any of our other ports. Fortunately for this country, the ship in Dover was not destined for an Irish port. It must not be lost sight of that this is one of the main planks the Minister is trying to achieve in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said on at least six occasions in this House that he is concerned about the illegal trafficking of human beings from other parts of Europe and the rest of the world. The people involved in the horrific occurrence in Dover last weekend came from southern China. They were herded and treated worse than animals. They were brought in a train across Asia, Russia and eastern Europe to a port in Holland from which they were transported in terrible conditions. They had no air and suffocated in a container. According to the reports, they were screaming and scraping the doors with their fingernails, trying to get air. That signifies the essential thrust of the Bill and the importance of getting it passed urgently.</P>
      <P>I read the report of the debate on this Bill in the Dáil, where the Minister was criticised for bringing this legislation forward piecemeal rather than in one Bill. His critics were answered by the unfortunate incident in a neighbouring state a few days ago. That point must be made.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that organised gangs involved in trafficking in eastern Europe, South America and north Africa take the life savings of innocent people. We read that the people who died in the tragic episode in Dover paid $14,000 each to a subversive and criminal organisation in China. They were treated like animals. Apparently, they were misled into thinking they would be flown to Ireland. It is obvious that many of those who died did not even know where Ireland is. This was to be their golden opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that some of the vibes coming from this country welcome this type of development. We are giving the impression we are the land of a thousand welcomes, which we may be. However, we have limitations and laws, although we accept our responsibilities under the Geneva Convention. The impression is created in places <Col N="1366" /> such as China, North Africa and eastern Europe through remarks by some politicians, the media and some do-gooders which are carried on the Internet that Ireland is a soft touch. Organised trafficking to this and other countries is resulting in the deaths of people. I predict that something similar to that which happened in Dover could happen on a smaller scale at one of our ports, which would be devastating for the country and for asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we cannot see the trees for the forest, but we must never forget that a proportion of those who come here are decent and proper asylum seekers and refugees who come within our laws and the European conventions and they must be respected. Sometimes their genuine case is lost in the plethora of cases of people who are here for reasons other than seeking asylum. I am convinced that at least 80% of people coming here from Romania have no genuine case for asylum or refugee status. I was in Romania on at least two or three occasions since the overthrow of Ceaucescu. It is a poor country which is emerging from the era of the Iron Curtain and the eastern European communist regime. Some might argue that Ceacescu's successor, Iliescu, may be just as severe, but during my visits I saw no obvious oppression of people in Romania in any major systematic way. The same could apply to Poland, but I have less knowledge of that country. In the next few years Romania will probably be a member of the EU &ndash; I predict this will occur before 2010. Romanians will then be free to travel within the EU and will enjoy the other benefits of EU membership.</P>
    <P>In praise of the Minister's work, I welcome his trip to Bucharest some weeks ago when, in a very sensible and co-ordinated way, he met with his counterpart to seek the repatriation of those who do not come under the asylum category. Most applicants for asylum and refugee status in Ireland come from Romania, although I am not sure of the percentage. Under this agreement those who do not get asylum here can be repatriated in a humane way to their country of origin. I see nothing wrong with this, especially given that Romania and Poland will soon become part of the EU. I understand the Minister has plans to go to other countries such as Poland and Nigeria, which is a sensible way of dealing with the difficulties we are encountering.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled and somewhat alarmed by the Minister's statement that 3,000 people have gone missing from the system. They have not pursued their applications for asylum beyond the initial step, have not gone through the appeals process and have left the social welfare system. Are these people still in the country? Have they vanished into thin air? Have they gone across the Border to Northern Ireland or Great Britain? It is a worrying feature and indicates the importance of fingerprinting, something I have previously urged in the House. There was a furore that fingerprinting was inhumane and unfair and that we were criminalising people in advance, but this is <Col N="1367" /> absolute rubbish. Fingerprinting is very simple and painless and if the 3,000 who have gone missing had been fingerprinted they could be traced and tracked down when required.</P>
    <P>People make comparisons with the Irish who went to America. Members of my family went to the US in the 1950s and 1960s and at that time it was normal for emigrants to present themselves to the authorities and to be fingerprinted. Emigrants had to have medical records, accommodation organised and police records to prove they had no criminal background.</P>
    <P>We are a nomadic people. The vast majority of Irish people who went abroad did so to work, as I did myself in my younger days. I am convinced that many of those coming to the country do not have that wish. People might say I am racist to say so, but that is not true. The country could do with many additional workers, but I have the feeling that&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;some of the people from China, North Africa or eastern Europe have been given the impression that this country is doing extremely well and has an excellent social welfare system. They are being led up the garden path and told lies about Ireland.</P>
      <P>Those who died in Dover are the victims of trafficking and the object of the Bill is to curb the activities of traffickers. What about the Dutch lorry driver who arrived at Dover? He knew damned well that there were 50 or 60 people in the container without air. The police observed his manoeuvring, pulled him in and found 58 bodies in the container. Their deaths were appalling and unfortunate. The driver knew the people were in his container and he was in on the racket &ndash; he was probably a middle man.</P>

      <P>That is my suspicion and I am entitled to it. He is not in this jurisdiction and I am not in any way jeopardising his fair trial.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision whereby a lorry driver or a person piloting a ship or aeroplane who knowingly brings in people, and who is in many instances well paid for such racketeering, can have their lorry, ship, boat or aircraft confiscated and that the powers of the Garda are enhanced. The fact that a ten year jail sentence is being introduced might deter many traffickers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation may send a message to those trafficking in human beings, be it in China, South America or North Africa. The Minister said that 75% of those who come to the country illegally do not come through the normal ports of entry, such as the airports, which is very worrying. Some <Col N="1368" /> are being brought across the Border in taxis. We must put our foot down. At the end of the day it is important that the Minister has recognised in the Bill the case of the genuine person seeking asylum or refugee status who is fleeing persecution. Such people must get protection and be supported.</P>
    <P>I hate to see Ireland being a facilitator for traffickers, be they of European, African or Asian origin. The human misery of trafficking is nothing short of the slave trade which occurred in Africa hundreds of years ago with which there are similarities and parallels. The snake heads in China have made millions of pounds from such racketeering, resulting in 58 bodies being found in Dover. I hope such a thing will not happen on our shores and I welcome the Minister's fast-tracking the Bill through both Houses. I also welcome his announcement that comprehensive legislation is coming down the track to replace the Aliens Act. I give my full support to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <P>I also welcome the Minister and wish to review some of what he said but before doing so I wish to refer to the contribution of Senator O'Donovan, elements of which were regrettable. It was a clichéd response in which there was reference to do-gooders. This is always an easy one &ndash; to describe opponents or people who are critical as do-gooders when one wants to take a populist line. Ireland, we are told, is a soft touch. That is also an emotive phrase, as is the new phrase of &ldquo;a proportion of proper refugees and genuine asylum seekers&rdquo;. We then have the wonderful statistic dreamed up by the Senator that 80% of those who come here from Romania are bogus. There was no justification for this. It just happened to be a nice round figure that appealed to him on the spur of the moment. One needs to put properly established figures on the record of the House, not something that suddenly enters one's right ear in a moment of manic inspiration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a wonderful lack of rationality about it. He blissfully went on to point out <Col N="1369" /> that Romania is in the process of trying to join the European Union. In a few years therefore the borders will be open. That being the case, why are we desperately engaging in this propaganda war against Romanian asylum seekers? I am very worried about this.</P>
      <P>The Senator congratulated the Minister on going to Romania. I understand that arrangements have been made for Romanian and Nigerian police to come here. That really worries me. These are the people who may have been abusing the victims and are to be brought here to serve as judges in cases where they may well have been the miscreants. What kind of standing do the Romanian and Nigerian police have that the Minister should seek to place them on the same footing as the Garda Síochána?</P>
      <P>With regard to fingerprinting, I am not the slightest bit happy because it places people at a secondary level and creates a kind of two stream society. One fingerprints criminals. Has any evidence been adduced to show there is a higher proportion of criminal activity among those applying for asylum or refugee status than among any other group of visitors? Why do we not fingerprint everybody, including tourists? A number of those who come here from England are perhaps criminal in their own way. Some of the gangs which come here which have been established as not being of Irish origin come here perfectly legally on European Union passports. Because they appear to be different they are treated as asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>I worry a little about these issues and I am afraid that we may also have a tragedy like Dover. I share the concerns of Senator Connor in particular on the issue. He obviously received the same briefing as I did from Amnesty International in the aftermath of this tragedy in which 58 people died. While we condemn the trade in human beings, there is a moral as well as a legal responsibility. As a country we have to accept some of the responsibility. What are the conditions in these countries that are driving them out? Why should people want to leave their homes and the culture in which they have lived? Part of the motivation is that we are entering a kind of fortress Europe. Day by day we are closing down the legal avenues &ndash; the proper avenues &ndash; by which people can make application. They are literally being forced into the hands of the traffickers.</P>
      <P>On a global scale we are colluding, as a member of the European Union, in the growing inequality between northern and southern economies. We are profiteering from this. The Minister's phrases can equally be applied to this country. He said that the traffickers have no concern for the good of anyone or anything except themselves and their wallets. Is that not the attitude that we as a country are taking to those who are financially disadvantaged? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very interesting series of articles in <i>The Irish Times </i>today. The leading article looks at the question of trafficking in humanity and <Col N="1370" /> refers to one of the most worrying legal aspects of the Bill, that is, the restriction on the right to judicial review being placed on refugees and asylum seekers. It reads:</P>
    <P>In the last few months, however, other provisions have been grafted onto the Bill by the Minister for Justice, Mr. O'Donoghue, and the legislation now curtails the access of asylum seekers to the Courts. This is an unfortunate development and blurs the distinction that should exist between asylum seekers and immigrant workers and those criminal gangs they pay to help them cross EU boundaries. In the same way, the recent Government decision to automatically finger-print asylum seekers creates a negative image of asylum seekers in the public mind.</P>
    <P>The effect of one section of the Bill therefore is to place asylum seekers and refugees in the same category as the criminal gangs which are brought into play to try to get them into this country.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention briefly to a letter which coincidentally appears on the same page from Mr. Piaras Mac Einri, director, Irish Centre for Migration Studies, National University of Ireland, Cork, in which he asks in a very eloquent way the questions I have just asked. Why should people in the first case seek to leave their own country and come to the island of Ireland? He writes:</P>
    <P>People do not leave their homes and countries on a whim. One would not normally choose to travel in the back of a sealed lorry either. Nor can I imagine that people would choose, if more attractive alternatives were available, to go to places where they are likely to be reviled as criminals, &ldquo;illegals&rdquo; and spongers.</P>
    <P>That is why, apart from anything else, we should be very concerned about the language we use in describing people who are seeking asylum in this country. He concludes as follows:</P>
    <P>The criminal gangs are indeed evil, but they are a symptom, not a cause. Through our silence and acquiescence in the inequalities between north and south, we are parties to all of this misery. The alternative is to build north-south links and to work for a more equitable world. It will hurt and we will have to give up a lot of privileges, including that of asserting our exclusive right to a disproportionate share of the world's resources. A more open immigration policy and a more generous development policy would be a good start.</P>
    <P>I referred to language. I am very glad that there is a certain human tone in the Minister's speech in which he refers to the welcome traditionally given by Irish people. I am one of those who made the point that in his normal run of speeches up to this there has simply been a hard-headed attack on the rights of asylum seekers. He talks about the status of Ireland as the Ireland of the <Col N="1371" /> welcomes but what kind of welcome did the Richardsons receive &ndash; the man who was stabbed and very nearly lost his life in Pearse Street? From where did that kind of negative energy come in the streets of our capital city to innocent people visiting their family? That is what worries me. There has been a growing attitude of antagonism fed by unwise words from political leaders of all kinds.</P>
    <P>We are told that we are being targeted as a destination for illegal immigration. Again we have to ask why that is the case. Why is this happening? The Minister acknowledges the increase and states that it does not occur by accident. Asylum seekers, many of whom do not even know what their destination is, often tell of large sums of money paid to traffickers. I would like the Minister to give us a more detailed analysis and present some figures. This is anecdotal. There should be more substance to it. The Minister said it is known from intelligence sources that taxis and private vehicles are daily travelling from Northern Ireland and discharging their illegal passengers in Dublin. That may be so, but will he provide the House with specific cases? It would convince me if there were details, facts, figures, times, numbers and registration numbers. I presume convictions will arise following the passing of the Bill and I ask the Minster to return to the House after six months and provide us with a report, complete with details of the number of convictions.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that there would an education programme. That is important. If a proper education programme had been in place perhaps the people who set upon the unfortunate Richardson family might not have done so because I am sure their actions were the result of a level of ignorance.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that in section 5 he is making technical changes to the Refugee Act to facilitate the commencement of the Act in full. Will he provide detailed information about when the full implementation of the Act will occur? It appears to remain a hazy aspiration.</P>
    <P>I welcome some aspects of the Bill. The Minister said it will criminalise the activities of traffickers, including traffickers in asylum seekers, but such criminalisation will not in any way affect the rights of the individual asylum seeker. That very important point was emphasised by the various agencies to whom I spoke in seeking briefing material. The Minster went on to say that in so far as the asylum seeker is concerned, the position concerning his or her admission to the State and the processing of his or her application remains unchanged. I welcome that.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision in section 2(2) that the offence is committed only when the entry to the State of the illegal immigrant or asylum seeker is facilitated for gain. I read the Bill carefully to ensure this was the case. It is important that only those involved in a commercial transaction should be subject to this kind of criminal <Col N="1372" /> provision. There may well be circumstances where an organisation, individual or group may seek to assist somebody whose initial entry to the country is not fully covered by the law. This is especially relevant when considering cases from places like the land of my birth, which has already been referred to &ndash; the so-called Democratic Republic of the Congo, where people are endangered if they are returned. It would be honourable for organisations, groups and individuals to try to assist people in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Is there a list of unsafe countries? Senator O'Donovan referred to the slave trade in Africa centuries ago. It was not centuries ago. It is happening in Sudan today, yet apparently we are prepared to return people to that jurisdiction. I handled a case where a well qualified person from Sudan had extreme difficulty in getting asylum status, even though the person's family had been embroiled in politics to such an extent that there is no doubt that he would be murdered if sent back. I therefore welcome the Minister's assurance that those who act for humanitarian purposes or because of family links do not commit an offence under the Bill. It is important that we extend a net to catch the profiteer rather than direct the energies of the State against people who are fleeing from an impossible situation.</P>
    <P>Certain criteria regarding judicial review, identified by the former Chief Justice Finlay in the case of G <i>v.</i> the DPP, are laid down. I have no difficulty with that, but I regret the restriction placed on asylum seekers in terms of the entitlement to seek a judicial review. The Minister said it is his intention to proceed with the commencement of the Refugee Act in full on the enactment of the Bill and that he would shortly publish the detailed secondary legislation necessary for the smooth operation of that Act. I assume that means it will be published during this calendar year.</P>
    <P>I give the Bill a very qualified welcome. We need to be careful. For example, Senator Connor referred to the case that occurred in Belgium some years ago where a woman was killed by Belgian officials during the process of deportation. She had been very distressed and became hysterical and was sat on by officers until she smothered to death. I do not believe we want to see that in this country.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan said the Dutch lorry driver involved in the Dover case is guilty. It is dangerous to assume that. He may be, but we do not know. We must wait until the case is over. On one of the morning programmes on the wireless yesterday or the day before, a Dutch truck driver who is resident in Ireland and works for an Irish company gave his story about how, when travelling through Dover and driving along a motorway in England, he heard banging from inside the truck container. He thought the load had shifted and looked in his mirror as a precaution and saw hands waving. He was afraid to stop in case the people concerned would escape or attack him. He contacted the police authorities on his mobile <Col N="1373" /> phone and they created a reception area into which he drove. The people were removed by the police. That man was terrified he would be charged with being complicit in what had happened, even though he was not. He had no knowledge of the people involved but he managed to alert the police. What would have happened if he had not been aware of the presence of people in his truck until he arrived at a port or destination where he would have been investigated by the police? Some lorry drivers may be guilty, but not all. It is dangerous to assume guilt on the part of any individual before they have been given due process.</P>

      <P>This Minister has introduced 26 Bills and more are on the way. He is to be commended for the amount of work he has done and is doing on all aspects of this issue, whether it be child trafficking, drug trafficking or human trafficking, which is very serious.</P>
      <P>People seek to make a song and a dance about deportations and fingerprinting. Those of our own people who do not meet the immigration criteria for entry to the US are deported back to this country. They arrive at Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport.

That is the current procedure, not that which operated 25, 30 or 50 years ago when it was also the practice.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that in the poll 75% of people came out in favour of fingerprinting. No matter what measure one tries to enact in Ireland, 25% of the people will oppose it. My interpretation, therefore, is that 100% of the people surveyed were actually in agreement with fingerprinting.</P>

      <P>Another criticism of the Minister &ndash; I will not speak about him further because I will let the public do that &ndash; was that he lacked sympathy. When there was a crisis in Kosovo, he was the one who put out his hand across the water and brought those people to County Kerry first, and the people of Kerry welcomed them with open arms. Yet it is said that he lacks sympathy. When he saw a crisis, a genuine refugee crisis, he acknowledged it.</P>
      <P>With regard to asylum seekers, illegal immigrants or whatever one wants to them, there are definitely different categories. It is like lies, damn lies and statistics. There are the rogue traffickers and there are genuine asylum seekers, and the Minister's heart lies with the genuine asylum seekers. He wants to make sure that the genuine applicant will get a fair crack of the whip and will be documented and processed properly, and that is what the Bill is all about.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. There is a huge amount contained in it, but many parts of it are too soft. I would certainly go a great deal further.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to the number of Romanians coming here and asked why the Minister would not let them in now because Romania will join the EU in a couple of years. I welcome the process by which other countries are trying to join the EU, and I welcome all of these people. However, when they become citizens of the EU and enjoy freedom of movement within the EU, they will not need to come here to be housed or to get social welfare. They will come here, apply for a job and get accommodation like any other person travelling in any part of Europe.</P>
      <P>I have travelled to many parts of the world. I and my family and friends had to seek out jobs and accommodation and we did not have our hands out to the state.</P>

Are we going to tell these people to put another 58 people in a container tomorrow and the following day and let him make another £2 million or £5 million? Will we let such people send them across Europe with a death sentence?</P>
      <P>The Minister is too soft in proposing that traffickers should have to forfeit their container, etc. If I was in the Minister's position, I know exactly what I would do with them. I would confiscate their boats, planes and homes as he did with the drug traffickers when he made a job of it. I would go a small step further with anybody who was engaged in the trafficking of people, which is a dreadful practice.</P>

It has been brought to my notice that in Nigeria there is somebody running advertisements promising passage to a European country of choice on receipt of £18,000.

It promises food and £100 spending money per week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This reminds me of a recent statement by the Irish bishops. The Minister took them up on it and rightly so. They said that we must put our hand out to these people and help them. We are helping them. In my county there are about 350 such people. They are welcome, but there should be 350 people in all the counties. We should all put out the hand of friendship to these people who are genuine cases who need to be looked <Col N="1376" /> after, the people who are being ill-treated and are under threat in their own countries.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the outrage about fingerprinting. It is normal to have a photograph on a passport, for instance. One cannot get on an plane now without some form of identification. We must know who people are, although, of course, people give false names.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which Senator O'Donovan referred and about which I was amazed is that 3,000 of them are missing. They have disappeared into thin air. To where did these 3,000 unfortunate asylum seekers disappear? Were they not happy with the accommodation we were providing for them?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill or perhaps I should say that I welcome that part of it which is covered by the scope of its Short Title. I do not consider it appropriate to tie into the Bill, which is about trafficking in illegal immigrants as the Minister stated, amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, because that is a totally different subject altogether. It is almost mischievous to confuse the two and address them in one Bill. The tragedy in Dover draws to our attention the seriousness of the situation. However, it should not blind us to the fact that such misfortunes occur regularly throughout the world, not just in Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>Traffickers in immigration are exploiting a worldwide need created by an imbalance between wealthy and poorer nations. There is no comparison between the two and, to a person in one of those poverty-stricken nations, the prospect of escaping to a better life in the richer part of the world is too tempting and almost impossible to resist. They readily believe the most unrealistic promises made to them. They are willing to undertake journeys such as that which ended in Dover and to risk death. Senator Dan Kiely spoke of what is happening in Nigeria. I was not aware of that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While no words could describe the contempt we feel for traffickers who exploit that need and demand and the aspirations of those people, we should be realistic about the conditions which permit that trafficking to thrive and which almost foster it. Trafficking in illegal immigrants takes place because rich countries are effectively closed off to people from poorer countries. This is largely true of Canada, the United States and <Col N="1378" /> Australia, it is almost totally true of Europe and is, without reservation, true of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As far as someone from a poor country is concerned, the term &ldquo;illegal immigrant&rdquo; in Ireland is an oxymoron, a contradiction in terms. There is no process of legal immigration. When one speaks of &ldquo;illegal immigration&rdquo;, one means immigration, because we do not have legal immigration, with the exception of the limited work permits scheme, which is restricted to a narrow range of people who have the particular skills we want. For a person without those skills, which means almost everyone, Ireland presents a closed door to their face. It does not have a system of legal immigration. We do not offer even a small number of them the opportunity to share in or add to our wealth as immigrants often do when they come to a new country. For those people, the only possible way to come through the door we close against them is to do it illegally because we do not have a legal system. In an important sense, our attitude and policy are a charter for the traffickers who exploit immigration.</P>
    <P>I do not argue against cracking down on traffickers as it is an important part of immigration policy &ndash; we are all agreed on that. I oppose its being the whole policy, which it effectively is, and the Bill shows that it is. Neither do I suggest that Ireland or the developed world would ever be able to accommodate everyone who wishes to come here. There will always be an imbalance between those who want to come and those we can accommodate. It will always involve the country to which refugees and immigrants seek to come having to make some tough, hard, arbitrary choices. There will always remain some scope for illegal trafficking and there will always be some residual demand which traffickers will seek to exploit. However, when the policies have the effect of channelling the entire level of demand for migration through the illegal route, perhaps the time has come to question that strategy.</P>
    <P>I have argued in the House for a more generous policy on immigration which would be justified purely on economic grounds. Even if we could hold back our economic growth to half its current level, we would still have a demand for jobs which would exceed the number of people ready and able to meet it. The gap is not just a skills but also a labour gap. The shortage of people to fill jobs is likely to have the most dramatic effect at the lower rather than the higher end of the scale. That has not been said often enough nor is it understood. In purely economic terms, we have a demand for more people. There is a ready supply of such people who, as we have seen, are prepared to spend all their resources and risk their lives to come knocking on the doors of the western world. Despite that, we in Ireland do all in our power to keep that door shut in their faces and leave all humanitarian and moral considerations out of the discussion. This approach does not make economic sense. I refer specifically to the economic wisdom of what we are doing and leave aside the ethics and morality of it. <Col N="1379" /> When we take into consideration the humanitarian and moral considerations, the case for doing things a different way becomes unanswerable. We must find another way.</P>
    <P>I do not say the legislation should not be part of that different way, but I cannot help feeling that there is a certain sense of unreality about it, that we are not living in the real world. What makes Ireland an attractive destination for traffickers to bring people to? By all accounts, it is the length of time it takes for an application for asylum to be resolved. That is in our hands. The time taken keeps lengthening because the level of applications and applicants keeps exceeding the increase in resources allocated to deal with the problem. Ireland is becoming more attractive as a destination as the waiting time increases, and that is what has been happening for the past few years because we have not handled the problem.</P>
    <P>While that is the reality, it is not an inevitable reality. We could easily break this logjam by means of an amnesty for those already here, and that was suggested by the bishops some months ago. While we could do that, the suggestion was rejected out of hand by the Minister, and I can understand why. He said an amnesty would encourage more people to come here. However, it would have the reverse effect if it were accompanied by a strong signal that any future applicants would be dealt with quickly. There should be an amnesty for those already here but it should be accompanied by a serious decision, announcement and determination to ensure we deal quickly with future applicants. It is the growing time lag in resolving applications which continues to make Ireland an attractive place for asylum seekers, yet all that has been achieved by the best efforts of the Minister and his Department is a lengthening of the queue. Is there no one in this labyrinth of a Department who has the courage to say that it is madness, that it is not working and that it will not work?</P>
    <P>We need a policy for immigration. What we have is a policy for stopping immigration. Apart from being ineffective, the approach is both economically and morally indefensible. We should not pass the Bill without sending at the same time a clear message to the Government that this policy is no longer enough. We have an opportunity to do something about it now. We must find a solution and that solution is in our hands in this Bill. Time should not pass without doing something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the legislation. The Minister has been very specific in dealing with legislation covering many national issues within his remit. The Bill is part of an overall policy to deal with immigrants and it deals with a specific issue which faces the country and with which we must deal in a proper, civilised and legal manner. As Irish citizens and parliamentarians we should deal with our fellow man in a fair and equal manner. <Col N="1380" /> As members of the EU we have a national responsibility to deal with this matter. Ireland is one of a large number of countries which have great numbers of immigrants arriving on a regular basis. For the first three months of this year we have had something in the region of 3,600 immigrants. Countries as large as the UK have something in the region of 18,600 immigrants. This is something which Europe is being faced with, particularly the EU.</P>
      <P>I accept the premise and purpose of the Bill. It is necessary to have a structure in place to deal with the developments which are emerging. I welcome the Government's interest in setting out structures which are common to other European countries in dealing with immigrants in a fair and reasonable manner. We are wealthy countries and offer good opportunities. We are entitled to carry some of the responsibility regarding immigration from many African and eastern countries which are coming through difficult transitional periods.</P>
      <P>It is important and fair that the Bill protects the interests of people who come here on humanitarian grounds and organisations involved in bringing people to this country. Members of the Opposition who have contributed to the debate, including Senator Norris, have recognised the balance of the Bill, particularly with regard to some of the conditions written under the different articles for the protection of genuine, innocent immigrants who come here of their own free will and in great need due to strife and difficulties in their own countries.</P>
      <P>We have our own emigrants who become immigrants in other countries. Statistics have shown that more than 80 Irish people have sought asylum in Sweden in the first three months of this year. This is an indication that we contribute to those seeking asylum in other countries and it is important that this is realised. These people are looking for a better life; perhaps some are from the North. We have an obligation to deal with this matter. I recognise the need to have structures in place and to have an organised approach in dealing with immigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had recent meetings with asylum seekers and a way should be found to allow genuine people to contribute to our economy. These people feel they can work and make a positive contribution to the State. I understand that accommodation is being paid for by the taxpayer through the Government but some people are tied within the area they live. Some of these people could make a personal contribution but there are restrictions on them. There must be an improvement in the humanitarian approach by allowing people a little freedom within the area where they live. There should be flexibility in dealing with those who want to participate and make genuine contributions to our economy. The period of assessment and examination is extremely long. I understand the purpose of the Bill and the changes with regard to the structures <Col N="1381" /> of judicial review. It is important that applications are dealt with efficiently, effectively and that final conclusions are reached.</P>
    <P>The provisions being put in place for dealing with traffickers in people are not excessive &ndash; they are reasonable and understandable and I hope they will deal effectively with them. One can see from the Internet the growth in this business. Where there is money to be made people will take advantage of it. Governments and states must seek to provide structures and laws to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister's considerations with regard to changing the Immigration Act under this Bill and something must be done about the number of people who have not dealt with the State institutions, the Garda or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is important this matter is dealt with effectively but the Bill will be of benefit in that regard. It will help the Government consider justifiable ways, perhaps in a European and an Irish State context, to take a different approach in dealing with people's long-term needs. Until such time as we deal with the logjam of people we will be unable to make necessary changes to deal with the occupational needs of our State.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister is extremely humane. Human rights should be a central plank to our legislation and I respect the Minister's view that we must act in a proper and balanced manner. I support the Bill, the contents of which are generally fair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his comprehensive presentation in introducing this legislation. I speak as somone in a constituency with the greatest number of asylum seekers and refugees. About one fifth to one quarter of asylum seekers are accommodated in Dublin central. If there are 20,000 plus asylum seekers there are between 4,000 and 5,000 asylum seekers in that area. There are a couple of hundred refugees in various other parts of the country, including major urban areas from Galway to Cork and Wexford &ndash; this does not reflect the figures from the Minister's Department &ndash; but we know where a disproportionate number of asylum seekers are located. This gives rise to problems which are not being addressed.</P>
      <P>Many Members spoke about the terrible tragedy in Dover where 58 people suffocated in a truck travelling from Zeebrugge. The people responsible should be prosecuted. Every effort should be made to find them. If traffickers were involved in that tragedy they should be dealt with severely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tourist from England was almost killed here because of his colour. He was not an asylum seeker. The racist language used during that attack is a very worrying trend in our society. There was a very serious outbreak of violence when a shop in Parnell Street was attacked a few weeks ago. Many parts of my constituency are <Col N="1382" /> sprayed with graffiti which is openly racist. These issues are the manifestation of the problem.</P>
    <P>The bishops, Amnesty International, the Irish Refugee Council and other organisations which represent asylum seekers are very critical of the measures being introduced by the Minister. They feel he is using a very heavy hand in dealing with the problem and that in many cases he misses the point. It is almost like Don Quixote tilting at windmills, the Minister is missing the core of the problem. The Minister's record on this issue and others is not good. Yesterday we discussed the Offences Against the State Act, 1998, which introduced very tough and, as described by the Taoiseach, draconian measures in the aftermath of Omagh. Very little return has been elicited from the very heavy measures introduced regarding the right to silence, the period of detention and inferences that might be taken. No prosecutions have been made even though the Act has been in operation for two years. We must ensure that legislation hits the target, otherwise we are enacting dangerous legislation, particularly if it is tough and draconian.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to prohibit trafficking in illegal immigrants. That is a very desirable objective but, as Senator Quinn said, we are tagging on amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, and providing for a number of other related matters. The thrust of the Bill is penalising and attacks traffickers and asylum seekers. It is not clear whether section 2, which deals with people who organise or help others to enter the country, relates to those who do so with good intent or those who do so clearly for gain. The distinction is not clear enough to meet our international duties under the Geneva Convention, 1951. Section 4 deals with the detention of vehicles, ships and aircraft. A person may not question the validity of their refusal, exclusion, determination or decision except by way of judicial review. The Bill also changes the normal period of time in which application may be made for a judicial review from three months to two weeks. There is a different law for the asylum seeker and the Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>Section 7 grants powers to a sergeant &ndash; it is a superintendent in the Offences Against the State Act, 1998 &ndash; to search a person or place and seize goods. It is an offence to obstruct the Garda in doing so. Any member of the Garda may arrest without warrant anybody he or she suspects of being in breach of a deportation order. It appears as though the Minister is directing all his ammunition in one direction and not paying attention to other areas.</P>
    <P>Our history in terms of emigration goes back 150 years. Many of our citizens have worked illegally in other countries. I was amused to hear Senator Kiely's diatribe, given the magnificent role he has played in Kerry in trying to rehabilitate illegal Irish emigrants in the United States. Rumour had it he had commissioned an Aer Lingus aircraft to bring 15,000 to 20,000 Morrison visas to people living illegally in the United States. While Senator Kiely supported economic <Col N="1383" /> refugees and asylum seekers around Kerry, he does not appear to have a good word to say about them when they are coming into this country. He was a wonderful defender and supporter of those leaving the country.</P>
    <P>We must look at the current situation. When Mayo played New York in a Gaelic game here last year, seven of the 15 players from the New York team had great difficulty getting home because they did not have proper papers. They were illegal economic immigrants. The GAA had to plead long and hard for New York to participate in the football championship this year. Many of our people are living abroad as illegal economic immigrants. We must be very careful about what we say and do.</P>
    <P>The Minister misses the point on a number of occasions. This legislation does not deal with traffickers. Traffickers are international operators. We need international policing of the problem. We will not find these traffickers in Ireland. They will be found in Asia, Central Europe and Africa. How can this legislation deal with them? It will not. It is meaningless because traffickers will not be found in this jurisdiction. This is a bit like our drugs legislation though at least most of the drug barons were living in Ireland when the legislation was introduced &ndash; most of them now live outside Ireland. The only way we can deal with them now is by way of international policing. Only one line of this Bill which states, &ldquo;European Union legislation will prescribe a common approach to the criminalisation of trafficking in human beings&rdquo; refers to international policing. This matter was discussed at the European summit in Portugal last weekend. That is not an indication of any great alacrity. We must focus on international policing of traffickers if we are to deal with the problem. Most of what I fear about this legislation is what is appended to it, the amendments to the 1996 Act and the other provisions which dilute the rights of people who come to this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look again at Government policy. What is the real issue? The real issue is that people do not come to this country because of persecution in their homeland. The reality is that we have no framework in place to process economic migrants or immigrants. Such people have no choice but to couch their application in other terms but we all know they are economic immigrants. They are here because of poverty in their own countries and because they want a better life, just as happened in the 150 years of the Irish diaspora up to the last decade. It is high time we looked at the problem in those terms. We have looked at the issue in terms of our capacity to deal with it &ndash; we have an enormous capacity to deal with it given the needs of the workforce. As Senator Quinn said, the booming economy needs those at the bottom of the scale more than high fliers, as we can train the former. They are willing to work and are looking for the right to do so. I agree with the suggestion of an amnesty for those immigrants who have been here for a <Col N="1384" /> year, for example. They could be given the right to work, education and training and could fit into Irish society effectively and efficiently. Those people could make a considerable contribution to society.</P>
    <P>We must put a framework in place to deal with economic migration in the future. That is the nub of the issue. We must also deal with those who come in and give a guarantee that people will be dealt with in six months. That would get rid of the backlog as well as the deportation problem which the Minister knows he cannot deal with. He knows he is making a mess of deportation. There is no deportation policy afoot and that area is not functioning. The sooner the Minister recognises this the better. He knows that the people who have been refused for one reason or other are economic migrants. He must treat them as such and provide them with the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>If we are to deal with this matter in the context of a pluralist society we must provide the funding and structures to do so. We need an education programme in schools and an awareness programme in the workplace and the community. We need those programmes no matter what is done to improve the lot of those immigrants already in Ireland. We need to present ours as a welcoming society that will take in newcomers and that will look on them as equal human beings, as there is an incipient racism abroad. This racism is often fuelled by people who issue statements &ndash; a Deputy in the Minister's constituency has spoken of his area being flooded by 80,000 refugees and has created fears that his area will be swamped. Those remarks were foolish and dangerous. Someone making such remarks should be criticised strongly by the Minister for doing so. Under no circumstances should such a person be allowed to influence legislation like this.</P>
    <P>I am not overjoyed by this legislation as it will be totally ineffective in what it seeks to do with trafficking. The Minister should direct his attention to economic immigrants.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and offer a qualified welcome to the Bill as a necessary retuning of the laws. I recognise the Minister as a hardworking Minister, but I sometimes wish that Ministers for Justice were not quite so hardworking when it comes to legislation. I know the Minister will not take this personally &ndash; this also applies to Home Secretaries. They tend to operate in the short term and reactively. The Minister will gather from Senators' contributions that a much broader context is needed here and that we should examine how people enter this country, how to prepare them to live here and how we prepare our people for that. I share that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill to the extent that it deals with the evil of trafficking. I too deplore the appalling tragedy in Dover and the trafficking that led to it. People are making money out of this practice and it should be stamped out internationally. The incident in Dover seems to be a <Col N="1385" /> bonus for some broadsheet writers in Britain who see it as justification for draconian measures taken in the past and for more of the same. Like Senator Quinn, I draw another conclusion from the Dover episode and the trafficking behind it. It is the product of circumstances Governments have created for themselves and is a bit like prohibition in America. That is what produced the Mafia and other gangs in America.</P>

      <P>That was removed to a degree when prohibition was removed. To concentrate on raising the wall all the time will have the effect of increasing the price people are prepared to pay to get over the wall. We need to be careful about this.</P>
      <P>I took some small exception to the Minister's reference to taxis and private vehicles daily travelling from Northern Ireland and discharging their illegal passengers in Dublin. I hope that does not mean that some of my neighbours who look oriental, Slavic or black will be hauled out of their cars at the Border, as I have seen happen. There are people in the North who would be sniffy about this and say that people were not always so worried in the past 30 years when the traffic was going in the other direction.</P>
      <P>I commend the remarks of Senators Quinn and Chambers and I hope this issue will be put in context, though I am worried about the context in which it is emerging. I commend the Minister on the measured language he used in presenting the Bill, but other comments made during the debate were quite disturbing, even more so if they reflect incipient or nascent racism in society at large. I encourage the Minister to revisit the issue of dealing with those people who are already here, as Senator Quinn said. There is an enormous social problem in this area that needs decisive and courageous action from the Minister to cut the Gordian knot, otherwise I fear the Minister's Department will be overwhelmed by pushing this great stone up the hill to find it rolls down again. Much of the benefit proposed by the speeding up of processes in the Act might well be lost in that way. It is not so long since I was bombarded and lobbied &ndash; though that is not an acceptable word &ndash; about the problems of illegal Irish emigrants in America by people who have already contributed. It seems that we want it both ways, we want our illegals made legal, while we want to keep other people illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn and I raised in a previous debate the absolute economic imperative of open borders, or as open as possible. We need to have a means where people can come and work in this country and where we can use their skills and labour. We should be grabbing these people because if we do not, the economy will suffer grievously in the years ahead. By and large, these people are coming from difficult areas and the majority are extremely hard working people who are prepared to work in jobs, which Irish people are no longer <Col N="1386" /> prepared to take, over long and unsociable hours, particularly in the catering trade and others that are vital to the tourism industry. There is a tradition of attachment to education and they push their children on. I have no doubt they have the capacity to make an enormous contribution to this country if we prepare ourselves to receive them and are open.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister's problems. I welcome the efforts he is making in the Bill to deal with them in the short term but I hope it is not, in any sense, a substitute for all of us taking a broad look at immigration, the economic and social aspects of it and how it can be helped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister but I am not sure I can give a warm welcome to the Bill. Like other Senators, I believe it only addresses a symptom of the problems we have. I understand the concern everyone has about dealing with those who are profiting from this grim human trade but this trade has been going on for a very long time and countries far more powerful than this have tried to deal with the cartels involved and have not been in a position to stop it. I cannot help but think that this legislation is for our benefit rather than that of those who may be trafficked. This is the most unfortunate point about it.</P>
      <P>As other Senators have said, most people who come to the country are economic refugees and, as has been pointed out, there seems to be a very large market for many of them once they get here. For example, I cannot be the only one who has said &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; to people working in the construction industry, only to be told they speak no English. However, they seem to be getting on particularly well in the job and I am sure the builders employing them have got all the required work permits for them.</P>
      <P>There is a policy, without even looking at the credentials of people who come here, of immediately getting rid of them. I strongly support what Senator Quinn said about our lack of immigration policy and about looking at those who are here already. For example, I have met nurses who are refugees from eastern Europe. I do not know if anyone has tried to employ them but perhaps with a little upgrading of their skills and a little more knowledge of our pharmacopoeia, they could be usefully employed. I have met these people working in the construction trade and I know they are, as Senator Hayes has said, working in the catering industry, although I was sorry when I discovered that even now one of them was being paid £3 an hour. I feel very bad that people are being taken advantage of by those seeking to pay them amounts below the minimum wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have asylum seekers as well and they are being put in the same boat as the economic refugees. I have been in countries from which people have been seeking asylum. It is impossible for them to get out of these places without the assistance of others. They may be under threat of death wherever they are. Lumping refugees and <Col N="1387" /> asylum seekers together has been most unfortunate. Of course they will not have papers and will have forged papers because if they are caught with the right papers on them, their lives would perhaps be finished. There are doctors here from countries which I will not mention. The Irish Medical Council asks them for their papers but they cannot even send someone to the equivalent medical council in the country from which they have come because that person would be at risk for seeking those papers. Putting asylum seekers and refugees together is most unfortunate, but apparently that is what the Minister has decided to do.</P>
    <P>Other countries have tried to deal with these traffickers in human flesh. Since the end of the last war, the trafficking in women and children from eastern Europe to western Europe has been well documented. Some were promised employment in the hotel business, night clubs and so forth, but a large number have ended up in prostitution. Whatever papers they may have had were taken from them. If they feel they are at the mercy of the authorities in the country to which they have come, how can they possibly make their presence and their terrible difficulties known?</P>
    <P>I do not know the number of women and children brought into this country but a young woman from the Far East, who was working as a prostitute in London and who came over here, was murdered. As far as I know, little progress has been made on that murder. How many other girls in similar circumstances are coming to this country? We are making such little effort to do anything about the exploitation of women and children and, I suppose, young men in those circumstances that one could be forgiven for thinking the Government has no policy in this area.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, if we could classify pornographic films made before 1994 because, as one knows, they are widely available in sex shops. Videos, I gather, sell for about £50 each and, I presume, are rented for less. If one looks at any of these videos &ndash; one could not look at them for very long, one would need to use the fast forward button &ndash; there are people of Far Eastern and African nationalities in some of them while, in others, the participants appear to be very young. Surely by not doing everything we can to deal with this trade, we are encouraging it. Again, we know those who are brought from abroad can be very useful to those who make these films.</P>
    <P>The trade used to be from eastern Europe and the Far East to western Europe. I gather there is now a considerable trade from Africa. If one is in France or Italy, in particular, and sees the number of black girls waiting in lay-bys along motorways and other such places, one can just imagine the difficulties they face. They are thousands of miles from their own country probably having been exported by their families because in some areas the cultural significance of women is not the same <Col N="1388" /> as in Europe. With the type of legislation we are bringing forward, they are far less likely to come forward to the authorities than if we did not have such legislation.</P>
    <P>In many cases, we have not even tried to devise a policy of interviewing women asylum seekers or refugees as individuals, especially if they do not speak English. They are looked on as an appendage of whatever males they are with. It is important to remember that those they may be with may be exploiting them. I ask the Minister to try to ensure that interviews with women are done separately unless they specifically request that they are not to be parted from whoever they are with and that they are given the chance to talk to women interviewers because, in some cultures, to admit to rape or even sexual harassment could mean death because it is a crime of honour. We have even seen this happen in public places in other countries. There is an enormous amount of work to do in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn and the bishops have urged the Minister to grant an amnesty to those already here. I deal with a large number of these people because, as I pointed out to the Minister some time ago, it has become very popular to have a baby in Ireland. The pregnant woman has never been more valuable than if she comes here and has a baby as she, her child and other members of the family are entitled to reside in Ireland and the child is entitled to the care and comfort of his or her family. I hope we will not change this position. We could do so as a short-term measure and regret it in ten years because we might not be a favoured destination for refugees at that stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not think about this before tomorrow, but I suggest it is foolish to introduce legislation such as this, particularly when we were the recipients of the goodwill of other countries to which Irish people travelled. Those people had to work hard but a large number of the refugees I have come across are prepared to do likewise, and a considerable number of them have skills from which we could benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill. The Minister stated that Ireland has become an attractive country in which to live because of its economic success delivered by the Government's polices, for which I compliment all concerned.</P>
      <P>No one wanted to come here ten or 15 years ago when Ireland was not economically viable. Thousands left the country but they did not do so in the back of containers and they were not carried out of the country by Irish racketeers. Such practices are taking place at present and that is the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill, any person who organises or knowingly facilitates the entry into the State of a person whom he or she knows to be an illegal immigrant will be guilty of an offence punishable on conviction on indictment to an unlimited fine or up to ten years in prison, or both. That is right. Provision has also been made for the forfeiture <Col N="1389" /> of the means of transport used for trafficking in illegal immigrants.</P>
    <P>The background to the Bill has been well publicised and involves incidents where groups of people are smuggled into the State in goods containers in an attempt to evade normal immigration checks. llegal immigrants are forced to pay thousands of pounds up front by racketeers to gain entry to this country. It does not stop there, because once these people are in the country they are obliged to continue making payments. These people's lives are at risk or are under threat if they do not do so, but since they have no jobs where is the money to come from? A person in such a desperate situation would have to come up with the money by fair means or foul. Everyone knows what I mean by that.</P>
    <P>The Minister is concerned by the level of exploitation being perpetrated by organised criminal elements who arrange the movement of vulnerable individuals across European borders under extremely dangerous conditions. The measures in the Bill are in line with those taken by other EU member states.</P>
    <P>Several speakers have referred to the tragic incident this week in which 58 people died in a container lorry travelling to Dover. This incident demonstrates the Minister's well-founded concerns on this issue. There is a need to prosecute the perpetrators of crimes such as the trafficking in human beings.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to Senator O'Donovan's comments when he suggested the driver was guilty. I would wait for due process, but it is unusual that the first thing that gentleman did when he was stopped was run from the scene. This does not suggest anything to me but I will wait for due process.</P>
    <P>There is a legal obligation on all drivers to check their loads before leaving for their destination, but I wonder if that is happening. I am sure there are isolated cases in which innocent drivers are caught up in this trade but, by and large, this crime is well organised.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated it is essential we fully honour our international obligations in respect of genuine asylum seekers and refugees who have nothing to fear from this legislation. Comprehensive and fair procedures have been put in place to deal with the backlog of asylum applications and current applications. However, it is vital to send a clear signal to those engaged in trafficking in illegal immigrants that the further exploitation of immigrants and the evasion of immigration procedures will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the legislation are based on the recommendations of the report of the interdepartmental committee on immigration, asylum and related issues, which was accepted by the Government. The Government also approved the drafting of amendments to the Immigration Act, 1999, by means of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, the net effect of which will be to strengthen the deportation procedure so as to provide the Garda with powers to detain a <Col N="1390" /> deportee at the same time as a deportation order is being served if it suspects, with reasonable cause, that the person who is the subject of the order will evade a requirement of that order.</P>
    <P>Illegal immigrants are given three chances, they have the right to make an application, to appeal a decision on that application and to seek a judicial review. Senator Dan Kiely rightly pointed out that, in contrast, if one arrives at John F. Kennedy Airport, or any other airport in the US, and one's papers are not in order, one is put on the next flight out of the country. That does not happen here and people are given a fair chance to prove whether they should be accommodated.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided additional resources on an ongoing basis and has succeeded in implementing measures which have resulted in the more efficient processing of applications. The solution lies in further improving the processing of applications. If we can reach a situation whereby applications are dealt with speedily, and the Minister is committed to achieving that objective, the massive influx of illegal immigrants will drop dramatically.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between genuine refugees and illegal immigrants. Senator Norris referred to do-gooders, and such people exist in these Houses and outside. However, when these people speak in public, they conveniently ignore the difference between these two groups and the fact they are both seeking asylum, but for different reasons. I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their constructive contributions to the debate on this important Bill. The debate has been wide-ranging and touched on many facets of the immigration question and related issues in the areas of asylum and refugees. I will try to deal with as many points as I can and look forward to a more detailed examination of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It has been obvious from the debate that we have all struggled to find words to express our total abhorrence and shock at the tragic event in the UK last weekend in which 58 young lives were lost due to the callous disregard for life on the part of those who trade in human beings. This tragic event starkly underlines the need for this Bill which will ensure that our criminal law can deal effectively with those who seek to exploit asylum seekers and other immigrants by engaging in the despicable trade of trafficking in human beings. Unfortunately this is a well recognised international trade and we must stand shoulder to shoulder with our colleagues in the EU in combating this international evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immigration phenomenon continues to evolve rapidly in this country and we are also witnessing a significant increase in the number of people seeking asylum. Accordingly, there is a need to ensure that the procedures for dealing with immigration and asylum matters continue to <Col N="1391" /> be fitted to the needs of those processes and of those involved.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes amendments to the deportation process resulting from actual experience and is designed to make practical improvements to the effectiveness of that process. The Bill also provides a statutory judicial review process tailored to the requirements of actual cases in the immigration and asylum areas. These provisions have been carefully designed in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General to ensure that the effective working of these procedures continues to be consistent with legal principles, with the Constitution and with our human rights obligations, as reflected in the various international instruments to which Ireland has subscribed.</P>
    <P>Most importantly, the Bill puts in place the final technicalities to enable me to proceed with the commencement of the Refugee Act and thereby implement an important policy objective of the Government from the outset, namely, to put on a statutory footing the independent processes for the assessment of claims for the protection of the State under the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the specific points raised by Senators. In general terms, my party colleagues were supportive of what I am trying to achieve. I appreciate their comments and perhaps they will understand why I will deal with the critical points as opposed to those which were supportive. I am afraid that Senator Connor fails to appreciate either the scope of application of the judicial review procedures in section 5 of the Bill or the actual distinction between refugees, asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. A cursory glance at section 5 (1) clarifies what procedures are catered for. They include all the various steps in the normal immigration processes of entry to and removal from the State, which apply to a wide range of persons who have never sought asylum in the State as well as to those whose asylum claims have been found to be groundless. Section 5 also applies to the various steps in the asylum process as well as to notorious international war criminals or those against whom exclusion orders have been made.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor is wrong to portray the provisions as applying to refugees and asylum seekers. They do not apply to refugees at all. Senator Connor continues to use these two terms in the same breath, as if they were coterminous. This underlines his failure to grasp a very important distinction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>A refugee is a person in flight from persecution in his or her home country. An asylum seeker, on the other hand, is a person asserting that he or she is a refugee who may or may not be. An asylum seeker can turn out to be a refugee but he or she can also turn out to be an economic or illegal immigrant. The <Col N="1392" /> sad fact is that many asylum seekers do not turn out to be refugees but are people using the asylum process to circumvent our normal immigration controls. In so doing, they abuse the hospitality of the host country and the right of those genuinely in need of the protection of the State to obtain sanctuary.</P>
      <P>I cannot tell by looking at an asylum seeker whether he or she is a refugee. Only the very careful and arduous process of investigation of each case can discern that. While that process is going on, we ensure that asylum seekers have food, shelter, medical attention, care and so on. However, if at the end of the process, it turns out that person is not a refugee but an illegal immigrant, I surely owe it to those who are refugees and to society generally to ensure the illegal immigrant goes home.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor referred to a number of tragic cases abroad where the deportation process resulted in the death of the person being deported. I assure Senator Connor that I will always try to ensure deportations are carried out humanely with the least risk to all concerned. In this context, deportees are generally accompanied on their journey home by immigration officers to ensure their safety and that of any other passengers on board.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor quoted the concern of Amnesty International that the Refugee Act is not yet fully implemented and the principle of non-refoulement is, therefore, on shaky ground. This ignores the fact that section 5 of the Refugee Act, which I commenced in September 1997, stitches that concept into Irish law. I have already indicated that once the technical amendments to the Refugee Act contained in this Bill are enacted, I will be commencing the Refugee Act in its entirety, in fulfilment of my and the Government's commitment to do that.</P>
      <P>Like many commentators, Senator Connor seeks to make a comparison between immigration to Ireland and what happened to Irish emigrants in the United States of America. While I obviously welcome the fact that people express concern regarding Irish people who were obliged to emigrate and what happens those who emigrate here, it is important, at the very least from an historical perspective, that the record be put straight. It is not true that the Irish who emigrated to the United States of America in the 18th and 19th centuries and for the vast majority of the 20th century were illegal immigrants, no more than those who were obliged to emigrate to Australia or Britain were. In the vast majority of cases, they were not illegal immigrants.</P>

      <P>I never said Nigerian police would be located in this country. I have made an arrangement with the government of Romania, which the President of America described as a republic on a visit there, to have two policemen come to this country to liaise and assist. There was never any discussion of the possibility of Nigerian policemen coming here. I am entering into discussions with the Nigerian ambassador and I hope to meet him shortly to discuss the immigration of Nigerian people to this country. An agreement is in place with Romania and I am pleased about the arrangement on re-admissions.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> The accusation has been made that by fingerprinting asylum seekers coming into the State they are being stigmatised or criminalised. I reject that out of hand. It is not the case. These fingerprints are being taken because it will be possible in the future, particularly under Eurodac, to make comparisons with a central European database in order to ascertain whether asylum seekers coming into this State whose fingerprints have been taken have made an application in another state. It will be possible under the Dublin Convention, which was signed here, to return such people to make their applications where they made their first application, in accordance with international law. I am trying to observe international law. There is no question of anyone being stigmatised or criminalised. In any event, as I have already explained, fingerprinting will not apply to children.</P>
    <P>I strongly reject the argument that we are only looking after ourselves. We have a tremendous humanitarian tradition in giving sanctuary to refugees. This has continued under this Government and will continue long after it has left office. I am confident of that. The position is that asylum seekers who are found to be illegal immigrants are not in the same position as refugees. No amount of argument can change that.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris criticised the fingerprinting provisions of the Refugee Act as in some way stigmatising asylum seekers as criminals. Unfortunately, there are facts which must be faced here. Some of them may be unpalatable but, nevertheless, facts are always true. The fact is that people are making two or more applications for asylum under different identities. There have been about 50 such cases in the past year alone. The fact is that people who have already applied for asylum in other EU states are making fresh applications for asylum here. That is why Ireland, in common with all its EU colleagues and many other countries, is introducing fingerprinting, simply, as I said, to distinguish one asylum seeker from another in circumstances where the possession of reliable identity documents is a rarity and to eliminate abuses of the asylum system by multiple applications. That is the express purpose declared in section 9 of the Refugee Act which deals with fingerprinting.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also queried whether there is evidence of trafficking. The facts of what has been happening in this country speak for themselves. Approximately 1,000 asylum seekers arrive here each month. Common sense suggests that 1,000 people do not just decide to come here every month, but that traffickers are at work organising and exploiting at least some of these people. When one considers that approximately half of all asylum applicants are coming from two countries, Nigeria and Romania, and we now have the highest annual number of asylum seekers from these countries in the European Union, common sense suggests that a deliberate targeting and marketing of Ireland in those two <Col N="1395" /> countries is in operation. Furthermore, when one considers that asylum seekers often say on their arrival or when being interviewed by officials in relation to their asylum claims that they paid large amounts of money to agents to arrange their journeys and that in many cases they were unaware of where they were going, one would have to bury one's head in the sand to maintain there is little evidence that trafficking is taking place.</P>
    <P>In addition, operational information available to the Garda about the pattern of trafficking through Northern Ireland, intelligence on suspected traffickers in this State and Garda information on large transfers of money back to countries of origin indicate that trafficking is taking place. If I need to say more to convince Senators of the organised criminal nature of this type of activity, I will point to regular examples of professionally forged registration books and immigration stamps found here and abroad. The Garda is also investigating allegations that Irish passports are being obtained by persons taking on the identities of deceased Irish children.</P>
    <P>I reject completely the suggestion by Senator Norris that we in this country are morally responsible for the callous actions of traffickers because we seek to operate what I describe as the sovereign right to control the people who come to this country. We exercise these controls in accordance with fundamental principles of Irish and international law, which have been well recognised by the courts. Traffickers are subject to no such controls. What we witnessed last weekend in the United Kingdom is evidence of this fact. I resent the comparison made by the Senator.</P>
    <P>The contributions of Senators Quinn and Costello seemed to suggest there is no legal immigration to Ireland. This is utterly mistaken. All one need do is look around to see there is legal immigration to this country. One need only look at Chinese and Indian restaurants, pharmacies and the health service. Foreign doctors have come to our shores for many years, both to learn from our medical schools and to contribute their skills. Unfortunately, it suits some people's agendas to promote the notion there is no means of legal immigration to this State. It is a pity that some have been taken in by that misrepresentation. My Department has a sizeable division dedicated to catering for the many thousands of people who migrate legally into this State every year&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;many of whom, in the fullness of time, obtain citizenship by naturalisation. The falsehood that there is no legal immigration to this country is dangerous because it brings comfort to those who argue that abusing the asylum process by making an unfounded claim of persecution is in some way justifiable. <Col N="1396" /> That is never justifiable &ndash; all it does is to trample on the rights of those who really are persecuted.</P>
      <P>The argument has been made in this House and in other quarters that people who are deemed to be illegal immigrants or whose status has not been determined should be allowed work in the State. It has been seriously suggested to me that the way to fill the labour market is by means of illegal immigration. The result of that suggestion could only be catastrophic. There is no doubt it would mean thousands of people arriving in this State on the assumption that, irrespective of their status, they would be allowed work here. I am not aware of other states which allow an unrestricted right to work of this nature. I have cautioned against it consistently over a three year period. The difficulty is that it would be represented abroad as meaning precisely what I just said, that people coming here would have the certainty of working here. Senators should make no mistake &ndash; that would be an enormous pull factor.</P>
      <P>The argument that it does not make economic sense not to allow people awaiting determination of their applications to work does not stand up. On 26 July 1999 the Government decided, in good faith, that people in the State at that point or those who had been here for a year would have the right to work. That July, over 500 people came into the State. The decision of the Government was clearly misrepresented abroad as meaning that anybody who arrived into the State would be allowed work. Within one month, the numbers coming into the State had almost doubled. I rest my case in regard to the attraction, or otherwise, of the right to work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>The argument has been made that the amount of time before decisions on applications are being dealt with is getting longer. Since coming into office, I have increased the number of staff dealing with this area from 22 to 300. When I took office, 22 people were trying to deal with thousands of applications. Most people did not know&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;when, if ever, they would obtain an interview. That is the reality of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the position now, the Government has agreed in principle that I will be able to take on additional staff. These figures are being agreed at present with the Minister for Finance. The objective of the exercise is to ensure the Government's stated aim of hearing applications within a six month period will be fulfilled. Incidentally, it is always difficult to achieve that when one is dealing with issues of this nature. The necessary legal constraints delimit one's scope for shorten<Col N="1397" /> ing applications. Every application must be heard substantively. On appeal, a person may make the argument that he or she should be allowed stay on humanitarian grounds and there is always the option of judicial review.</P>
    <P>An amnesty was called for in the House this afternoon. I know what would happen if there was an amnesty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It would amount to a call for another amnesty and then other. This may sound blunt, but the result of that would be to create a major pull factor.</P>
      <P>According to Senator Quinn, my only policy is one of stopping immigrants and that it is morally and economically indefensible. I reject that charge for the simple reason that I have a very onerous constitutional responsibility, which I take very seriously, to protect the borders, economy and security of this State. It is not a question of stopping immigrants coming in but of ensuring that people who enter this State are here legally. That is something which each other sovereign government seems to impose without difficulty. For some reason for some considerable time there have been people in Ireland who for historical or other reasons &ndash; I do not know why &ndash; object to what is internationally renowned and respected practice. The difficulty is that while I may be criticised across the Chamber and in the other House in relation to my policies, it is only if I give in or agree that given measures should be conceded that I can prove what I said in the first instance was correct. It is a &ldquo;heads you lose, tails you lose&rdquo; situation.</P>
      <P>I can only tell Members that based on the best advice available to me and on my reading of the situation I firmly and passionately believe that what I am proposing and legislating for is right. This will not be established today or tomorrow, but only when another Minister changes the policy and we see the subsequent consequences. As of now, I am holding my position.</P>

      <P>I share in the condemnation of the recent high profile attacks, apparently motivated by racism, and of many other lower profile but nonetheless abhorrent incidents. My commitment to stamping out racism before it develops to the scale we see in other countries is already a matter of record and I continue to fund practical community based anti-racism measures through the programme established for that purpose. In addition, I have established a committee on racism and interculturalism which is expected to report to me very shortly so that we can embark on a major public awareness campaign to deal with any ignorance which exists among a <Col N="1398" /> small minority about people of a different cultural background.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello suggested the Bill on its own is not enough to deal with the operations of traffickers. The Bill provides specifically for the extra-territorial effect of the offence. Of course, I accept legislation on its own will not deter traffickers and that, in addition, we need international co-operation with police and immigration authorities. The House may be aware that Europol has been given competence to deal with trafficking in human beings and that international police co-operation can be and is used to track the activities of traffickers.</P>
      <P>In this context I express my appreciation to the British Home Secretary and the French Interior Minister for the warmth of the reception they gave me and my officials when we visited them in recent weeks, and in particular for the positive response regarding the concerns we expressed. The necessity for formal contacts between immigration authorities in various jurisdictions on a day to day operational level and at a more formal policy level, has become more apparent than ever. Such contact must also involve carriers such as ferry companies who also have a role to play as the providers of the services which are exploited by those involved in trafficking.</P>
      <P>No doubt Senators are aware that on 8 May 2000 the Government agreed a number of measures in relation to asylum, refugees and immigration matters. These measures include the strengthening of Garda international liaison arrangements by the placing of Garda liaison officers in London and Paris for the purpose of interacting with local law enforcement authorities on immigration matters, with particular emphasis on combating trafficking activity and on departures from major embarkation points to Ireland. On 12 June I met the UK Home Secretary and on 19 June I met the French Interior Minister. The latter meeting took place as the tragic events at Dover were unfolding. I secured the agreement of both Ministers to the proposed placement of the officers in question and their interaction on a pro-active basis with the relevant French and UK authorities on immigration matters in general, with particular emphasis on combating trafficking activity. The officers in question will have a critical role to play in maintaining liaison between our immigration and police services on issues concerning illegal immigration, and in particular in liaison between police and immigration services at ports and airports. I intend that such liaison will continue and be developed. A further meeting at official level has been arranged with the UK and is in the course of being arranged with the French authorities. My intention is to strengthen these contacts even further in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> In the light of these contacts the question of the placement of further liaison officers in particular problem ports or airports will be considered. In so far as the UK is concerned that consideration will have to take account of the existence of the common travel area which results in the imposition of occasional rather than systematic checks on passengers. The common travel area between the respective jurisdictions is of enormous value and relevance to Ireland and its people. Because the vast majority of asylum seekers arrive in the State <i>via</i> the UK or France, the Government recognises that a strengthening of international liaison with those countries in particular is important in identifying information or immigration trends and flows and other immigration related activities.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello said I was attacking the wrong target. I suggest that he is attacking the wrong target, that he is attacking the messenger because of the message. Neither do I agree when he says no real distinction has been made between people operating out of humanitarian motives and traffickers. The difference is clearly spelled out in the legislation, but I look forward to further discussion with him on that tomorrow.</P>

      <P>It is difficult if not impossible to quantify the preventive effects of the Offences Against the State Acts. I suggest they have been extremely successful.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello raised the issue of legal immigration which I have explained exists. I do not at all accept that I or the Government made a hames of deportations. The reality is that the matter was before the High Court for most of last year. Subsequent to that, the Immigration Act, 1999, was enacted. It is true to say that our immigration laws, based on the Aliens Act, 1935, are entirely inadequate for a modern society and do not reflect the far greater degree of mobility and ease of access and egress. These factors are not addressed by the 1935 Act. The Immigration Act, 1999, which arose from the High Court case, was aimed at dealing with that judgment.</P>
      <P>It may come as no surprise to Senator Costello or anybody else that very few take up an invitation, as outlined in legislation, whereby the authorities write to the person to be deported saying they should be at a certain place on a certain date at a certain time so that they can be deported. This has been the precise position in relation to the deportation procedures in the State and that is why&mdash;</P>

    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes said I am in danger of being overwhelmed by a great stone being pushed up a hill. If I do not introduce these measures it will not be one stone which will fall on me but several as the entire system will collapse. It is quite simple. I was informed during my recent <Col N="1401" /> visit that in France alone there will be 10,000 applicants each month. I am the first to accept that the people concerned are vulnerable and unfortunate. The difficulty is that only a percentage of those vulnerable and unfortunate people are refugees for whom international law deals with the issue of sanctuary. Naturally the Government is prepared to obey it. The difficulty on this small island on the periphery of Europe is that I cannot solve the international humanitarian problem. I cannot open the borders of the State and state that I could make a dent on the problem.</P>

      <P>I have put the position as well as I can. Senator Henry spoke about the exploitation of women and children, a matter about which I am also concerned. We have introduced legislation to deal with the dissemination of child pornography over the Internet. We are also seeking to ensure interviews are held, people's human dignity is respected and every human being is treated properly and with great dignity. There is no intention of changing the rule whereby a child born on the island of Ireland becomes an Irish citizen. That is the position under the Constitution and part of the Good Friday Agreement. It was a statutory right; it is now a constitutional right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. The immigration process generally and the asylum process in particular have developed and continue to develop rapidly, at a pace and to a level <Col N="1402" /> few would have predicted. The problem is a dynamic one and may, as we have learned from our experience of the operation of our laws and procedures, require us to provide immediate responses from time to time. The current situation has shown that in certain circumstances our procedures and controls urgently need to be underpinned or defined to improve their operational effect and efficiency, in some cases to guard against abuse and ultimately to ensure the longer term credibility of our immigration and asylum systems. It also underlines the continuing need for review of how the law operates and a willingness on the part of the Legislature, not just in this instance but also into the future, to take the necessary steps to rectify flaws and introduce improvements to take account of the evolving situation.</P>
    <P>I have referred to my proposals under development in the Department for a comprehensive Bill which will set forth a modern legal framework for the future development and implementation of immigration policies suited to the needs of our society paying proper respect to our human rights obligations. I will not hesitate however to bring forward further legislation in advance of that comprehensive immigration and residence Bill where I perceive a need for statutory change in the immigration or asylum areas to deal with any practical problems which may arise and cannot await the main Bill.</P>
    <P>I respect the views of those who hold an opposite opinion and the motivation which underlies their expression. I just do not agree with them.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged to have copies of those amendments made available this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to report back to the House on a number of amendments made by the Dáil to the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which was passed by the Seanad before Christmas. The Bill has received a huge amount of debate in both Houses and when I say that I am delighted to be back in the Seanad with it, Senators will understand why I say so. We spent about 85 hours on the Bill in this House and I accepted 169 amendments. The Dáil devoted a further 96 hours of debate to the Bill and accepted 450 amendments. It is safe to say that the Bill has benefited from the wisdom of both Houses in a big way.</P>
      <P>The time spent on the Bill is a recognition of the importance of the Bill and that it will transform the planning system in Ireland for many years to come. The big challenge will be to ensure that the Bill is fully implemented and resourced, as Members of this House and the other House commented during its passage. I assure the House that I am fully committed to seeing that this is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the large number of amendments made in the Dáil, I do not propose to go through every amendment accepted in that House. Many were technical, correctional or consequential on other amendments. Others clarified and improved existing provisions. I want, however, deal with the <Col N="1403" /><Col N="1404" /> major changes made for the information of Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 44 provides that development plans should be compatible with any national plans, policies or strategies which the Minister determines relate to proper planning and sustainable development. The idea is that the national spatial strategy, which is being drawn up by the Department, can be given recognition in the development plan process.</P>
    <P>There were calls in both Houses for the development plan to integrate social, community and cutural development into the proper planning and development of the area of the local authority. Amendment No. 48 provides that the development plan should include objectives for the integration of the proper planning and sustainable development of the area with the social, economic and cultural requirements of the area and of its population. The Bill also provides for consultation with city and county development boards when development plans are being prepared. That is a move which will be welcomed by all sides of the House because it was raised extensively here.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 50, 118, 134, 441 and 447 are the main amendments giving effect to the land-use aspects of the European Union directive on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, also known as the Seveso II Directive. The greater part of that directive will be given effect through European Community regulations currently being drafted by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The directive relates primarily to ensuring that factories and premises which use hazardous substances comply with necessary safety standards and that proper procedures to deal with emergencies are put in place. However, one article of the directive, Article 12, requires member states to ensure that the objectives of preventing major accidents or limiting the consequences of such accidents are taken into account in land-use policies and we have provided for this.</P>
    <P>Arising from the debate in the Dáil and Seanad on the procedures for the adoption of the development plan, I introduced a number of amendments to reconfigure the periods involved. The first set of amendments to section 11 timetable more precisely the various functions which must be carried out in the preparation of the draft development plan. The initial period for the informal pre-consultation phase is being reduced from 20 weeks to 16 weeks. The time available for councillors to issue directions after receipt of the manager's report has now been expressly provided for &ndash; this is ten weeks. Following the issue of directions, the manager will have a further 12 weeks to prepare a draft. This then goes to the members who have eight weeks to amend the draft if they wish. The reworking of section 11 means that the process of finalising the draft and getting it passed by the councillors will take place in ten and a half months. This leaves two weeks <Col N="1405" /> for the authority to prepare the plan for public display following the making of amendments at this stage.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 12, additional time has been given to both the manager and the councillors to carry out their functions. There always was some leeway at the end of the process in year two for slippage, but this has been reduced by the changes. The public consultation procedure under subsection (3) is shortened by two weeks to ten weeks. The manager is given an extra two weeks to prepare his report under subsection (5), that is a total of 12 weeks, and the members are given an extra four weeks to consider the results of the first phase of consultation under subsection (6). The period for preparing amendments and publishing notice of them, on foot of a resolution under subsection (7), is also now timetabled at three weeks. Councillors are also given an extra two weeks to consider the report on the amendments to the development plan. The total timetable in section 12 is now 51 weeks which allows for five weeks slippage in the process. The Bill as passed by the Seanad probably allowed for about ten weeks slippage depending on how the non-timetabled processes were estimated. All processes are now timetabled. I consider these amendments to be fair to officials and elected members of the council and that they meet the general concerns of the Opposition amendments.</P>
    <P>There were calls in the Seanad for setting out the procedures for adoption of a local area plan. As initiated, the Bill left the procedure at the discretion of the planning authority, subject to regulations which would be made by the Minister. Section 20 now sets out a formal procedure for public notification and for the adoption of a proposal to make, amend or revoke a local area plan and is based on other similar procedures in the Bill such as the procedures for adopting planning schemes in SDZs.</P>
    <P>The question of linguistic impact statements came up again in the Dáil as it had done in the Seanad. I considered this issue further and brought forward an amendment to section 33, amendment No. 121, which allows for permission regulations to be made requiring additional information to be submitted along with a planning application for development in Gaeltacht areas. This additional information would assist planning authorities in determining applications in accordance with their obligations under section 10 to protect the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht. These regulations will be made in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. This amendment catches the essence of linguistic impact statements when considered in conjunction with the objective in section 10. Officials from my Department have met Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge which expressed itself satisfied with the approach I am now taking. Amendments to sections 19 and 20 also give specific recognition to local area plans for Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> Amendment No. 137 is designed to meet the point that where the manager of a planning authority, or the board of An Bord Pleanála, goes against the recommendations to grant or refuse permission, the reasons for not accepting the recommendation should be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 139 merely restates in a separate section the provision previously in section 34, which allows the planning authority to take into consideration the past record of developers when deciding whether to grant planning permission.</P>
      <P>Repeat applications were raised by Senators on all sides. There were complaints in both Houses about persons who make repeat applications for the same development where the first application is under appeal, possibly in an attempt to avoid third party involvement. The issue has also been raised with my Department by the Ombudsman. Amendment No. 143 will prevent multiple applications by a person regarding the same development while the first application is still before the board.</P>
      <P>There was much debate in both Houses about the changes in third party appeals. In particular, concern was expressed about people who may have been happy with the initial application but were unhappy with conditions imposed on the final decision by the authority. In response to those concerns, amendment No. 144 will permit persons whose interest in land is affected by a decision of the authority to apply to the board for leave to appeal against the decision. The board shall, if it finds that the decision is materially different from the application by reason of conditions imposed, and that the person's interest in their property is materially affected, grant leave to appeal. This meets the concerns expressed by Senators on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Supplementary development contributions are dealt with by amendment No. 168 which introduces a new section allowing for the drawing up of supplementary development contribution schemes to facilitate public-private partnership projects. While the provisions of section 48 are confined to infrastructure provided by local authorities, section 49 is not. It is designed to facilitate infrastructure, including public transport infrastructure, which could be provided by a private or public developer and which could be part remunerated by development contributions in the area serviced by the infrastructure. The section meets some of the demands in both Houses that part of the costs of public transport provision could be met through development contributions. However, this is being done in a controlled manner where a project, such as an extension of Luas, would facilitate development in a specifically defined area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 169 clarifies that a &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; interest as regards judicial reviews is more than a mere property involvement. It could mean <Col N="1407" /> that a person could be affected by a development. The amendment also provides that, to show a substantial interest, one must at least show that one has been a participant in the decision-making process. If a person does not get involved and then applies to the court for judicial review, he or she must show the court that he or she has a good and sufficient reason for not getting involved earlier.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 171 requires the courts to deal with judicial reviews on major projects as expeditiously as possible. In addition, amendment No. 241 provides that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may direct the board to give priority to a particular class of developments, for example, large road schemes. The Minister may not, however, instruct the board on decisions on a specific development. These amendments will be critical for the speedy provision of infrastructure projects under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 189 to 199, inclusive, introduce a new chapter in Part IV of the Bill with two purposes &ndash; to strengthen the provisions on architectural conservation areas and to introduce a new designation of &ldquo;area of special planning control&rdquo; in which planning authorities will be able to exercise close planning control on works to and uses of buildings in the interests of conservation of an area. The powers in this section will ensure that local authorities can take a proactive approach to the protection of towns and cities to ensure they are better places in which people can live, work and shop. These are significant additions to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999. However, arising from our experience in implementing that Act and preparing guidelines to assist local authorities in selecting architectural conservation areas, it was felt that these new provisions would be a useful addition to the code.</P>
    <P>A number of further clarifications were made to Part V. I draw Senators' attention to amendment No. 212 which provides that developers must indicate how they propose to enter into an agreement. The planning authority will have to have regard to such proposals. This provision explicitly gives a developer a chance to put forward proposals for meeting the requirements of Part V in a manner which best suits the developer, provided that the proposals are in keeping with the requirements of the Part.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 213 provides that people who before 25 August last had inherited land and paid tax on it and people who gave a mortgage for land and then came into possession of the land in question since that date will be entitled to market value where land is provided by them for social or affordable housing on foot of a planning application. Amendment No. 216 provides that a housing association building houses for letting only will be exempt from the provisions of Part V. Amendment No. 218 introduces an anti-avoidance section to the Bill which will ensure that <Col N="1408" /> developers cannot escape the requirements of Part V save in the case of the legitimate exemptions provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Two major changes were made regarding the appointment of members to An Bord Pleanála. Amendment No. 222 increases the permanent membership of An Bord Pleanála by an extra board member to seven and the extra panel created to make the nomination has, therefore, been created. This panel relates to the fourth pillar of social partnership and to interests such as the arts and the Irish language. Recent experience has shown that the nominating bodies have not nominated their full quota of candidates when vacancies have arisen on the board and this has restricted my choice. It has caused particular problems in selecting a proper balance of gender and experience for the board. In an attempt to ensure that the widest possible selection of candidates is available, amendment No. 230 introduces a new fallback procedure for making appointments where applications may be sought by open advertisement.</P>
    <P>In line with the proposals outlined last week in the Government's action on housing, I introduced a number of amendments to allow strategic development zones to be prepared for residential development. These are set out in amendments Nos. 248 to 297. To that end the National Building Agency and local authorities are included in the list of bodies which can be a development agency. A new section has been introduced allowing a development agency or a local authority to acquire the land needed for the zone. In the case of the authority, this can be done by way of compulsory acquisition. Alternatively, the agency may enter into an agreement with the owner of the land to facilitate the establishment of the zone. In considering a planning scheme for the SDZ, the authority and the board will have to have regard to the housing strategy.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 371 to 375, inclusive, introduce a new Part dealing with development on the foreshore. These new sections were introduced to the Bill to implement the Government's decision on introducing a single procedure for major infrastructural development by local authorities which crosses the foreshore. These developments in future will require the consent of An Bord Pleanála and the need to obtain the consent of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources under the Foreshore Acts will not apply. However, the provisions require early consultation with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and require the board to have regard to any views expressed by the Minister. Amendment No. 372 also requires development on the foreshore to obtain planning permission from the local authority. In this case, the requirement to obtain a foreshore licence will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 385 replaces the section in the Bill dealing with funfairs. The major change is that the same requirements to obtain a safety certificate will apply to fairground equipment used <Col N="1409" /> at permanent funfairs, that is, those with planning permission or pre-1963 authorised use, as well as at those funfairs which travel. It should be noted that amendment No. 384 allows regulations to be made for outdoor events organised by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 393 replaces in its entirety the section dealing with providing information by electronic means. In response to the debate in both Houses, the new section provides that any written documents or other information can be provided or kept in electronic format from the date of the commencement of the Bill without any further need for regulations to be made permitting it. One critical proviso, and this is reflected in the Electronic Commerce Bill, is that both sides must consent to the information, whatever it is, being in an electronic form. There is little point in changing information to an electronic format if the person getting it cannot use it because they do not have the necessary technology or even the necessary skills. Further, the technology requirements of the local authority or board must be complied with. I do not propose to make them accept planning applications in any format. They must, of course, make those requirements known. These are necessary and practical provisos to the introduction of e-planning and reflect the provisions in the e-commerce Bill. This is a very modern provision which meets the concerns expressed in the debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 418 and 419 restate in an improved form the sections dealing with the interface between IPC and waste licensing and the planning system. No major changes of policy have been made. Amendment No. 312 brings the section of the Bill dealing with the board's approval of local authority development which requires environmental impact assessment into line with the divide between planning and environmental licensing. Where an IPC licence is required for a local authority development requiring an EIA, the board will deal with the land use issues and the EPA will deal with the pollution control issues.</P>
    <P>Members will recall that we had a long discussion on the effects of quarries and their environmental impact. From the time this matter was highlighted in the Seanad, Members have received a great deal of correspondence and representations. Amendment No. 420 was introduced in light of that debate and the widespread public dissatisfaction with unregulated quarries, an issue which was particularly highlighted here. I was criticised for not bringing in a Report Stage amendment to deal with the issue. However, as Senators can see, the issue was complex and required a great deal of work and, indeed, negotiation with the quarry sector to try to get it right. However, we have brought forward a strong provision to regulate the quarry sector in a manner which takes a balanced approach in regard to the protection of the environment and sustained economic development and which should not <Col N="1410" /> adversely impact on the supply of aggregate to the construction industry. The amendment basically requires that all quarries more than five years old should be registered with the planning authorities. The planning authorities will be entitled to regulate them by imposing environmental conditions on their operation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 421 will require most of the substantive regulations to be made under the Bill to be subject to a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. This will ensure greater scrutiny and transparency in the making of planning regulations in the future.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 429 to 435, inclusive, modify the existing legislative arrangements for tolling under the Roads Act, 1993, by removing the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's quasi judicial functions in relation to toll schemes. Under the revised Part V of the Roads Act, 1993, the decision to adopt or revoke a toll scheme, adopt by-laws or enter into toll arrangements with private investors will be a matter for the National Roads Authority in the case of national roads and in the case of non-national roads, for the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>There are a number of provisions in the Bill which reduce the role of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in project-specific approvals and consent. In this connection, the amendment proposed to the tolling provisions of the Roads Act, 1993, removes an anomaly that would otherwise have been created under the Bill. This would have seen the Minister for the Environment and Local Government retaining an involvement in the approval of specific toll projects, while approval of associated motorway schemes, compulsory purchase orders and environmental impact statements in respect of the same roads projects would be transferred to An Bord Pleanála. In the absence of these amendments, part of the project decision-making process would be retained by the Minister and part by An Bord Pleanála which would be clearly inappropriate. The proposed amendments seek to address this situation and are consistent with the other provisions of the planning and development Bill to which I have referred. These amendments also required a consequential change to the Long Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the outset, it is not possible to go into detail on each of the 450 amendments made to the Bill in the Dáil. Members will appreciate the reason I spent the past 25 minutes speaking on them. The number of amendments is a reflection of the in-depth scrutiny the Bill received, particularly during the 56 hour Committee Stage debate. I thank the Members of both Houses who contributed to this detailed scrutiny which enhanced the Bill. While not agreeing with all aspects of the Bill, I hope it can be accepted that I listened to all points of view and responded where I could, either by accepting amendments or by coming back on Report Stage in both Houses with amendments which responded to the concerns raised. This was a good exercise in <Col N="1411" /> democracy and we have created legislation which is a credit to that process and which will stand the test of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The Bill has given rise to a long and arduous road for him and his staff. We have seen so much of them over the past year or so that we almost became friends. The Minister has given me a nice surprise. Very often Ministers come to the House and say they will look at and review certain things and the next time one sees the legislation there has been no change or it has been changed to such a small degree that it does not make a difference. Having gone through the amendments, the Minister has accepted substantial suggestions made by Members of the Oireachtas. The Minister listened and fine-tuned this Bill to make it a very good one, but I cannot be 100% supportive of it and I do not think the Minister would expect me to be.</P>
      <P>When the Minister came to the House on Second Stage he said the Bill will put in place a hierarchical structure of plans and that it will be a holistic approach to planning matters &ndash; I think that was the wording he used. For that to be true, the national spatial plan had to be ready to be put in place at the same time as publication of the Bill. That is not a major criticism. I am only suggesting that the two should have been hand in hand or the national spatial plan should have been finalised before the Bill. That would have given the Bill a more holistic approach as the Minister intended. However, it is good to know the national spatial plan will be produced and I am sure there will be a degree of urgency in bringing it before the House.</P>
      <P>The development plan timetable is much more accurate. It is finely tuned and much more effective. I do not think anybody could disagree that time is limited to bring our plans forward. I commend the Minister for accepting the suggestions made by Members on both sides of the House regarding the local area plans. I had strong views on the development of the Gaeltacht areas and the Minister said he would review it to see if anything could be done. I know from Committee Stage that Deputy Dukes will be very supportive of the concept of the separation of the Gaeltacht area and the protection of its identity. I thank the Minister for introducing this in the plan. It was something of importance to me as someone who lives in the Gaeltacht and to many others who felt that its identity should be protected. I am glad that Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge has supported the provisions in the Bill and I congratulate the Minister for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspector's report is of vital importance. I could not understand that when an inspector's report was overruled by the board, that was the end of the matter and nobody knew why it was overthrown. I am glad to hear the Minister say that if a report is overthrown for or against, the board must explain in detail the basis on which it <Col N="1412" /> was overthrown. This will clarify matters and shows things are above board.</P>
    <P>I raised the matter of a developer's past record. One of the difficulties that arises is how we pursue a developer if he changes his company name. I do not think it is possible to deal 100% with that problem. The adjustments made will go some way towards dealing with it if we seek out individuals irrespective of the companies. I have not grasped from what the Minister said today whether he is talking about the development company's record or the person who is a member of the board of that company. Each individual in the company should be examined.</P>
    <P>Very often what happens in the case of repeat applications is that the person takes the eye off the ball after the first application is granted. Anybody who has dealings with the local authority will understand this provision is of critical importance. I welcome the provision dealing with the issue of third party appeals which was raised by Senators on both sides of the House. The provision that a substantial interest in relation to judicial review is more than a mere property involvement is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might reply to my query regarding architectural conservation areas and areas of special planning controls. This relates to what I said about An Bord Pleanála being able to overthrow a county or city development plan. I feel they should be restricted in so doing. Can An Bord Pleanála overthrow an architectural conservation area or an area of special control? Can they modify it, change it or disrupt it? </P>
    <P>I proposed the removal of Part V of the Bill and the Minister said if it were removed the Bill would collapse and would have no value. At the time I did not think it would be workable as I felt it could be challenged. I am still waiting, as I am sure the Minister is, to see if it will be challenged. There is much mumbling outside the House as to whether it will be brought into court. An opportunity has been lost to introduce the concept, suggested by a Dáil committee, of the local authority taking up the land at the time of zoning. However, the question of equity has not been addressed and we will have to wait to see what will happen with the 20% social housing requirement. How do we ensure equity in the numbers of people affected by that requirement? Will one developer be affected and others not? Is it open to a subjective decision as to what development lands would be affected? One developer may have to provide 20% of his development for social housing and another might not.</P>
    <P>I sought an increase in the members appointed to An Bord Pleanála. The Minister has increased the number but I thought a few more could be appointed and we could get more work done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the strategic development zones and the development of the foreshore. It is not right that development of a foreshore for sewage treatment should have to go back An Bord Pleanála. A local authority should not have to go back to An Bord Pleanála for permission to develop <Col N="1413" /> something as important as a sewage treatment plant. It can delay things for a long time. The long delays at the Galway sewage treatment plant resulted in huge additional costs. People from every angle would be appealing to An Bord Pleanála in such cases. Perhaps we can take another look at that to see if we could include a provision that it could only be held by An Bord Pleanála for a certain length of time.</P>
    <P>The proposal to license all fun fairs was the subject of great debate in the Lower House on Committee Stage. If that were to happen then small communities would have to be licensed also. It was felt that a certain type of fair, dancing at the crossroads etc., held in small communities for fund raising purposes should not require licensing. A small community group in my constituency erected a plaque to commemorate the famous oarsmen, the Emmets Rowing Crew, and took up the whole pier during their celebrations. It was a wonderful community effort and a beautiful ceremony. One wonders if they would have bothered if they had had to obtain a licence to do so. Such a requirement would impose restrictions on small gatherings of people raising funds or recognising somebody in their community.</P>
    <P>The subject of electronic media was a source of some debate. I am glad it is included in the Bill. Technology moves on and so do we. We recognise that not everybody will have the facilities or training to use certain technologies but I believe people will be totally computer literate in 20 years.</P>
    <P>The issue of the control of quarries was a bugbear. I live between two quarries and know how the operators abuse the local area. They do not deny this but say it is so because they do not have to adhere to any regulations regarding dust or lorry weights. While lorry weights could be checked by the Garda it is very rarely done. The washing down of lorries to keep down the dust etc. causes huge problems. I did not meet with representatives from the quarries but I did receive letters from them. I did not want to meet with them. There are certain vexatious issues which they have a right to raise. They point out that if they have set up in an area and somebody builds a house 200 yards away from them then that person must recognise that the dust, shaking of the windows and blasting are all natural aspects of quarrying. Their right to complain is lessened by the fact that they were aware of its presence before they built their house. People living near quarries opened after they became resident in the area have genuine complaints if they are affected by dust or blasting affects the structure of their house and shakes the windows and frightens them.</P>
    <P>I attended a number of meetings about turbary. I would like to revisit the issue again. I am sorry the Minister did not take the opportunity of working the other way around. Instead of saying there should be a planning application for all turbary he should state that the each local authority <Col N="1414" /> will decide whether a development requires planning permission. Turbary in Offaly is quite different from turbary in Connemara where a man might have only a few small fields to turn. That man will not make a planning application to turn those fields and will work away to his heart's content. I do not think we should make laws unless they are applicable across the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his staff have been extremely helpful to this House in dealing with this Bill. Nobody was trying to score political points during the debate. We were merely concerned with fine tuning the Bill, which is probably one of the largest pieces of legislation to go through the House in the past 20 years. The Bill may be outdone only by the forthcoming local government Bill. Our intention was to be helpful. The Minister is to be congratulated on his commitment to look at all our amendments and in taking so many of them on board. We were intent on producing a very good Bill, one that we could recommend outside. I may be unhappy with some aspects of it but one is never 100% happy with anything. I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill before us.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an tAire ar ais don Seanad. I concur with Senator Coogan that this Bill got more air time in its passage through the Seanad than any other Bill in my short time here. The Minister's accommodating approach to accepting amendments and opinions that would enhance the Bill was a hallmark of those debates and he is to be commended on that. He took the same approach on Committee Stage in the Dáil, which has led to a large number of amendments being tabled. Most if not all those amendments are intended to strengthen the Bill and to ensure that the planning and development process will be significantly improved. The development plan prepared by the local authority is a major stage in the planning process and the Bill covers that matter well. Details of the application process are also laid out and enforcement is dealt with.</P>
      <P>Planning is becoming a major concern for the public. Many councillors are indicating that they receive an increased number of representations on single planning applications and those canvassing in the Tipperary by-election will have encountered planning concerns in rural areas. It is incumbent on the Department and the Minister to ensure that local authorities are properly equipped and resourced to administer the planning process efficiently and to implement this significant Bill successfully. The Minister reminded us that we spent 85 hours debating the Bill in the Seanad while the Dáil spent 96 hours on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>The amendment providing that development plans should be compatible with the national development plan and for the inclusion of the national spatial strategy is a wise one that should go without saying, but it is necessary to copperfasten such measures in legislation. The provision that the social, economic and cultural <Col N="1415" /> requirements of an area be part of a development plan is also a welcome inclusion.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with the European directive on major accident hazards is interesting. We have seen a number of recent accidents in Ireland, although fortunately none has been as serious as some of the catastrophes on the Continent, which are indicative of the need to highlight this matter in the planning process. Prevention is always better than cure. The amendments dealing with this matter are very wise in the light of recent international events.</P>
    <P>The development plan timetable has been altered somewhat and I am concerned at the period for slippage being reduced from ten weeks to five. The framework is tight, although that may be good as it will have to be complied with once it is in legislation. However, it is important that the process of consideration and consultation is provided for fully in the Bill. Many local authorities are considering their development plans at present and it seems somewhat remiss that the strategic policy committees &ndash; there is one in every council &ndash; will be dealing specifically with the planning but do not appear to be involved in the process. This may relate to some sectional interests, but it is regrettable that these bodies are not being utilised fully. I am concerned that people might see this as an opportunity to advance some element of their conditions of employment and that could obstruct the process, as seems to be happening with the SPCs, and would be regrettable. What provisions are there to deal with this?</P>
    <P>Section 20 sets out a formal procedure for dealing with local area plans, which I welcome. County development plans are often of necessity aspirational and general. It is possible to be much more specific regarding development with local area plans and people should be more aware of what is permissible and what is not. That should assist the efficiency and transparency of the process enormously. My local authority has looked at local areas and is now preparing development plans for villages, so it is possible to be very specific as to what one wants to see happen. Such plans will chart the future development of counties once they are knitted into the overall development plan. I commend the Minister and his officials on the inclusion of that provision.</P>
    <P>With Senator Coogan, I commend the amendment which protects the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht. This matter was debated at length and its inclusion is indicative of the Minister's interest in the area and his ability to take constructive suggestions on board. Regarding the inspector's report, it is good that An Bord Pleanála or the manager must outline the reasons for not accepting the inspector's recommendations. However, it is extraordinary that one man should have such power vested in him when a body is elected by the public and is accountable to the public. Given the present <Col N="1416" /> climate of transparency and accountability, that is not the way of the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will give that a whack during the local government Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The local government Bill may amend that, as Senator Coogan suggests. The executive powers are far too sweeping, particularly in planning, when individual councillors may have a greater insight into the proper planning and development of their areas due to their local knowledge. That is an important factor in making decisions, yet it may count for nothing when the opinion of one executive supersedes it. I look forward to that being changed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the amendment which deals with the past record of developers. I do not know if the local authority could apply a condition to a permission being sought by a developer that previous incomplete developments would have to be completed before the commencement of the permission. Something like that would do much to ensure developers complete building projects. It is fair to say that most developers do so to a satisfactory standard but those who do not and who are consistent defectors in this area should suffer as a consequence. The provisions here will enable the local authority at least to take that into account.</P>
      <P>The issue of third party appeals, which concerned a number of Senators when discussed, has been addressed by the Minister and I welcome that. There is a provision now for people who, because of a change in conditions or arising from additional information sought from the developers, might have a different perspective on an application in terms of whether they view it favourably or unfavourably. They have the right to some redress in the event of their being dissatisfied.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision for supplementary development contributions. If people benefit from the expenditure of public moneys when infrastructure facilitates their own development, it is right that a contribution is expected from them. However, there is a need to ensure the system is applied fairly. It is not applied uniformly throughout the country. Some local authorities do no more than pluck a figure from the air and it is often based on what they think the developer might wear in terms of a charge. It needs to be more scientifically based than previously. Perhaps it could be dealt with by way of regulations or whatever, but it is something I would recommend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judicial review is a procedure with which we would have to concur. Amendment No. 171 requires the courts to deal with judicial reviews on major projects as expeditiously as possible. That is in recognition of the infrastructural deficit we have had for many decades which is being addressed in the national development plan. It would be a pity if the full and successful implementation of that plan were held up because of <Col N="1417" /> delays, through spurious claims or whatever. I wonder if asking the courts to deal with them as expeditiously as possible is more aspirational than placing a requirement on them to do so. Often the courts take a very broad interpretation of their role in these matters and, in general, they tend understandably to make allowances for the individual as against the major corporate or public body.</P>
    <P>The idea of including areas of special planning controls within the development plan is highly desirable. There are sensitive areas and this is a good inclusion which should assist the process. The more specific we are about requirements in individual areas in towns or counties, the easier it will be to show that the implementation of the development plan and of the whole planning process is done in a balanced and even-handed way.</P>
    <P>Part V, which is a significant and important part, has had some amendment in the Dáil. I echo Senator Coogan's point in that it would be a travesty if an appeal to the Supreme Court happened and the Bill was held up for years as a consequence. Indeed, it could even be a delaying tactic. Given that property rights are so strongly enshrined in the Constitution &ndash; we would all subscribe to that and would not look for any change &ndash; it is important that the Bill does not find itself held up for a number of years by court proceedings. I do not know what can be done to ensure that does not happen but the housing needs of the people are such that initiatives are urgently needed.</P>
    <P>There is a strong provision in the Bill with an emphasis on social housing and it will benefit the many people who find themselves on the margins, whether they are local authority applicants or have the possibility to aspire to home ownership of which we have a very proud record. It is important this section is implemented sooner rather than later. I hope some mechanism will be found to ensure there is not an undue delay in regard to it.</P>
    <P>Exempting housing associations, housing co-operatives, social housing schemes and so on is desirable and I compliment the Minister on including that. In regard to strategic development zones, it is good to see the National Building Agency, which has been involved in some tremendously valuable developments and has assisted many local authorities, included in that particular section. I am glad the foreshore licences requirement has been excluded. It is fair to say the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is not noted for dealing with foreshore applications expeditiously. It does not appear to be one of its strong points and, therefore, this provision will be of assistance in ensuring developments proceed.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the electronic media is a good development. Given that we are applauding and complimenting ourselves, and justifiably so, on the development of our e-commerce industry and the fact we are now the largest exporter of computer software in the world, it behoves us to <Col N="1418" /> include provisions which facilitate its further development and use in any legislation brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is to be welcomed and encouraged.</P>
    <P>On the control of quarries, the amendment made is simple and straightforward and will probably be very effective. Quarries over five years will be registered with the planning authorities which will be entitled to regulate or impose environmental conditions on their operation, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>I find myself in some disagreement with the provision in regard to toll roads and the amendment made to the Bill. As a principle, I disagree with the devolution of political power to unelected bodies such as the National Roads Authority. I do not object to tolls being placed on roads provided we are talking about long motorways which facilitate transport, whether private motorists or goods vehicles, in particular. We should remind ourselves that the motorist and the transport industry in general are very heavily taxed. I would not like to see a plethora of toll roads or bridges. We spoke about e-commerce earlier and it is essential that tolls do not become a matter of placing gates on road transport. I do not see the sense in spending large amounts of money developing our infrastructure if we stop traffic for ten to 15 minutes while people pay their toll. That defeats the purpose of the investment in the first place. Anything that is done in that area should ensure traffic continues to flow and is charged to some system, as applies in many other countries.</P>
    <P>The Planning and Development Bill is major legislation. While it consolidates legislation in the area, many new and important initiatives have been taken in this Bill. I hope the local government system is geared in such a way as to ensure its successful implementation. Local authorities are stretched at present. It is not just a matter of money but also of manpower and management to ensure the Bill meets the objectives to which the Minister and the Houses of the Oireachtas aspire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on the hours he has put into this Bill. The Minister referred to the time he spent in both Houses but forgot to mention the hours he spent going around the country explaining the Bill in detail to all sectors of the housing industry, whether local authorities, building authorities or whoever. The Minister is to be complimented for this as he and his staff explained the provisions of the Bill in detail. He lived up to his commitment to meet groups privately and publicly and gave everyone an opportunity to make an input into this legislation. The Minister must dream about this Bill and he and his staff must be happy it is coming to fruition. I compliment him and his staff for their efforts as this is the largest Bill I have seen since the Companies Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything that should be said about the Bill has been said. However, planning will be the major issue facing local authorities in the coming <Col N="1419" /> years. County development plans will be examined before the end of the year. I am confident the Department and local authorities will get those plans right as we all know the importance of housing and the pressure on young people seeking to obtain a house. The Minister has put in place a mechanism to reduce house prices and that method is working. He has also committed himself to building 50,000 houses per annum, the impact of which can already be seen.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities face a problem due to the lack of planners. My local authority cannot get planners and other authorities probably face the same problem. Large companies snatch planners from local authorities. Parents are telling youngsters in third level education to get into planning so there will be a large number of planners in a few years which might reduce the burden. In the meantime, we will have to take that on board.</P>
    <P>I welcome many aspects of the Bill. In particular, I welcome section 137 which stipulates that the manager of the planning authority or An Bord Pleanála must give a reason if they go against a recommendation to grant or refuse permission. This is an important aspect of the Bill as all Senators supported this measure. I do not understand why a reason is not given when a manager or an inspector from An Bord Pleanála goes against the recommendation of a local authority planner to grant or refuse planning permission. The only reason given may be that the application is in contravention of proper planning or whatever. Qualified planners have recommended this kind of measure and I am glad to see it included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Other provisions of the Bill are long overdue, such as those concerning repeated applications, third party appeals, Part V, judicial reviews and so on. The Bill has been comprehensively dealt with in both Houses and I have been looking forward to it for some time. I commend the Bill and thank the Minister, his staff and the entire Department for the effort they put into this Bill which will be to the betterment of young people who want to build houses. They are the people who will gain from the Bill in the long term and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment all involved for their courtesy and co-operation in processing this major legislation. The Minister pointed out there were 169 Seanad amendments and 450 Dáil amendments to the Bill. The Bill spent 85 hours in the Seanad and 96 hours in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>There were some tense moments and difficult times at various Stages of the Bill and I thank the Minister and his officials for bearing with us and teasing out the various difficulties which required teasing out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was a member of a local authority and secretary of LAMA and has adopted a winning, approachable and open door attitude to local authority matters. His aspiration is for the Government and the private sector to build <Col N="1420" /> 500,000 houses over the next ten years, that is 50,000 houses per year. This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>We can look back at the past 50 years and see from where we have come on the issue of housing. Everyone in public life who has to knock on constituents' doors at least once a year, whether in presidential, general, local authority or Seanad elections, will have witnessed the great improvement in the standard of housing and the conditions in which people now live. Thank God we have seen this day but who would have thought a Minister would propose a plan to build 500,000 houses, one new house for every eight people, over the next ten years? This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Because of the wonderful condition of and buoyancy in the economy, we will review county development plans not after five years but after two and a half to three years. Ten years ago there were 400 people living in Kinnegad, County Westmeath, which is in the Minister's neighbouring constituency. In five years there will be 4,000 people in Kinnegad, a tenfold increase in population. These areas are facing problems with housing and water and sewerage, and it is wonderful to be a public representative in Ireland today where money is available to address these problems. We are putting together a planning Bill which will bring us to an era beyond our wildest dreams or expectations.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators Dan Kiely and Walsh in welcoming section 137 which provides that An Bord Pleanála will have to give a reason for granting or refusing to grant permission and changing the decision of a local authority. Local authorities are well informed, whether by public representatives or their staff who come from every parish and village in the area. Sometimes it is difficult to understand why decisions are changed as this must be in the national or local interest.</P>
    <P>Employment was always an important issue for people in north Westmeath and that is still the case as the population in the area has decreased by 34% over the past 30 years. We had a five seat constituency which was reduced to four and then three seats. While there has been an enormous increase in population around Kinnegad, from Rochfortbridge and Milltownpass to Athlone, the Celtic tiger has not affected north Westmeath, an area with which the Minister is familiar as it was part of the Meath constituency for more than 12 years. Over 210 housing applications were granted for Castlepollard but building does not seem to be starting. Circumstances can vary, even within a county, where there are massive increases in job opportunities and population in one part and none in the other part. This is bound to happen in the next year or two which is why putting this Bill into law will protect the environment in the beautiful lake district where I come from. Senator O'Dowd comes from our neighbouring County Louth which also has its coastline to consider.</P>

      <P>Housing is currently the biggest issue in this country. In terms of local government, it is an area which needed significant attention, which it does not get in this Bill. The jury is out on whether the formula used in this Bill, with the Bacon report, will solve the housing crisis. Every week I am faced with young people and couples in my clinic, trying to get local authority housing or an affordable site on which they can build their own house. These people are trying to shape a future for themselves and their families. The Government has singularly failed to address the issue. It cannot pretend it has only begun as it has been in government for over three years. The queues are growing at my clinic. Never were fewer local authority houses built in County Louth than under this Administration. Never was it more difficult or expensive for a young couple to plan their future, buy their home and live together in harmony.</P>

      <P>In fairness, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, you have. I was not going to speak at all until I heard Senator Cassidy. When I hear him going on, I really cannot stomach it &ndash; I say that humorously. The young people I met are fed up to the teeth because they cannot get affordable housing and feel they are going nowhere. There is increasing frustration among young people about their future and the way the Government is mismanaging the future of their families, particularly by not providing them with serviced sites.</P>
      <P>I am not a lawyer but it seems unconstitutional to exclude people from building a house in an area because they have not resided there. For example, Clare County Council can tell people they cannot buy or build a house in a certain locality because they do not live in County Clare. That is rubbish. We should allow any couple anywhere to obtain a site they can build on provided it meets planning, development and sewerage criteria. Domicile should be totally irrelevant. Many development plans exclude people from building and living in areas where they can build or buy an affordable house. The Minister must address this issue.</P>
      <P>The development centres proposed in many of our county development plans will put increased pressure on smaller rural communities. Villages where people bought houses, knowing the available infrastructure, are being thrown out of kilter by the type of development taking place. A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I thank you for your latitude. This is an issue which remains to be addressed by the Government. I am unhappy with it and I know the people of County Tipperary will demonstrate their unhappiness tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on this voluminous and comprehensive measure. I thank him for accepting so many amendments, particularly those put down by my colleague, Senator Coogan. I watched Senator Walsh speak on the monitor and it reminded me that I should be here. The Minister accepted one of Senator Coogan's amendments which provides that where inspectors' reports are overruled, in this time of openness and transparency, the reasons will have to be given by the manager or, more importantly, by An Bord Pleanála when matters are appealed. Previously, a one, two or three line excuse was given and one did not know the reason behind it.</P>
      <P>I have been justifiably critical that at local authority level, planning officers, who are qualified people, were often overruled. This may not have come into the open because they may have been directed by managers who in some instances acted as if they were feudal overlords.</P>

      <P>Perhaps they do, I am not as familiar with them as I was. I am not talking about any local authority in particular. It is a small country and we all attend conferences, enjoy each other's company and swap relevant stories. We hear what is going on from Donegal to Wexford and all the places in between. Managers have often been rates driven, so to speak, to get more money into the local coffers. Sadly, as we all know, a number of bad decisions were made and planners were overruled, entailing the revision of reports. One did not necessarily discover this from examining the file. We are moving into a new era and what remains of the system is changing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something seriously amiss when a majority can rezone without having to offer a single line of explanation for a rezoning or material contravention motion. I am talking about the few cases &ndash; we may all know some of them &ndash; where the planning officer's report is against it, the managerial advice supports the planning officer and the majority, without offering a word, vote it through. We are well aware of the Finlay Supreme Court judgment on section 4 motions. They cannot be passed, and properly so, without elected representatives offering valid reasons on planning grounds. I am totally baffled why this should not also apply to rezoning and material contravention motions. It is probably because it has not been tested in the courts. I look forward to the Minister's words of wisdom on this. The question of in-committee planning meetings was recently very much in the news in my county. The practice <Col N="1423" /> has grown of holding electoral area or full council meetings dealing with planning. Sadly, these are not open and transparent because no minutes are kept of them. One can examine an individual planning file but one will not find the minutes of the planning meeting where one's application or that of one's neighbour was discussed. The Minister rightly made provision in the other Bill for full media access and full openness and transparency, to which I totally subscribe. However, there is a conflict here in regard to planning meetings. This matter should be addressed, although we should have planning meetings to discuss anything the manager, planning officer or councillors wish to discuss.</P>
    <P>While Britain is behind us in many respects, particularly in its lack of an independent planning appeals board, it is ahead of us in this respect. I met the planning officer in Stratford-on-Avon, Seán O'Grady, which is a rather Irish name but he spoke the Queen's English well. He showed me minutes of planning meetings, which were held in public with notices posted on the front of the council building. The first item on the agenda, which tickled me pink, was &ldquo;declarations of interest, if any&rdquo;. That applied to the officials as much as the councillors. Councillors might say that a certain person was their neighbour or a member of their constituency organisation. They would then go on, having declared their interest, to speak about the individual application. I thought that was a wonderfully open and transparent approach. I throw that out for the Minister's consideration, for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>While the Minister might have been hamstrung by EU directives and so on, I am disappointed we were not able to resolve the position on traditional turbary rights in Kerry and elsewhere. This has been important to rural areas and the farming families who depend on the bog. It would be terrible if the Irish tradition of the day in the bog got wiped out by this. I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh for your indulgence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to this Stage of the debate. I think they accept we cannot make further changes to the Bill at this Stage. However, it is worth noting a comprehensive set of regulations will be drawn up under the Bill and any comments relevant to those regulations can be considered at that time. Guidelines will also play an important part in implementing the Bill and may deal in a practical way with some of the issues raised. I want to touch on some of those issues briefly, out of courtesy to the Members who raised them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Coogan raised the issue of the national spatial strategy. The Senator is right that, in an ideal world, we would have had many moons ago a national spatial strategy which would have been updated regularly. This Bill would fit into that context. We do not live in an ideal world, but the <Col N="1424" /> national spatial strategy is steaming ahead and will be in place before the end of next year. That will be the final piece of the jigsaw. However, as I said, the Senator is right that it is important.</P>
    <P>I thank Members who acknowledged the efforts we made in this and the other House in relation to the Gaeltacht areas, the recognition of their particular heritage and culture and the need to protect the language.</P>
    <P>In relation to the inspectors' reports, Members are aware we have changed the rules and regulations for the inspectors' report and for going against that report or recommendation and the engineers' report at local authority level. Reasons for that will now have to be stated. Senators on both sides have repeatedly made the point that that will make the system more transparent.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan raised the past history of developers. I assure him that if a person who previously failed to complete a development is believed to have formed a new company or partnership or is in some way connected with a current application, the Bill is specifically designed to take that into account. It is an important point that that should be covered, which it is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators Coogan, Kiely and others raised the issue of the board being able to grant permission in contravention of an architectural conservation area designation or the development plan itself. We had a long discussion on that. I amended it in the House, as Members may recall, and I have not gone any further in the Dáil in relation to it. However, we have narrowed the areas in which they can do that and they must give specific reasons for it, which is right. I hope that within the next decade, when the system is up and running and when development plans are being reviewed on the cycle they are supposed to be &ndash; which is every six years under the new Bill, starting in year five and completing in year six &ndash; the development plans will be so up to date that there will be no real need for material contraventions. That could be looked at again. However, at the moment, the best way I can describe it is to say that I cannot take that chance.</P>
    <P>I will make a general point in regard to Part V and say to Senator Coogan, specifically, that all developers will be treated equally. There will be no question of one being treated differently. That will be up to the local authority, which will introduce a housing strategy and require up to 20% &ndash; the authority will decide the percentage &ndash; of all residential land to be provided for social and affordable housing. Any developer who wishes to develop that land will have to comply with that requirement. There will be no discrimination against any particular builders in relation to that because it applies to all.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd raised the issue of housing under Part V. If fewer houses were built in County Louth under this Administration than ever before, the Senator should look at himself and the other members of Louth County Council, rather than this Administration, because it has <Col N="1425" /> received the money to build more houses. It has got more starts&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said to the Senator that that is a matter for the members of Louth County Council, because it has received more money and starts over recent years than ever before. It has the right under the multi-annual programme this year to advance the building of houses. It can build the number for all four years of the multi-annual programme. If it does not do that, it should look to itself rather than blame the Department and the Minister for its failings.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh referred to the importance of enforcement in relation to the Bill. He is right that this Bill will only succeed if a culture of enforcement emerges. I acknowledge that staffing is part of the answer. Senator Coogan was the first to raise that matter in this House on the initial Stages of the Bill. We will provide, and have provided in the past, the resources for local authorities. There certainly are labour constraints, which are causing difficulties. As part of the response to the Bacon report the Government has clearly indicated it is again going abroad to seek consultants etc. to tackle the problem. I hope we get the support of all the social partners &ndash; I know I have the support of Members of this House &ndash; as there are labour constraints, whether people want to face that reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding sewage treatment works on foreshores, local authorities will have to submit an EIA to An Bord Pleanála rather than the Minister as is currently the case. The foreshore licens<Col N="1426" /> ing issue will be dealt with at the same time giving one rather than two procedures, which should expedite matters.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators that small outdoor events will not come under the licensing arrangements in the Bill. We are talking rather about licences for large outdoor concerts where there are safety, litter and crowd control issues etc. Feiseanna and local festivals will not require a licence. Some people were looking for a complete exemption for charitable events. However, a way around such an exemption would be for very large concerts to make a contribution to charity. Therefore, each event must be examined on its own.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan spoke about public planning meetings. All representations from public representatives in relation to planning should be in writing or made in public at a planning meeting. I have spoken to members of local authorities who have some reticence in this regard, not for any bad motives, but because they feel they would be able to give a truer picture of the circumstances if everything was not being recorded, and be able to use their local knowledge in some cases to oppose or propose planning applications. However, it is better for the system in general if representations are made in writing or at planning meetings. Local authorities can make a decision in this regard and open and transparent procedures should be considered by the SPCs involved in planning. Senator Walsh raised the fact that SPCs are not involved in the development plan process. There is no need to include provision in the Bill that SPCs should be involved in the process. It is a matter for local authorities to order their business. I confirm for Members that the industrial relations difficulties associated with SPCs have finally been cleared following a recent ballot by the unions and we should be able to move ahead in this regard very quickly.</P>
    <P>The hue and cry in the mid to late 1970s was so loud that the power which Ministers had under planning legislation to make final decisions on appeals in relation to planning applications was taken from them on the basis that the Minister was a public representative. Senator Walsh is now advocating that the executive decision in relation to individual planning applications should be given to the elected members of local authorities. That would not find much favour with the public. Judging by the current difficulties engendered in various places by public representatives in relation to housing developments, mainly in the Dublin area, such a proposal does not recommend itself to me. Some people will cry and shout about having more powers, but when push comes to shove they are very reluctant to take on the responsibility going with them. Ideally that would be the way to go, but I do not think it is feasible.</P>
    <P>A number of other points rather than questions were made in relation to e-mail facilities for planning, quarries, tolls etc. I previously made the point in relation to tolls that the Minister cannot take representations one way or the other. A procedure has been set down which is followed and <Col N="1427" /> the Minister then makes a decision. Therefore, it is not a question of taking democratic control from anybody. People have an opportunity to make a contribution in the open fora.</P>
    <P>The Bill is important from a housing point of view, and in this context Part V is extremely important. People have raised the possibility of a constitutional challenge, but I have made my views known.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to conclude on a sour note, especially after all the positive comments which have been made, and I do not like doing so in the absence of certain people. However, I am rather disappointed that no member of the Labour Party thought it worth their while to attend the debate on this important Bill. It is very poor form, and I am sorry to have to say this after all the co-operation I got, particularly from Deputy Gilmore in the Dáil. The Labour Party should be represented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his staff for their wonderful work and the long arduous hours they put into the Bill, and for their help when I had to ask about some technical aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The member of the Labour Party said he was unable to be here and he apologised &ndash; the other Members are obviously canvassing. He said he would try to be here if possible, although this is not the Member who initially dealt with the Bill. It is not my job to apologise on behalf of the Labour Party, but it is only fair to put on the record what the Member of the party said to me.</P>
      <P>I am not 100% happy with a few aspects of the Bill, but who will make me 100% happy? One of these aspects, which I did not mention, concerns the National Roads Authority. I wish to stray a little, as the authority is inclined to do when it plans roads around the countryside. The NRA has too much responsibility and is too distant from the electorate and the people in the decisions it makes. I want the NRA to have greater accountability to elected representatives, which, unfortunately, is not 100% provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The reason I am bringing the matter up again is that the National Roads Authority is higgledy-piggledy building a road through a Gaeltacht village, the culture and integrity of which we are trying to protect, tearing it in two. It should not have the right to overrule something as important as the strategy outlined in the Bill or the local development plan which states that an area is to be protected, but that is another day's work and I intend to fight the battle at as many levels as I can. The Minister was supportive when I discussed the matter with him. One does want to see places of high amenity shattered by four lanes of traffic where that is not necessary.</P>

      <P>Because Fine Gael gained a Member last week it is of the view it can speak on behalf of all parties. I thank the Minister on bringing this important Bill before us. It seems like a long time since it was fully debated in the House. Like Senators Kiely and O'Brien who participated on earlier Stages, I found it a valuable experience and a great exercise in democracy. It is to the Minister's credit that his <i>modus operandi </i>is such that he is amenable to constructive suggestions from any side of the House to strengthen and improve legislation. That is what we have come to expect from him. His experience of local government shone through in the sense that he was fully <i>au fait </i>with the merits and demerits of any suggestions made.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the Minister's officials and their interest and commitment. We are very fortunate to have officials of their calibre in the public sector who work assiduously to ensure we have a system of governance of which we can be proud.</P>

    <Title>Aer Lingus Bill, 2000: Order for Second Stage.</Title>

    <Title>Aer Lingus Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to Senators for agreeing to take the Bill. I am aware that there was a fuss, which was Members' entitlement, as it was not on the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the sale of shares in Aer Lingus at a time to be determined. The Government authorised me on 14 December 1999 to initiate a process leading to a public offering of shares in Aer Lingus. Since the Government's decision the Minister for Finance and I have engaged Salomon Smith Barney and AIB Capital Markets as the joint global co-ordinators and underwriters for the transaction. During the past few months officials from my Department and the Department of Finance and the advisers have worked closely to prepare the necessary groundwork for the IPO. The enact<Col N="1430" /> ment of the Bill is a crucial element of the process. I hope it may be possible to complete the offering in the latter half of the year or early 2001 depending on market conditions and the satisfactory finalisation of all preparatory stages for the IPO.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has made and continues to make a significant and valuable contribution to our economic and tourism development by providing a range of quality services to destinations in our main markets in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States of America. It is the Government's wish that the airline should continue to play this key role for the future, irrespective of its ownership status.</P>
    <P>Irish people at home and abroad have taken great pride in the achievements of the national airline since its formation over 64 years ago. It has been clearly identified with our image as a nation at home and abroad and has in many ways grown up with the State. Its strength has always been the quality of staff and the warm and personal nature of the service which they provide. I am confident the company will long continue to provide this service for its customers.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment in the mid 1930s with one small propeller aircraft serving one route &ndash; Dublin to Bristol &ndash; the airline has developed into a thriving and profitable company earning good profits, employing over 6,200 people and operating 38 aircraft serving 34 destinations. In 1999, it carried over 6.5 million passengers. The company was structured into the present Aer Lingus Group plc in 1993 as part of the major restructuring programme commonly referred to as the Cahill plan. The restructuring period was a traumatic event for the company and staff. It involved cost savings, rationalisation, a once off cash injection of £175 million by the Government and the divestment of non-core assets. It could be said that the significant change involved led in essence to the creation of a new airline.</P>
    <P>I do not underestimate the impact of the crisis at that time. All of us in public life and many others will remember it and the various episodes which led to huge trauma for everyone, including those who worked in the company, those who were in Government or Opposition and those involved in the decision making process. I put on record my appreciation for the work done, the challenges met and the opportunities taken by both parties since then to produce the healthy, vibrant company of today.</P>
    <P>The trading performance of Aer Lingus has been positive over the last number of years, bolstered by the strong economic conditions in Ireland. Furthermore, the board and management have identified clear opportunities for profitable development well ahead of the forecast average growth for the sector internationally. This growth will be achieved through further development of existing routes, through capitalising on the good location of hubs at Dublin, Shannon and Cork and through the development of <Col N="1431" /> enhanced services in conjunction with its partners in the Oneworld alliance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the US decision to approve Aer Lingus's code-sharing with AA, American Airlines, one of its alliance partners, on routes to New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles. I also welcome the news of US approval for Aer Lingus to operate on a new route to Baltimore, where services will commence in September next. This brings the number of routes the company operates to the US up to five.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this positive performance and the forecast for continued economic growth in Ireland, the Government wishes to ensure that the airline is fully and clearly positioned to compete successfully in the changing global air transport market and has the ability to respond effectively to the cyclical nature of the industry. The Government is satisfied that there are no longer compelling economic reasons underlying State ownership of Aer Lingus. The availability of private sector capital is now far more widespread than when the airline was originally set up and there is no shortage of operators willing to take on commercially viable routes.</P>
    <P>Across Europe, Governments have withdrawn from direct control and/or ownership of airlines. Privatisation of former flag carriers, such as British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France, KLM and TAP has either occurred or is underway. The only state airline in the medium to large size, other than Aer Lingus, which has not introduced private capital to date, is the Greek airline Olympic Airlines. However, it is understood that it too is now being prepared for privatisation.</P>
    <P>The air transport industry is particularly dynamic. It has been challenged over recent times by the opening of the European market, the adjustments required to deal with the new competitive environment and the strategy being pursued by the US for open skies policies. We have a particular policy in this regard which we do not intend to change.</P>
    <P>In making its decision for an IPO, the Government had regard to the aviation industry's response to change, including alliance consolidation, ownership changes, competition from low cost carriers and accelerated technological innovation. It also had regard to the significant capital needs that will be required by Aer Lingus, not only over the coming years, but shortly. In its report &ldquo;Strength through alliance&rdquo; published in April, 1999, which recommended entry to the Oneworld alliance, Aer Lingus identified a need for equity to meet existing growth plans, including the major fleet development programme currently underway, as well as to maximise the potential benefits of the alliance.</P>
    <P>Advisers appointed by the Minister for Finance and I who examined this matter at the time broadly concurred with this view and concluded that a minimum of £150 million was required to fulfil the company's needs going forward. That is based on the fact that the ratio of airplanes on <Col N="1432" /> hire and those owned is not tilted favourably in the case of Aer Lingus and on the clear need for massive capital injections to ensure that the airline can invest in the necessary airplanes to enable it continue to compete satisfactorily and, most importantly, to enable it fulfil now the challenges and advantages facing it in the Oneworld alliance.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy for Aer Lingus is being undertaken in consultation with the Aer Lingus management and unions. I have no doubt that this strategy will secure a strong and viable Aer Lingus going forward, continuing to serve Ireland's main markets in the UK, Europe and the United States. I met with union representatives shortly after the Government decision. This was followed by a series of contacts primarily between advisers from both parties, which were helpful in shaping a framework for an ESOP. I believe that these contacts should now give way to formal discussions and I have written to the Aer Lingus unions inviting them to engage in formal discussions on an ESOP in the context of the IPO.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus employees already enjoy the benefits of a profit sharing scheme implemented as part of the 1993-6 restructuring programme. The scheme was put in place by the then Government in recognition of the additional contribution asked of the workforce in the implementation of the Cahill Plan. Under the scheme, eligible employees are entitled to receive the equivalent of 10%, approximately £24.4 million, of the issued share capital of Aer Lingus at 31 December 1995, earned out of profits, of which 5% is by way of shares and 5% by way of cash. In the context of the IPO, the Government has authorised me to discuss an ESOP which would give the staff a stake of up to 14.9% in total, in the airline. I look forward to working with the staff representatives on this matter over the coming months.</P>
    <P>Turning to the main provisions of the Bill, section 1 is the definitions section and is self explanatory. Section 2 and the Schedule provides for the repeal of the existing legislation governing Aer Lingus. Section 3 provides for the sale of shares in the airline. Section 4 is intended to enable the company to issue and sell shares. Section 5 provides for agreements relating to the sale of shares in the airline.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that with effect from the commencement of this section, the scope of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts will no longer apply to the company and any worker director holding office on the board at that time will cease to hold such office. By law a company emerging into a flotation process is not allowed avail of the provisions of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts because they do not cover such a company. As in the case of Telecom Éireann, we were able to agree an arrangement with the unions. It may not have been perfect but it met what was needed at that time. There has not been an advancement on that, but in the talks with the unions, which I <Col N="1433" /> hope will commence when they reply to my letter to them, I hope we will include this as an item on our agenda. I intend to try to work out with the unions an equitable arrangement, as I was able to do with the Communications Workers' Union with regard to Telecom Éireann. It remains to be seen if a different type of formula will emerge through the ICTU and the other unions involved, such as SIPTU and IMPACT, but we have the time to engage in such a process. Section 7 is concerned with employee shareholding schemes. Section 8 provides for an exemption from section 60 of the Companies Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is an enabling provision to provide that Aer Lingus may establish a superannuation scheme for employees and former employees of Aer Lingus. Naturally that is an important issue. Last autumn because of a huge amount of correspondence, telephone calls and parliamentary questions, I engaged in a process whereby I met the trades unions. They voiced legitimate and worrying concerns regarding the pension schemes of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. I asked the chairmen of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta to set up task forces to look into the companies' pension schemes and then report back to me. Last week I received that report. I have asked the two chairmen to meet me in the coming weeks to look at the arrangements they are putting in place to ensure whatever is required of a pension scheme in the State sector is adhered to. We have also sent the report for actuarial appraisal. In the months ahead I hope to come to grips with that. It is proper that it should be worked through. It is proper for the workers and those who worked there that a proper scheme be entered into.</P>
    <P>I thank all who contacted me and made me aware that there were challenges and difficulties in the existing schemes. In particular, I look forward to meeting the chairmen of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta to hear their views on how they intend to come to grips with this and ensure that the pension schemes are properly worked out in order that proper arrangements are made. That is only right and I have a duty to ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a standard provision regarding the expenses of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Enterprise. Lest Members think that I will go off with a great deal of money from Aer Lingus, it has nothing to do with that but has to do with the expenses of running the IPO. Let the Senators all be clear on that.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the repayment to the Exchequer of a loan &ndash; I think it is £5 million &ndash; and outstanding interest by Aer Lingus. Section 12 provides for the disapplication of certain Acts to Aer Lingus. Section 13 gives the Short Title and commencement provisions.</P>
    <P>When I came into the Department this time three years ago &ndash; in fact, it was five days from this date &ndash; one of the first files put in front of me was the Aer Lingus file. My predecessor, Deputy Dukes, had written in April 1997 to the chairman, Mr. Bernie Cahill, to ask his and the board's <Col N="1434" /> views on the future of Aer Lingus. Time moves on and Governments come and go, and three years later here we are dealing with the response of the same chairman &ndash; it seems only elected people change. The chairman responded by letter to me, then Aer Lingus set up a study and there was the appraisal of that study. I took a memorandum to Cabinet, and a second memorandum, and there were exploratory talks between the advisers. There is now the invitation to the trades unions to come to real talks and I hope this will be taken up. I hope the issues of the pension scheme and the ESOP will be determined soon.</P>
    <P>I hope, having heard the views of this House and the Dáil, that we can arrive at a decent Bill containing whatever amendments may be felt necessary, and I am open to that. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the views of the Members of the Seanad on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltim roimh an tAire go dtí an Teach seo arís. Is Bille an-thábhachtach é. Aontaoím gur rud tábhachtach go mbeadh an mBille seo romhainn, ach níl mé ró-shásta faoin modh ina tháinig sé isteach.</P>
      <P>My party supports the Bill and the principle behind it. We have no difficulty with the Bill, but I have some difficulty with it coming in at such short notice. As it is such an important Bill, I am not satisfied that I have had enough time to research all of the arguments which I should rehearse here. Perhaps on Committee Stage there may be other arguments I may make which I will not make now. I reiterate that my party welcomes the proposals in the Bill. There is no future for Aer Lingus except through this IPO.</P>
      <P>The future growth of this important company is tied to its new relationship with Oneworld alliance and, in particular, with the investment Aer Lingus must provide over the next five years to run successfully the current business and to improve, change, rationalise, modernise, etc. The company will need more than £1 billion. The sum of money it needs to raise is significant and obviously the IPO will produce some of that. The Bill will allow the IPO to proceed as quickly as possible, and that is appropriate.</P>
      <P>The questions within the company regarding pensions addressed by the Minister are important. The share of the company which its workers will be given, to which the Minister referred, is important also. No doubt that matter will be concluded successfully in terms similar to those used in the Eircom launch, where it was done successfully. I have every confidence that that will happen here also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that on arriving in an aeroplane at Dublin Airport one will see many airlines operating. Many of them are competitors who internationally and locally forced down the price charged by the state airlines. The state airlines operated monopolies for far too long and the cost of a flight to London or France, for example, was exorbitant and unreal. It was not until the likes of Mr. Freddie Laker, Virgin Airlines and Ireland's <Col N="1435" /> Ryanair came into play that the prices fell. By selling this company through the IPO, it will make it much less reliant on the State and the involvement of the State will reduce considerably. I am unclear as to whether the Minister or her nominees will still hold an investment in the company, but it is right and proper that market forces will dictate to the consumers of the service exactly what price they will pay. I welcome the increased competition and deregulation and Aer Lingus's new alliance with British Airways and American Airlines.</P>
    <P>The real questions in people's minds will be whether they can or should buy Aer Lingus shares. The problem which the ordinary potential shareholder must think about is how attractive a prospect will Aer Lingus be.</P>
    <P>Some 550,000 people purchased shares in Eircom and, like many others, I encouraged everybody to buy only a small number of shares. Those who were sharp enough to sell quickly made a profit but many of the rest of them, who may not have known about the cyclical nature of telecoms until they read the financial press after they bought shares, are very unhappy now with their investment. It is not fair to say, as some people do, that they took that risk. To buy shares in Eircom was a big decision for the ordinary Irish punter. When they got involved, they did so thinking they were getting a good bargain and hoping they would make a reasonable profit in a reasonably short time. Many of them are sorry they got involved. It was not the Minister's wish, my wish or anyone's wish that that should have happened, but the fact is it did happen.</P>
    <P>The key issues in the Aer Lingus initial public offering will be the launch price of the shares and what the advisers, the Minister and others must take into account in determining the launch price. People will be concerned about that and rightly so because they want value for money. The value of Eircom shares was set too high and that has been shown to be the case in the context of telecommunications companies on the market throughout the world. The issue is the price at which people will buy, and people would like to own shares in Aer Lingus. The Minister said, when launching the Eircom shares, that it was an adventure for everyone. It will be a much more cautious adventure on this occasion, but it is one our party supports. We are in favour of and support the thrust of what the Minister is trying to do, but a great deal more thought must go into determining the price of shares. That will be the critical factor. They cannot be too cheap because the silverware cannot be sold for little or nothing, yet they cannot be overpriced. There are wise people whom the Minister will pay a great deal of money to give her advice on determining the price because it will be a critical factor in people's attitudes to the offer.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which arose with Eircom shares is that we assumed the strategic partners which Eircom took on board were locked in for <Col N="1436" /> a certain period. However, they are now trying to offload their shares on a market that does not want to buy them. This has been critical in the reduction of the price of Eircom shares. I am not completely clear on this because I only had a short time to inquire, but I understand that Aer Lingus will not take on a strategic partner to invest in the IPO. I understand British Airways and others offered to buy a 10% share in the company initially.</P>

      <P>I accept that. I am trying to tease out the issues and perhaps the Minister will respond to them today or another day. If major players who are not strategic partners are to purchase Aer Lingus shares, we need to think that through and debate it because it is an important issue.</P>
      <P>Regarding the future control of Aer Lingus, I do not have a problem with it being part of a global alliance because it is a good thing. However, we must think strategically and identify what problems, if any, there may be in future. If there is an amalgamation of these massive, multi-faceted companies which will eventually control our major airline, we must consider how that will impact on services. Competition and deregulation in the industry will not be a problem.</P>
      <P>The nature of the aviation industry is cyclical. At present, things were never better. Never were there more passengers and never was it so busy, so everyone is happy. However, it will not always be that way. We must give consideration to when things change, as they inevitably will given the cyclical nature of the business.</P>
      <P>I have a criticism not just of Aer Lingus but of every airline. On short haul flights, one is only sitting in the aircraft for an hour or two hours, but when one travels the transatlantic routes, there is a problem in that there is a very small margin between one's seat and the person sitting in front.</P>

      <P>When a good rugby supporter, such as Senator Glennon, or someone like me who wants to sit back in his seat, sits in front, there is a serious problem with personal space. I have written to Aer Lingus about this and I was told there had never been a complaint until my letter was received. I do not believe that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the issue may seem amusing, medical evidence shows, however, that, in terms of long haul flights, there is a greater possibility of people having a stroke when they are crammed into the coach area where there is a mix of oxygen and air. I read about this recently and it showed that, in first class, there is no problem, but that the situation deteriorates as one moves down the <Col N="1437" /> plane. It is a serious medical issue. I was surprised when I read about it recently and perhaps Aer Lingus will take note of it. I hope I am not the only one concerned about the lack of space in coach class in which most of us travel. I want Aer Lingus to address that. The principle of packing people into aeroplanes is not acceptable, especially on long haul flights. I believe people would pay more if they had a little more space. It can be very uncomfortable, even if the price seems reasonable, and it can also be very unhealthy, so I would like that issue addressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill. I understand from what the Minister said that she is prepared to consider amendments. That is good and positive. I reiterate my warning about the share price. People who invested money in Eircom are not happy. They feel they are getting poor value for money. We want to entice them to buy, but they have had a chastening experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach. Aontaíom go hiomlán leis an Seanadóir O'Dowd agus cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille tábhachtach seo. The hallmark of the Minister since coming into office three years ago has been to bring pioneering legislation before us. The Eircom legislation set the frame<Col N="1438" /> work for further IPOs and I am pleased the Minister is following on in an area which is of fundamental importance to the economy and the Irish air transport industry.</P>
      <P>She rightly pointed out the progress made by Aer Lingus. It is a credit to the board, the management, the staff, the Department and the Minister who all played their part in ensuring that Aer Lingus, especially in the past decade, has become a much more commercially focused organisation than it was previously. It had many economic, financial and industrial difficulties, which can often emerge when a company enjoys a monopoly and develops practices which would not be sustainable in a more competitive environment. The company underwent a traumatic and difficult period. It is gratifying that the hard work, effort and sacrifices made by many are now showing fruits and that this strong vibrant company can be confidently floated on the stock market where, no doubt, it will be subscribed to by people who are anxious to become involved in that sector of our economy. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the role played by Aer Lingus over the years. As the Minister rightly said, it has contributed to the economic life of the country and, in particular, tourism must be singled out.</P>
      <P>As an island it was essential to have our own airline and the provision of the necessary services and access to this country, particularly when the number of airlines worldwide was far less and they were less inclined to come here. People in general took an element of pride in the national airline. It was a flagship and was seen as such. Glasgow Celtic invariably uses Aer Lingus, as does another football club in Liverpool of dubious standard.</P>
      <P>We should remember particularly Seán Lemass, who was heavily involved in developing the emerging democracy of the 1930s and who played a significant and pivotal role in the development of many semi-State companies such as the ESB, Bord na Móna and, indeed, Aer Lingus. Seán Lemass and his generation had the vision to make these decisions and the courage to implement them. It is important that such people be credited with the success of the company. It will emerge as a strong private company with people wishing to invest in it to ensure its success for the future.</P>
      <P>The current health of Aer Lingus underlines in a real way the benefit of competition. That is not lost on the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke. Competition has played a significant and positive role in the strengthening of the commercial ethos of that company. At a time when we are suffering the effects of monopoly in our rail system there is a lesson that competition is the secret of success in ensuring a healthier rail and bus transport system in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus will also have to continue its progression to a more commercial focus. When it becomes a public limited company, internal cultural changes will have to take place to meet the <Col N="1439" /> needs of the market. Recently there was the Oneworld alliance and the involvement with American Airlines indicates it is preparing itself well for the transformation. We can feel confident that despite the challenges involved, it will successfully make the transition.</P>
    <P>Some people might question whether if the State loses its influence and involvement we will diminish to an extent our control as a peripheral island on the west coast of Europe. I would not subscribe to any doubts in that area. Undoubtedly, Aer Lingus can, as has been shown by Ryanair, become more successful and more progressive from a marketing point of view. Like Senator O'Dowd, I also feel that in the past the consumer did not get the best deal possible from our air transport system. That was probably due to insufficient competition on some of the more prominent routes. As a consequence, people were paying well in excess of what the economic and competitive fare should have been.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd made an interesting point about the difficulties with his knees on some of the long haul flights. I will state again an argument in favour of competition. When I was in the US some years ago, TWA removed one or two rows of seats from their aeroplanes which they announced publicly and advertised that people would have greater leg room&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They are pot belly up now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a great example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That company used it as a marketing device, probably about ten years ago. Perhaps as the Minister said, the step taken to improve competition was ill-advised. It shows the innovative initiatives airlines and, indeed, any industry in a competitive environment will have to take to outsmart others. This can be achieved not only on price but also on quality, value and service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note from section 3 of the Bill that any funds received will obviously be to the benefit of the Exchequer. I suggest the Minister might give consideration to ensuring that any funds received should be re-invested in regional airports and regional air routes. Given the tremendous traffic congestion in our capital city it behoves us to look at other ways of diverting traffic away from one centre of population. Our ports have been addressed but our regional airports need investment and focus to ensure people can travel to any part of Ireland, Britain and any other major European centre where business takes place. It would be a significant contribution for the dispersal of industry. One of the attractions for many industries coming to Ireland is ease and speed of access. We would benefit if we could counterbalance our regional development in that manner. It would be good to see profits recouped from investment and diverted into a similar area of transport which requires it, such as the sale of shares in Aer Lingus, which for a long time was <Col N="1440" /> our only source of investment, other than Aer Rianta, in air transport.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross, in particular, did not necessarily subscribe to the notion that employees in Telecom should have got 15% in shares. I compliment the Minister on this provision and it is an enlightened approach. It is important that people working in a company have an absolute commitment, and one of the best ways of ensuring that is to allow them participate in the shareholding of the company. Therefore, their fortunes, so to speak, will fluctuate with the fortunes of the company. It is a good coincidence of interests and one I would advocate. I compliment the Minister for taking this approach. I am sure this will be the blueprint for other IPOs and other public sector companies.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has served this country well but it has had its difficulties. It has shown great resourcefulness in overcoming these difficulties and I have no doubt the Bill will open up a new chapter of development for the airline and, I hope, for the island. As I said, this is a peripheral country and it is essential that we have the best possible competitive access, be it for tourism, business, goods and so on, to our European partners and, indeed, to the wider world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill, not only with a sense of joy but with a sense of relief that we are facing up to reality. I am delighted this Bill bites the bullet. Although it was rushed before us today, I can understand why&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come another time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not know until this morning that we would have to speak on this Bill and felt we might not be prepared for it. It was interesting to listen to the Minister and to read through her paper. I am in a different business but I looked at the similarity between the two. Some of the words the Minister used like &ldquo;consolidation, globalisation, alliances, a need for massive capital investment&rdquo; also relate to my type of business. It is interesting to note that the words used by the Minister regarding the airline business relate to so many other businesses. The Minister referred to companies which start-up from nowhere and succeed and the challenge of technology. Safety is as important a factor in the airline business as food safety is in the food business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;competition&rdquo; cropped up a number of times in the Minister's speech. The area of competition, about which Senator Walsh spoke when he referred to TWA, is customer driven and market driven. I cannot think of a better example of this than the airlines. Senator O'Dowd referred to the fact that we had two airlines operating between Dublin and London at a cost of £239. Look what happened. We now have competition. One has a right to run an airline between any two cities in Europe if you can meet the safety regulations, etc. The change is dramatic. Many <Col N="1441" /> people spoke of the doom and gloom awaiting us if we allowed competition in. We ended up with many airlines, some of which suceeded while some failed. We now have far more passengers, far lower prices and far more people employed than ever before. All the threats of doom vanished because of competition.</P>
    <P>We are looking for a debate in this House on rising inflation. One of the challenges facing us is the control of inflation. One way of doing that is to introduce competition. A great example of that is what has happened in the airlines over the last 15 years. We have heard the complaints people have about having their knees stuck in their mouth while in an aeroplane. The Minister said TWA are no longer in business. I am not sure about that; I think they are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe they revived themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They did run into trouble. Pan Am did something similar and went out of business. There is no rule which points the way to success in this or any business. I travelled with Southwest Airlines in the United States on one occasion and had to squeeze into a seat with a man much bigger than I who could not fit into two seats. I do not have the same problem as Senator O'Dowd. Southwest Airlines state that what they look for is core competence and that meant getting into an airport and out again within 30 minutes. They decided on that basis they would not serve something which had to be cleaned up. They did not have time to clean the planes. I know that is happening within Ryanair also. Other airlines overwhelm you with service for a higher price.</P>
      <P>I have drifted somewhat but it appears to me that some of those examples are the way to succeed. I love the story &ndash; it may not be quite true &ndash; of an aircraft in the United States which, having driven out to the end of the tarmacadam, could not take off as a light was flashing in the cockpit. An unhappy passenger said, &ldquo;That means a two hour delay,&rdquo; but within five minutes of turning around they came out again and he said to the hostess, &ldquo;That's wonderful, you must have changed the engine very quickly,&rdquo; and she replied, &ldquo;No, we just changed the pilot.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are some things one does not compete with. One should not compete on safety. What a great record Aer Lingus has. No airline ever stands up and shouts about what a great safety record it has. We are proud of what Aer Lingus has done in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This biting of the bullet is interesting. To anyone of my generation, Aer Lingus is part of what we are. When I was growing up the idea of having a national airline was seen as an essential badge of nationhood. If you did not have one you were not seen as a real nation. We followed the fortunes of our national airline with a sense of pride throughout those years. I was delighted to hear Senator Walsh referring to Séan Lemass. We <Col N="1442" /> could add to that people like Gerry Dempsey, Michael Dargan and others. They must feel a sense of pride now.</P>
    <P>We rejoiced in the successes of Aer Lingus and we continued to lend it sympathetic support as it went through those difficult times. Aer Lingus played a key role in the development of our tourism industry. It is easy to be casual about our success in tourism and in attracting business, but it was not always like this. I grew up in a business which depended on tourism. I remember the difficult times in the 1950s and 1960s. The promotional efforts of Aer Lingus in the main markets for Irish tourism were a central part of the national effort which brought tourism to the level it has reached today. I was always proud of the advertisements I saw abroad for Ireland. It did not have to advertise Aer Lingus, it only had to advertise Ireland because the only way one could travel there was through Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>We are living in a changing world. We were right to want a nationally owned airline in the 1930s and 1940s. We wanted it, we needed it and it did very well for us in those days, but to continue to cling on to that vision in today's shrinking world would be nothing more than nostalgia. The future for Aer Lingus in its present form would be very short. Few fundamental things change and we touched on them today. We are ending the notion of a State airline kept afloat by repeated injections of State money. Aer Lingus was kept afloat out of a sense of national pride and an imperative demand that every country should have a state-owned airline. I did not know that Olympic is the only remaining state-owned airline. That concept is gone forever. The notion that the European Union would consist of a grouping of different states all supporting their costly badges of nationhood in the form of heavily subsidised airlines has no future. The cost of maintaining such a family of albatrosses would hold back the European Union's growth and undermine its competitive position.</P>
    <P>The second concept to be eliminated is the notion of an airline restricted by national boundaries. Just as we have seen the revolution in telecommunications destroy our long held concept of distance, we will see the effect of globalisation on the airline business. The future of the world's airline industry is a marketplace with fewer players than before. Even those players will tend to be bound together in an ever smaller groupings or alliances. We may not like this concentration of our world industry &ndash; and I am talking about my own business &ndash; but it is a reality. We cannot fight it. The cold reality is that there is no future for Aer Lingus as a State-owned airline. The Minister has faced up to that. Aer Lingus must be privatised. I understand that there is a narrow window of opportunity to do that at the right time. I trust the Minister has identified that and that is the reason we are putting this Bill through this week.</P>
    <P>Privatising the airline is today's business but let no one be in any doubt that it is the final step. <Col N="1443" /> They should not think that is the end of it. It is instead an intermediate step before the airline becomes part of a much larger entity serving a wider marketplace than before and from a different perspective. I welcome this move because there is no alternative to it. We do not have a choice other than to watch helplessly while the airline slides into bankruptcy and irrelevance in a world that is changing too fast for it. That is what will happen if we do not do something, no matter how well-meaning we are.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has served Ireland well and let us be thankful for that. Now let us stand back and watch with pride as it fends for itself in the world marketplace, where I believe it will not merely make its way. I like the word &ldquo;flotation&rdquo;, although that would be the right word if we were launching a ship &ndash; perhaps &ldquo;soaring into the air&rdquo; would be better.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd mentioned the price. This is a business and business involves risk. I have no problems with those who invested in Eircom. They knew what they were doing and if they did not they should not have invested. When one invests in an airline or telecommunications company one knows one is taking a risk that might or might not succeed. Let us make sure we support this and that we give it the start it deserves. I trust the Minister in this area and on that basis I believe it will succeed. Let us remember it is a risk and there is no guarantee of success. I wish the privatisation and Aer Lingus itself well. It is only the first step on a much longer journey.</P>
    <P>I was going to say I was looking forward to a maiden speech, but then I realised it was not a maiden speech so I wondered what the alternative was, perhaps a virgin speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister and this important legislation, not just for Aer Lingus but for the country as a whole. Previous speakers have touched on the importance of Aer Lingus in the fabric of Irish life since its foundation in the 1930s. It is not just a matter of the economic life of the country, although we all know how important it has been in that regard, but the social fabric of the area I come from has been hugely dependent on the prosperity of Dublin Airport and Aer Lingus in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My earliest recollection of Aer Lingus is of being six years old and sitting on my poor father's shoulders as he carried me across fields. We got the bus from Skerries into the city as there was no link road then from where the main round<Col N="1444" /> about is now, although this was not 100 years ago. We traipsed through fields in which the corn was higher than I was and, for fear of losing me, my father carried me on his shoulders for half a mile or so. Some Senators may recall there was just one access road &ndash; the old Collinstown Road, which was a direct extension of the Santry Road.</P>
    <P>At the time Farranfore was somewhere in Kerry and Cork was a place that would probably complain if it did not get an airport eventually, while airports in Galway, Sligo and Carrickfin were absolutely unheard of. Times have changed. Senators on all sides have alluded to pride and that is appropriate, as there was not just national pride but also local pride in north County Dublin in the success of Aer Lingus. My father was a good Fianna Fáil man and, given Seán Lemass's strong links with Skerries, it was a matter of huge personal pride to everyone in north County Dublin then and now that Aer Lingus was our flagship carrier, carrying the shamrock across the airways of the world in a positive manner and providing a high quality service, which it continues to do. It has created the standard to which all other Irish airlines in particular must aspire.</P>
    <P>From the late 1960s to 1990s Aer Lingus was on a roller coaster ride &ndash; if that is possible for an airline &ndash; which culminated in the mid 1990s and the rescue package we know as the Cahill plan. That plan was the major turning point for Aer Lingus and it is important that due tribute be paid to the team headed by Mr. Cahill which drafted the plan, the employees who took it on board courageously and the Government which supported it so strongly. If that plan had not been produced and adopted as it was we would not have this Bill and it would not be possible for Aer Lingus to develop commercially as we hope it will.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has 6,200 employees, which makes it a giant employer by Irish standards and a major employer by any international standard. Spin-off industries employ probably double that number, directly and indirectly, within a 20 mile radius of Dublin Airport. We should reflect on those figures as they are staggering in an Irish context. The importance of a vibrant Aer Lingus to Dublin Airport and, by extension, to the country cannot be ignored. I will restate those figures &ndash; Aer Lingus employs 6,200 employees worldwide and it is estimated that approximately double that number of workers are employed in ancillary industries within 20 miles of Dublin Airport, never mind the other airports around the country.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has been the forerunner of and has set standards for Ryanair, Aer Arann and other Irish airlines. Even allowing for the fierce competition in which these companies are involved, there is more than a grudging acknowledgment of the success of Aer Lingus and those airlines are happy to have Aer Lingus to be measured against. Ryanair's budget strategy, in particular, can only be measured in comparison with a quality carrier.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> The aviation industry in Ireland is thriving and it is also a very exciting time for the industry internationally. Aviation is an essential element in the national infrastructure which has been the basis of our recent economic resurgence. I may be guilty of repetition, but in discussing a Bill of this importance to Aer Lingus, due cognisance should be taken of the importance of the company to the national economy. When we want the volume of international trade to grow, a successful airline of the quality of Aer Lingus is a huge aid in portraying an image of Ireland abroad as a progressive and dynamic country.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the superannuation scheme. I note the Minister's comments and would like to reiterate that this section is a source of major concern to the employees. In my short career in public service, I have already received many representations on this issue. I know the matter is in hand and that a task force has been established. I look forward to a successful conclusion to the difficulty. I cannot, nor do I think we should, underestimate the importance of a well motivated workforce in a company at such a critical juncture in its history.</P>
    <P>It is very important that issues of shareholding &ndash; I congratulate the Minister on the manner in which it has been dealt with in the Bill &ndash; and pensions are not confused. Shareholding is an entirely separate issue from pensions. A significant proportion of the 6,200 employees have particularly long service. One of the characteristics of Aer Lingus is lengthy service. It is not a company from which people move too readily and that, in itself, is a tribute to the history of good staff relations within the company. I strongly urge that the issue of pensions be dealt with as positively as possible and that the goodwill of the workforce is harnessed because it will be needed at this stage in the company's development.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these are exciting times internationally in relation to the aviation industry generally. I am told there are no longer Government controls on the number of carriers which may operate particular routes or on the capacity to be offered or the fares to be charged. The open market, I understand, is to be extended later this year with the conclusion of an agreement between the European Union and ten central and eastern European countries. The Department of Public Enterprise has already received inquiries from a number of these countries which are interested in operating air services to Ireland. I do not have to go into detail on the importance of Aer Lingus to tourism in Ireland and, particularly, to tourism in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Across Europe governments are withdrawing from direct control of airlines and only the Greek airline, Olympic Airlines, has been left in public ownership. As the Minister has said, its days in public ownership appear to be numbered.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments of my colleague, Senator Walsh, in relation to investment in regional airports. The flotation of Aer Lingus is <Col N="1446" /> an ideal opportunity to direct some of the funds generated to this area. If the expansion which has taken place at Dublin Airport could be replicated, even to a small degree, in some of the provincial airports, it would not only make a huge difference to the quality of air travel in this country and to facilitating such travel, but would also, hopefully, be a major advantage to the local economies around those regional airports of which there is such a strong network.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator O'Dowd for his good wishes. I share his views on the lack of space which a certain percentage of our population have to endure on flights. Senator O'Dowd limited his comments to long haul flights but, unfortunately, I have the difficulty all the time. Perhaps he and I could do a deal with Aer Lingus that in return for shedding a few stone, it might give us a few extra cubic inches.</P>
    <P>I will not get involved in the issues raised in relation to the stock market. I note Senator Ross has joined us and, while I will not agree in advance to everything he will say, I will listen to him intently.</P>

There are many clichés which could be used such as<i> bon voyage,</i> God speed and speedy passage, but I hope whatever it takes will be available to the Minister and that this Bill will enjoy a successful, smooth and quick passage through the Houses. It creates tremendous possibilities, not only for the company but for the country.</P>

      <P>I join in the unanimous congratulations to Senator Glennon on his speech, one of the best and most interesting maiden speeches we have heard in this House in a very long time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill. While the contents of the Bill are enabling and, therefore, tell us very little about the Minister's and the Government's plans, we should welcome the principle that Aer Lingus is to be privatised soon, that the Government is not frightened of going down this privatisation road and that that ideological taboo has now been conquered. We are very happy to privatise companies where we think it is appropriate and in the interests of the industry, the Government, the workforce and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say very much about this Bill because there is very little in it. However, I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward early because there is a fear among some of the doom mongers in the financial community and some of <Col N="1447" /> the press that somehow after Eircom, privatisation will not go ahead.</P>
    <P>I would like to nail one lie here and now which I see appearing in every organ and amongst the Opposition and a few others about Eircom. The Eircom flotation, contrary to what everybody says when they describe it as a fiasco and a disaster, was an extraordinary success and it is about time people realised that. Eircom shares were floated at around 3.90 euro and went to a price of about 5 euro. If anything, the Government could be criticised for selling it a little too cheaply. Every private investor should have been satisfied for many months that they were sitting on profits. All we have heard in the last few weeks is their bellyaching and being encouraged by the ignorant and <i>agents provocateur</i> in the media to be dissatisfied because they have shares which are now somehow showing a loss. They thought, and were led to believe by the Opposition, that shares go up a euro every day. That is not what privatisation is about.</P>
    <P>Eircom was a thundering success for the Government, the Minister and for those who bought shares, but it does not mean they are going to make money forever. It is a very good thing that they are now below water because if they were not, the great shareholding public would think, for some reason, that buying privatised shares was a guarantee for a 20% to 50% gain overnight. It is not and it never has been. Those who did not take it are the mugs and I am one of them &ndash; I did not take it. I have a shareholding in it and I did not take the profits &ndash; I sat on them. I could have taken a very nice profit at 5 euro or at 4.90 euro, 4.80 euro or 4.60 euro, but I did not. I am sitting on them at 3 euro or 2.95 euro today and I am perfectly happy because I am used to losing and making money in stocks and shares.</P>
    <P>Let us nail the lie that because they are below water at this time, the privatisation has not worked. It worked brilliantly for the Government and small shareholders up to now, and they have been making money 80% to 90% of the time. That flotation was a great success but it was a difficult flotation because so much money was involved. It was a global flotation, which Aer Lingus will be, but on a smaller scale. The Eircom flotation succeeded in getting institutions around the world to buy shares and to put a large amount of money into the hands of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>We must also remember that whereas 500,000 people bought Eircom shares, many people did not buy shares. What are our obligations to those people? Has the Minister got a single obligation to the 500,000 people who bought shares at the expense of the 2.5 million people who did not buy them? They would have been the losers. Let us put the lie to those who claim the Eircom flotation was not a success. It was a thundering success and remains so. One cannot measure the success of a flotation by the fact that it goes down for a few weeks almost one year later. That is <Col N="1448" /> ridiculous and is the gospel of the utterly ignorant trying to create trouble. That is what happened with the Opposition. I do not blame it, but it should be exposed for doing so.</P>
    <P>Let us learn the lesson in the context of Aer Lingus and not be frightened by the prophets of doom or those who can jog backwards and foresee what was going to happen after it happens. Let us not be frightened by those who claim it was a disaster. It was not a disaster, it was a success. Let us go ahead with the Aer Lingus flotation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It is dangerous to do so but I will offer a hostage to fortune and predict that when Aer Lingus is sold it will not flop but will fly. The reason will be that the controversy over the price of Eircom is a bogus controversy. According to reports, the Minister was advised to sell at £4.30 by some people and at £3.70 by others, all of whom had vested interests. The people who advised £4.30 would have received larger fees if the shares sold at that price and those who said £3.70 tended to be the management's advisers in whose interests it is to have a low figure because they look better if the share price goes up, and their options are probably more valuable, if they get them.</P>
    <P>The same will happen with the Aer Lingus flotation. The Minister will receive conflicting advice but the price will be determined by whether the shares will sell. People will look at the market, do a book-building exercise and ask what people will pay for the shares. The institutions will decide, not the retailers. They know what they will pay and the shares will be sold at that price. The flotation will not be a failure because that would be an extraordinary indictment of the advisers and the Government. They cannot afford such a failure because there are so many other privatisations to take place. A failure with one of these flotations would put the others in trouble.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that, because we are being told we have done so badly with Eircom, the retail element will be far smaller and the price will be dictated by the institutions which are very clever at these things. One fund manager &ndash; I think it was Hibernian &ndash; tried to railroad the Government and its advisers into valuing Aer Lingus at, I think, 300 million. This manager said the company is not worth much more than that and is already talking down the price. That is a legitimate tactic but if we allow people to do so by saying Eircom was such a failure, which it was not, we will be forcing ourselves to sell the company short. That would be a tragedy. The company would still be sold as the institutions would decide the price. The problem is that retailers may not be interested and that would be a great pity. There is an opportunity for small investors to join in what could be a very profitable enterprise.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it will be a good investment but nor does anyone else if we do not know the price. However, people should not be told this is a bad opportunity. There is so much ignorant <Col N="1449" /> talk to the effect that there is no way Aer Lingus can be sold now. It is only a matter of price. Advisers will look at the price of the company and the price of a few airlines around the world, they will take a price earnings ratio and price the company a little below that. Then they will claim it is an attractive offer, take it and dictate the price.</P>
    <P>As a small investor, I would not mind institutions dictating a price to the Government and would be happy to piggy-back on them. The Minister might consider copying the Deutsche Telekom third issue last week which priced the shares to institutions at 66.50. The retail investors, of which I was one &ndash; I have to keep declaring my interests &ndash; bought shares at 3 cheaper than the institutions. This guaranteed a large retail subscription and all those who came in at a discount of 3 are sitting on a small profit. I sold on the first day as there is nothing wrong with 3% over night. It is better than one gets in the banks and a bit more than inflation. There was great attraction in that offer.</P>
    <P>In addition, there was an offer of getting one share for every ten if one held the shares for 18 months. That is another way of involving retailers, even though it is slightly less honest as there can be a reflection on the share price coming up to that time. However, there is a great attraction in encouraging people to come in by offering them a discount over institutions. This option should be considered. One is giving retail investors a real discount and can let the cowards like myself get out with a small amount. However, retail investors are getting a good start and one knows institutions will still pay above that level on the second, third and fourth days, all other elements of the market being equal. Aer Lingus has great possibilities and will be a great success. This is a good, ideological Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to answer a few questions in which I am particularly interested. I assume that 100% of Aer Lingus will be sold. I do not know whether the Government has given a commitment on this issue or whether it will only sell a certain amount of the company. I assume the intention is to sell 100% of the company. However, I understand that less than 50% of Aer Rianta will be sold. I do not understand why the Government sells 100% of Eircom and less than 50% of Aer Rianta. The Minister will probably say Aer Rianta is a vital national interest and we have to keep the airports open. However, that is a serious commercial problem for any investor, particularly an institutional investor, if it is going to take an interest and then finds the Government has what is, in effect, a golden share.</P>
    <P>My concern is that the Government will maintain control of Aer Rianta. If it does so it will not be a good commercial investment because successive Governments will appoint cronies to the board, make commercial decisions for the company and put pressure on it to do all sorts of things which will mean it is not subject to normal commercial criteria. What is the difference with <Col N="1450" /> Aer Lingus? Are investors expected to pay a high commercial price and still have the Government breathing down their necks? That is the nanny state making political decisions.</P>
    <P>In the case of Eircom, the Minister tactfully managed to persuade some directors that their best interests lay in moving to other areas and then made suitable commercial appointments. In other words, political appointees were moved out and those more attuned to the commercial world and more acceptable to the prospective investors were moved in.</P>
    <P>The board of Aer Lingus is full of political appointees. Some, maybe all, of them have great commercial experience and some, maybe all, are there on merit. However, that is not the case as a general rule in semi-State bodies. Semi-State bodies in this country are riddled with party political loyalists. What plans does the Minister have for removing those party political loyalists pre-privatisation and replacing them with people whose directorships do not have such a complexion?</P>
    <P>Is it planned to appoint a chief executive to Aer Lingus pre-privatisation because it is obviously appropriate that one be put in place a considerable time beforehand. One of the problems with Eircom has been the question mark over management. Some investors are worried the management of Eircom has not been up to scratch and they have sold their shares as a result. They are also worried about the structures at Eircom, which are similar to Aer Lingus. I am talking about over-manning and the issue of workers' shares.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Government's political need because of the precedent set to give so many shares to the workers. I do not believe that the return they get from workers in the form of what they call &ldquo;changes in work practices&rdquo; merits this. That is a smokescreen. There is enabling legislation on this. What percentage does the Minister intend to give to the workers? Is that considered a deterrent to investment and privatisation? In my experience, there are investors in Eircom who are reluctant to hold on to their shares because of over-manning and worker participation. It does not compete, nor will Aer Lingus compete with other airlines or on the Stock Exchange if management has its hands tied and workers have a pivotal number of shares in the company.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill. I also compliment Senator Glennon on his speech and his use of notes rather than a script, which is the tradition of the House. He knew his subject so well he barely had to refer to them. The points raised about insufficient leg room and poor cabin ventilation are of serious significance. There is an increased incidence of problems such as deep vein thrombosis because of the cramped conditions in economy class, as opposed to business and first class. Senator O'Dowd can give this as a reason for getting an aisle seat. It is particularly serious on long flights. Ventilation and the spread <Col N="1451" /> of minor diseases and major ones such as tuberculosis is also an important issue. The Minister can inform people of this when discussing the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Glennon on his maiden &ndash; I will use that term because it is generic &ndash; speech and I was honoured he made it on a Bill I introduced. I thank him for his well thought-out and robust contribution. I thank Senator O'Dowd who spoke in favour of the Bill. He referred to the major airlines and the cyclical nature of airline travel. This cycle is continuing to increase, hence our need to divest when it is strong. The Senator spoke about cramped seating. I am sorry about that but I think these conditions apply to all airlines, not just this one. He also referred to Eircom shares and I will deal with that when I reply to Senator Ross. I thank Senator O'Dowd for his enthusiasm for the Bill and for competition.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Walsh for welcoming the Bill. He referred to the evils of monopoly, which is true. I have not met one consumer who does well in a monopoly. Of all the professions, politicians recognise that because we do not earn our living by being part of a monopoly but by having competition constantly snapping at our heels, whether we are in the Dáil or Seanad. Senator Walsh acknowledged the role of Aer Lingus and the benefits of competition. He is concerned that some of the money from the sale should be invested in regional airports.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn referred to globalisation, technology, consolidation, competition &ndash; all the words he said he would use on the radio or talking to staff in his stores. The exact qualities which guide him in his business, both buying and selling, are inherent in this Bill. He spoke about biting the bullet. I was determined to bring forward this Bill since the brouhaha about Eircom. I called it Enid Blyton type behaviour, as if there was a Famous Five plot to engulf everybody, so I would think more kindly of those talking about it. I noted a growing trend among economic commentators who said the Government had lost its bottle and it would not continue what they wanted, which was to free up the companies and make them compete. Aer Lingus has been competing for 13 or 14 years. I was determined, no matter how short or long our term of office &ndash; I hope it will be long &ndash; that we would still keep our bottle. I am glad the legislation has progressed this far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn said Aer Lingus is no longer a State airline kept alive by State intervention. One cannot do this with any company in a global market. No company wants to go cap in hand to the Government and ask to be bailed out. Aer Lingus and its employees put that behind them under Bernie Cahill. They knuckled down and used their money. The EU had ceased to provide funding. Senator Quinn is right that State intervention in bailing out what is a commercial company is a <Col N="1452" /> nonsensical concept. Aer Lingus does not want that any more. Senator Quinn said Aer Lingus is not confined by national boundaries and its privatisation is an intermediate step to a new and wider world.</P>
    <P>Senator Glennon welcomed the Bill. His recollection of being brought through the cornfields on his father's shoulders to see the planes was an evocative image reminiscent of Alice Taylor. He said he saw the planes as magical and they remain so in many people's minds. He spoke about national pride and paid tribute to the chairman. I also pay tribute to the chairman and former chairmen and boards &ndash; they deserve it. Senator Glennon also referred to regional airports.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross said he was glad I was not frightened away. I suppose in a perverse way I am not daunted by events, rather they make me the opposite. I was determined to progress this legislation. I welcome Senator Ross's contribution.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, I told Deputy Yates to get a life. The idea that one could guarantee to people that shares will stay up forever is dafter than Enid Blyton. If that were the case, why would anybody work when they could just buy shares that went up all the time? For 11 weeks of this year, from January to almost the end of March, the shares increased by between 15% and 25%. However, I cannot force anyone to sell. It is their own business whether they sell or not. The idea that I can wave a wand and suddenly make every share of a company we sell stay up in value is so daft and dotty that one would wonder how it came about. I hope retailers will purchase but I will not be giving any guarantee &ndash; and I never did &ndash; that the shares will stay up forever. If we ever arrive, as a nation, at a stage where shares stay up forever, we will all have died and gone to heaven, to which we are not entitled to go. We will have landed in a kind of El Dorado which is not of this world.</P>
    <P>I listened to the points Senator Ross raised. It will emerge very quickly whether all of Aer Lingus is to be sold. The Government has not taken a formal decision on it. I am aware that my partial privatisation plan for Aer Rianta and the fact that the Government will retain a majority shareholding in it will mean it is still a State institution, run by the State. That has connotations of nannies, mollycoddling and everything that goes with that.</P>
    <P>The Senator also spoke about the moving of the directors of Eircom. I am considering that at the moment with regard to Aer Lingus. I will, as I did with Eircom, take advice on that.</P>
    <P>Over-manning does not apply in Aer Lingus. It engaged in trimming exercises between 1993 and 1995 and again last year. Workers have been very involved in that process. There is a very strong workforce in Aer Lingus which has lived through horrendous times. The board is determined it will be in very good shape when it goes to market, in employment terms as well as everything else.</P>
    <P>The Senator also referred to the chief executive. I met the chairman last week by arrange<Col N="1453" /> ment. It seems they are deciding between two people and hope to make the appointment by the end of June. It would not be possible to go to the market without a chief executive. He or she will need to be a thumping good seller, open, forward looking and all-embracing. I hope that is what will happen.</P>
    <P>We have had a very lively debate. I welcome Senator Henry's contribution, which was made in the light of her own professional knowledge and competence. It shows the range of interests here.</P>
    <P>In regard to passengers being cramped, I am very sorry about Senator Glennon's size. It is very attractive, but I do not know what we can do about it if it gives him trouble on flights. I imagine it could give rise to air rage if he became so annoyed that he lashed out at people. However, that is by the way.</P>
    <P>Thank you, Sir, for your courtesy. I thank Members and the officials who have accompanied me on Second Stage. We had a very wide-ranging and good debate. I know it was upsetting for Members to have the debate sprung on them this morning and it was natural for them to vote on it. However, I thank them for the courtesy afforded to me.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann supports the review of the National Drugs Strategy being conducted by the Minister of State with special responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, with a view to identifying any gaps or deficiencies in its existing strategy and to develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new arrangements through which to deliver them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State. We both represent inner city constituencies and we have much experience of the problems caused by the misuse of drugs and the importation and distribution of illegal drugs. We see on a daily basis the human tragedies caused by this. Drug addicts are normally multiple abusers of drugs such as heroin, <Col N="1454" /> prescription drugs and alcohol and will go to any lengths, whether legal or illegal, to get their fix.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem facing those attempting to deal with the drug epidemic was getting the local non-drug taking population to realise there was a problem in their midst which could only be tackled locally, except in very serious and exceptional circumstances. I remember, as I am sure the Minister does, the halls filled with people protesting against any kind of facility being situated in their area.</P>
    <P>In this context, I welcome the local drugs task force, which is a partnership between the statutory, voluntary and community areas. To be parochial, I want to praise the Finglas-Cabra partnership for the intelligent and sensitive way it is carrying out its work. I am glad the Cabinet committee on social inclusion has increased the funding of the local drug task forces.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the £25 million allocated to the young people's facilities and services fund. The greatest problem facing the addict or recovering addict is what to do with his or her spare time. These people have much spare time when they are recovering and being weaned off their addiction, and this time must be occupied. In this context I welcome the facilities being provided through the young people's facilities and services fund which will provide education, training and personal development courses. The fund will play an increasing role in the rehabilitation of recovering addicts.</P>
    <P>Earlier I said substance addicts are normally misusers of multiple drugs or medication, always mixed with alcohol. A growing threat down the road is the future health implications of the growing abuse of alcohol. People seem to be getting access to alcohol at a younger age. At weekends we see children under the influence of alcohol on the streets of our city and behaving in a very anti-social way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very tough job to do, but he has great experience at the coalface and I have no doubt he will bring energy, enthusiasm and dedication to the job of containing the spread of the misuse of drugs, to weaning drug addicts from their addiction and rehabilitating them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and welcome the Minister. The abuse of drugs has serious implications not only for those directly involved but for those around them. I worked in an area where drug abusers were treated. When we speak of drug abusers we often forget about alcohol, the social drug, and often fail to appreciate the potential dangers pertaining to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Illegal drug use is a problem in every city, town and village. While I agree the problem is more acute in Dublin because of heroin, the drug to which abusers of other drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy normally graduate, we must not lose sight of the fact that children everywhere are experimenting and dabbling in drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy. The hub of a drug abuser's existence is getting the next fix, and everything else is irrel<Col N="1455" /> evant. While cannabis and ecstasy are closely associated with the youth sub culture, experience in Dublin has shown that if left unchecked the problem has the potential to quickly spiral out of control, particularly in disadvantaged communities. It is important to note that disadvantaged areas are honed in on by pushers who pick disadvantaged individuals, people short of a few pounds, supply them with a sample or two of a drug and get them hooked. The person then becomes a pusher. Very often, if not invariably, drug pushers are drug abusers.</P>
    <P>Under age drinking is a very serious problem. Alcohol is a legal and social drug, but it has a devastating effect on many people, especially on families. Abuse pertaining to alcohol was the most common reason for admissions to psychiatric hospitals some years ago. Alcohol is seen as a gateway drug for many potential drug users. The problems associated with the abuse of alcohol have been well documented over the years and we all know the devastation it has caused to quite a number of families. The British Medical Association defined an alcoholic as a person who, having taken the first drink, cannot guarantee when he or she will stop. The World Health Organisation defines an alcoholic as a person whose drinking or behaviour as a result of drinking affects any of the three main areas of life such as family, home and work. Therefore, it does not matter how many drinks one consumes &ndash; if one drink causes a person to miss work or crash a car and kill somebody then that person has a drink problem. It is not a matter of consuming a great deal of alcohol.</P>
    <P>Drug misuse is a complex problem requiring a multi-disciplinary response across a range of agencies and professions. No one agency has a monopoly on wisdom in this area and organisations can learn much from each other in terms of identifying local needs and designing appropriate responses. We must have a multi-disciplinary approach to tackling drug abuse.</P>
    <P>I understand the common theme running through the regional consultative fora, to which I am sure the Minister will refer, is the importance of education and prevention strategies in addressing an emerging drug problem in rural areas. Regrettably there is a problem in mid-Leinster, but to date there is no evidence of heroin abuse and we must be thankful for small mercies. We need a pro-active approach in terms of educating our children and raising awareness among families and communities about the dangers of drugs and drug abuse. Education has a pivotal role in the prevention of drug abuse. Teenagers should not feel pressurised into taking drugs.</P>
    <P>It is important to say what has happened in a number of towns, including Mullingar, where local publicans have put up notices saying, &ldquo;If you deal, we'll squeal&rdquo;. Drug pushers must clearly understand that if they are caught pushing drugs they will be reported by vintners. I compli<Col N="1456" /> ment the vintners' association in Mullingar and other towns on that very positive initiative.</P>
    <P>Teenagers should be given the self-confidence and self-esteem to say no when drugs are offered to them and they should be provided with other outlets for their energies, such as leisure and sports facilities which are absolutely imperative. The impact of sport extends far beyond the playing pitches and athletic grounds. It has obvious benefits in promoting health and fitness and can play a major role in fostering a sense of community identity, even in the most deprived areas. For this reason it is very important that sport and leisure facilities are provided throughout the country as a positive outlet for teenagers, especially as they relate to preventing the spread of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Regarding the migration of drug pushers, interaction and contact between gardaí is essential. The Garda has been very successful in a number of drug seizures and it is not necessary to give examples. We cannot sit back on our laurels and say we are doing extremely well as there is still much more to be done. It is imperative that if a drug dealer moves from one area, particularly from a larger urban area, to a provincial town or village, contact is made between the gardaí in both areas so the person can be monitored. Very often drug dealers move house to spread their evil trade among local youth. Dealers always focus on deprived areas.</P>
    <P>I very much look forward to hearing the Minister, whom I know has an abiding interest in this area, and I compliment him and his predecessor, Deputy Flood, on the great work they have done. I congratulate the Garda which has done excellent work in this area and to which we should be very grateful. We should also be grateful to community groups which have fought tooth and nail to evict drug pushers from their areas, but moving them from one area to another is only transferring the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State for the debate on this most important subject. I listened with great interest to my colleagues, Senators Fitzpatrick and Glynn, and salute their experience. I have no experience of the matter, the great scourge of our time. Senator Fitzpatrick spoke about the difficulties being experienced in inner city Dublin where pushers ply their awful and frightful trade in deprived areas. There are some desperate human tragedies associated with misuse.</P>
      <P>It has been said that there is a need for education because there is a difficulty in getting through to those who are not abusers, drug pushers or takers. In this context I salute the great work being done by the local drugs task forces and by liaison groups. Such a group in my home town of Killarney, comprising local councillors, members of the community and the Garda Síochána, is doing excellent work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Multiple drugs and/or medication are taken with alcohol by those involved. It is often forgot<Col N="1457" /> ten that alcohol is a drug. Most of the anti-social behaviour in provincial towns results from the abuse of alcohol and/or drugs and those involved seem to be getting younger and younger. They graduate from alcohol which is seen as an easy social drug to ecstasy and cannabis. It is in disadvantaged areas that pushers primarily ply their trade in an effort to get people hooked and continue the chain.</P>
    <P>There is much to be said for organisations coming together to learn from each other as the problem is emerging in rural areas. I salute what Senator Glynn said about the approach being adopted by Mullingar vintners: &ldquo;If you deal, we'll squeal.&rdquo;  This is to be welcomed and I hope it will spread to other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the review which will be a useful exercise in identifying any gaps or deficiencies in the existing strategy, in devising revised strategies and the arrangments which should be put in place for their delivery. If I recall correctly, the national drugs strategy was initiated by the then Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and in 1996 there were two reports on the matter which identified 11 areas with particular drug problems in Dublin and one in the north inner city in Cork in which preventive programmes were put in place.</P>
    <P>Tackling the drugs problem is a difficult task which must be approached with determination and as a priority of youth provision as young people are confronted with more and more choices, conflicts, challenges and pressures. The problems of unemployment, homelessness, poverty and social exclusion are widespread, with their attendant problems of drug abuse and crime. The review is welcome because we must re-examine our sport and youth work structures, systems and processes and continually devise and implement new policies and initiatives to meet this change.</P>
    <P>The concept of community involvement is vital in responding to the challenges which face our young people in a society which is ever changing and increasingly complex. As in virtually all other countries, we are suffering from the increased availability and accessibility of drugs owing to reduced cost and the prevailing social attitudes which have resulted in young people becoming the most vulnerable category in terms of the threat drugs posed to communities and society in general. While the Government and State agencies must adopt a multisectoral approach to the problem, it is imperative that communities are empowered to participate in devising and implementing strategies for their localities. Many are doing so.</P>
    <P>Sport and recreation have a vital role to play in demand reduction, particularly with reference to education, prevention and community development. We must value sport and recreation as mutually beneficial and enjoyable experiences entailing active modes of experimental learning where young people are involved in learning by <Col N="1458" /> doing and reflecting on their experiences. More importantly, adequately resourced programmes permit communities to play a real role in meeting young people's needs.</P>
    <P>In response to the escalating problem of drug abuse the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation established a drugs strategy, the aim of which is to provide an effective and integrated response. As well as acting as a guiding force for future planning and policy in the war against drugs there are three essential principles, the first of which is that the response to the drugs problem must take account of the different levels of drug misuse throughout the country. While illicit drugs, cannabis and ecstasy in particular are a nationwide phenomenon, in view of its public health implications and close association with crime heroin abuse is the most pressing aspect of the problem. Consequently the national drugs strategy focuses primarily on the areas experiencing the highest levels of abuse.</P>
    <P>There is a need to ensure all programmes and services which respond to the drugs problem are delivered in a coherent and integrated manner. There is also a need to encourage communities experiencing the highest levels of drug misuse to participate in the design and delivery of the response to the problem in their areas. Arising from this the key objectives of the strategy can be described as follows: to reduce the number of people turning to drugs through comprehensive education and prevention programmes, to provide appropriate treatment and aftercare for those dependent on drugs, to have appropriate mechanisms at local and national level aimed at reducing the supply of illicit drugs and to ensure an appropriate level of accurate and timely information is available to inform the response to the problem.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well and look forward to hearing what he has to say on the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

This is my first opportunity to welcome him to the Seanad and I wish him a long and glorious career as a Minister. I am sure he will do very well and I look forward to the day when he is Minister for Foreign Affairs which, as we all know, is a plum job in any Administration.</P>

      <P>Not at all &ndash; I would not touch it with a barge pole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are meeting this evening in the aftermath of a very worrying situation regarding the recent deaths from infections which have been spread not just in Dublin but also in other cities in the United Kingdom. This indicates a really serious problem. It is quite tragic, particularly when people inject themselves and the tissue is dam<Col N="1459" /> aged. The infections seem to be like the necrotising disease where all the flesh rots. It is just appalling. It seems this raises the question of quality control. That is a real problem, because one of the reasons for so many deaths, both from infection and overdose, is that there is no stable standard for the heroin available on the streets.</P>
    <P>We will never stop people taking drugs. What I am about to say &ndash; I have said it before &ndash; will be wildly unpopular. It is that the only ultimate solution on a global basis is to legalise everything. When he was a Member of this House, Dr. O'Connell expressed the same view on the other side of the House some years ago. We must accept that people are adults, that they will sometimes make foolish choices and take decisions that will not enhance their lives and will lead to a certain amount of suffering. However, the suffering will be minimised. Most importantly, if this could eventually be done by treaty on a multinational basis, it would knock out the profit incentive. That is what is driving the whole drugs industry.</P>
    <P>There should also be education because, even if the situation to which I referred occurred, people would legally get drugs at a cheap rate and inject themselves. They would not necessarily have happy lives. We should put out a slogan which says it is not fun to be hooked on heroin. Last year I heard on the radio a well educated young man with a university degree working as an accountant. He was a drug addict. He was surviving and was able to do his job, but he had to be constantly on the needle. His life was bloody awful. He had access to pure drugs &ndash; controlled amounts &ndash; and knew the quality of them, yet he was not getting much of a kick out of it because apparently after a while all one gets when one injects is a certain stability. One is back to normal, but there is very little buzz left. It is a sad situation.</P>
    <P>The Government should look at the question of cannabis. Again, it is very difficult to control the supply and it feeds enormous sums of money into the pockets of gangsters. That is unnecessary. We should establish a commission to look into this question, to see what way we should treat this drug. I am not in favour of the nanny state. Many people if they are honest will say they smoked a couple of joints and engaged in other activities. It should not be a matter for the criminal law. We could take a look at other countries who have taken this view, such as the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>Among the people who work most marvellously in this area &ndash; I am sure the Minister of State is acquainted with them &ndash; are those in ICON, the Inner City Organisations Network. It includes people like Deputy Gregory, Seán Lamb from Sheriff Street and Mick Rafferty. They were the first people to signal that there was a lack of co-ordination in our approach to drugs. We <Col N="1460" /> needed to bring in the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda, the social security and health services, etc., because people were escaping through the net. We did not have a grasp of the problem.</P>
    <P>We need to listen to what is being said by these kinds of people. I have taken a brief from a very interesting group, the Dublin City Wide Drugs Crisis Campaign. I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with it because it made a submission to the review of the national drugs strategy. It is worth putting on the record some of the valuable things it has said in its submission. Again, it emphasises the community level. The first point the group made to me was that community representatives are clear that the putting in place of the national drugs strategy and the establishment of the local drugs task forces have been positive developments for local communities, and with this initiative by the Department, the role of the community centre has been formally recognised. That was very important for them.</P>
    <P>The group goes on to say that the involvement by communities in the task force structures has played an essential role in changing the relationship between the community and the State sectors and in strengthening the role of the community sector generally. However, it points out that the effectiveness of task forces is dependent on the degree to which there is an existing structure and level of community organisation within the community itself. Many communities do not have this kind of infrastructure because of the lack of investment in resources.</P>
    <P>The country now has plenty of money in the kitty and I would like to see the House supporting this vital young Minister of State in raiding the piggybank. I refer to the example of Noel Browne, who got his hands on the loot and wiped out TB. While the drugs problem is very sophisticated, a certain amount can be done with money, especially if it is put into the community. Money is not a solution to everything, but it plays a role.</P>
    <P>The group goes on to say that there is a need to develop a parallel programme of community development supports for local task force areas and, in this light, the addition of a member of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to the national drugs strategy task force is very important. It points out that community representatives are very clear in what they have told the group about the benefits of the network which have been facilitated through it. The group proposes that a cross task force technical assistance fund for community representatives should be established which would enable cross task force initiatives on training and information for community representatives. This is of a piece with what Deputy Gregory, Seán Lamb and others were saying some years ago about the need to have an inter-disciplinary approach.</P>
    <P>The group says that local task forces cannot <Col N="1461" /> solve the drug problem entirely, and that task force budgets are insignificant in relation to the overall budget provided to State agencies. It points out that local task force plans should clearly set out the scale and level of development needed in their areas which cannot be met through task force funding, but which is essential in order to tackle the drugs crisis in the long term. The local task forces can then apply to central funds for moneys needed.</P>
    <P>The group recommends that all Departments should be obliged to draw up a plan that indicates how they intend to support and complement the work of the local drugs task forces within each Department's overall plans and budget. It advises that structures need to be developed to facilitate involvement by the target group in the national drugs strategy. The group UISCE is developing this on a national basis parallel to the local task forces and it should be supported as a forum that can participate in the national drugs strategy in a similar way as the Dublin City Wide Drugs Crisis Campaign network. The group also points out that there is a need for participation by the target group in local task forces. Some task forces are already implementing this, for example in the north inner city area of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The families of drug users are also directly and tragically involved. Support services are needed to help them. I ask the Minister of State to speak to his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to see if a senior member of the Department will discuss this problem with the people involved. It is a disgrace and an outrage that this has not happened. I ask the House to support this because it is very important.</P>
    <P>If one call was to go out from the House tonight it should be a call on the Department of Education and Science to help the Minister of State, who is doing an excellent job, and help the people involved in the local task forces. The Department is doing nothing. The chief executive officer of the East Coast Area Health Board has met them, as has the Minister. Why will the Department of Education and Science not move? It must do so.</P>
    <P>I live in the north inner city. It is a wonderful area. It has had a real problem with drugs, but the people are wonderfully courageous. Some of the apartment blocks have been described in a negative fashion, but they are wonderful. I recently visited Ballymun. It could be a superb environment, but it is also ravaged with drugs because the people are deprived, they lack the educational facilities and they do not have the hope or infrastructure to help them. The House should put its muscle behind the Minister of State to try and address these matters and prevent the spread of the drugs problem.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate because it provides an opportunity to discuss our drugs policy, especially the comprehensive review which I have currently undertaken. The key objective of the review is to identify gaps or deficiencies in the existing strategy and to develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new arrangements through which to deliver them.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that there appears to be broad consensus on all sides of the political divide on the main thrust of our current drugs policy, which has developed largely from two excellent reports produced by the ministerial task forces on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, as well as my party's policy document, entitled A Radical Approach to Drugs and Drug Related Crime.  I take this opportunity to mention the work done by Deputy Rabbitte and my colleague, the former Minister of State, Deputy Flood, in developing this policy. Before discussing the review, I want to outline the background to the current drugs strategy and the various elements which make up our overall approach.</P>
      <P>The principle of partnership and co-operation underpins our approach to tackling the problem. The key element of our approach is to bring key agencies together in a planned and co-ordinated manner to develop a range of appropriate responses to drug misuse, not just regarding stopping the supply of drugs but also in providing treatment and rehabilitation for those who are addicted, as well as developing appropriate preventative strategies.</P>
      <P>It is also our policy to involve local people in the design and delivery of programmes to address drug misuse in their areas. We believe that an approach which allows voluntary and community groups to work with State agencies in tackling the drug problem significantly increases our chances of success.</P>
      <P>During the past few years, the Government has made a concerted effort to tackle the drug problem. The Cabinet committee on social inclusion, which is chaired by the Taoiseach, is driving a comprehensive social inclusion programme and the Government has committed over £1 billion in the national development plan to implement it. This includes over £400 million to be administered by my Department and a significant portion of this money will be aimed at tackling drug misuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point made by Senator Norris about the source of the heroin problem, it is coming almost exclusively from areas which suffered enormously from unemployment, neglect and social exclusion over a 30 year period. It is embarrassing for all of <Col N="1463" /> us that this has been allowed to develop. We are all guilty, nobody in particular is to blame. The problem exists and we must tackle it. We have an opportunity now that we have the money, as a number of Senators stated, and the money must go into these areas. The Government is committed to doing that.</P>
    <P>I want to give one important example of what is happening because this is a programme which can really unlock this, that is the integrated services process. There are four pilot schemes around the country, three of which are in Dublin, in Dublin 8, Jobstown and the north inner city. The other is in Togher in Cork. That programme is getting all the State agencies to tackle on an individual basis problems which arise for young people and other people in a locality. The four pilot schemes will finish at Christmas and then I hope we will be able to use the experience to move into other areas which have suffered from social deprivation. It really is the key.</P>
    <P>Recently I launched a report for the pilot scheme in Rialto. The excitement evident in everybody, the people from the State agencies, school teachers and the local community, was fantastic. It means that everybody gets committed completely to it every day of the week, 52 weeks a year. That is what it will take to break this, not only money but real commitment. We owe it to these communities to break the cycle of social deprivation. Not only will we do that, but at the same time we will tackle many of the problems which are leading to the terrible heroin abuse in many of these communities.</P>
    <P>To ensure the effective implementation of our drugs strategy, we have set up the national drugs strategy team, comprising personnel from all the key Departments and Government agencies. In addition, one person each from the community and voluntary sectors bring the perspective of those sectors to the team's work.</P>
    <P>The team oversees and assists the work of the local drugs task forces, which were set up in the 14 areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse. The task forces will allow the State agencies to work at local level with community and voluntary groups in initiating responses to the drug problem appropriate to the needs of each area.</P>
    <P>Through the structures I have outlined, we are delivering a comprehensive drugs strategy. On the supply side, we have legislated significantly over the past few years to increase substantially the powers of the Garda and other authorities to tackle organised crime and drug dealing. The Criminal Assets Bureau, in particular, has been extremely effective in ensuring that the drug barons are not afforded an opportunity to enjoy the wealth they have amassed from their criminal activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> However, as those working with drug users know only too well, we cannot solve the problem simply by cutting off the supply of drugs. We must also put in place a range of education and other measures to prevent young people from turning to drugs in the first instance, as well as treatment and rehabilitation options for those who are already addicted.</P>
    <P>Since the mid-1990s, we have made huge strides in providing treatment for those who are addicted to drugs. The numbers in treatment in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, where the vast majority of heroin users reside, have risen from about 1,400 in 1996 to almost 5,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>While we have not quite reached the stage where we have eliminated waiting lists, we are making significant progress towards this aim. An interesting feature of our waiting lists is that while the number of people receiving treatment is increasing rapidly, the number waiting for treatment is decreasing at a significantly slower rate. This reflects the fact that more people are presenting as our services improve, which, in itself, is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Some people might argue that there may be as many as 13,000 heroin users in Dublin and that, therefore, only one third of them are in treatment. The reality, however, is somewhat different. It must be realised that not all heroin users are ready to present for treatment at any given time. Our aim must be to make sure that when they do present, the services are there for them. The Eastern Regional Health Authority estimates that if it provides a further five or six treatment centres, it will be close to eliminating the existing waiting lists. Its drugs service plan for 2000 is geared towards this aim.</P>
    <P>Of course we are not relying totally on drug users presenting, we are actively encouraging them to do so. We have appointed outreach workers and, through the local drugs task forces, we have set up support, advice and referral centres for drug users and their families. Indeed, over 4,000 users and 3,000 families have availed of these services in the three years since the task forces were established.</P>
    <P>An important development in the drugs area has been the development of a joint programme of action between the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Prisons Service aimed at ensuring that the level of treatment available to drug misusers inside prison is consistent with that available on the outside. Obviously when drug users are committed to prison, it presents an ideal opportunity to get them thinking in terms of doing something about their addiction. This programme includes: the provision of detoxification and drug-free wings in Mountjoy; a methadone maintenance programme; facilities for special needs groups, such as those diagnosed with hepatitis or HIV; the appointment of addiction coun<Col N="1465" /> sellors; and separate, but duplicate, facilities for women prisoners who misuse drugs.</P>
    <P>In addition, my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, recently announced the setting up of a pilot drug court project in Dublin's north inner city. Drug courts, of course, have proved very successful in the United States, where they offer treatment and rehabilitation programmes for drug using offenders as an alternative to prison. A planning committee, which was set up by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has developed a pilot programme based on the US model but suitably adapted to our circumstances.</P>
    <P>The task forces have made very considerable progress in the three years since their establishment. As a result of initiatives developed through them, we have set up nearly 50 support and advice centres for drug users and their families. Over 4,000 drug users and 3,000 families have availed of these services. In addition, nearly 350 schools have participated in drug awareness programmes, with about 6,000 school children involved in these programmes. Some 350 teachers have received training and over 300 youth groups have run drug prevention initiatives. Training programmes have been delivered to 1,300 community workers, 1,200 parents and 1,300 young people outside the school setting. Over 160 resources materials such as videos, leaflets and brochures with drug awareness messages have been developed and disseminated in all the task force areas.</P>
    <P>This represents a significant achievement and I take this opportunity to put on record my thanks and appreciation to the State agencies and the voluntary and community groups which have brought this to fruition through their work on the task forces. I also congratulate Citywide, ICON and other groups around the city and country which worked so diligently and hard at the coalface to tackle this serious problem. I thank the voluntary and community representatives who have given so generously of their time and energy. I also thank the national drugs strategy team for its excellent contribution in overseeing and supporting the work of the task forces.</P>
    <P>An independent evaluation of the local drugs task forces undertaken in 1998 confirmed that they have been a huge success. The evaluation found that they had achieved a number of notable successes over a very short period, not least in the manner in which they have reduced the feelings of isolation and frustration previously felt by many of the communities in areas where the drug problem is at its worst. I am sure public representatives who work in these areas will have noticed a marked increase in the morale of community and voluntary drug workers since the setting up of the task forces. I am also pleased to see that representatives from all parties are now participating in the work of the task forces. I know that <Col N="1466" /> public representatives can enhance considerably the effectiveness of the task forces through their intimate knowledge and experience of drugs issues in their areas.</P>
    <P>Although we have achieved many successes, it is a first step and there is a long way to go. Given the remarkable success of the task forces to date, the Government has allocated a further £15 million on top of the £10 million which they received earlier to enable them to update their action plans and further develop and expand the range of drug programmes and services which they provide.</P>
    <P>While we have made tremendous strides in recent years, especially in terms of providing treatment, there is still a shortage of programmes to assist drug users to move from treatment towards rehabilitation and full reintegration into society. I have asked the local drugs task forces to place special emphasis on this issue in the updated action plans which they are preparing. Through measures developed by them in their earlier plans, almost 700 drug users are already in specially designed community employment schemes which offer them counselling, training and other necessary supports. These programmes are facilitated by FÁS, which has made up to 1,000 CE places available for such programmes.</P>
    <P>In the area of aftercare, FÁS is working closely with other agencies such as the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which is finalising its own comprehensive rehabilitation policy proposals following detailed consultation with other key players including the voluntary and community sectors. The vocational education committees and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are also examining what contribution they can make in terms of developing appropriate programmes for drug users attempting to complete their recovery.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate and opposing views on the effectiveness of methadone as a treatment measure. I believe it is an effective intervention, as evidenced by the fact that nearly 300,000 drug users throughout Europe are on this form of treatment. However, it is only effective when it is supported by a range of other services, such as counselling, rehabilitation, etc. Our key priority over the next few years will be to develop these services. An encouraging trend in this regard is the number of people on methadone who are finding employment. The recent evaluation of the ERHA's treatment services, to which I referred earlier, found that in some treatment centres almost 40% of those on methadone were now working. Arguably, the stability which methadone has brought to their lives has allowed them to seek out employment and hold down a job in much the same manner as any other person on treatment for a long-term medical condition. This proves that, provided they receive treatment and other supports necessary to their well-being, <Col N="1467" /> drug users can effect a full recovery and return to a full and normal life.</P>
    <P>However, that report also showed some negative aspects, such as that 60% of people are on benzodiazapenes. It is a problem we recognise and we hope that we will have a protocol in place in the new drugs strategy to try to stop the spread throughout the country of &ldquo;benzos&rdquo;, as they are commonly called. It is a serious problem. They are extremely damaging and many people are taking methadone and benzodiazapenes together which can cause many problems for them. That can be dealt with in the new drugs strategy.</P>
    <P>Sport and leisure can play a vital role in diverting young people away from drugs. Through the young people's facilities and services fund, we are supporting the building or refurbishment of nearly 50 youth facilities, 20 sports clubs and 20 community centres in the local drugs task force areas. In addition, almost 80 youth and outreach workers are being appointed to work with young people whoare at risk of becoming involved in drugs. A total of £35 million is being invested in projects under this programme.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that the problem of drug misuse is not confined exclusively to the local drugs task force areas. For this reason, we have provided funding under both the young people's facilities and services fund and the national development plan to address the drug problem in other parts of the country. This is essential if we are to ensure that the problems which have developed in Dublin are not allowed to spread to other parts of the country. Funding from the young people's facilities and services fund has already been allocated to Galway, Waterford, Limerick, south Cork city and Carlow.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has introduced a number of initiatives to respond to the drug problem. The Walk Tall substance misuse prevention programme was piloted in 1996-97 and was extended to primary schools in all local drugs task force areas in 1997-98. It is being extended nationwide and, at this point, has been introduced in nearly 1,200 primary schools. The On My Own Two Feet programme for post-primary schools has been introduced in approximately 570 schools, with over 1,500 teachers having undergone inservice training.</P>
    <P>In addition, recognising the direct link between educational disadvantage and social exclusion, the Department has introduced a range of other interventions, including the Breaking the Cycle initiative, which caters for 14,000 children, the allocation of additional resources to over 75,000 primary and 99,000 post-primary pupils in disadvantaged areas and the expansion of the home-school-community liaison scheme to all 316 primary and 211 post-primary schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> The more I examine this problem, the more I am of the opinion that if we want to tackle it in the long term we must tackle educational disadvantage. It is essential. I recently spoke with a person in the medical field who works in the north inner city. They told me they had been working for 12 years and that they had never met a heroin addict who had sat, never mind passed, his or her leaving certificate. Almost all had left school between 12 and 15 years of age. If that is not tackled in the long-term it will be repeated for generations to come.</P>
    <P>To date we have, of necessity, tended to focus on the drug problem as it impacts on the local drugs task force areas. This is because of the impact of the heroin problem in these areas in terms of crime and public health concerns. However, there is a need at this point for a wider examination of our overall policy, not just in the task force areas but in the country as a whole. With this in mind, I have initiated a comprehensive review of the overall national drugs strategy. As I said at the outset, the objective of the review is to identify gaps or deficiencies in the existing strategy and to develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new arrangements through which to deliver them. The review will identify the latest available data on the extent and nature of drug misuse in the country as a whole. It will also attempt to identify any emerging trends and pinpoint the areas with the greatest levels of drug misuse.</P>
    <P>To be as comprehensive as possible, it will also examine international trends, developments and best practice models. As part of the review we have invited submissions from interested individuals and groups. To date, I am pleased to say that over 120 submissions have been received. This indicates the extent of public concern and the high level of awareness of drugs issues. In addition, as part of the review process we are undertaking a series of public consultation sessions at eight different locations around the country. The fora provide a unique opportunity for all those working in this area to have an input in to how the strategy should be adapted to reflect the current reality of the drug problem and how the strategy should be shaped for the future. Our aim must be to ensure that the response to the drug problem remains relevant to the situation as it exists at present.</P>
    <P>To date, we have held five sessions and the remaining three fora are scheduled for Athlone tomorrow, Sligo on Friday next and Dublin on Monday, 26 June. I invite Members to the remaining sessions to express any views they may have on what is a complex issue. Some of the issues which have arisen are early school leaving, lack of rehabilitation and counselling, lack of information about services &ndash; there is a breakdown in communications &ndash; and as others have mentioned, under age drinking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> To assist us in the review, my Department has engaged a team of independent consultants who are attending each of the fora. It is the Government's intention to have the review concluded by the autumn and a new strategy in place by the end of this year at the latest. Combating the drug problem is a key priority of the Government. All of us are aware of the havoc which drug misuse can cause to the individual, his or her family and neighbourhood. All Departments, State agencies and the voluntary and community sectors have key roles to play in this area. Collectively we must build on the progress to date and increase our efforts and commitment to control this great social ill which affects many of our communities.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the contributions of Members during the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, to the House. I think it is his first time here in his ministerial capacity. I hope he has a good period in Government as Minister of State, particularly in this important portfolio.</P>
      <P>We have been slow in dealing with the drugs problem in a comprehensive fashion. Two decades have passed since the heroin epidemic hit this city. It is only in the past four or five years that serious attempts have been made to respond to it. In that period there have been tragic, horrific deaths of young people, virtually all in their teens or twenties. The death of Veronica Guerin in 1996 was largely responsible for the sudden response from the authorities. Up to that time it was almost impossible to get any response from them with regard to the epidemic. Communities have been ravaged over that period. The statutory organisations have been grossly negligent in fulfilling their duties. The people I would first lay blame with is the medical profession. It denied the Hippocratic oath and would not treat drug addicts while they treated other members of their family. Prison doctors refused to provide a service appropriate to the needs of addicts. They refused to provide methadone as an alternative to drugs and delayed the introduction of a decent system of treatment and rehabilitation. It is only in recent years that Mountjoy, which has the largest number of addicts, has had any response to the problems there. It was like pulling teeth to get any scheme in place to deal with the problem. Thankfully, at last something is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time the Eastern Regional Health Authority is playing a role in the prisons. It should have been playing a role 20 years ago. It is only now beginning to realise it has a responsibility for what is happening in our prisons. The situation has been extremely bad and the Garda did not colour itself in glory in its response once these problems were in disadvantaged communities. I was delighted to hear all the Minister of State said and to recognise that substantial progress has been made over the past few years. His <Col N="1470" /> predecessor, Deputy Chris Flood, made an enormous contribution, as did Deputy Rabbitte. It was a sea change after the death of Veronica Guerin and a focus on where a solution might be found on a comprehensive basis. This came about by combining the statutory organisations with the voluntary organisations and the community. It was also based on the local partnerships and the establishment of a local task force. This is the right approach. There is all-party acceptance of and agreement with this approach. It compares with Northern Ireland in that there is no disagreement in terms of the process.</P>
    <P>The situation is still not good. The funeral took place in Seán McDermott Street this morning of a young man who had taken an overdose. A needle was found in his arm. He had gone to the local clinic for treatment where he was put on the methadone bus. His parents believe he did not get sufficient methadone and had to turn to heroin. Their view is that the system let their son down. He wanted to be part of the system which offered him a course of treatment and to be dealt with properly. Whatever the rights or wrongs of that situation, the funeral which took place this morning was another tragedy. We do not know the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>Members might have seen an article in today's <i>Evening Herald</i> by Paddy O'Gorman in which he disputes the numbers of people presenting for drug treatment in the Dublin area. The estimated figure is 13,000, but he said it is closer to 5,000 &ndash; he did not say how close. If we are dealing with an official figure of 5,000 and there is an estimated figure of 13,000, the vast majority of people are not presenting for treatment. How can the problem be tackled when we do not know the extent of it? Is it a fact that most heroin addicts are outside the system? Does the Minister or the statutory agencies know? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When a point is reached where there is no waiting list we have some idea. It is the first step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, in many circumstances I wonder if people will present for treatment as many of them are not interested in undergoing a treatment programme. Many are addicts and will remain so for whatever period, whether that ends in a tragic death or they beat the habit themselves or with the help of their families. There is a drug culture and it does not mean people will find it necessary to present themselves for treatment. That is the nature of drugs &ndash; it is an addiction, it is not a treatment. In most cases there is no treatment at the end of the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say more but I do not have time in the minute remaining to me. The supply side is still a major problem. The drug barons are outside the jurisdiction and it seems as though there is a wider network of gangsters getting involved <Col N="1471" /> in the supply of heroin to this country. A decision must be made &ndash; it will be a difficult one &ndash; on the difference between soft and hard drugs and whether soft drugs are the gateway to hard drugs. We do not know what is the stepping stone, if there is a stepping stone, to heroin. Heroin is a killer and in many instances the gardaí treat heroin and cannabis as though they were equal. Approximately 80% of the seizures by the gardaí are soft drugs such as cannabis, and these statistics are used in terms of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that the areas of education and disadvantage are tackled. We have come a long way in the past few years. The Minister of State has the right approach and I look forward to progress being made under his aegis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for listening to Senators' concerns on an issue which is of major concern to the people of this city and the country as a whole. The general consensus is that the drug problem presents itself in two distinctive forms. Heroin is used in the greater Dublin area and bigger cities. The use of cannabis and ecstasy is now a nationwide phenomenon. Heroin abuse is a much more pressing aspect of the drug problem because it brings with it public health implications and has a serious association with crime. We know that those using heroin encounter serious problems financing their addiction because it is an expensive habit.</P>
      <P>Most speakers have commended the Government for the great efforts it has made in the area over the last three years. The setting up of the 14 local task forces, 12 of which are centred in the greater Dublin area, has been of tremendous benefit and value. Their brief was to target a co-ordinated response to the drugs problem incorporating the relevant statutory agencies and local communities. Local communities are essential to solving this problem as they have their finger on the pulse, they know where the problems exist and who is creating them. Communities have been afforded the opportunity to participate in resolving this problem and that has resulted in a much more cohesive response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task forces have had significant successes since their inception in 1997. Organisations involved now believe that for the first time ever there is a real structure in place. There is a great deal to be done and no one denies that. The Minister of State is more aware of it than anybody else. There has been a significant increase in the range of programmes available to drug users and potential drug users. It was very encouraging to hear what the Minister of State had to say recently about the number of people receiving methadone treatment. He said tonight that the establishment of five or six further centres is being considered. That would, as he suggests, <Col N="1472" /> reduce waiting lists significantly and may eliminate them entirely.</P>
    <P>I welcome his proposals regarding a pilot drug court system which will, in some respects, prevent people going through the rigours of court and jail. I hope this will prove to be a decent alternative to going through the prison system. The demand for heroin in city areas is primarily a reflection of the basic underlying patterns of disadvantage and social exclusion which characterises those areas. It is reasonably easy to pick out an area in a city where one would envisage that a drug problem exists. Poor people living in these areas have limited educational aspirations, they have no real desire to educate themselves, they lack employment prospects and nine times out of ten they get caught up in the drugs disease.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said recently that 40% of those on methadone programmes are working. That is a major breakthrough and is very rewarding to those tackling this problem. He also indicated to me recently that 70% of methadone users no longer take heroin. That, too, is a very rewarding and encouraging statistic. We must emphasise that the vast majority of families who live in these poor areas affected by drugs are doing their very best to educate their children and to seek a better future for them. They take great pride in their communities. While we support those who have fallen foul of the system we should also give as much support as we can to those families who are doing their best in difficult circumstances. We need to focus our attention on those people. If they lose heart or give up hope we will have another spiral of this dreadful disease. It is necessary for us to respond in a most aggressive and positive way.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that 350 schools had undergone a drug awareness programme. That is the way forward. He suggested in his speech that education is one of the keys to tackling this issue. It is most encouraging to learn that 6,000 children have been associated with the drug awareness programme. Teachers, youth groups and parents are playing their part in bringing about a solution. There is a clear need to invest in educational provisions adequate to meet the needs of areas through a targeted local education strategy. The Education (Welfare) Bill, when fully enacted will, hopefully, supply sufficient education officers in these areas to improve matters.</P>
    <P>Overall, the national drug strategy has been very effective in creating a new impetus of response to the local drug problems. It has provided a framework for greater co-operation and a more integrated planning of the services required in the future. A strong case has been established in a number of areas for the development of new local plans.</P>
    <P>The Minister alluded to many great proposals which are in the pipeline. I am confident that he, having taken up this task from Deputy Flood who <Col N="1473" /> did a tremendous job, has the commitment and ambition to bring about a very positive solution. Having worked with him in Dublin Corporation for ten or 11 years I am fully aware of his commitment in this regard. I heard him speak on this issue long before he became Minister of State. I have the utmost confidence that he will bring about very positive solution to this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>A phrase which occurs quite frequently in top psychology self-help books is that nice guys finish last. In this case at least one nice guy finished first. Deputy Eoin Ryan's promotion to Minister of State was universally welcomed and, in particular, was welcomed by Members of this House where he served with distinction.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has been handed a very difficult task. I do not think anybody expects him to solve the drug problem but we do expect him to put a severe dent in it. He has undertaken a very large programme and will, I hope, make a profound difference.</P>
      <P>There are two approaches to the drug problem as I see it. The first is to cut off supply &ndash; if one does not have drugs one cannot use them. That may be the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Anyone who sells hard drugs should receive a mandatory ten year jail sentence and any major drug supplier should get life imprisonment without remission or leave to appeal. Those who sell heroin are handing loaded guns to people, usually in deprived areas. They are giving them guns to point at themselves. They may miss the first couple of times but, as sure as God made little green apples, they will kill themselves eventually. It is a very serious offence. We cannot look on it too lightly. The other approach is to educate people, and that is the one adopted by the Minister of State. The reason the Minister of State and I do not use heroin is not that we cannot get it or might not like to chance it. It is that we are aware of the dangers of these drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our attitude to drug use is lighthearted in some ways &ndash; I refer particularly to alcohol. I know a fair amount about this because I work in a hospital. I have said before that the age of alcoholics is decreasing. Just 20 years ago it was in the mid-60s, but nowadays people as young as 16 or 17 are alcoholics and can never again take a drink. That is because of the abuse of alcohol. I know the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has made some recommendations in this regard recently and I hope those are taken on board. I was particularly impressed by a speech the Minister of State made to the National Drugs Strategy Review Group of the North-Western Regional Consultative Forum this month in Galway. He outlined some of the issues he referred to tonight, such as the local drugs task forces in Dublin and Cork and how many families have been helped. He also stressed the importance of <Col N="1474" /> education in combating drug misuse, saying that almost 350 schools have undergone drug awareness programmes, with approximately 6,000 school children participating, while 350 teachers have received training in this area. Over 300 youth groups have run drug prevention initiatives, while training programmes have also been delivered to 1,300 community workers, 1,200 parents and 1,300 young people outside the school setting.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker said the Minister of State might look at legalising marijuana, though I do not want to misquote him. Marijuana is not a harmless drug. I have seen many people who have been abusing marijuana over a number of years and their lifestyle leaves a lot to be desired. They have lost their get up and go and are apathetic. Some countries which have legalised marijuana have found this to be the case.</P>
    <P>In the past few days we have seen that football hooligans in Holland were smoking dope in cafés and did not kill themselves. That is the good side.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>The bad side is that one keeps on smoking dope and gets into trouble. People should have no illusions. We cannot adopt the same attitude towards smoking dope that we have adopted towards alcoholism, as it is now accepted that young people drink an enormous amount. Our young people drink more than young people anywhere else in Europe and that cannot be tolerated.</P>
      <P>The work the Minister of State has done so far in promoting involvement among young people in their local areas is a key element in dealing with this. Any response must take account of the different levels of drug misuse which are experienced around the country. Heroin abuse is rampant in some areas and, as previous speakers have said, the use of heroin is one of the causes of crime. It is not something that is given out free, though sometimes people are given some for free to hook them and get them into an awful lifestyle where they must steal and so on. The effect on the rest of society is enormous. Heroin abuse has profound implications not just for public health but for society as a whole. Burglaries and other crimes are committed by those who are hooked on heroin and who need money to feed their habits and it is rightly the primary focus of the national drugs strategy. If we are to reduce the numbers using drugs it will have to be done with a comprehensive education and prevention programme, which the Minister of State is undertaking. We must also provide appropriate treatment and rehabilitation for those dependent on drugs &ndash; the Minister of State is also addressing these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be appropriate mechanisms at national and local level to reduce the supply. That <Col N="1475" /> is a matter for another Department, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is looking at that all the time. We must also ensure that an appropriate level of accurate and timely education is available to inform the response to the problem. I wish the Minister of State well in this enormous task. If he makes any dent in it, Irish society will reward and thank him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak on this matter, but it would be remiss of me as a person involved with young people on a daily basis as a teacher and adult education organiser not to say that I realise the terrible problems that confront young people.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to organisations which help those caught up in drug abuse. A few years ago an organisation arrived in my parish of Turloughmore and was viewed with some scepticism. We wondered what would happen and what kind of people would use that organisation. Now we realise the magnificent work being done by the Cuan Mhuire organisation. Sister Consilio Fitzgerald has made an enormous contribution to programmes fighting drug and substance abuse. I have not been given the opportunity to pay tribute to her here before, but I pay a glowing tribute to her and her organisation. The organisation is also based in Bruree in Limerick and in Kildare as well as having a facility a mile from my house. Sister Consilio has received little support over the years and has relied mainly on Christmas singers, raffles and sports, but I pay tribute to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, who has come to her assistance and provided quite an amount of grant aid to enable her to enhance her facilities.</P>
      <P>It is important to continue to support people like Sister Consilio and Cuan Mhuire. We can do so much to prevent drug abuse, but we must also have rehabilitation services. We must also help those working in the No Name Clubs who try to create meaningful and worthwhile activities for young people without alcohol, drugs and smoking. Those clubs are run by volunteers with little help from us. I pay tribute to those involved in the various training workshops run by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. These cater for young people who are brought in to be rehabilitated and who can be given work experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tremendous work is being done and I commend the Minister of State and the task force on that work, but I appeal for more support and aid to be given to voluntary bodies such as the No Name Clubs, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform training centres and particularly those like Sister Consilio who have carried on a great crusade over the years. They have contributed greatly to helping many people and their <Col N="1476" /> families all over Ireland. I pay tribute to her, as she is in the mould of Mother Teresa of Calcutta. She has made an enormous contribution and I appeal to the Minister of State to consider providing more support for rehabilitation and support programmes. I wish the Minister of State well in future. He has the support of every organisation and party in Ireland in tackling this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well with his new brief. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Deputy Flood who also made a considerable input into this strategy on how best we can reduce the numbers taking drugs. The motion refers to the new Minister of State. We can take a fresh look at the problem, look at the strategies in place, identify any gaps in the strategy and see how best we can fill those gaps. The objective or the bottom line is to reduce the number of people taking drugs. The question is how best that can be done. What mechanism can we put in place to get the best result? How do we cut off the supply? That is a hard and complicated task and I wish the Minister of State well in that regard.</P>
      <P>The local task forces, which were set up throughout the country, are a start. This task force will reflect the views of all the interested bodies, including the health boards, the Garda Síochána, FÁS, the Probation and Welfare Service, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the youth service, the community sector, the voluntary sector and the elected representatives. One or two people from each of these areas will come together, pool their knowledge and come up with a strategy on how to curtail the drug problem in the area in which the task force is working. It is a tall order. We must have people who are knowledgeable, who have the expertise, who are familiar with the problem in their area and who have access to the Minister of State or whoever else in order to put in place a programme to curtail the drug problem in a particular area. I recognise that this is very difficult in some cases.</P>
      <P>Senators have referred to social inclusion. I congratulate the Government which has allocated a colossal sum of money, £1 billion, in the national development plan to alleviate the problem of social exclusion. Having said that, we are concentrating on areas of disadvantage but we may not be on the ball in other areas, such as middle class areas where there are young people, where the family structure has changed, where both parents are at work, where there are lone parents and where children have time on their hands between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. They are vulnerable during this period when they are hanging around open spaces. It is known that the drug problem is creeping into these areas. I say that to ensure we do not concentrate solely on the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the educational programmes which have been put in place. The Minister of State and <Col N="1477" /> the Government are to be congratulated because they started with the Breaking the Cycle scheme. They introduced the Walk Tall programme in primary schools and the On My Two Feet programme in second level schools and have put in place home-school links and community initiatives. I hope the parents are getting involved in devising a co-ordinated effort.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see greater involvement by FÁS which may have a significant role to play. Now that we nearly have full employment, we should be developing second chance education programmes for those people who are on drug programmes and initiatives.</P>
    <P>Much work is being done. I know, as a teacher and from listening to people, teachers and other colleagues, that the number taking drugs has reduced which is welcome. We must not take our eye off the ball. The drug problem will spread to the middle class areas. We need a co-ordinated effort to make sure that all the bodies about which the Minister of State spoke in regard to the local drugs task forces will be aware of how best we can tap into the educational programmes and to teachers. Teachers are the first to detect a drug problem in the school, particularly where there is local authority housing neglect, environmental problems and family issues which will drive young people out of their homes and will leave them vulnerable. These young people will always be vulnerable and the drugs suppliers will be watching them.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well. I have no doubt he is going about this in the right way. We have the money and the Government has made a huge commitment. This requires the full co-operation of the key bodies. If we get them working we will succeed and will drive the drug suppliers out of this country and into oblivion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I have only a few comments to add to the very sensible speeches which have been made by other Senators. I wrote to the Minister of State on the issue of trying to make communities realise that to have a drug treatment programme and facility in their area is not a threat but a method of dealing with the problem. The Minister of State and I, coming from the same part of the city, realise that when the Baggot Street programme was properly organised, there was a huge improvement. When we had one or two facilities around the city trying to deal with all the drug addicts who wished to get on programmes it was appalling. Once we managed to organise the situation, it was a great help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to see the circular the Minister of State sent to those of us who had written to him saying he was having meetings in various parts of the city, but he may have to become even more localised than that. If everyone coped with the drug addicts they had within their area, it would not only be better for the drug addicts, it would be better for the areas themselves. I realise the terrible limitations of methadone pro<Col N="1478" /> grammes. It is really only putting people into a halfway house where we try to get them off addictive drugs. For the community in the area and, even more so, for their unfortunate families, it makes a huge difference. It is the Minister of State's problem to try to organise it but if I can do anything to help him in the various areas in which he has met resistance, I will.</P>
    <P>It is pathetic that we have a waiting list for people to get on programmes which are essentially to get people on to a legal drug, methadone-physeptone, and off illegal drugs. A major problem is the lack of recognition by people all over the country, not only in this city, that we have a serious drug problem, that every area will have to cope with it and that it cannot be farmed out elsewhere. The Minister of State will remember the way Baggot Street used to be as well as I do. It is not like that anymore, it is now organised. It made a huge difference when that happened.</P>
    <P>We should be very grateful &ndash; I hope Senator Fitzpatrick will understand that this is important too &ndash; to those general practitioners, the family doctors, who have become involved in treating people in their practices in their catchment areas. I ask their other patients not to be quite so belligerent about it because it is very important. General practitioners know the family scene and the local and community scenes. If they are prepared to take on people with this serious addiction as patients, we should be eternally grateful to them and try to be supportive of what they are doing.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State if he could provide more resources to assist families who have a family member who is a drug addict because their lives are hell, no matter which part of society they come from. Half their goods are stolen and sold, credit is run up in their name and they spend their time trying to pay bills. Their situation is a nightmare. Goods which are stolen and replaced are stolen again. We need to be as supportive as possible of these families.</P>
    <P>We also need to provide more support for people who come off treatment programmes for heroin or methadone, which is, after all, an addictive drug. These are two particularly difficult drugs to treat. A person may be clean and leave a programme but the more support we can provide the better. I would support any measure the Minister of State can take in this regard.</P>
    <P>Some people get on to hard drugs in prison. However, unfortunately many of those who get off drugs in prison find little support when they are released. Objections are raised over the location of hostels and even drop-in centres where people can go to try to get the moral support which would help them to maintain themselves. No sooner do these people come out the gates of Mountjoy Prison than someone is waiting to meet them to get them back on drugs. Senator Fitzpatrick is nodding.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention one group which does not concern the Minister of State but I would ask him to raise the matter with the Minister for Health <Col N="1479" /> and Children, Deputy Martin. There is a problem with drug addiction in the medical profession, generally involving prescribed drugs. Unfortunately the Medical Practitioners Act only allows people to come before the fitness to practise committee when they are in an appalling state. This involves their being struck off. For some years the Medical Council has urged the Minister to modify the Act so we can deal with people suffering from alcohol or drug addiction at an earlier stage. It is dreadful that people have to reach the stage where they are struck off following an appearance before the fitness to practise committee. The Minister promised to address this issue but matters can be put on the long finger because there is much pressing legislation. On hearing a Bill was to be introduced before Christmas I often wish I had asked, &ldquo;Which Christmas?&ldquo;</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State ask for a sense of urgency in changing the regulations as this is a serious issue? Unfortunately some of those who become involved in drug addiction, including some in the nursing profession, get involved with addicts. The Minister of State is nodding and he knows this only too well. Along with the other efforts he is making, some of his Cabinet colleagues also need to take steps. I suggest that the first day the House resumes in October, the Minister for Health and Children introduces such a measure in the House. I am sure the Chief Whip would be delighted to have the Medical Practitioners Act in the House. Let us make a promise that the Minister of State will press the Minister on this matter and I will keep after Senator Tom Fitzgerald and we will amend the Medical Practitioners Act. This is a serious issue. The matter would not be contentious as we would all agree. However, a change might make quite a difference where there is an abuse of prescribed drugs and that is particularly important.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House. He will bring energy and commitment to the drugs problem. He has come up through the ranks of Dublin Corporation from an inner city constituency so he knows the problem, what he is talking about and what needs to be done.</P>
      <P>Drug addicts have poor self-esteem and low educational attainments. None of those on the register has completed the leaving certificate and they see themselves excluded from mainstream life. The Minister of State has two instruments with which to deal with this problem &ndash; the local drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services funds. As they say as Gaeilge, these are fite fuaite trína chéile &ndash; they are the two legs which support the whole edifice of dealing with drug addiction.</P>

    <P>One Senator mentioned that Dr. Noel Browne came into pots of money in the late forties which he used to deal with the scourge of TB. I do not wish to take from Dr. Browne, but he had one instrument available to him which no Minister <Col N="1480" /> has today, namely the carrot and the stick. One could be inveigled or brought for treatment for TB. If one refused to go for treatment, the area medical officer had the stick of sending one to hospital. We may have to consider such an approach so that those who refuse to go for treatment, and who are a danger to themselves and others, may be forced to go for treatment. However, I doubt whether one can force an addict to undergo treatment.</P>

      <P>Baineann an scéal atá agam anocht le múinteoir atá ag múineadh i scoil Dhún Chaoin ó 1970. Cé go bhfuil Dún Chaoin i gceartlár na Gaeltachta, dúnadh an scoil an bhliain sin mar go raibh sé mar pholasaí ag an Roinn ag an am nach mbeadh scoileanna beaga acu tríd an tír. Chuir tuismitheoirí na háite go mór i gcoinne dúnadh na scoile. There was a public outcry in the early 1970s when the school in Dunquin in west Kerry was closed down by the Department in pursuance of its policy of closing small rural schools. The school was of great importance. The children of Peig and the families of many famous writers attended it. Many groups of scholars came to the school to learn about the Irish language. In our era, Dunquin and the surrounding area was considered as a foinse na Gaeilge. Is deacair cuimhneamh ar aon áit eile sa tír go mbeadh an méid sin Gaeilge agus cultúr na tíre sáite ann.</P>
      <P>Without a shadow of doubt, it represented a microcosm of Irish society, fiú féin i measc Gaeltachtaí na tíre. There are very few places in Ireland like Dunquin. It is the place where the remaining families who left the Blasket Islands in 1953 settled, in this small, barren outcrop of the Dingle peninsula. Irish was the language of the community and the school. When I was a teenager I spent several weeks each summer in Dunquin, even though it was not far from where I was reared. I have a great interest in the area.</P>
      <P>Dúnadh an scoil mar go raibh sé mar pholasaí an uair sin scoileanna beaga tuaithe a dhúnadh. An rud ba thábhachtaí a bhí ag baint leis seo nó gurbh é seo an áit deireanach go raibh muintir na mBlascaod agus a gclainn ag freastail ar scoil. Peig is buried about half a mile from the school. Some of the best known Irish scholars learned there. It was a place, above all others, where the language and the culture of the Gaeltachtaí needed to be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an outcry when the school was closed. A cursory glance at the newspapers of the <Col N="1481" /> time reflects this. In the Minister of State's constituency, it would have been paralleled by the row about the Baltinglass post office many years earlier. It was a local row which became a national issue. The whole country and every Irish language enthusiast and fanatic, those of us who cared, were concerned about it. There was a great deal of support for the school. The Government of the day refused to go back on its policy and it closed the school. It was the death-knell of the community.</P>
    <P>The community and its supporters around the country decided they would try to keep the school open with their own resources. A trained and qualified teacher from Kildare moved down from Dublin. His name is Micheál Ó Dubhshláine and he worked in the school for two or three years. The dates are not very important, but he worked there from the beginning of the school year in 1970 until April 1973 when there was a change of Government. The new Government decided to grant the school recognition. It advertised for a teacher, Micheál Ó Dubhshláine was appointed to the job and he has taught there since.</P>
    <P>I visited the school on at least three occasions. It is a wonderful school, looking out over the Blasket Sound at the most westerly point of Europe. It is a monument to our culture and a place where what remains of cultúr na Gaeltachta is safe in its natural environment. Tá Gaeilge ón gcliabhán ag leanaí na háite a rugadh san áit. Tá siad tógtha trí Ghaeilge, ag dul ar scoil agus ag foghlaim trí Ghaeilge. Tá siad á múineadh trí Ghaeilge agus déanann siad gach rud trí Ghaeilge i gceartlár na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>We must show our commitment to this cause. This man has reached retirement age and it seems extraordinarily petty for the State to deprive him of pension entitlements for the two years he was working in the school but paid by the local community rather than the State. It seems the State has already saved three years' salary. The least it could do to make amends is to recognise the period of diligent service given with no support. The teacher should get full pension recognition.</P>
    <P>I ask that this case be dealt with separately, as it was dealt with all along. No other schools were opened in 1973 when the Government changed. It should be dealt with in that context. It is a tiny cost to the State of slightly over two eightieths of a teacher's salary. It is not a great deal of money and it is recognition that must be given. I appeal to the Minister of State to respond positively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to address Senator O'Toole's query regarding superannuation entitlements for the person in question in respect of the period 1970-73. The Teachers Superannuation Act, 1928, and the Teachers Superannuation (Amendment) Act, 1990, govern the superannuation of national school teachers. These are enabling Acts under which superannuation regulations are made. The superannuation provisions are of general appli<Col N="1482" /> cation and departures in individual cases are not permissible.</P>
      <P>The background to this matter is that from 1 August 1970 Scoil Dhún Chaoin, a one teacher school with an actual and projected decline in pupil numbers, was closed in line with policy at the time. The Department of Education withdrew funding from Scoil Dhún Chaoin and the teacher in service there took up employment in Scoil an Fhirtéaraigh. Following the withdrawal of the Department funding, it is understood that parents in the area privately employed the person in question from 1970 to 1973 as a teacher for their children. It is also understood that the person in question had moved from his pensionable employment as a secondary teacher in Dublin to take up this private teaching position in Dún Chaoin.</P>
      <P>From April 1973 Scoil Dhún Chaoin was again given official recognition by the Department, the person in question was appointed to a pensionable teaching post in the school and his salary was paid by the Department of Education. During the period from September 1970 until April 1973 this teacher was employed and paid under a private arrangement and not by the Department. Service under a private arrangement does not come within the scope of the superannuation provisions for national teachers. Therefore, the service given during this period cannot be considered for pension purposes.</P>
      <P>Service could only be pensionable at that time if it were given in a temporary or permanent capacity by a suitably qualified person, in a school recognised by the Department of Education and Science where the teachers were in receipt of salary from the Department. The person in question has additional service in the secondary sector, which was pensionable under the superannuation provisions for secondary teachers. This service has been transferred to the primary sector and will be included in the calculation of his superannuation benefits at retirement.</P>
      <P>To assist teachers who have broken service and who would otherwise not have the maximum service at retirement, the Department of Education and Science operates a notional service purchase scheme, whereby a teacher can purchase service at full actuarial cost. This scheme enables a teacher to purchase extra years to enhance the superannuation benefits, both pension and lump sum, payable at retirement. The original notional purchase scheme operated from 1983 to September 1991 and allowed a serving teacher to purchase service to age 60. A revised scheme was introduced in October 1991, which is still in operation. This gives teachers a choice to purchase to age 60 or 65 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned is currently purchasing, to age 60, additional pensionable service through the original notional service scheme. Should the person concerned remain teaching without any breaks in service and continue his purchase contract, he will in the month he reaches 60 years of age have a total of 40 years. This is the maximum required <Col N="1483" /> for calculating his pension and lump sum entitlements. If the person decides to retire any time before his sixtieth birthday, the service purchased will be actuarially reduced.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole put the case for this person very seriously and passionately. I will raise the matter, in the way he raised it with me, directly with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the generous conclusion to his otherwise very bleak statement. I want to make two further points.</P>
      <P>First, the Minister of State said in his statement &ldquo;to assist teachers who have broken service . . . &rdquo;. This man did not break service. He has been teaching continuously and constantly and has never broken service. That is the reason for my appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, and more to the point, this is an indi<Col N="1484" /> vidual case that can be dealt with individually under the superannuation Act because it gives the Minister powers to do so. The Government is about to introduce legislation to give pension rights to a particular individual because he has gone beyond the age&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am making the point that if we can introduce legislation to look after Mr. Justice Flood, to which I think he is entitled, we should do the same for another individual who has also done the State some service, in a way which protects and progresses our culture, language and heritage. Mr. Ó Dubhshláine deserves our support on this. I am glad about the Minister of State's positive support and I look forward to getting a result on this.</P>
