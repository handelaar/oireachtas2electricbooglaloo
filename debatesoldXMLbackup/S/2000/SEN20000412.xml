    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 19, motion 18. No. 1, motion re referral of a proposal for a Council decision creating a European refugee fund to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, will be taken without debate. No. 2, motion re referral of the agreement between the Governments of Ireland and the Republic of Hungary to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, will be taken without debate. No. 3, Committee Stage of the Equal Status Bill, 1999, will be taken today. No. 19, motion 18, will be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather there are about 84 Committee Stage amendments to the Equal Status Bill, 1999. Clearly, these will not all be dealt with in a satisfactory way today. Perhaps the Leader will undertake to review progress at about 5.45 p.m. Since the same Bill is ordered for tomorrow, Committee Stage could continue then if needs be.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader assure the House that all Stages of any Bills introduced next week will not be processed and that the usual end of term device will not be availed of by certain Departments to introduce a Bill, declaring it the most important in the world, and asking that all Stages be taken on the same day? Will he assure us that we will have adequate time to debate any legislation which may appear next week?</P>
      <P>I gather it is the intention of this Government to review the laws on libel and defamation and that a review is taking place. Will the Leader indicate, either tomorrow or on Friday, what progress has been made and whether the Government has any proposals? Perhaps he might initiate a debate in the House on the matter because there are issues which need to be addressed and all sides need to talk to each other rather than at each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I raised with the Leader the fact that we face a budget surplus of <Col N="1634" /> between £1 billion and £2 billion. He gave an undertaking to come back to me but I have not heard anything. Because of our great regard for the Department of Finance and its total lack of policy on spending, it should get some indication from public representatives on how that money might be invested in the future. It is a serious point in that there is no culture or tradition in the Department of Finance of a spending or investment strategy. It would be very helpful if that could be done. I recognise that the Private Members' motion tonight will deal with some part of that but I would like to see an overall plan. We have already costed the national development plan but this is additional money. We should have a plan on how it will be used and hear Government policy on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The two motions before us are important &ndash; one relates to the European refugee fund and the other to an agreement between this Government and the Government of Hungary on drug trafficking, money laundering and organised crime. It is a shame that they should go to committee without some discussion in the House. Will the Leader indicate that when they leave the joint committee there will be an opportunity for both motions to be discussed in the House? They are matters of considerable relevance concerning far-reaching issues.</P>
      <P>We are not happy that Committee Stage of the Equal Status Bill, 1999, is being taken today and Report Stage tomorrow. This legislation is of considerable importance and a large number of amendments has been tabled. The Bill took 12 months to get through the other House and it will be dealt with in two weeks in this House. I do not believe that is a proper way for us to deal with legislation of this substance. I agree with what Senator Manning said about a review at 5.45 p.m. but we should go a step further. I would prefer if the Leader indicated that we would not pass Committee Stage today, that we would finish it tomorrow rather than going on to Report Stage and that we could deal with Report Stage next week.</P>
      <P>A demonstration took place outside the House yesterday by the Jubilee 2000 group concerning debt cancellation for developing countries. The House debated this important matter last week and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, has been up front and proactive on the issue. However, can we do something more substantial such as twinning Ireland with a developing country like Mozambique? This year's Exchequer surplus will be close to Mozambique's national debt. We could also twin with a country such as East Timor to provide a link in terms of resources, education and so. This might provide a way forward on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate those involved in the making of last night's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on private rented accommodation which painted an horrific picture. Does the Government propose legislation regarding rent control and regulation of the <Col N="1635" /> private rented sector which is completely unregulated? A tenant can be evicted at the whim of a landlord and conditions in much of this sector are dire. Is legislation contemplated to give security of tenure and fair rent?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards No. 2, international agreements do not require the agreement of Seanad Éireann and, therefore, are not discussed in the format of a motion in this House. However, the Leader may be able to allow such a discussion in a different format.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate early in the next session on the issue of lobbying? We pride ourselves on developing a more open and accountable culture and I hope that is the case. However, there is significant evidence to prove what many of us have suspected for a long time, namely that there are pockets of power which are not accountable to anyone. This is not consistent with the principles of a republic as I understand them. We must debate whether there is a need for a register of lobbyists and whether lobbying, which has become an industry, needs to be regulated. This issue could be debated with much benefit to all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask about the manner in which legislation is dealt with between this House and the Dáil. I refer in particular to the Local Government Bill and the Planning and Development Bill. This House dealt with the planning Bill for some weeks but when it went to the Dáil the Minister started adding to it. Those additions, such as the right of the National Roads Authority to raise funds and to apply tolls to roads it intends <Col N="1636" /> to construct, and the right of local authorities to apply tolls to secondary roads, are extremely important and should have been discussed in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad has no control over the manner in which the other House does its business. Any amendments which are made to that or any other Bill in the Dáil will come back to this House in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments should have been dealt with in this House. That is what should happen with the Local Government Bill which Leader says we will take in this House in two weeks' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a brief discussion on Tibet? I had tabled a motion on the Order Paper on the subject but it has been removed. I want to substitute another such motion because the sub-committee on human rights of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs unanimously passed a resolution on Tibet. It would be useful to examine it and perhaps pass it unanimously in this House. An hour or 30 minutes would suffice.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning raised the issue of reform of the libel laws. I absolutely agree, we must be very careful. We do not want to go down the road Britain has taken and we must, despite the intensive lobbying by newspaper interests, preserve a decent balance so the individual, in taking on these corporations with huge resources, is not placed at a further disadvantage. I remind newspapers that if they tell the truth, they have nothing to worry about. Why should they be permitted to print lies about decent people? If they do, they should be soaked as hard as possible.</P>

      <P>In recent weeks there have been repeated calls for a debate on the retention of the groceries order. We are concerned that the Minister has said nothing. There is a motion on the Order Paper&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The public and the grocers do not understand her position. She has not made a decision and is prevaricating. We would like the motion on the Order Paper in the names of the Fine Gael Senators to be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Costello in his call for aid for Mozambique and, particularly, Ethiopia. In 1984 we said this spectacle would never happen again. Everyone was shocked at the pictures which emerged at the time and now there is another dis<Col N="1637" /> aster. I implore the Minister and the Government to give further aid to alleviate the present suffering in Ethiopia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to have allowed the issue of Sellafield to go off the boil. If that happens, it will favour the continuance of the <i>status quo. </i>There is an environmental conference taking place in June and I ask the Leader to remind the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and the rest of the Cabinet team who will attend, to make a sustained effort to ensure the issue is kept under observation and that the British are kept aware of our feelings. The issue should not be allowed to simmer away quietly.</P>
      <P>I congratulate <i>The Examiner</i> on becoming the <i>Irish Examiner.</i> I ask the Leader to use this opportunity to suggest to the editor that coverage of the Seanad in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> would make it a national paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will show its relevance and I appreciate the Chair's patience. I will not labour the point because Members of the House are aware of the dastardly comments made about the MacGillycuddy Reeks and Killarney &ndash; cheap shots made by people trying to promote a small and relatively unknown guidebook.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Taoiseach on what he said last Friday when he visited Killarney in the company of the captains of Irish industry. He said that for more than 25 years he has been visiting Kerry and Killarney and it was always a great sadness to him when he looked in his rear view mirror and saw Killarney disappearing. That says it all regarding people who said something else about seeing it in a rear view mirror. I thank those who made kind and appropriate remarks in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls by several Members to invite a representative of the National Roads Authority to come into the Seanad. I also support calls by Members for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the Seanad and to indicate that he will provide extra <Col N="1638" /> funding from the Exchequer for our national secondary roads, the most neglected routes throughout the country. Each county has a large number of such routes and very little funding has been allocated to them. It is a matter of urgency that a representative of the National Roads Authority or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government should come to the House to explain why more funding cannot be made available for our national secondary roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to bring to the attention of the relevant Minister an issue about which I am concerned, the high cost of motor insurance, particularly for young drivers. A large number of people who have come home having spent a few years working abroad find it impossible to get car insurance. Young motorists are being charged very high motor insurance premia and some controls must be put in place.</P>

      <P>With regard to the request by Senators Manning and Costello, we can review progress on the Equal Status Bill, 1999, at 5.45 p.m. I hope we will be able to deal with all Stages between today and tomorrow, but we can review progress at 5.45 p.m. With regard to legislation for next week, I hope to brief the Whips in the morning or later this evening regarding three Bills, one of which is the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. Legislation must be taken before statements or debates. I accept Senator Manning's point &ndash; he is a former Leader of the House and he speaks with the experience of having to work within the confines of requests by Government.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning and Norris requested a debate in the House on the libel laws. I can facilitate the House by allowing time for such a debate. This matter is of immense importance and there is a great deal of interest in it. We used to have a newspaper that printed the truth in the news. That is what Senator Norris was talking about.</P>

      <P>Regarding the call for a debate on the private rented sector, I can allow time for such a debate. In recent years amendments were made to existing legislation to ensure all rented accommodation is registered, but many local authorities have fallen down in this regard.</P>
      <P>I will take on board Senator Quill's views to see how they can be progressed. I wish to inform Senator Coogan that the Planning and Development Bill is going through the Dáil. Amendments are being tabled to the Bill after which it will be back in the Seanad. This indicates that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, having been the secretary of LAMA and a member of a local authority, is very flexible and at the end of the day it is about getting things right. I welcome this and I know Senator Coogan has vast experience&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Norris asked for short statements on Tibet for which I will make time available. I will pass on Senator Jackman's views to the Minister regarding the groceries order on which we made our views known in this House last week. I will allow time to discuss Sellafield further, as requested by Senator Quinn. The House is in agreement that Sellafield may be a danger to the health of Irish people and I have no difficulty making time available for a debate on the matter. Senators Quinn and Coughlan send good wishes to the <i>Irish Examiner</i> and I will pass on their views during the Committee on Procedure and Privileges meeting this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I inform Senator Coghlan that the Intoxicating Liquor Bill will be in the Seanad all next week when Members can take part in a lengthy debate. I understand Members have been influenced by the debate in the other House on various matters and these issues will be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1640" /> Senator Burke called for an extra allocation of money for national secondary roads. As the Senator may be aware, an extra allocation has already been made this year.

      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 8, after &ldquo;<i>3(1)</i>&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or <i>4(1)</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, to the House and look forward to a constructive debate on Committee Stage when I hope we will have an opportunity to explore the Bill to its full extent. While it took a little over 12 months to go through the Dáil, it may not take as long in this House. I hope there will be adequate time in which to explore the important issues in a Bill which has taken up a considerable amount of legislative time in the 1990s, having been introduced by us when in Government in the mid-1990s.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment. It remedies an omission identified in the definitions sections in relation to the definition of &ldquo;discriminate&rdquo;. Surely this is one of the elements at the heart of the legislation. The definition excludes discrimination against those with a disability. That is a serious omission and I hope the Minister will take it on board.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 19, before &ldquo;carer&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or other&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and hope that in the time available for Committee Stage, today and tomorrow, and Report Stage we will give the Bill a thorough examination. This amendment seeks before &ldquo;carer&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or other&rdquo;. The final part of paragraph (b) reads:</P>
      <P>and, for the purposes of <i>paragraph (b),</i> a primary carer is a resident primary carer in relation to a person with a disability if the primary carer resides with the person with the disability;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason we should confine the carer to such a category. It can easily discriminate against a certain category of person with a disability. So far as the payment of the carer's allowance is concerned we now have a non-residency clause attached to it, which was a matter of much controversy for many years. One does not have to be resident in the home to be the primary carer of an old-age pensioner or a person with a disability. That is the reason I ask the Minister to <Col N="1642" /> accept the amendment. The final part of paragraph (b) would then read:</P>
    <P>and, for the purposes of <i>paragraph (b), </i>a primary carer is a resident primary carer in relation to a person with a disability if the primary or other carer resides with the person with the disability;</P>

      <P>Apart from the inclusion of pregnancy, which for reasons arising under EU case law is treated as gender discrimination in the Employment Equality Act, the definition of &ldquo;family status&rdquo; in this Bill is identical to that in the Employment Equality Act. The proposed change would create an unjustified divergence between the definition in this Bill and in the Employment Equality Act. If the primary carer did not have to be resident then more than one person could be deemed to be the primary carer of the same person.</P>
      <P>It is difficult even to think how discrimination could arise in this area but it is important to keep the definitions similar in the Employment Equality Act and in this Bill. It is difficult to think of one practical example where discrimination could occur on the equal status side. We are retaining it because it is in employment legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity there is no better reason than that. The definition of &ldquo;carer&rdquo; should be broadened out to include &ldquo;other carer&rdquo;, meaning some other person who may be outside the house. Why should it have to be a family member? We have the narrow definition of family member as laid down in the EU interpretation and in the court interpretation also which the Minister has mentioned. Why can we not approach this in the spirit in which we approached the carer's allowance when we broadened its scope? A primary carer living outside the home can now qualify for carer's allowance. Furthermore, I do not see why only one person can be a primary carer.</P>

      <P>During the debate on Second Stage, other Members and I made the point that it is unclear whether services provided by the State come within the scope of the Bill. This amendment merely places the reference to statutory provisions within the definition of &ldquo;service&rdquo; so there is no uncertainty. The Minister dealt at great length with the points made by myself and by Labour and Independent Senators on Second Stage but we were not satisfied with the Minister's response and we are not satisfied that a satisfactory amendment has been made to the Bill on Committee Stage in the Dáil. This amendment reiterates the points made on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 is very similar to Senator Connor's amendment. It seeks to have public services specifically mentioned in the Bill. This is not a new idea and since the Bill is nearing the end of its progress through the Houses, it is necessary to underline the importance of this issue. My colleagues and I are not the only ones to be concerned. I note that a similar amendment was tabled to the 1997 Bill by the Minister of State's party colleagues, Deputy McDaid and Deputy Flood, and supported by the then Deputy Keogh. It is clear that this issue has been explored and promoted across party lines by experienced Members of this and the other House. I ask the Minister to take cognisance of that fact.</P>
      <P>This amendment has been regarded as necessary by a considerable body of political opinion in both Houses and clearly meets the concerns of many people who want to see public services specifically mentioned in the legislation. I hope the Minister will accept the view of Labour Party Senators and the wider view of others on this matter. If it was considered necessary to make this amendment to the 1997 Bill, why is it not considered necessary now?</P>

      <P>Whether one is in Government or Opposition it is important to seek expert advice from the relevant departmental officials. I have consulted my officials and the Attorney General on this matter. There is no doubt that equal status legislation applies to the State. &ldquo;Service&rdquo; is defined in section 2 as a service or facility of any nature which is available to the public generally or a section of the public. This applies to public services as well as those provided by the private sector. The application of the Bill to public services is reinforced by the wording of section 5(1) which provides that it is irrelevant whether the services are provided for consideration or otherwise. The reference to the State in section 14<i>(a)</i>(iii) also underlines this point. It is clear <Col N="1644" /> therefore that the Bill applies to services provided by the State.</P>
      <P>In its judgment in 1993 in Howard<i> v.</i> The Commissioners of Public Works<i></i>the Supreme Court stated that it was not necessary to state in legislation that the State was bound thereby. I am advised that, by implication, the Bill applies to the State and that it is unnecessary to include an express provision in this regard. Neither of the proposed amendments would appear to achieve express application to the State because the words &ldquo;statutory services&rdquo; and &ldquo;statutory provision&rdquo; would narrow substantially what is understood by the State.</P>
      <P>In Ireland the doctrine of Crown prerogative whereby the State is not bound by any statute which does not include it expressly or by implication did not survive the enactment of the Constitution in 1937. The uncertainty which surrounded this issue was finally laid to rest in the landmark Supreme Court judgment, Howard<i> v.</i> The Commissioners of Public Works, 1993, ILRM 665, in which it was held that the State was bound by the planning Acts and was accordingly obliged to apply for planning permission before building an interpretative centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was spokesperson on the Office of Public Works in the other House when amending legislation had to be introduced, but it would do the Bill no harm to state expressly in every section where it needs to be stated that it applies to services provided by the State. It would remove all uncertainty and put the matter beyond yea or nay. In the case of the interpretative centre in Mullaghmore the State was of the view that it did not have to observe the law so far as planning permission was concerned. The Supreme Court decided otherwise &ndash; that the State is amenable to the law in the same way as every citizen. In keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court's decision the Minister of State should ensure it is expressly stated that the Bill applies to the State. This would do the Bill no harm and would put the matter beyond yea or nay.</P>

      <P>There are a number of amendments along this line. This is the first of what I would term the &ldquo;golfing&rdquo; amendments.

      <P>This amendment and others attempt to meet the concerns raised by the Irish Ladies' Golf Union, of which everybody is aware.

We are introducing legislation which will ensure women who have not been allowed become full members of golf clubs, tennis clubs or other sporting organisations will no longer be discriminated against.

Perhaps the Acting Chairman, the Minister of State or Senator O'Meara can tell me about the history of discrimination against women in golf clubs. I cannot understand such behaviour.

      <P>Senators are trying to ensure golf clubs take into account the past associate membership of women rather than treating them as if they were joining for the first time. This is not, however, what the proposed amendment achieves nor would it be my intention to legislate against discrimination which existed in the past. The Bill does not have retrospective effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) is that discrimination which occurs after the commencement of the Act but which is based on a ground which existed in the past, regardless of when, will be covered by the Bill. As associate membership is not a discriminatory ground, the Senators' <Col N="1647" /> amendment does not achieve its intended purpose.</P>
    <P>We cannot legislate to cover the position of women who have been associate members of golf clubs. Whether charging such persons full fees would constitute discrimination would depend on the circumstances of the case. I am aware that many women golfers consider it unjust that their historical association with a club could be discounted when membership fees, rules etc. are determined. I am advised that while the Bill can permit the making of concessions to women who were denied full membership, it would strain the concept of discrimination to include a provision on the lines proposed by the Senators. I have given careful consideration to the representations made by women golfers and I am proposing amendments to section 9 to meet those concerns. I cannot accept the amendment but we can look at the matter when we come to deal with section 9.</P>

There is a great deal of anxiety and grievance that an anti-discrimination Bill is in effect causing them an injustice. The Minister of State is right in saying that what the golf clubs are proposing is not discriminatory. It may not be discriminatory but it is unjust. I know we will deal with section 9 later but I do not know whether the Minister of State is telling me it is possible to achieve what I want here or that she is not able to achieve it in the context of this section.</P>

    <P>My amendment affects section 3 which refers to discrimination in a general way and describes what it is. I merely ask that in all subsections of section 3 where there is a reference to &ldquo;person&rdquo; or &ldquo;persons&rdquo; the word &ldquo;group&rdquo; would be added. That would give greater certainty to the application of this section and to the definition of discrimination. Several groups may suffer discrimination and their rights should be clearly <Col N="1648" /> recognised in this Bill &ndash; for example, a group of refugees, a group of migrants and a group of travellers. I want the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; or &ldquo;persons&rdquo; to be followed by the term &ldquo;group&rdquo; in the various subsections.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister of State's response to my amendment will be and I do not know how it would diminish the Bill. I believe it will enhance the Bill's provisions.

I ask the Minister of State to give us the rationale behind the dropping of the reference. I am convinced that leaving out the term &ldquo;group&rdquo; waters down this important legislation which will act very strongly, if properly used, to tackle and eliminate discrimination in our society.</P>

      <P>This legislation has been on the agenda for almost six years. There are nine grounds of discrimination spelt out in this Bill. I do not disagree with the tenets of Senator Connor's motion. The matter was originally referred to the Supreme Court in a parallel piece of legislation under the Employment Equality Act, 1977. The Act was withdrawn because of the Supreme Court's decision. As a consequence the Minister of State, her staff and advisers are constrained by the Supreme Court decision. This Bill should have been on the Statute Book long ago. It would be dangerous to debate areas of discrimination, broaden or introduce new definitions of it now because it might prolong the debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is important to note &ndash; the Minister of State might correct me if I am wrong &ndash; that the Bill has an inbuilt review system whereby this matter can be examined in two years' time and other aspects taken on board. Advice has been taken on this issue. The last Government dealt with it, it was sent to the Supreme Court and now it is back here again. There are nine areas of discrimination spelt out in the legislation. I am not saying the list is exhaustive and there is no room for improvement, but the Minister of State is acting with the best advice available to her. This legislation has been in the pipeline for five years, which is too long.</P>

      <P>The points made by Senator O'Donovan about the Supreme Court are relevant in that it is half of the problem. We have two problems with these amendments. It is correct that the 1997 Bill covered discrimination against organisations as well as individuals. However, when the 1997 Bill was referred to the Supreme Court opposing counsel criticised the <Col N="1649" /> drafting of section 3(1) of that Bill as meaningless, a criticism which was upheld in our subsequent legal advice.</P>
      <P>It does not make sense to apply the discriminatory grounds, such as &ldquo;that one is male and the other is female&rdquo;, etc., to organisations. Not only does the inclusion of organisations present a serious drafting problem, but it is also arguable that such a provision might be as protective of an all-male or racially exclusive organisation as it would be of an organisation representing travellers or racial minorities. There are two reasons, therefore, that the Bill does not apply to discriminations against organisations but to discriminations against individuals. I cannot accept the amendments which attempt to reinstate organisations into the definition of discrimination.</P>
      <P>Under the 1999 Bill it will still be possible for an individual who encounters discrimination as a member of an organisation, such as a member of a Traveller organisation, to bring a claim of discrimination on an individual basis. Aside from the Supreme Court having difficulties with it, there is also the difficulty that we could be protecting a racially exclusive organisation or an all-male organisation, which is not what we are trying to do. The Senators are trying to ensure I am protected by the legislation if I am discriminated against because I am a member of a Traveller organisation, but I am protected because I can bring a claim as an individual.</P>

Is there something in the judgment which makes it impossible to include the term &ldquo;group&rdquo; here? Travellers or people in the gay and lesbian community may be discriminated against as a group. Can they as a group take action under this legislation? The only appropriate way to seek redress may be as a group.</P>

      <P>The difficulty for the Minister of State and her officials and advisers is that the referral of the 1997 Bill to the Supreme Court and its subsequent decision rocked the system because it was not anticipated. As a result, the Minister and the Minister of State went to considerable trouble to ensure that all angles were covered in order that the same thing would not happen with this Bill. I have no doubt the Minister of State took advice on this Bill which meant everything had to be examined in great detail. <Col N="1650" /> After almost five years of debate by different Governments and advice from different Attorneys General, it is time to move on. I understand what Senator Connor is trying to achieve but unless the Minister of State agrees to change it, we may have a problem.</P>

It must be an individual case because we have been discriminated against as an individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>That waters down the Bill. The Government has taken a narrow and cautious view of Supreme Court judgments in amending this and other legislation and has gone further than it needed to go. I would like to explore the consequences of the Supreme Court judgment because it does not affect this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has answered my question that a group cannot take a case under this legislation. I can think of few groups more appropriate to mention in the area of discrimination than Travellers. Travellers are not necessarily discriminated against as individuals but as members of the Traveller community. This legislation prevents Travellers from taking a case as a group. The Bill is considerably watered down by the exclusion of this paragraph which was included in the earlier Bill. My good advice &ndash; the Minister of State knows where I get it &ndash; is that this paragraph should be included because the Bill is considerably weaker without it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Meara. The reference to &ldquo;person&rdquo; is clear and is repeated in every subsection. As we stated, there are many cases where discrimination is against a group of people. The only appropriate way it can be dealt with is if that group has a form of redress in law. However, the Bill is against that principle. It is a lame excuse to say that opposing counsel in the Supreme Court hearing of the 1997 Bill criticised it, although I do not blame the Minister of State because I am sure she is taking the advice available to her. Opposing counsel has the privilege to say whatever it likes. If the judges in their final judgment made a reference to the fact it was clearly unconstitutional, we would have to take <Col N="1651" /> account of that. To take account of something an opposing or a defending counsel stated at the outset of a hearing of any case is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am subject to correction but my understanding is that it would be unusual for an association or a group to initiate legal proceedings. A limited company is a legal entity and a person or a number of people can take a case. I have yet to see a Traveller association take a case. There is a group in Munster which is not happy with the milk quota regulations brought in by the Minister. I heard yesterday that it has decided that three members of the group will bring a test case rather than the association. I am not sure if High Court or Supreme Court rules provide for a group to initiate such an action.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the problem if a person or a number of persons in a group or an association can take a case. The Minister had to take cognisance of the Supreme Court decision and that section was referred to. Not only did the opposing counsel refer to it but when it was referred back to the Government's legal advisers, it was found that the points of law made by the counsel in the Supreme Court &ndash; they were on the opposite side &ndash; were correct.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Senator O'Meara is correct in saying the Minister and the Government are being a little cautious but under the circumstances and having regard to the fact it has been trawled through by the highest court in the land, caution is important. The Minister is constrained because of the Supreme Court referral, and that section was specifically referred to. It is not a question of the Minister being overcautious because she has good reason to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind if Senators say we are over the top in regard to caution because we have to be. This Bill has already foundered before the Supreme Court and has been found unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of that, we do not want to find ourselves in the same position in which the last Government found itself this time three years ago with another unconstitutional Bill. There are many important parts to the Equal Status Bill which we must put on the Statute Book, albeit three years after it was first attempted. We cannot take even the slightest risk here, so caution is the heaven under which we operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Senator Connor's point, it needs to be said that the judgment did not cover the detail of the Equal Status Bill. As he will recall, it covered the detail of the Employment Equality Bill, although they were twin Bills and there were similarities between the two. We do not really have the benefit of a detailed judgment on the Equal Status Bill and, therefore, we must look at issues such as <Col N="1652" /> those which the opposing counsel might have made. If our advice had said it was irrelevant, that would have been fine. However, our advisers have said it is a relevant point and needs to be looked at. It is essential to look at those cases.</P>
    <P>In regard to what Senator O'Donovan said, I am on a committee which is talking about taking out an injunction. The solicitor's advice at the meeting last night was that it would not be taken out in the name of the committee but in the name of an individual, the chairman of the committee or whoever. It will be taken out in the name of the chairman, Mr. Pat Smith, or whatever his real name is, and not in the name of the residents' association. Associations do not necessarily take cases.</P>
    <P>If we take the case about which the Senator is concerned &ndash; a problem in Pavee Point &ndash; will individuals or that organisation take the case? The result will be the same. If I, or the Senator, as a member of Pavee Point, am discriminated against, the result will be the same. It does not matter how many people take a case, the result will be the same. The key factor is that we cannot take any risks with this legislation. We could debate this issue all day but we will not take risks with this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Minister made about organisations as opposed to groups is not the point I made, as she knows. We are familiar with situations where a named person takes a case on behalf of a residents' group, Pavee Point or another organisation. That is different to what I am talking about. I am talking about a group in the community. If an individual goes to court to get relief, I understand &ndash; although I am not a lawyer &ndash; that only the individual who goes to court gets relief and not the unnamed hundreds who do not. I seek to explore a situation where hundreds of people can take an action as a group because they are being discriminated against as a group.</P>
      <P>The Minister made my point on the cautious approach being taken by the Government. It is being far too cautious. We had a long debate on the Employment Equality Act, particularly as it affected disabled people in the workforce, and on the Supreme Court judgment. Lawyers could argue the toss on the matter all day but it is my opinion &ndash; the Minister confirmed it in her remarks &ndash; that the Government is being far too cautious in regard to the Supreme Court judgments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court found certain issues and the way the Legislature dealt with them incorrect under the Constitution, and the Government must deal with that. However, that does not necessarily mean the Government must take the view that everything must be placed under the stethoscope as a result. The Employment Equality Bill was sent to the Supreme Court and it found certain sections unconstitutional. That is what we must deal with. We had considerable discussions on that when the amended version was <Col N="1653" /> before the House. The Minister is being far too cautious and, as a result, is undermining the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate what I, and Senator O'Meara, said in that the Government is being far too cautious. Going back to the Supreme Court judgment on the other Bill, the decision given was not even remotely related&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to what we are discussing.</P>
      <P>I refer to the point made about Pavee Point, a Traveller welfare group &ndash; perhaps it describes itself as something different &ndash; which puts forward the welfare and the point of view of the Traveller community in this city. It is easy to envisage discrimination against that organisation as a group. Does it have redress under this Bill to go to court for relief, as it has been described, if it felt it was being discriminated against as an organisation representing the interests of Travellers?</P>
      <P>First, there was a caution which proceeded from the opinion of counsel in the Supreme Court hearing, which I did not think was very relevant. Now we have the caution advised by the Attorney General. The current Attorney General has been a cautious and, indeed, an incautious man at times. I was a colleague of his in the other House and I am not satisfied that he always gives the best advice &ndash; I do not want him to take that personally. If, God forbid, I got involved with the courts, I would not altogether want him to defend me in love or in war.</P>

      <P>I say to Senator O'Meara that if Pavee Point was refused permission to book a room in a local hotel and wanted to take a case, it could. The secretary of Pavee Point who rang up to book the room can take the case as an individual. In essence, it has the same result. We must bear in mind we are talking&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they could take the case. It is covered by the Bill. The cases we are talking about are being referred to the Director of Equality Investigations. The 100 members of Pavee Point can write to the director and claim that they have been discriminated against as an organisation. It is not a case of going to court or legal fees but of asking the Director of Equality Investigations to look at the case. We can review <Col N="1654" /> these issues in the two year review. In the meantime, the priority is not to be here in June with another Bill which has not been added to the Statute Book.</P>

      <P>These amendments have been referred to as the &ldquo;golfing&rdquo; amendments and are designed to cover a situation where a minority group can comply with a condition under the legislation but only suffer a detriment.

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept these amendments. The definition of indirect discrimination is equivalent to that in the 1997 Bill and follows generally accepted international norms for defining indirect discrimination. The amendments would, when considered in conjunction with section 3(1)(<i>c</i>)(iii), introduce considerable uncertainly into the definition. If a person cannot comply with a condition then it is possible to establish whether a particular category or person suffers disproportionately from the requirement. If, however, as the amendment proposes, the degree of compliance with the requirement is taken into account, it becomes extraordinarily difficult to determine whether the requirement has a disproportionately adverse effect on a particular category.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments seek to add strength and clarity to the Bill. Subsection 3(1)(<i>c</i>)(iv) concerns the obligations to comply with the conditions. We wish to insert the word &ldquo;objectively&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;justified&rdquo; and to replace &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; with &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. We have discussed this issue but there are insufficient objective criteria in the descriptions in the Bill. These reasonable amend<Col N="1655" /> ments would add clarity and I do not know what arguments the Minister of State can make against them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The test is similar to the wording of section 31(1)(<i>d</i>) of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which deals with indirect discrimination on grounds other than gender. It is also unchanged from the Equal Status Bill, 1997. I do not consider it appropriate to amend this provision as proposed by the amendments as it would create an unnecessary departure from the provisions of section 31 of the Employment Equality Act. Furthermore, it will be a matter for the Director of Equality Investigations to decide whether the conditions in question have discriminatory effects which cannot be justified as being reasonable in all circumstances. It is not a matter for subjective judgment and, therefore, it is not necessary to say that the justification is objective.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection 2(<i>h</i>), line 38, after &ldquo;origins&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or they are of a different linguistic group&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important group of amendments, some of which have become more relevant and important since the publication of the Bill. The amendments apply to the section of the Bill concerning discrimination which is critical for the interpretation of the Bill in terms of defining when discrimination has taken place.</P>
      <P>Section 3(2) defines the grounds for discrimination between any two persons. The grounds are comprehensive and include gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community.</P>
      <P>These amendments seek to add grounds of membership of a different linguistic group, trade union membership, welfare, refugee, asylum seeker and political affiliation. By any objective analysis these amendments would add to the effectiveness of the legislation. The Minister of State is obviously losing patience in terms of how long it is taking to get this legislation onto the Statute Book considering the views of the Supreme Court and so on. However, this legislation will be of considerable importance, particularly to those being discriminated against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of Members of both Houses and the Minister of State is that we will have a powerful, effective and comprehensive Bill. The section is comprehensive but it is not complete as it omits grounds which we know to be used to discrimi<Col N="1656" /> nate against certain people. I can give no better example than the position of asylum seekers and refugees.</P>
    <P>The grounds of membership of a different linguistic groups, trade union membership and welfare are also important but, perhaps, less common in the current climate. However, even if the incidences are few and do not come to public attention as much as other grounds, that is not a good reason to omit them from the Bill.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the ground of trade union membership was requested by ICTU and is very important as is the ground of membership of a different linguistic group as suggested by the Refugee Agency. However, this issue does not necessarily have to refer to a racial context. For example, it is possible for Irish speakers to be discriminated against. The ground of trade union membership was pursued by the Progressive Democrats in the 1997 Bill. The inclusion of the refugee and asylum seekers grounds have been requested by the Refugee Agency. These are important matters which I hope the Minister will consider and include.</P>
    <P>In recent months the asylum seeker issue has arisen in an extremely worrying fashion. We are faced with a situation we could not have previously envisaged which must be dealt with by legislation and by other means. Certainly the situation could not have been envisaged when the Bill was drafted. Times and circumstances have changed and the Minister must bear that in mind. The Bill must contain the refugee and asylum seeker grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to strengthen the application of this Bill and its meaning by adding other categories to the nine areas clearly identified in the Bill. Those in different linguistic groups, members of trade unions and welfare recipients can easily be discriminated against.</P>
      <P>If a person has refugee status, he is entitled to the full protection of the State and to welfare. It is important that we specify that in the legislation because the issue of asylum seekers and refugees is so important.</P>
      <P>On Monday I will chair a meeting of the Sub-committee on Migration of the Council of Europe in Paris. Before the representatives of 41 countries, I will call on various NGOs and experts to report on the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees, particularly in relation to their reception at airports and their expulsion from the country which they have sought to enter. My fear is that I will have to hang my head in shame when the report on this State is made. These people will make objective reports, they are representatives of NGOs with no axe to grind, or they are experts who have researched their work, and I do not know what I will hear. I am not hopeful that I will hear good things about my country. That will put me in an embarrassing situation as chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we identify political affiliation as a possible ground for discrimination. We <Col N="1657" /> are a mature democracy but it is not long ago that a member of the Communist Party in this State would have suffered discrimination. I am an active opponent of communism but if that is a person's belief, it is fine with me. It is right and proper that a person is able to pursue his beliefs in a democratic manner and that the law protects his legitimate political activity.</P>
    <P>The Minister will tell me that the nine areas included here were previously identified in the 1997 Bill, but there is nothing wrong with making it more comprehensive. We do not want to delay the Bill's progress &ndash; it should have been on the Statute Book long ago &ndash; but we want to make it better. We will not revisit this for many years.</P>

      <P>That is a review. There should be provision for a statutory five year review irrespective of what happens in two years.

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators O'Meara and Connor are attempting to add a number of new areas of discrimination. There are nine grounds of discrimination in the Bill. The 1997 Bill included the same nine areas.</P>
      <P>I understand Senator O'Meara's point about asylum seekers and refugees but it puzzles me that we talk about discrimination when millions of pounds are being spent on them, they have free legal aid and the right to appeal and they are put up in very good accommodation. There are 60 of them living within a few miles of me and I have given them a lift on occasion to try to understand their mindset.</P>
      <P>In Bantry there are 220 people on the housing list. Tomorrow houses will be allocated to people who have been on that list for eight or nine years. There are 22 houses being allocated, thus leaving 200 people dissatisfied. Two weeks ago at my advice clinic, a young single mother of a five year old girl came to see me. She has been on the list for six years but most of the houses which will be given out have three or four bedrooms so this woman, who works part-time to raise her child, is very unlikely to be accommodated. In the nearby three star hotel, however, these people are getting first class accommodation. That made me think. That woman feels discriminated against because the asylum seekers are getting first class treatment and accommodation while she lives in a crappy old mobile home. There must be some restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three Attorneys General have given advice on the Bill and the Minister has gone to extreme trouble to ensure that any challenge to the Supreme Court will not succeed. This Bill must be passed sooner rather than later but if we start <Col N="1658" /> to introduce new grounds its passage will be delayed and the likelihood of a successful challenge to the Supreme Court will be increased. There is provision in the Bill for a review every two years. If, in two years' time, we feel that other grounds should be added, that would be the appropriate time to do it.</P>
    <P>I listened to what Senators Connor and O'Meara said, but if we go down the road of including more discriminatory grounds, we will be here this time next year debating further legislation and those whom we represent in terms of these discriminatory grounds will not thank us for prolonging the debate. If the Minister of State is exercising caution in some area, she is entitled to do so. We have been rapped on the knuckles over this before and, therefore, we must move cautiously. A measure provides for the review of this legislation in two years' time and that is a short period in political life to re-examine this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Ms M. Wallace Ms M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the issue of refugees and asylum seekers, the Bill provides for discrimination on race grounds, which includes colour, nationality or ethnic or national origin. Since the Bill applies to everyone in the State, irrespective of his or her status, it will be possible for a person who is an asylum seeker or a refugee to bring a complaint of discrimination on any of the nine discriminatory grounds. If an asylum seeker or refugee considers that he or she has been treated less favourably in the provision of goods and services because of his or her race, colour, nationality or ethnic origin, it is open to him or her to take a case of racial discrimination under this Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill will afford real protection to refugees and asylum seekers who experience such discrimination. Under section 3 of the Refugee Act, refugees are entitled to the same rights as an Irish citizen to employment, education, health services, social services, etc. The State makes all its services available to refugees and Irish citizens on the same basis.</P>
      <P>As Senator O'Donovan said, the nine discriminatory grounds listed in the Bill are in line with those in the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and much work needs to be done to eliminate discrimination in our society on those nine existing grounds. Senator O'Meara said the Minister is losing patience; it is not only the Minister but the people represented in terms of the nine discriminatory grounds who are also losing patience because this legislation has not been passed after all this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Meara also referred to amendments tabled by the Progressive Democrats and other parties to this legislation in the past. I remind her this legislation was originally introduced by the then Fianna Fáil-Labour Government in 1993 and that Government devised these nine grounds of discrimination. The then Labour Minister stuck with those nine grounds and the Fianna Fail Minister will also stick with them on the basis, as explained by Senator O'Donovan, that we have <Col N="1659" /> come a long way towards getting this legislation on to the Statute Book and we want to continue with it on behalf of all those, including many Irish people with disabilities and others who have been discriminated on other grounds, who are anxiously awaiting its enactment.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Connor's point, I stress that paragraph (4) of section 2 provides that a review of the measures will take place within two years after the provisions of the Act are brought into operation to assess whether there is a need to add to the nine specified discriminatory grounds at that stage. A similar provision applies to the Employment Equality Act.</P>
    <P>Given the complexity and the broad scope of the Bill, additional discriminatory grounds cannot be added on the grounds that it is important to ensure that the people referred to are also not discriminated against. If a change is made to section 3, the implications such a change has for the rest of the Bill must be assessed, including the fact that there may be possible exemptions depending on the discriminatory ground proposed. Such additional discriminatory grounds could be considered in the context of a review by which time we will have substantial experience of the operation of the legislation. It is fair and reasonable to proceed on the basis of the nine discriminatory grounds listed. We have talked about them for six or seven years. The people represented in terms of those nine discriminatory grounds are anxiously awaiting the enactment of this legislation and we will consider what further grounds may be added when the Bill is reviewed in two years' time.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her comments. At the very minimum, she should accept the inclusion of the discriminatory ground of being a refugee or an asylum seeker. I make a final appeal to her on the basis that if there is an act of discrimination or almost a campaign of discrimination against any sector here, it is against refugees and asylum seekers. One leading evening newspaper here has consistently run headlines appealing to albeit a minority gallery who are anti-refugee and anti-aslyum seeker. The Government could not send a better message to that minority who hold that sentiment but which has great potential to grow than to include the discriminatory ground of being a refugee or an asylum seeker. We know from the experience of other mature democracies that xenophobia and racism can become popular. It is always up to a Government to lead on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is one of the dark sides of human nature that at times where there is a high level of migration or people are on the move and there is an influx of refugees that anti-asylum seeker and anti-migrant sentiments are easily whipped up in the tabloid media or in the so-called popular media. They are playing for a corner of the market which believes in what they are reporting, but that is not <Col N="1660" /> giving a lead. It is up to the Government to give a lead. I appeal to the Minister of State to give a lead here on the basis of the background to this issue. She and the Minister are also aware of it. References to accommodating refugees or asylum seekers in disused barracks or in flotels offshore with facilities that are far below a basic standard do not inform this debate the way it should be informed in a civilised country.</P>
    <P>This country, above all countries, should reach out legislatively and in terms of our national expression to those people who want to come to our shores because we sent many an unfortunate person from these shores. They were economic refugees. For the first 75 or more years since this country gained independence it could not provide a livelihood for a quarter and sometimes a third of the sons and daughters it produced. In the 1980s we could not get an accurate figure of the number emigrating; it was probably far in excess of 150,000. Those young people, many of whom were well trained and educated, had to leave this country for economic reasons. We did not call them refugees, but if people from Kosovo, Bosnia or Nigeria came here for the same reason we would call them refugees. Many of our emigrants went to the United States of America. They followed the traditional emigration trail of their ancestors.</P>
    <P>At a time when this country is experiencing such a level of economic growth and is a popular destination in terms of economic opportunities, we should accommodate people who cannot find an opportunity to advance economically and often socially in their own countries.</P>

      <P>I reiterate everything Senator Connor said. I also appeal for leadership from the Government on the matter of refugees and asylum seekers. We have got very little, if any, leadership on this matter from the Government. This is a worrying phenomenon because in the absence of such leadership and tolerance the ground is left open for the generation of fear into what undoubtedly will become, if it has not already, racial hatred. The example Senator O'Donovan gave is one that could be replicated around the country. It is up to us as public representatives in answer to that woman's question to say that we as a nation, a member of the European Community and a member of the wider world community, have a responsibility to house refugees, to treat them with humanity and to investigate their claims for refugee status or asylum seeker status and to ensure due care and attention are paid to their rights as human beings and individuals. If we allow them to be treated less favourably than our own citizens, we are asking for racial hatred, and we will get it. As Senator Connor said, we can use this legislation to give a lead on how we treat refugees and asylum seekers. Such a lead is absent at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the Traveller community specifically mentioned in this section? This is because of the <Col N="1661" /> treatment Travellers have received in the wider community through the years and we now accept the need to include in legislation specific protection against discrimination against the Traveller community. The perception of asylum seekers and refugees can be very similar to that of Travellers. People see them as somehow lesser people of whom they are afraid. They are perceived as living in lesser ways than the wider community. In many cases they are excluded from services such as insurance, from hotels, bars and so on. This is why the legislation includes the Traveller community as a specific group.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that the ground of race includes refugees and asylum seekers. However, this is not so in all cases given the emerging problem of how people perceive refugees and asylum seekers. Senator O'Donovan's comment could be repeated hundreds of times in relation to the location of refugees, particularly in this city. Given what is happening, it is imperative this section is included in the legislation. It was not included in the legislation six or seven years ago because no one anticipated such a problem. Such a problem did not exist at that time. I do not accept the argument that because the measure was not included then, it should not be included now. It was not included then because it did not appear necessary but it is definitely necessary to include it now.</P>

      <P>We must accept that refugees and asylum seekers are by their very nature of a different nationality. If an asylum seeker or refugee considers that he or she has been treated less favourably in the provision of goods and services because of his or her race, colour, nationality or national or ethnic origin, it is open to him or her to take a case of racial discrimination under the Bill. The points made by the Senator are covered under the race aspect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>On Senator Connor's concerns in relation to affording refugees the same status as Irish citizens in terms of services, section 3 of the Refugee Act entitles refugees to the same rights as Irish citizens in terms of employment, education, health services and social services. The State makes all services available to refugees and Irish citizens on the same basis.</P>

If after two years we find the legislation needs to be clearer, we can discuss it further. If we begin discussing the issue now, we will not even get the race aspect through in two years. Let us get the issue of race discrimination on the Statute Book and allow people to take a case in the year 2000.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5)The Minister shall not later than five years after the commencement of this section review the operation of this Act to assess whether there is a need to add to the discriminatory grounds specified in <i>subsection (2).</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister will say that the legislation will be reviewed after two years, and one welcomes that. However, there are many precedents for a five year review. The legislation should be reviewed after five years and again after another five years. The interim review after two years is welcome but the Minister should accept the principle of a five year review. Such reviews are seen as good practice in the case of other legislation and many international conventions. Grounds for discrimination, such as the refugee and asylum seeker grounds, would not have been envisaged two years ago. In two years' time we will, no doubt, surprise ourselves again when new issues arise. Let us establish the practice of reviewing the legislation after five years and again after another five years.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Connor's amendment. The Minister has spoken about the <Col N="1663" /><Col N="1664" /> review of the operation of the legislation in two years' time but I am sure she will agree it is very unlikely that a review after that time would evoke a legislative response. A comprehensive look at the working of the legislation would be necessary to justify bringing amendments or an equal status (amendment) Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>Five years is an appropriate period in which to assess the effectiveness of the Bill. Given the Government's record and considering the Employment Equality Act, it is unlikely that the Bill will come into operation immediately and it will take a number of months to take a case to the Director of Equality Investigations and to have it assessed. Therefore two years is far too soon to judge how the legislation is operating. Five years is a realistic and appropriate period to allow for a proper review of the operation of the Act. The Act covers new ground and we do not know what its effect will be. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We sometimes introduce legislation of this sort but are not sufficiently careful about monitoring its effect, which I hope in this case will be excellent. Recent legislation prescribed a mandatory sentence of ten years for those convicted of having more than £10,000 worth of drugs in their possession. When one reads in court reports how frequently such sentences are reduced on appeal, one wonders why we passed the legislation at all. Indeed, I was not in favour of it. A review of that legislation would tell us that it is not having the desired effect.</P>
      <P>Five years is a relevant and reasonable length of time in which to monitor this legislation for the purpose of a review. I congratulate Senator Connor on tabling this important amendment and I support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has been made repeatedly and clearly that an automatic review after two years is built into this legislation. At that time it could be decided to carry out another review after a further two years. Two reviews could be carried out within the next five years. As the Bill specifies a mandatory review after two years, the proposal to review the legislation in five years could cause confusion. The mechanism for a review is already included in the Bill and we should leave well enough alone. Other grounds for discrimination can be added at the two year review. A five year review would create more problems than it would solve.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Donovan has covered much of what I wish to say. Section 3(4) already provides for a review within two years to assess the need for an additional discriminatory ground. There is a similar requirement in the Employment Equality Act.</P>
      <P>As Senator O'Donovan said, the possibility of a further review can be considered when the two year review is complete. For those reasons I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> I draw the Senator's attention to section 39 in Part IV of the Bill which deals with the additional functions of the equality authority. Paragraph <i>(c) </i>reads, &ldquo;To provide information to the public on and to keep under review the working of this Act and, whenever the Authority thinks it necessary, to make proposals to the Minister for its amendment&rdquo;. The authority is therefore responsible for the day-to-day operation of the Bill and its twin sister, the Employment Equality Act. If it decides that there is a need for change it will make proposals to the Minister for its amendment under section 39<i>(c).</i> It is therefore better to leave the Bill as it stands; otherwise, as Senator O'Donovan said, the operation of the Bill would be reviewed twice in the next five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in no doubt about the Minister of State's good intentions. Unfortunately she is not Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Personally I hope she is when the time comes to decide on these matters. While I accept what she said, it is necessary to state that the operation of the Bill should be reviewed after a period of five years. Human rights law is developing at a rapid rate and even in countries as advanced as this there is much ground to be made up. I hope ten years from now human rights norms and law will have progressed further. There are whole areas which need to be developed.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Council of Europe which looks at human rights law. While there have been many positive developments in the past 20 years, there will need to be further changes, new developments and innovations in the next ten to 20 years. It is for that reason that it is necessary to state that all legislation dealing with human rights should be subject to regular review. It is extremely difficult to have new legislation of this nature introduced in either House, there is always a view that existing legislation is adequate. I am therefore attracted to the idea that the operation of the Bill should be reviewed after a period of five years.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)An educational organisation or institution shall not be allowed to rely on <i>subsection (2) </i>to lessen the rights of individuals who have a disability or who have special educational needs as provided for in the Education Act, 1998.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is often stated that providing special facilities or services for a child with a disability in a school may have the effect of placing other children at a disadvantage. I cannot accept that argument. It should be possible to provide facilities and services for children with a physical disability in a school or educational institution without affecting the facilities and services provided as of right for all other children. I do not know if a good argument can be made against enshrining this principle in the Bill. Naturally schools will state that there are staff and accommodation shortages but given the level of economic growth and prosperity achieved we ought to have the reached the point where we are in a position to ensure all such children are provided with the best possible facilities and services. This should not hinder in any way the facilities and services provided for all other children.</P>
      <P>Schools and educational institutions, all the facilities of which are paid for by the State, should never be allowed to use this as an excuse. It is not an acceptable argument that providing special facilities and services for a child with a disability will place all other children at a disadvantage.</P>

      <P>This is the section on which the previous Bill was struck down by the Supreme Court. It is extraordinarily sad at a time when we keep boasting about the money available that it has been watered down more than necessary.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 26, modern thinking within educational establishments &ndash; given her interest in people with a disability I am sure the Minister of State is in favour of this &ndash; is that children with disabilities should be integrated wherever possible into the general school system. At a time when more money than expected is coming in, why can more classroom attendants not be employed to provide the extra help these children require? On what is the money to be spent? There are ample opportunities to spend it to the benefit of the population by advancing projects such as the integration of children with a disability into the general school system. Extra classroom assistants would be required to take the children concerned to the lavatory in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not seem to like considering the matter because the facilities required to integrate people with a disability into the community are considered personal. If a person in a wheelchair wants to go to one of the lavatories in Leinster <Col N="1667" /> House the situation is absolutely appalling. One of the amendments which cannot be discussed because of its financial implications would have an impact on this matter. If it is being said that the people concerned should be allowed to become part of the community something has to be done. Are we really asking for intermittent catheterisation for them in some corner with the consequent risk of infection? We are talking about the provision of basic physical facilities. The Bill unfortunately goes nowhere near covering the people concerned who have a wish to become involved in life.</P>
    <P>I have spoken frequently in the House and written to the Minister of State about the allowances payable to disabled persons. The Minister of State should not think that I believe she is not sympathetic. She is. I just wish she was running the show to ensure there was more action on this matter. It is difficult for people to understand when a Minister boasts about the amount of money available and says, &ldquo;Let's party&rdquo; while some people cannot get into the general run of the life of the country, never mind to the party. I ask the Minister to accept this amendment for the sake of the children.</P>

      <P>The good news is that if Senators look at section 4(5) of the legislation since coming from the other House they will find that what they have requested is covered. The drafting of the equal status legislation was developed in close consultation with the Department of Education and Science. It does not dilute the provisions in any way of the Education Act, 1998, with regard to people with disabilities and it will allay the fears expressed by Senators and Deputies. It ensures the equal status legislation cannot be interpreted as being prejudicial to the provisions of the Education Act. The other relevant sections 7(2)(a), 9(a) and 15(2)(g) of the Education Act come under section 4(5). If <Col N="1668" /> Senators would like me to explain these sections I will do so.</P>

      <P>For clarification, it would be useful to refer to section 15(2)(g) of the Education Act because it was framed to take account of the Supreme Court finding on the Employment Equality Bill. It states that the reasonable provision and accommodation for students with disabilities is to be done from &ldquo;resources provided to the school from monies provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo;. It thus avoids any implications that school authorities must use their own resources for this purpose. The wording of the Equal Status Bill is thus consistent with the requirements of the Education Act, 1998, and does not dilute it in any way.</P>
      <P>Section 7(2)(a) of the Education Act gives the Minister for Education and Science certain functions regarding funding which includes funding for support services for students with a disability. Section 9(a) requires schools to use available resources to ensure that the educational needs of all students, including those with a disability, are identified and provided for. Section 15(2)(g) requires a board of management to use the resources provided to the school from moneys provided by the Oireachtas to make reasonable provisions and accommodation for students with a disability or other special education needs, including, where necessary, alteration of buildings and provision of appropriate equipment. Section 4(5) ensures that the equal status legislation cannot be interpreted as being prejudicial to the provisions of the Education Act. The requests made by Senators are covered in the Education Act and it cannot be interpreted that there will be fewer facilities &ndash; it cannot be watered down.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister said, I take it that private education institutions will not be covered by the joint terms of the two Acts. The Minister pointed out that accommodation specifically for disabled students is provided through moneys voted by the Oireachtas and does not cut across the Supreme Court judgment. <Col N="1669" /> Presumably, that means if somebody in a wheelchair wanted to go to a private institution and was being prevented from doing so, he would not be protected.</P>
      <P>With regard to the undue difficulty and the cost to an employer of employing a disabled person &ndash; which emerged from the Employment Equality Act and was struck down by the Supreme Court &ndash; it appears the Government has been far too cautious in its response and has not dealt with it sufficiently. It could have been far more creative and imaginative. This legislation does not provide an adequate level of protection and rights for disabled people. This should be the intention of all Members of the Oireachtas of all political parties &ndash; I made this point on the Employment Equality Bill also. The spirit of our intention has not been expressed in the legislation.</P>

      <P>Like Senator O'Meara, I am disappointed this legislation does not go further because so much lip-service is paid to helping people with disabilities. It is important to remember that one does not have to be born with a disability, one can be acquired. Because we are healthy now does not mean we will remain that way. I know the Minister is heavily involved with people with disabilities but one does not have to have many dealings with them to see how incredibly difficult some of their lives can be. A small amount of help would go a long way &ndash; although it may cost money &ndash; in the provision of services by State bodies.</P>
      <P>If disabled people were given two hours home help a week they might be able to live on their own. One can imagine the difficulties encountered by disabled people. It is difficult for them to come home from work to start the ironing when a home help could get through a great deal of housework in two hours. The provision of such services appears to be an insurmountable problem which should not be allowed to exist. I am disappointed in this section but I note there will not be a change. I realised there were difficulties but I had hoped the provisions would not become so watered down.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 5, but in Part I, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&ndash;A public authority shall within 6 months from the passing of this Act submit to the Authority a scheme which shall show how the public authority proposes to fulfil the duties imposed by this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is self-explanatory. It is a sensible suggestion and one which is, unfortunately, necessary. It is also based on clause 2 of Schedule 9 to the UK Northern Ireland Act, 1998. I should <Col N="1670" /> point out for Members' benefit that it was the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, a unit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform based in Mespil Road, which suggested that this proposal be included in the Bill. For that reason, I am sure the Minister will be happy to take it on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill covers nine grounds, with many exemptions and diverse areas of service provision in the private and public sectors. It is not clear why this obligation should apply to public authorities only. I cannot see that a scheme submitted only six months after the passing of the Bill, irrespective of when it is commenced, could contain useful material on the practical application of the Bill, as opposed to broad aspirational statements. Government Departments and other public bodies are committed, through customer service plans, to equality of opportunity.</P>
      <P>I would also point to the extensive functions being given to the authority in relation to codes of practice and equality reviews. These functions, and in particular the authority's power to conduct equality reviews of bodies with more than 50 staff, have the potential to prompt practical anti-discrimination policies and measures in public authorities.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there is no comparable requirement on public bodies in matters to which the Employment Equality Act, 1998 applies.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;but does not include information gathered from genetic testing,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to Part II, disposal of goods and provision of services in the insurance sector. The section, as currently drafted, covers a number of areas but we wish to include information gathered from genetic testing. This amendment was originally tabled by Deputy McDaid in his capacity as Fianna Fáil spokesperson on justice during debate of the Bill in the Dáil. It appears to us to be a good idea to include it in the Bill given the advances in the area of genetic testing and engineering. We are constantly being told genetic testing will be a major issue in the early part of this century. It would make a great deal of sense to include information gathered from genetic testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise there are concerns about genetic testing but I do not see the Equal Status Bill as being the appropriate vehicle for resolution of these issues. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not the supervisory authority for the insurance industry <Col N="1671" /> and it is not his function to establish standards for the use of genetic data for insurance purposes.</P>
      <P>The Irish Insurance Federation is reviewing the issue with a view to establishing best practice, taking account of developments in other countries. A code of practice has been agreed at industry level on the use of genetic tests in life assurance and the industry intends to engage in consultations on this code before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>So far as the Equal Status Bill is concerned, material obtained from genetic testing falls to be treated with other data which insurance companies can use to justify different treatment. It has to be data on which it is reasonable to rely and the difference of treatment has to be reasonable having regard to the data or other relevant factors. The Equal Status Bill therefore limits the opportunity to discriminate.</P>
      <P>Insurance contracts require the disclosure of all material facts in the application, whether the insurance company asks for it or not. An insurance company could hardly be prevented from taking into account a genetic test which indicated an increased risk. I do not think the Equal Status Bill is the appropriate vehicle for resolving such issues.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Section 13 of the Housing Act, 1988, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1) This section applies to members of the &ldquo;Traveller community&rdquo; which is defined for these purposes as the community of people commonly so called who are identified both by themselves and by others as people with a shared history, culture and traditions including historically a nomadic way of life on the island of Ireland.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment relates to the issue of accommodation. It may seem unusual to introduce it at this point but we need to define Traveller culture and identity in this Bill. That has not been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State will know, Senator O'Meara and I are members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, the committee that tracks the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In relation to this Bill we took many submissions from various sources, one of which was Pavee Point. That organisation pointed out to us that there was a need to recognise Traveller culture and identity in this Bill. It also pointed out that the task force on the Traveller community <Col N="1673" /> recommended on page 85 of its report to the Minister that the equal status legislation should define Travellers in a manner that acknowledges their distinct culture and identity. Pavee Point makes the following point in its submission:</P>
    <P>Although this Bill specifically includes Travellers the minimalist nature of the Bill does not ensure that Traveller culture and identity will be taken into account in the design and delivery of services. Such an inclusion is important if the Bill is to appropriately address the current situation.</P>
    <P>Housing is always controversial. Anyone who is a member of a local authority will know that there is always controversy over Traveller accommodation and housing. People from the settled community will often make uninformed complaints about cultural habits of Travellers. The Travellers do not have the same settled pattern of living as people from the settled community. It is important that this is stated in the Bill. It is appropriate for the distinct Traveller culture and identity to be recognised and mentioned in the sections that deal with housing and accommodation. I request the Minister of State to include my amendment which states:</P>
    <P>the &ldquo;Traveller community&rdquo; which is defined for these purposes as the community of people commonly so called who are identified both by themselves and by others as people with a shared history, culture and traditions including historically a nomadic way of life on the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It would not be harmful to include my definition of the Traveller traditions, history and culture. It is important. So much of the ill informed comment and action in regard to Traveller accommodation comes from a total misunderstanding of their history and culture.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a very homogeneous society and there is a similar approach to the refugee and asylum seeker issue. There is a resistance to different cultural practices. To some extent this is understandable because of our history as an island nation. We need to continually educate the public about different cultures and traditions and their legal right to exist and co-exist with all the other traditions and cultures to be found in any population. The world is changing rapidly and there is a great intercultural mix everywhere. Pavee Point and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, which was set up under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, made the same point to the committee. I hope the Minister of State will accept my amendment given the good recommendations that go with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will be happy to know that I have good news on this issue, which is that we dealt with it during the Dáil debate. Section 2 of the Bill includes the definition:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Traveller community&rdquo; means the com<Col N="1674" /> munity of people who are commonly called Travellers and who are identified (both by themselves and others) as people with a shared history, culture and traditions, including, historically, a nomadic way of life on the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>This wording is virtually identical to that suggested by the Senator and it is based on the Race Relations Order in Northern Ireland and it is now included in section 2.</P>

      <P>There is a need to continually state it. It is appropriate for it to be restated, even only as a reminder, when dealing with Traveller accommodation, which is where ill informed comment and discrimination manifests itself against the Traveller community. That has been my experience as someone who lives in a rural community and as a member of a local authority housing committee. It is at that level that one comes up against the problem of Traveller accommodation and housing and the tensions that will give rise to in the settled community. People are not well informed about Traveller history and culture and their need to practise a nomadic way of life. This is an appropriate point in the Bill to reiterate the Traveller culture and identity.</P>
      <P>I beg pardon for my lack of information and for not spotting that reference in section 2. I remember that Pavee Point and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism made a good point about it when they met the sub-committee.</P>

Otherwise it would be seen as being more important with regard to accommodation but less important with regard to access to clubs, goods, services and educational establishments. It would be better to stick with the existing customs and practices. It is included in the definitions at the start of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The definition is repeated in section 48(<i>a</i>)(ii), page 34, because we want to make sure that it applies to employment. In that section we are also reminded about the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and we made sure that the same definition is applied. This is the first time that a definition of the Traveller community has been inserted in legislation and I warmly welcome it.</P>

      <P>This amendment is a rehash of the arguments we made about persons with or without refugee status. I want to insert the phrase &ldquo;or persons with refugee status&rdquo; after the term &ldquo;Union&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We know that persons within the European Union have the same protection that we have under our domestic laws and we are protected by the domestic laws of any other member state. Once a refugee has achieved refugee status in this country the Minister has acknowledged they are entitled to the full protection of the law and to any welfare the State provides. It is important to state it because of the times in which we live. If there is discrimination in this country it centres around refugees and asylum seekers. No one can send a more powerful message to the public than the Government, particularly at a time when we are introducing such seminal legislation.</P>

Section 3 of the Refugee Act, 1996, although not yet in force, states this and it is an administrative practice. The opening words of paragraph (<i>d</i>) provide that the exemptions for differences of treatment for EU nationals at section 7(3)(<i>d</i>) of the Equal Status Bill and section 12(7) of the Employment Equality Act are without prejudice to section 3 of the Refugee Act.

      <P>(<i>e</i>) where the establishment is a university or other third-level institution, it provides different treatment in the allocation of places at the establishment to mature students (within the meaning of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992).&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to add a new paragraph at section 7(3)(<i>e</i>) which indicates that where the educational establishment is a university or other third level institution it is not discrimination to provide different treatment at that establishment for mature students. The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1992, provides a definition of a mature student in the context of the administration by local authorities of the higher education grants scheme. A mature student is someone of 23 years of age or over in the year of entrance to third level.</P>
      <P>I brought forward this amendment because concerns were expressed to me that the Equal Status Bill took no account of existing admission policies of universities which afford preferential treatment when admitting mature students. The Department of Education and Science has informed my Department that the broad policy of facilitating and encouraging admission to our universities is central to the State's approach to adult education in that it embodies the notion of second chance education. However, an imbalance exists whereby many people who have left the education system did not have the same educational opportunities which are available to school leavers today. This can be due to previous low levels of third level provision or issues of social or economic disadvantage. Adult education provision is seen as a way of addressing such inequalities of opportunities.</P>
      <P>The case made for the exemption in the Equal Status Bill of the universities' admission policies for mature students is persuasive. Accordingly, I made an appropriate amendment to ensure that continuance of these policies is not overridden by the Equal Status Bill. I am also making a similar change in the provisions of the Employment Equality Act dealing with vocational training in so far as they relate to third level education.</P>

      <P>Section 7(4)(<i>b</i>) provides that educational establishments are not obliged to admit students with a disability if so doing would make impossible or have a seriously detrimental effect on the provision of their services for other students. This exemption was included following legal advice about the open-ended nature of the obligation under the 1997 Bill which would negate other people's constitutional right to education. There was a balance to be struck in this regard. I stress that the wording of this subsection was formulated in consultation with the Department of Education and Science and involves a strict test. Since the school will have to persuade the Director of Equality Investigations that it meets the test in section 7(4)(<i>b</i>), I do not regard it as necessary to qualify this section by reference to objective criteria. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the provision of services or facilities for a student with a disability affects the services or educational facilities available to other students, the institution can opt out. That should not be allowed to happen. The State provides almost 100% of the funding needed for third level education, including the upkeep of buildings, etc. If the provision of proper services or educational facilities for a person or persons with a disability in a university faculty causes disadvantages for other students because of a lack of resources, it is not fair or just that the latter should win. We should use part of the £500 million we generated in the first quarter of this year in our Exchequer returns, which was more than we anticipated on 1 January, to ensure that such discrimination does not take place.</P>
      <P>We need a new disability Bill to protect the interests of people with a disability. We have been promised that Bill for a long time but we have not seen it yet. This Bill which is supposed to outlaw discrimination allows such a concession to educational establishments. That is not fair or just. I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come across cases where the parents believed the right place for their child to be educated was in the school on their road. However, this might not have been the right place for the child. Sometimes if a child is diagnosed with a particular disability at four years of age, it takes time for the parents to deal with the fact that their child's educational needs may be different from those of their other children. If the mainstream option is the best option for the <Col N="1678" /> child, that is what should be available. On the other hand, if the special school is the best option for the child, perhaps that is what should be available once supports are provided in the appropriate places.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say this is the right place for the child regardless of the circumstances. One must apply the strict test in such cases. I have come across many cases where mainstream schools were slow to accept a child with a disability from the parish and no test was applied. Parents then fell out with the school authorities and the usual local debates took place. I have been involved in many of them on behalf of children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>This, in a way, strengthens the hand of the family with a child with a disability. If the child is refused admission to the primary school, the school must justify that to the Director of Equality Investigations under the strict test. The exclusion of a person by a school on foot of this provision would meet the strict test, namely, that the person's disability must make it impossible or have a seriously detrimental effect on the school's provision of its services to other students.</P>
      <P>I underline the term &ldquo;strict test&rdquo;. We have in mind a child whose disability is such that his or her admission would seriously disrupt or negate the education of the pupils. Also, it might not be in the best interest of the child to be in that environment. It is not intended to cover situations where it would be inconvenient for the school to have a pupil with a disability. In fact, it would catch such schools because if the school felt it was inconvenient for it to put a ramp outside the front door and, therefore, inconvenient for it to take in a child with a wheelchair, regardless of their educational ability and right to come into the mainstream school, it would not pass the strict test.</P>
      <P>The perceptions and attitudes of other pupils or their parents are not relevant. This has applied in the past. We are not talking about inconvenience, perceptions or attitudes. Those types of cases would not pass the strict test. The criteria are extremely strict and the exemption can be invoked only in limited circumstances. Where a school has availed of this provision, it will be open to the person to seek redress under the Equal Status Bill by submitting the case to the Director of Equality Investigations. The school would have to provide satisfactory evidence to the director that there was a basis under section 4 for its decision not to admit the student. In other words, where an educational establishment seeks to avail of such an exemption, it will be a matter for that establishment and not the complainant to show that the exemption applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at it in the round, this is an extra benefit to the student with a disability who has been refused entry in the wrong to the mainstream school. In the past, if one did not win the fight, one went elsewhere. Now if one does not win the fight, one can take one's case to the Director of Equality Investigations. It is critical we identify <Col N="1679" /> the fact that there is an extremely strict test under this section. Looking at it in the round, it is an additional benefit to the student with a disability accessing mainstream education.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 14, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&ndash;The partners or members or any of them of a business or of its board or governing authority whether incorporated or not that is carried out by individuals who are and share in the capital profits of a business as its partners or members (&lsquo;a firm') shall not discriminate in relation to&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) the admission of a person as a partner or member of the firm or conditions applicable to a partner or member of the firm,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) the status of a partner or member of the firm in relation to the work done by the firm or the sharing in the capital and profits of the firm, or</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) the expulsion of a partner or member from the firm or any other sanction against the partner or member.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 38 seeks to insert a new section but, in fact, it seeks to restore a section originally in the 1997 version of the Bill. It relates to self-employed firms, such as accountants and solicitors. One would be familiar with the type of firm about which I am thinking which is defined in the amendment. It is clear from the text of the amendment that these firms of self-employed are not excluded from the operations of the Bill. In other words, those firms cannot discriminate in relation to the admission of a person, the status of a partner or the expulsion of a partner or member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only is it an important and valuable section to include in the Equal Status Bill, it is required by the Government in order to comply with the 1996 EU directive on equality in self-employed activity. That was one of the main reasons this section was originally drafted and included in the 1997 legislation. The non-inclusion of this section in this Bill creates a problem in that it would <Col N="1680" /> appear that members and partners in these firms are not covered by the terms of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I cannot add anything to what Senator O'Meara said in favour of acceptance of this amendment. My amendment is similar in wording and has the same intent. Senator O'Meara made the valid point that it was included in the 1997 Bill. It improves the quality of the Bill in all areas of activity so that this sector is clearly included. There was a need for it when the Bill was drawn up by Mr. Mervyn Taylor in 1996 and 1997. I take it the Minister will say it had to be deleted because again there is a level of uncertainty in relation to the Supreme Court decision on the Employment Equality Act. I do not accept that.</P>

      <P>The Bill before us, unlike the 1997 Bill, does not contain any provision to deal with discrimination by firms, including firms of partners, against members or prospective members of such firms. As Senators will be aware, we obtained extensive legal advice on this measure following the Supreme Court decision in 1997. Our advice was that these provisions of the 1997 Bill were anomalous <i>vis-à-vis</i> the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, presented constitutional difficulties and were not required to transpose the EU directive on self-employed activity.</P>
      <P>I am not ruling out a prohibition on discrimination in firms and partnerships at some future time by whatever statutory means. Senators will, however, recognise the Equal Status Bill is essentially about the provision of goods and services and that it is a complex measure with a troubled history. Given the complexities involved, I do not intend to provide for firms and partnerships in the present Bill and cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>It might be worth Senators' while to note that perhaps we should look at this issue in the review of the Employment Equality Act because it is an employment issue as distinct from a goods and services one. It does not fit here. There are checks and balances in both pieces of legislation in terms of checking against age, ability to work and the other checks in the Employment Equality Act which do not necessarily apply to goods and services. It is an employment issue.</P>
      <P>It was included in this legislation originally because it was thought at that stage there was a need for it to transpose the EU directive on self-employed activity. It was subsequently discovered that was not necessary. In addition, it presents constitutional difficulties and difficulties here. It is not in the right place and there is no need to deal with it here in regard to goods and services as it is an employment issue.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for that clarification. Indeed, I would largely accept her point that it is possibly even more appropriate to the Employment Equality Act. Once again the <Col N="1681" /> Minister appears to be using the Supreme Court judgment as a blanket to cover more areas than is necessary. We are left with a situation where this area is not covered in this or in the other legislation. I imagine self-employed firms constitute a considerable area of employment in the service area of the economy but those firms are not covered by anti-discrimination legislation, whether in the Equal Status Bill or in the Employment Equality Act.</P>

It is equally wrong for us to talk about it today because we are talking about it under the wrong legislation. We should be talking about it under the employment legislation. We should bear in mind that the Employment Equality Act was passed in June 1998. This in an employment issue and there is no point in saying that because it was here in the past we should keep going. We now know that it was in the wrong place and there is no point in causing more problems. We should stop and do it right.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to examine the issue where clubs lose their licences for 12 months. The amendment stipulates that a club will lose its licence for 30 days on the first offence of discrimination, following which the situation will be examined. This will give the club an opportunity to put its house in order in terms of discrimination. Many clubs looked seriously at this issue when the last Equal Status Bill was rejected by the Supreme Court. Clubs sat back a little, thinking they would not have to consider this issue again. However, they will now have to consider the issue seriously under this legislation. <Col N="1682" /> In the meantime, some clubs have come into line but many clubs are still out of line. Losing a licence is a significant sanction and we are making it clear that clubs will lose their licences for 30 days for a first offence and for a longer period if there is a second offence.</P>

      <P>The Senator is correct except that this amendment does not water down the Bill. It is in no one's interest for clubs to lose their licences. It is in our interests to stop discrimination in clubs. We are proposing this amendment as a mechanism which will give clubs an opportunity to comply with the legislation within 30 days. The Bill is not about taking away licences, it is about stopping discrimination in golf clubs.</P>
      <P>This amendment does not water down the Bill but gives clubs an opportunity to change their rules and get themselves in order within the 30 days so that they do not discriminate as defined in the legislation. It is a clear change from the position as agreed by the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept the Minister of State's view that this does not water down the Bill if the legislation had been recently published. However, the Bill has been in gestation in one form or another for a number of years and has been widely written about in the media. The fact that clubs would suffer this penalty if they did not comply with the legislation has received much publicity and they do not need 30 days to put <Col N="1683" /> their house in order. The majority of clubs have already moved to comply with the legislation before it is enacted and that is as it should be. However, we now seem to be giving them an out and that is unnecessary. What is the rationale behind this amendment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is proposing a sensible and practical solution. It would be unfair and draconian if a club lost its licence permanently or for a year. A sufficient deterrent would be if clubs were closed down or lost their licence for 30 days. This is as it should be as this issue has been in the public arena for the past six or seven years and many clubs have put their house in order in anticipation of this legislation. I support and welcome the Minister of State's amendments in this regard. It is more than adequate to penalise a club for 30 days. Permanent loss of a licence would be using a sledgehammer to drive a thumb tack when a lesser penalty would be sufficient.</P>
      <P>The 30 day period is fair and adequate and I support this amendment which improves the Bill. The Minister of State rightly said that the purpose of the legislation is not to deregister clubs but to prevent discrimination and we should not lose sight of that objective.</P>

      <P>The ultimate sanction is still in place in that clubs will lose their licences for a second offence. We have met the golfing organisations since this Bill was passed by the Dáil. We are always willing to review, amend, change and be helpful. I hope this amendment will be seen by all involved in golf as an addition and a benefit as it adds to the warning system in that clubs will lose their licences for 30 days, which will give them an opportunity to get their house in order.</P>
      <P>Every member of a golf club will be aware of the fact that they cannot buy a drink during the 30 day period and the penalty will be the subject of much conversation. It also gives clubs the chance to get their licences back when they stop the discrimination. We are not interested in removing licences from golf clubs, we are interested in removing discrimination. The amendment adds an additional warning which will be beneficial as it will shake golf clubs into action, knowing they have 30 days to put their house in order.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Noting the buoyancy in the National Revenue, Seanad Éireann urges the Minister for Finance and the Government to pursue poli<Col N="1684" /> cies, over the next two budgets, that will ensure that everyone earning the national minimum wage will not be liable for income tax.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The motion principally deals with taxation, specifically the tax treatment of those on the national minimum wage. Before putting the case for the motion, however, we should welcome the fact that the national minimum wage was introduced on schedule at the start of this month. Progress on the implementation of the national minimum wage has been impressive by any standards.</P>
    <P>The original commitment was set out in the joint programme for Government in June 1997. The Commission on the National Minimum Wage was established a few weeks later and it reported in less than a year. Less than three years since the Government took office, the Tánaiste has steered the necessary legislation through the Oireachtas and the national minimum wage is a reality for hundreds of thousands of people.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that the Labour Party, which was in Government from 1992 until 1997, never got round to the minimum wage. Deputies Quinn and Rabbitte were both Ministers in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but no progress was made in their time on this very important social initiative. The introduction of the national minimum wage represents a huge step forward in the affairs of this State. It will directly benefit 160,000 of the lowest paid workers in society, those most in need of a boost from Government, those to whom one would think the previous Administration would have paid attention.</P>
    <P>We hear many people talking about sharing the wealth of the State but this Government is doing something about it. By introducing the minimum wage, it is ensuring that those on the lowest rung of the employment ladder can secure a greater share of the prosperity we as a nation are now enjoying. Setting the minimum wage at the right level is not a simple matter. If the rate is too low the initiative will have no effect and if it is too high it will put people out of work. The objective is to set a reasonable floor below which earnings should not fall and the Government has got it right. The initial rate of £4.40 per hour will rise to £5 an hour, just under £200 per week, by the time the Government has completed its term of office.</P>
    <P>There have been some complaints that the rate is set at too high a level. The main gripe from employers at present, however, concerns the difficulties they are experiencing in recruiting workers. No firm will go broke paying £4.40 an hour in the current era of economic success. Indeed, if there are jobs which are only sustainable below that level, we should question if they are the kinds of jobs we want as we move toward a high wage, high skills economy. Concerns have also been voiced about the policing of the national minimum wage. The issue should be dealt with in a spirit of fairness and maturity and <Col N="1685" /> people should accept the introduction of the national minimum wage as a measure designed to help the least well off.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the national minimum wage is the first step in a two part process. The next step will be the exemption of the minimum wage from income tax. The progress made in tax reform over the last three budgets is spectacular by any standards, as are the results. The Minister for Finance and the Government are to be congratulated on that. The rate of corporation tax has been slashed and revenue has gone up; the rates of personal income tax have been slashed and revenue has gone up; the rate of capital gains tax has been slashed and revenue has gone up. A commentator in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times,</i> writing about capital gains tax, stated, &ldquo;In spite of all the evidence that the rich have managed to avoid or evade their fair share and every other kind of tax, McCreevy has made sure that one kind of tax they do pay has been massively reduced.&rdquo;  It seems to have escaped the notice of this commentator that under the present Government the yield from capital gains tax has increased massively. There are people, however, who would be happy to see the rate of capital taxes doubled, even if the revenue accruing was halved and everyone would be worse off.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that virtually every major change in the tax system in the last 15 years has taken place while the Progressive Democrats Party has been in Government. During our two terms in Government nine points have been taken off the basic rate of income tax and 12 points taken off the top rate. We have seen the introduction of tax credits and massive increases in the value of tax allowances and bands, over 100,000 people on middle incomes removed from the top tax rate, and over 100,000 on modest incomes taken out of the tax net entirely. We are now well on target to deliver on the taxation commitments set out in the joint programme for Government. Two more budgets should see to that.</P>
    <P>The resources are now available, however, to do much more. The extent to which these resources would accrue to the Exchequer was not even envisaged when the Government was formed. Many commentators are critical of the Government's fiscal policy in allocating these resources. We hear it said regularly that no Government has had so much money and so many resources available to it. Such comment fails to recognise that such budget surpluses are a direct result of tax cutting policies pursued by this Administration.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the significant cost of this measure. It will cost approximately £1 billion in nominal terms to exempt the national minimum wage from income tax. I said &ldquo;nominal terms&rdquo; because the tax cuts contained in the past three budgets effectively have cost the Exchequer nothing. Income tax revenue is higher than it was when the Government took office. In terms of the revenue available to the Government, it is also <Col N="1686" /> possible to do what I propose, even with regard to last year's budget in terms of what the Minister allocated by way of tax reduction and tax credits.</P>
    <P>I concede the cost of this measure is significant. It is the type of figure by which we used to measure our indebtedness in the 1980s. Times have changed since then. We are now running substantial budget surpluses on the current account due to the prudential policies followed by the Government. Those surpluses are of a magnitude that allows us to contemplate tax reform and tax reduction on a scale that was not imaginable previously. Because of the buoyancy we have experienced, we need a leap of imagination well beyond that to which we have been accustomed regarding the allocation of those resources. From what was contained in the past few budgets, I am aware the Minister has that type of imagination and can contemplate those types of leaps.</P>
    <P>If we are prepared to think big, we can deliver big. The resources exist to exempt those earning the minimum wage from income tax. The objective can be attained within the lifetime of the Government. Provided the political will exists to do it, there is no reason the minimum wage cannot be exempted from tax over the course of the next two budgets. If this Administration can deliver that, it will have delivered one of the most significant political initiatives in the history of this State.</P>
    <P>Exempting the minimum wage from income tax would have numerous advantages. It would have an impact on the labour market. At a time when employers are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit workers, a tax free minimum wage would serve as a major attraction for people to enter the workforce. That attraction would not be confined to those on or near the minimum wage, as all taxpayers would benefit from the substantial increases in basic allowances required to facilitate exemption.</P>
    <P>Such a measure would also have an impact on social partnership and social cohesion. We are now in our fifth partnership arrangement. A major tax initiative on the minimum wage coming to fruition in about two years' time would smooth the way for a sixth agreement and help us to maintain our impressive and enviable record of attaining rapid economic growth while still keeping inflation under control.</P>
    <P>There is also a social justice element attached to the introduction of this measure. The rationale for introducing the national minimum wage is to enable those on very modest incomes to enjoy a greater share of the national cake. Making the minimum wage tax free would represent further substantial progress in the same direction.</P>
    <P>When this coalition took office in 1997 it would have seemed fanciful in the extreme if the new Administration started talking about a tax free minimum wage. That relates to what I said about the undreamt of resources that are now available. At that time there was not a minimum wage nor had preparatory work been done on the issue by <Col N="1687" /> the outgoing Administration. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, had to start from scratch when she took office. Even if there had been a minimum wage or some semblance of the preparation for one, the structure of the tax system would have made it virtually impossible to take the type of initiative that is contemplated in this motion.</P>
    <P>The working people of this country were heavily taxed on modest incomes in the dark days of 1997. A single person entered the tax net after earning £70 a week. It is difficult to believe that two left wing parties were prepared to preside over that type of situation, but they were because they had no real commitment to tax reduction or tax reform. Their performance is in stark contrast to the major progress that has been made over the past three budgets.</P>
    <P>The introduction of tax credits in the 1999 budget gave effect to one of the most important political commitments in the Progressive Democrats' election manifesto. The introduction of the tax credits represented one of the most significant changes ever made to the structure of our tax system. That change provided us with a mechanism for targeting the benefit of tax reduction measures at lower paid workers. Given it is such a good idea, I wonder why the previous Administration never got around to doing it. Talking about tax reform is one thing, but delivering it is a different thing. Building on tax credits, we have created a situation where a single person does not enter the tax net until his or her income reaches £110 a week and then he or she pays tax at 22%, not 26%. With tax credits it is realistic to aspire to raising the tax threshold to around £170 a week, the level at which the minimum wage has been introduced.</P>
    <P>The social and economic achievements of the Government are remarkable by any standard. We have increased the number of people in employment by almost 270,000. We have reduced the level of unemployment by 70,000, long-term unemployment by 50,000 and are well on course to eliminate unemployment within the lifetime of the present Administration. These are major achievements by any standard.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the level of long-term unemployment is particularly welcome. Long-term unemployment is one of the fundamental causes of deep-seated poverty in our society. It is a problem which for a long time we thought we would never solve and it is great that we have now put that type of thinking behind us. It would be in keeping with this record of outstanding achievement in the social and economic area if, now that we have succeeded in introducing the minimum wage, we were able to exempt it from income tax.</P>
    <P>Some members of the Opposition have been tentatively formulating the bones of a tax policy for the next general election. I have heard a few Members put forward a proposal of a tax free minimum wage as the centrepiece of their policies. My advice to them is to go back to the draw<Col N="1688" /> ing board and think again because I can assure them that will be a reality by the time the next general election is held in 2002.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. My colleague, Senator Dardis, seems to have read my mind in that he has made all the points I want to make. I welcome the Minister to the House and recommend this motion to the House.</P>
      <P>As Senator Dardis said, this motion deals with tax reform. When the Progressive Democrats formulated various policy documents in the months after it was established as a political party in 1985, one of it main planks was reform of the tax system, which was penal at the time. The party suffered much sneering and even more than that from various quarters. Such sneering by other political parties continued for some time and there were few exceptions. However, the Minister for Finance felt strongly that reform of the tax system was the way to proceed. The proof of the benefits of this approach is visible today in the enormous improvement in Exchequer returns on an ongoing basis with the introduction of each measure of tax reduction. As Senator Dardis outlined, whether the reductions were in capital gains tax, income tax or other measures, the major tax reductions introduced in those years have led to an increase in Exchequer returns.</P>
      <P>As a result of such tax reductions, there has been a major improvement in the level of employment. Since April 1997 the numbers of people at work have increased by approximately 270,000 or 280,000. Had that been suggested in a political manifesto before the last election it would have been laughed at, but that is what happens when tax rates are reduced.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis correctly pointed out that reducing the level of tax and introducing a minimum wage must go hand in hand. The contributions of various Members of this House and the other House on the National Minimum Wage Bill make interesting reading, particularly those contributions by members of the Labour Party who felt it did not go far enough. They had five years in which to introduce a national minimum wage but they did not think it worthy. Now that it is being introduced, they do not think it is good enough.</P>
      <P>For far too long those on low wages have been discouraged from working because of the high levels of tax. We are now making significant moves to change this policy and reward people for the work they do. We are tackling the problem of the black economy which existed in the past. This move, coupled with the minimum wage, could make a significant contribution to breaking down the black economy and reducing it to low levels, although there will always be a black economy to some degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of factors must be taken into consideration. There has been a great improvement for many people due to our Celtic tiger economy and sharing the wealth is extremely important. It is interesting that at a time when there is a <Col N="1689" /> suggestion that the national minimum wage should be tax free we read in the newspapers about the enormous incomes directors in one of our major banks awarded themselves last year, at a time when the shares in that bank dropped very significantly. Another significant factor is that directors must declare their income because, if the economy is to move forward, we must have confidence throughout the workforce and everyone must work together as a team. People working as a team is one of the main thrusts of the partnership agreements in the past few years. A football or hurling team may have good individuals but unless players work as a team they will not succeed.</P>
    <P>Many of the people who will benefit from the national minimum wage being tax free are those at the bottom level of the scale in income terms, such as the many young people coming out of school. Many people who are doing transition year in school are getting some experience in the workplace, which is a good thing. However, it concerns me greatly that some of them are being encouraged into the workforce and will miss out on their education. A situation cannot be allowed to develop whereby people are encouraged out of education. We should hold out the carrot to them so that they can get as much education as possible.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House and look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am happy to support the motion which endorses the Fine Gael tax policy. Last September, the Fine Gael spokesman on finance, Deputy Noonan, put forward a set of proposals to radically reform the income tax code at a cost of £2 billion. The proposals Fine Gael put forward focused on the needs of taxpayers and the needs of the economy and were founded on a number of principles. These included the introduction of fair and equitable income tax where the burden of income tax is significantly reduced on low paid and middle income earners and giving back a fair share of the resources available to those people who worked hard and who contributed most to Ireland's current prosperity. One of the main aims of these tax proposals was to increase the number of people available for work by removing the low paid from the tax net and ensuring they had a living wage which would encourage movement from welfare to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main proposals of the Fine Gael tax policy are to introduce a new earned income tax credit by increasing the £1,000 PAYE allowance to £3,600 and allowing all taxpayers, including pensioners and the self-employed, a tax credit of £864. This proposal would have the effect of giving an extra £624 to all taxpayers. In households where both spouses are working, each spouse would benefit. Fine Gael also proposed to increase the personal allowance by £1,000 for a single person and £2,000 for a married couple. This proposal, together with the previous pro<Col N="1690" /> posal of an earned income tax credit, would have the effect of removing all income up to £170 per week from the tax net. These two proposals would have the effect of removing all workers earning up to the minimum wage from the tax net. They would also benefit all taxpayers equally through the use of the tax credit system by giving extra benefits to households where two spouses are working and encourage the participation of women in the workforce.</P>
    <P>The introduction of tax credits would provide an opportunity to begin the integration of the tax and social welfare systems. Fine Gael believes the family income supplement should be used as a pilot project to commence this integration. The move to tax credits opens up the possibility of integrating income tax and social welfare and providing the foundation on which a family income scheme could be built. The first task is to complete the move to tax credits, which the Minister has done. Following this, a programme such as the family income supplement could be delivered more effectively through the tax system rather than through the welfare system. Many people who are eligible for the FIS do not claim it because, in processing their claims, many of their colleagues become aware of their circumstances and their family privacy is undermined. If payment was made by way of a cheque in the post from the Revenue, which would deliver a cash balance to persons whose income was too low to use up all their full tax credits, this difficulty would be overcome and all eligible low paid families would benefit. Fine Gael's tax policy did not seek only to exempt from the tax net those on the minimum wage, but also to improve the lot of the less well off in society, something the last budget failed to do.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House notes the buoyancy in national revenue. There is wonderful revenue buoyancy, particularly in the past three months. We are very fortunate in the surpluses being generated each month by increases in Government revenue. We are at a time when resources are plentiful but there are still many social problems. As well as ensuring everyone is earning the national minimum wage and not liable for tax, we must also face the other social issues. There are 1,500 homeless people in Dublin, 300 of whom were evicted from the private rented sector. Many elderly people are on low incomes and live in the private rented sector with the threat of eviction and an inability to find alternative accommodation hanging over their heads. Anyone who watched &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night got a glimpse of the terrible conditions in which people in urban and rural Ireland live. If the owners of these properties were to sell them, they would benefit from the reduction in capital gains tax, which is a shame, because they do not treat their tenants properly.</P>
    <P>A major contribution to the buoyancy in the national revenue comes from tax on the sales of new cars. However, there is no road space in our cities for all the new cars people are buying. The <Col N="1691" /> motorways are simply delivering cars into urban traffic jams at a greater speed without shortening the overall journey times and the Government has no transport plan.</P>
    <P>Another sad reflection on recent trends in the economy is the growth in social inequality which the Progressive Democrats Party never addressed. I accept inequality exists in every free society and always will, but there is a limit to what is acceptable. A recent UN report on the quality of life found that Ireland has the widest social inequality in the developed world after the United States. The ESRI recently showed that Ireland has the second highest level and fastest rising rate of wage inequality in the OECD. Social inequality in Ireland is most visible in hospital waiting lists. The better off in society have medical insurance and can get medical assistance straight away while the less well off must wait for many years for operations, often disappearing from the waiting list only when they die. Yesterday I heard of a 38 year old man, a transport employee, who had to mortgage his house to finance a heart bypass operation. Is that the kind of society we want?</P>
    <P>At a time of buoyancy in the economy the people deserve better. I support the motion but I also want to see the inequalities, which I have mentioned, addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak in the Seanad on the motion before the House.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline the provisions which have recently been put in place in relation to the national minimum wage and to state clearly the commitments which have been given in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness on the question of removing those on the national minimum wage from the tax net. I will then go on to discuss the Government's record and ongoing programme of tax reform, particularly in relation to the benefits to the lower paid and to set this in the context of the present buoyant economic climate. I will refer to the revenue aspects of removing those on the national minimum wage from the tax net.</P>
      <P>The national minimum wage was introduced with effect from 1 April 2000 and delivers on the Government's commitment to introduce a national hourly minimum wage. The new statutory minimum hourly rate is £4.40, based on a 39 hour week. The Act ensures that thousands of low paid workers will secure an increase in their pay. From that date, every experienced adult worker will be entitled to the national minimum wage of £4.40 per hour, a rate which is equivalent to a minimum weekly wage of £172.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of £4.40 per hour is in line with the recommendations made in the report of the interdepartmental group published in June 1999. This rate was decided on by the Government with a <Col N="1692" /> view to striking the right balance between the need to ensure that vulnerable sectors of the workforce are not exploited and the need to ensure that employment and competitiveness are maintained. Employers will be permitted to pay employees under 18 years of age, first-time job entrants or those undergoing training, specified rates below £4.40 per hour for a defined period. There is also provision for a temporary exemption from the minimum wage in the case of an employer in financial difficulty. This provision is especially important when attempting to encourage business start-ups and may provide new companies with breathing space at a critical stage in their development.</P>
    <P>The social partners, as part of the recently ratified Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, confirmed their support for the Government's commitment to the introduction of the minimum wage and of reducing the tax burden on the low paid. Section 1.1.3 of the new programme states:</P>
    <P>It is an agreed policy objective of the Government and the social partners that, over time, all those earning the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net.</P>
    <P>The pay agreement supports increases in the hourly minimum wage to £4.70 from 1 July 2001 and to £5 from 1 October 2002. I welcome the agreement, contained in the legislation, that no repercussive claims will be made by trade unions or employees as a result of the introduction of the minimum wage. This will help to ensure that certain potential negative effects of wage inflation do not arise.</P>
    <P>By any standards, Irish economic performance in recent years has been remarkable. Real GNP rose by an average of 7.6% per annum from 1994 to 1999. In 1999 it is estimated that real GNP increased by almost 9.9%. Along with this strong growth we have seen unemployment fall below 5% for the first time in a generation. Growth in Ireland is not expected to continue at the rapid pace of recent years. Ireland's potential growth rate over the medium term is judged to be about 5% per annum. This assessment reflects a projected expansion of the labour force of about 2% annually, driven by rising participation rates and a modest degree of net immigration.</P>
    <P>For a small open economy like Ireland, maintaining our competitiveness is essential if such growth is to continue. Moderate pay developments in the context of pro-work and pro-enterprise taxation reform have been central to our success in the 1990s. The most recent of our social partnership agreements, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, is designed to maintain the competitiveness of our economy over the next three years. It will further enhance the incentives to work and to enterprise and will enable Ireland to achieve even further prosperity &ndash; on a sustainable basis. The new partnership <Col N="1693" /> agreement is based on achieving an annual average GNP growth rate of about 5.6% over the period 2000 to 2002. This is in the expectation that there will be ongoing improvements in productivity, that emerging supply side constraints will be overcome and that significant budgetary surpluses will be maintained throughout the period. If economic growth exceeds assumptions, it may be possible to apply additional resources to accelerate progress towards the priority objectives of the programme, including social inclusion. Equally, if growth falls below this level it may be necessary to make more gradual progress. One of the most important elements of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is the agreed wage moderation which is vital in maintaining Ireland's competitiveness on the international front.</P>
    <P>The National Minimum Wage Act responds to the many challenges facing a changing Ireland. This Act, along with a number of other measures, is designed to ensure that all workers partake in the economic boom. In its three budgets to date the Government has removed 176,000 people, including the elderly, on low pay from the tax net thereby reducing the burden of tax on employment and increasing the incentive to take up employment. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will continue to aim for tax provisions in accordance with the objectives of this programme which benefit those on low but taxable incomes.</P>
    <P>Following the introduction of the Social Welfare Act, 2000, all those earning less than £226 per week are exempt from PRSI. As a result, almost 500,000 low paid employees will gain up to £5.67 per week from this month. The earnings limit for exempting employees from the 2% health levy contribution was further increased in the Act to £14,560, the result of which will be to exempt all employees earning up to £280 per week and all self-employed persons earning up to £14,560 per annum from the levy. These improvements are part of the Government's ongoing commitment to reducing the burden of taxation on the lower paid in society.</P>
    <P>As outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium, tax reductions are an integral part of the Government's strategy to maintain and improve competitiveness and to encourage the take up of employment. We intend to achieve these ambitious aims through a balanced strategy of removing more of the low-paid from the tax net altogether, by reducing tax rates, by ensuring that a large majority of taxpayers are subject to no more than the standard rate of income tax and by completing the transition to a more progressive system of tax credits.</P>
    <P>Over the course of the last three budgets, significant progress has been made in regard to these taxation policies. In an effort to encourage the take up of employment, the standard and top rates of tax have been cut by four percentage points since 1998 to 22% and 44% respectively, <Col N="1694" /> thereby actively encouraging people to enter the labour market. I have publicly stated the Government's commitment to reducing the standard rate of income tax to 20% over the next two budgets and the higher rate to 42% and 40% if economic conditions allow.</P>
    <P>The standard rating of the main personal and PAYE allowances in budget 1999 was the first step in the process of moving toward a more equitable system of tax credits. Standard rating equalises the value of personal allowances for all taxpayers, thereby increasing the incentive to return to work. It is my intention to complete the move to a tax credit system by 2001. A tax credit system enables more resources to be devoted to those on lower incomes for a given Exchequer cost by equalising the value of personal tax allowances for all taxpayers at the standard rate, therefore providing an incentive for low-paid persons to return to work.</P>
    <P>Section 1.1.3 of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness states:</P>
    <P>The Government and the social partners regard increases in tax credits and the development of the tax credit system as the priority areas for resources over the course of this Programme.</P>
    <P>Increases in personal allowances over the period 1998-2000 have eased the burden of tax on the low-paid. Personal allowances have been increased by £1,800, single, and £3,600, married, in the period 1998-2000. In the tax year 2000-01 a single person pays no tax on the first £110 of income per week, whereas when this Government came to office a single person entered the tax net at £77. This record far exceeds the achievements of the previous Government in terms of cutting tax on the low-paid, a fact often conveniently overlooked by some commentators.</P>
    <P>The introduction of individualisation in budget 2000 will provide an incentive to enter employment and particularly for married women to re-enter the workforce as they will now face a reduced marginal tax rate upon taking up employment. The first phase of individualisation in budget 2000 has significantly reduced the percentage of taxpayers paying at the higher rate, from 46% to 38%. This radical change in the structure of the standard rate band means that all taxpayers up to and at the average industrial wage will now pay tax at no more than the standard rate. This change, which will remove 125,000 taxpayers from the top rate of tax, will benefit in particular single workers and couples with two incomes and will increase the incentive for second spouses to join the labour force. Upon completion of individualisation the percentage of all income earners on the higher rate will have been reduced to 12%.</P>
    <P>We are often compared to the United Kingdom in terms of the higher tax burden we face on our <Col N="1695" /> earnings. However, as is often the case with such comparisons, the facts are somewhat different. A single person here on £8,000 per annum on PAYE and full rate PRSI has an average tax rate, including PRSI, of 6.3% compared to 12.7% on an income of £8,000 sterling in the UK, even after the recent UK budget. A single person on £12,000 faces an average tax rate of 14% compared with 19% in the UK, on the same income level in sterling terms. I appreciate that an income of £8,000 sterling at the current rate of exchange is something close to £10,000 in punts, but even on this basis the comparative average tax rate here is 9.5% <i>versus</i> 12.7% in the UK.</P>
    <P>In the case of married persons on one income with two children the relevant comparisons are even starker. On £12,000 sterling the UK tax burden is 19%, here it is 12.5% on a £12,000 salary; on £24,000 it is 26% compared with 15% here, and on £30,000 it is 26% compared with 19% here. Again, when allowance is made for the exchange rate difference, the gap narrows but the pattern is the same.</P>
    <P>The difference in the pattern of tax for single and married persons between here and the UK is due to the structure of the tax system. For single persons on income over £20,000 per annum, the UK taxpayer faces lower average tax rates than here. I received limited appreciation last December for my efforts to rectify the tax structure in this regard. However, a recent poll would indicate that the public has a better understanding than some pundits of the advantages that the reform will bring. In addition, the social partners have endorsed the policy as part of the recent Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>People should look at the comparisons between Ireland and the United Kingdom. There is an absence of commentary in this regard. One analyst recently produced figures such as those I have quoted. For the last number of years I have been deafened by some commentators and by some politicians and their allies in the media &ndash; I referred to some of them in glowing terms last week &ndash; claiming that the last few budgets have not dealt fairly with the low paid but have done everything for the higher paid. The reality is that low paid employees are treated far better here than in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The percentage take-out from the pay of people earning amounts up to £20,000 and more, is far lower here than in the United Kingdom. Even after the recent budget of my friend, Gordon Brown, the percentages are still in our favour. In recent years we have achieved lower tax take-outs from the pay of low paid earners here than in the United Kingdom. However, a single person earning £30,000 and more in Ireland is absolutely savaged by the taxation system compared with a high earner in the United Kingdom. Middle incomes earners in this country have been <Col N="1696" /> penalised for many years by our taxation system and this is particularly true of single people. Until my recent budget a single person was paying tax at the top rate on income above £14,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>As outlined in these figures, a married taxpayer does far better here than in the United Kingdom where there is full individualisation. I am merely moving towards widening the standard rate band. In the UK, not alone are there no double bands for married taxpayers but there is only one allowance for all taxpayers, whether married or single. In Ireland a married taxpayer has double the single person's personal allowance.</P>
    <P>In the dark and unenlightened days of the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s our taxation system was the same as that in the United Kingdom. Until the tax year 1980-81 there were many rates of tax but there was no double band for married taxpayers. When Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in power we had taxation rates of up to 77%. At one period there was surtax and for a few years there was a special 10% on top of the tax rate so that the 35% rate became 38.5%, the 45% rate became 49.5% and the 70% rate became 77%. Since income tax was introduced in Ireland and under successive Governments there was no double band for married people.</P>
    <P>I listened to commentators saying that last year's budget was socially regressive and talking about the rights of women in the home. In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, when there was no double band for married people, that was never said. A political decision was taken in the 1980-81 budget to double the tax band for married people. This came as a result of the Murphy judgment but the judgment did not compel the Government to double the bands. The Minister for Finance at the time pointed out repeatedly that the Murphy judgment would cost about £30 million and the additional measure would cost £130 million more. The Opposition successfully got the message across, inside and outside the House, that both measures were the result of the Murphy judgment. Since then it has been assumed that the Minister for Finance is obliged to double the tax band for married taxpayers, but this was never a correct interpretation of the legal implications of the Murphy judgment.</P>
    <P>Two points must be made. First, up to the tax year 1980-81, we had individualisation of the standard rate band, and those are supposed to be the dark days of unenlightenment. That system was changed in my political lifetime. I have been a Deputy since 1977. Senator Doyle came somewhat later. The second point is that tax on low paid workers is less severe here than in the United Kingdom. I am glad to have the opportunity of making those two points again.</P>
    <P>A minimum wage provides an incentive to return to work. This is often overlooked. Unemployed people moving back into work can retain <Col N="1697" /> certain secondary benefits, for example, medical cards, for a period of up to three years subject to an upper salary limit, and can claim back to work tax allowance which would significantly increase their take home pay. The Revenue job assist scheme which I introduced in April 1998 complements a wide range of schemes already available to assist the long-term unemployed back into employment. The scheme is a focused two part initiative that gives employers an incentive to employ a long-term unemployed person as opposed to someone already in the labour market. Under the terms of the scheme the long-term unemployed person also qualifies for a special tax allowance over a three year period.</P>
    <P>The new national minimum wage of £4.40 per hour gives a take-home pay of £4.05 based on the current tax and PRSI system. Before my first budget in 1998 net take-home pay on an hourly wage of £4.40 would have been £3.62.</P>
    <P>The ESRI impact study of March 1999 commissioned by the interdepartmental group on the impact of the national minimum wage includes an estimate of £77 million as the yield of income tax arising from the introduction of the national minimum wage. This figure would not include the impact of the personal taxation measures in budget 2000 nor the higher income levels and the increased numbers at work for the tax year 2000-01, although the combined effect of these is thought unlikely to affect the estimated yield to a significant extent.</P>
    <P>In addition to income tax, there will be secondary effects arising from increased indirect tax receipts as a result of increased disposable income, as well as decreases in yields of corporation tax and self-employed income tax as a result of increased wage costs. It is not possible however to quantify these secondary effects with any degree of accuracy.</P>
    <P>Exempting persons earning the minimum wage of £4.40 per hour or £172 per week from income tax may be achieved through either increasing the basic personal allowances; increasing the PAYE allowance, or raising the income exemption limits. The costs involved would be substantial for whichever method was chosen, particularly when increasing the basic personal allowances because increases in the allowances for single persons would have to be doubled for all married couples and therefore would benefit all taxpayers. The costs would outweigh the additional yield from the introduction of the national minimum wage mentioned above.</P>
    <P>An increase in the personal tax free allowances of approximately £3,200 for single persons and £6,400 for married couples would be required to ensure all persons earning the national minimum wage would be exempt from income tax. This would cost approximately £1,015 million in a full year. Increasing the PAYE allowance to exempt the minimum wage would be less costly as self-<Col N="1698" /> employed persons and their spouses are not entitled to avail of this allowance. In addition, the allowance is not doubled simply because one is married. If this method were used, an increase of approximately £3,200 in the PAYE allowance would be required which would cost around £700 million in a full year. Increasing the PAYE allowance would raise the issue of whether the allowance should be extended to all income earners. On this basis the cost would be £810 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Another approach would be to increase the exemption limits from £4,100 to over £8,900 for single persons and from £8,200 to over £17,800 for married couples. An increase in the age exemption limits for those aged 65 and over of more than £1,400 for single persons and £2,800 for married couples would also be required. This approach would cost far less but would create its own problems. It would put an enormous number of people back into the marginal relief system where the marginal tax rate is 40% and exacerbate the problems of poverty and employment traps for those wishing to return to work or earn more income. The marginal relief system was condemned by the working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems in 1994 on these grounds and we do not want to go down that route again.</P>
    <P>Exempting the national minimum wage from income tax through increases in tax allowances would be the preferred approach. This course of action was endorsed by the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems and by successive Governments as it would help to eliminate poverty traps over time.</P>
    <P>The Government has not just spoken about removing the low paid from the tax net and reducing the burden of tax on lower incomes. It has acted on these promises and the House can look forward to further action in this respect in delivering on our commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is noble that the Minister would aim to reduce income tax. There is a view that those on the left wing of Irish politics might have a difficulty with this. They are being seriously misunderstood. For many years PAYE taxpayers have been conducting a huge campaign to ensure they get a fair deal. There is much confusion however on how the situation in respect of income tax can be improved. There has always been tension on whether it is better to widen the tax bands or reduce the tax rates. It is far sexier for Governments to reduce the tax rates as it fits in neatly in a headline in the tabloids but for any group of workers widening the tax bands is far more attractive. I commend this approach to the Minister. That is not to say however that there is an objection to reducing the tax rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> The Fine Gael Party argued in its policy document published last year that there may be a good case for introducing a third tax band. This may develop if we were to proceed along the lines of the motion tabled by the Progressive Democrats, which is both reasonable and fair and restates one of the objectives of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in the section dealing with income tax, that the Government should seek to remove from the tax net all those earning less than the national minimum wage. This is a view which has been articulated by the Tánaiste on a number of occasions and by other members of the Government, including the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is hugely important to the 500,000 workers who in the last two months have accepted the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that action is taken on this basis. I am assuming that the Minister lent his support to the motion and is therefore restating what is contained in the programme. There was more than one doubting Thomas when it was presented to workers. Many said that it would not be implemented. It is crucially important to those who put it together, including the social partners, that it is seen to take effect. This is a hugely important motion. Many workers earning far more than the minimum wage were of the view that the commitment in the programme to those on low earnings was not strong enough.</P>
    <P>On a rough calculation those earning more than £112 per week find themselves in the tax net. By raising the threshold to approximately £170 per week there would be approximately a further £60 tax free income. This would represent an improvement of approximately £25 or £26 per week in the take-home pay of those on very low wages. This would be hugely significant. For those earning £180 per week gross this would compare to a 15% pay increase on top of the commitments contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I urge Senators on the Government side of the House not to let go of this issue which should be raised at parliamentary party meetings and on which they would have the support of this side of the House. I have not costed this proposal&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government gave a commitment for tax reform which will, in effect, give back approximately £1.5 billion to the taxpayer. <Col N="1700" /> This would bring the Government two-thirds of the way towards meeting its commitment. There have been continuing meetings to deal with the programme throughout the country and people said the Government would not pay back the money. In the middle of voting, people said this was just a cover-up and that the Government was including the terms of budget 2000. It took the trade union movement, the employers' movement and the Government, acting together over a weekend, to say it did not. This still causes difficulty for some people.</P>
      <P>The reason I am stressing the point is that one may think motions such as this are not important. This is crucially important to those of us who have to explain these programmes to workers on the ground. This is a local issue and I ask Members to make it clear to people in their local areas that this is a commitment. If this commitment is delivered on, is put in place and is seen to be effective, it will also be seen to be progress. We will be required to have a clear marker in the next budget and raise the tax threshold from approximately £112 to £180, or slightly more than that. It is important that this will be marked and that, at the end of the year, the Minister, in his budget programme, should give recognition of our commitment to the objective of the programme and should tell people just how far we will get towards it this year. Not one worker or fair minded person would object to a commitment that this will be given priority. I say this even though teachers will not benefit. Any teacher would say that this is the way forward and it is our first priority.</P>
      <P>As a Legislature and as public representatives our statement should be that this is where our priorities lie. We should stress that not all of society is selfish; we have still time to look after the people at the bottom of the pile. As far as workers go, the implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is of major importance to those who negotiated the tax aspect.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, to the House and the enlightening statement from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. I compliment my colleagues, Senators Dardis, Gibbons, Keogh and Quill, in tabling this motion. It gives us an opportunity to debate and evaluate the major contribution by the Government to improve conditions for workers. For many years the Minister for Finance has been an exponent &ndash; as has been the Tánaiste &ndash; of a low tax regime. That has proved to be a success and I compliment the Minister for Finance and the Government on their achievements to date. I compliment the Minister for Finance on what he said tonight. It indicates that the Government intends to continue down the road of providing further relief, in particular for those <Col N="1701" /> in the low paid sectors, and that everyone will be treated fairly and will get a fair crack of the whip.</P>
      <P>In having a new national agreement with the social partners it is worth contrasting the state of the nation prior to 1987 when Fianna Fáil first put the model in place. This was after Dr. Garret FitzGerald's Administration of 1982-87 in which Deputies John Bruton and Quinn were Ministers with senior economic portfolios. At that time inflation was as high as 21% and current borrowing was 8% of GNP with £1 being borrowed for every £1 earned.</P>
      <P>Emigration was at its highest level since the 1950s with unemployment at 16%. The only response of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties was to raise personal tax rates from 40% to 65%. In early 1987, we had a higher foreign debt <i>per capita </i>than Poland and Brazil while the <i>The Times</i> famously wrote that the international money lenders were going to &ldquo;pull down the shutters on Ireland.&rdquo;  A crucial ingredient of today's new found economic success has been the social consensus which began in 1987 under the then Fianna Fáil Government with the first of the new comprehensive national agreements.</P>
      <P>The social partnership approach produced a much needed recovery from the disastrous early and mid-1980s and underpinned a sustained period of growth since. That has been continued by this Government over the past three budgets. The first consensus deal was ultimately successful and, appropriately, named the Programme for National Recovery. It was agreed between the Fianna Fáil Government and the social partners in 1987. The national agreement was based on the strategy for development of the National Economic and Social Council, the tripartite think tank of the social partners where policy is analysed and consensus is formed.</P>
      <P>The deal achieved trade union support for a radical correction of the public finances. The national debt had peaked that year. The then Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, thus decided to tackle the growing fiscal crisis and to clean up the mess left by the Fine Gael-Labour Administration. This was done with some success. I compliment the then leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Alan Dukes, for what was known as the Tallaght strategy. His statement will always be looked on favourably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Fianna Fáil Party and those in Government have always acknowledged his contribution, his own party has not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The OECD which compiles regular reports on each of its 29 member countries noticed the improvement in the Irish economy at an early stage in its 1988-89 report. In its 1991 report it gave the reasons for the improvement saying <Col N="1702" />&ldquo;this good performance owes much to the broadly based consensus which has allowed maco-economic policies to focus on the medium term.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It said that the policy commitments of the 1987 Programme for National Recovery had been carried out &ndash; something which had not taken place prior to that. This had marked beneficial effects on interest rates and business confidence. It listed improvements in investment, productivity, profits, low inflation and growth at almost 5% for the previous two years. The attitude to social partnership in its embryonic phase contrasted starkly between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The new agreements ensured the trade unions had a say on tax matters and on many other aspects of the economy and society, including fiscal policy, and their views on the exchange rate policy were, at least, noted. The current Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, then Minister for Labour, played a vital role at this time and it was his job to keep the trade unions in the loop and stabilise industrial relations &ndash; a job he did successfully. The same can be said for the present agreement.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the comments of Senator O'Toole. He is re-echoing what he said on the day of the budget and subsequently on another occasion when he spoke on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, on which I compliment him. While he is an active trade unionist on behalf of the members of the INTO he has looked on the national agreement as being of national importance. He has reiterated and re-emphasised that again tonight.</P>
    <P>If we were to look at the differences then, Kieran Mulvey, one of the negotiators on the union side, recalled that the Taoiseach &ldquo;was the cement in the deal because of his extensive union contacts and the amount of ground work that he had done. He seemed to grow with the negotiations. He was a natural negotiator. He was prepared to put in the hours and, most importantly, it was and still is very hard to have a row with Bertie Ahern.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In contrast to this was Deputy John Bruton's attitude. He was not an enthusiastic supporter of the new social partnership approach. He was horrified that employer and union leaders could go to Government Buildings and put their case on taxation and welfare. He remarked critically at one juncture that there was another parliament outside Dáil Éireann making real decisions about the economy.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government is to be complimented on its achievements in the last three budgets. I have no doubt that the Minister for Finance will respond in a positive manner to the requests made by Senator Dardis and his colleagues. We cannot give a commitment tonight that the Minister will go the full distance in providing a further £1,000 million in tax cuts for low paid workers. However, he has given a commitment to continue down that road in order that their position will be improved.</P>
      <P>It is a sign of the times that we have a £1 billion surplus in the first three months of the financial year. If I had time I would compare some of the current social inclusion measures to those we had in the past under different Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators would be disappointed if I did not welcome the motion on behalf of women. Women's pay remains at between 70% and 75% of the average male industrial wage despite the fact that equal pay legislation has been in place for over 30 years. Single women, although being paid less, are taxed at the same rate as single men. The implementation of such legislation would be of enormous benefit to them. Married women frequently pay taxes at the higher rate because of the incomes earned by their husbands. I welcomed the introduction of individualisation in the budget.</P>
      <P>We should assist the Progressive Democrats to promote this motion, as they must do, which is extremely important because those who have least would benefit most. I am quite sure that is what everyone wants. The price may seem high but we have all been told to party and we do not wish to see some groups left as Cinderellas.</P>
      <P>The Minister made comparisons between tax rates here and abroad. We must be careful because local tax rates can sometimes make the UK situation look even worse. Services need to be taken into account and there is a great deal more to be done here with regard to services before we compare stark tax rates between countries. I welcome the motion which I hope the Progressive Democrats will promote in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the national minimum wage was a social policy commitment placed in the framework of an assault on exclusion, marginalisation and poverty. It protects those workers who are prone to exploitation, particularly women and young people. The legislation, which came into force on 1 April, affects 163,000 workers. The legislation was introduced to protect employees from exploitation by employers and we must now ensure that the State does not exploit them. I have every confidence that the Minister for Finance will ensure that the less well off will retain the money they are now <Col N="1704" /> earning. The Minister said last week that he is giving them back their own money.</P>
      <P>This Government was the first to tackle real tax reform, to improve the position of all taxpayers and increase the take home pay of those covered by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, especially those on below average earnings. Tax benefits have been delivered by the current Government through increased personal tax credits, widening the standard tax bands and a reduction in the rates at which tax is levied.</P>
      <P>The standard rate of tax was pitched at 26% when this Government took office. That rate has now dropped to 22% for the current tax year. The Minister has given a commitment to reduce that rate to 20% before its term of office expires. The higher rate has decreased from 48% when the rainbow coalition was in office to its current rate of 44%. The Minister also hopes to reduce that rate to 42% and possibly 40% in the lifetime of this Government, leaving our tax rates similar to those in Great Britain. I never envisaged, as a practising accountant dealing with cross-Border workers only three years ago, that we could reach such a position.</P>
      <P>Personal tax credits will increase from £2,900 for a single person in 1997-98 to £4,700 in 2000-01. Self-employment deduction allowances have increased from £800 to £1,000, resulting in a single person having to earn £110 per week before they enter the tax net. Tax bands have been widened from £9,900 for a single person in 1997-98 to £17,000 in the 2000-01 tax year. Exemption limits have also been increased, although I do not believe this is a good way to effect tax reform because the system can be complex and many taxpayers do not understand it.</P>
      <P>The Government and the social partners regard increases in tax credits and the development of the tax credit system as priority areas for resources over the period of the PPF. They are committed to removing, over time, all those earning below the minimum wage from the tax net. For many years there has been a belief that it was economically more favourable to remain on social welfare than to enter the workforce. The Government set about changing this attitude by introducing additional tax free allowances and child tax allowances for the long-term unemployed. A tapering personal tax credit allowance, over a three year period, was introduced. I am not sure if this has been effective because it is a complex system and many employers do not understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In taking minimum wage earners out of the tax system, I would recommend the introduction of a personal tax credit system rather than an exemption one. The tax credit system is simpler and easier to understand. If we were to operate an exemption system, whereby the taxpayer receives his personal tax credit, many employers would operate the tax free allowance system which <Col N="1705" /> would deduct tax at source. A person might be entitled to a tax refund at the end of the year and because of ignorance of the system and the fact that Revenue does not normally review low earners' individual PAYE returns annually many would lose the tax to the State.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the Minister to increase the personal tax credits rather than introducing exemption levels. Personal credits would have to be increased to £170 per week or approximately £8,000 and the self-employment deduction would have to be increased to £1,000 to ensure all those earning the minimum wage would remain outside the tax net.</P>
    <P>The low paid have suffered for years. They never affected industrial peace because they did not have the leadership of a union, as have many other sectors. I read in the newspapers in the last week that the ASTI is seeking a 30% wage increase. It disappeared from the ICTU shortly before the conclusion of the partnership agreement. It is insisting that if it does not get its way it will disrupt State examinations. That would be disgraceful and I hope it pulls back from those threats. Articles have appeared in the newspapers recently to the effect that the general treasurer of another teachers' union is seeking 30% under benchmarking. Ironically, the general secretary, who is a Member of this House, has not said much about it because he was very effective in negotiating the PPF.</P>
    <P>We hear about inflation fears and that huge wage increases will caution inflation, especially increases to the middle and higher income earners. People getting the minimum wage will not cause any damage because their wages are normally spent at home on necessities, not on foreign holidays or in other ways that would increase inflation.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years we have made changes to corporate taxation. The rate of tax on service in industrial companies will be reduced to 12.5% by 2003. It is not a lot to ask the Minister to ensure that people on the minimum wage are taken out of the tax net. There are many people I wish to speak about, such as those who are socially marginalised, widows, carers and pensioners. I hope the Minister will fulfil some of the commitments he gave during the social partnership negotiations.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to buoyancy in the economy. There has been a £1 billion surplus in the first quarter of this year. It has been stated that the surplus for the full year is likely to exceed the forecasted amount by £500 million. The wealth that has now been created in our economy is reflected in the £270 million that has been collected through VRT in the first quarter of this year. The Department of Finance has indicated that it expects the surplus for the year to reach £2 billion. I would not be surprised if it reached £2.5 billion even after it spends £3 billion on <Col N="1706" /> improving the country's infrastructure. I hope the Government will allocate more money to improve secondary roads as Senator Burke wishes. We all agree with him about secondary roads.</P>

We should not give people earning £15,000 per year the same tax reduction as home helps. For far too long semi-State and State bodies paid between £2.60 and £4 per hour while criticising everyone else for not paying more. It is important that we get the facts right.

That is not the way we should be thinking. I am not saying people should not have to pay 20% tax. I am not saying that PRSI should not be paid on the first £200. It is only right and proper that should be the case. However, that does not help the person on £40,000 or £50,000. I want to look after the person who does not make £20,000 a year. The motion states that everyone will get the benefit of £4.40 an hour.</P>

      <P>Why was this motion tabled this evening since it is only a couple of weeks since we debated the Social Welfare Bill with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs? In response to my query, he categorically stated that by the end of 2002 he would remove all people on the national minimum wage from the tax net.

      <P>The national wage agreement states that it is an agreed policy objective of the Government and the social partners that over time all those earning the national minimum wage will be removed from the tax net. However, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs said he will do it if he is Minister in 2002. Perhaps the lines of communication will be kept open with the Progressive Democrats so that people know what is going on in the coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has taken a long time to get to this stage. The National Minimum Wage Commission was <Col N="1711" /> set up in July 1997 and it recommended that the minimum wage should be two thirds of the average industrial wage. However, that is not the case.</P>

      <P>Considering the amount of money in Exchequer funds, it is scandalous that we cannot give more money to the less well off.</P>
      <P>The national minimum wage is not a basic wage because shift premiums, service charges, gratuities, tips and bonuses are taken into account. Persons between the ages of 18 and 20 will not get the minimum wage. The large number of restrictions in relation to the payment of the minimum wage is unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The minimum wage does not apply to a family business, whether it is a farm or other business, so family members can be exploited. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment did not have time to discuss amendments to this effect in the Seanad, although she indicated she would be interested in addressing that point.</P>
      <P>It is unsatisfactory that a person will pay tax on a weekly wage of £170. Almost £70 of a person's earnings will be taxed. I am glad the Progressive Democrats tabled this motion. It is important that the minimum wage is exempt from tax.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that 163,000 people will benefit from the national minimum wage, which is approximately 10% of the workforce. If £5 an hour was given from 1 April 2000, I am sure more than 200,000 people would benefit, which would be approximately one sixth or one seventh of the workforce. I hope the Government continues to help those on low incomes rather than accepting the views of the Minister for Finance that tax relief should be given disproportionately to the better off.</P>
      <P>The tax rate paid by people on the minimum wage is similar to that paid by the corporate sector. By 2002, corporation tax will be down to 12.5% but people on the minimum wage will be paying 22% tax. I welcome the motion&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;crying about the situation in regard to tax. I would have been in even greater outer darkness with a much smaller voice saying some of the same things. I recall, as I am sure the Minister does, very vividly that at the time we were threatened with the most appalling vistas, including the reduction in services, reductions in social welfare payments and that the country would go to rack and ruin if tax rates were reduced. That was the orthodoxy of the time propounded by people on those benches, by eminent economists and almost universally.</P>
      <P>To be fair to the Minister, he was one of the very few people at the time who said that if we reduce taxes, revenue will increase, we will have the capacity to do more for people who require more to be done for them and we will reduce the numbers on social welfare because there will be more people in the workforce. What he said has turned out to be true. He is the one who had the courage to go ahead and do it.</P>

      <P>There has been confusion about these figures. They were enunciated very clearly in the Minister's speech and I do not intend to repeat them. I agree with the option he chose as being the most desirable in regard to achieving this objective. He said that exempting the minimum wage from income tax through increases in tax allowances is the preferred approach. As I said in my opening remarks, which were confirmed by the Minister, the potential cost of doing this is over £1 billion. That causes people to be frightened until they recall that the tax package in the last budget was over £1 billion. It is quite possible, in the context of the revenue available to the Government, to do this over the period of two budgets. That is what we suggest and what will be achieved.</P>
      <P>I had an unusual experience this week when I met a taxpayer who said he had got £25 per week more this week as a result of the last budget. He said he was not so sure he needed it.</P>
