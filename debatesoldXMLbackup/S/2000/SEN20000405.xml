      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to clarify when the social economy programmes will be initiated; how the programmes will operate in practice; and the implications these programmes will have for the numbers engaged in community employment schemes.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Lanigan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the extraordinary lack of investment in industry in Kilkenny, particularly in the light of a recent company closure there and the further loss of 45 more jobs.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, statements on the crisis in Mozambique, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of other Members not to exceed 15 minutes; No. 2, Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill, 1998 [<i>Dáil</i>] &ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 3 p.m. and to conclude today; business will be interrupted from 1.30 p.m. to 3 p.m.; and No. 18, motion No. 17, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with today's Order of Business. In view of the fact that we seem to be light on legislation this week &ndash; we are only taking Report Stage of one Bill in a three day sitting, although I welcome the opportunity to have debates on issues &ndash; will the Leader indicate the legislation he believes will be taken in <Col N="1486" /> the House between now and the end of the session? Will he guarantee that Ministers will not come in here on the last few days indicating that all Stages of a Bill must be cleared or the world will collapse? We must be able to examine legislation in an ordered way, especially the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, an important Bill for which time will be needed to tease out the serious issues involved.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader make time available for a discussion on the whole area of arts and culture? Serious issues have arisen in this area, including the unsettled nature of the Arts Council; the future of broadcasting, on which many views will be expressed; and the point raised yesterday, namely, the danger to a part of our heritage due to the collapse of buildings in the Phoenix Park and the need to ensure that all archives in the custody of the State are properly housed. I would welcome the opportunity to have a debate on this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should welcome the budget surplus and should ask the Government how it intends using the money. People should be reassured that this money will allow the Government to implement the commitments on taxation and to address the problem of inflation. The Government should indicate its intention in that regard. I look forward to a debate on that in the House and I ask the Leader to arrange it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We should welcome the budget surplus. Such a buoyant surplus is tremendous at this time of the year &ndash; it is almost four times what it was this time last year. It is puzzling, however, that the mandarins in the Department of Finance estimate that the returns at the end of the year will have increased by half a billion pounds when they have already increased by that amount. I would have thought a reasonable expectation would be a surplus at least in excess of £2 billion, and perhaps even as much as £4 billion. I echo what Senator O'Toole said. This is a matter we should discuss because many areas need to be addressed, none more than the infrastructural aspect. We have massive traffic congestion in this city yet public transport is given the minimum amount of investment, and many other areas need to be addressed to ensure we have enough buses to run on the quality bus corridors. We have heard a lot about the Luas project but it has not been&mdash;</P>

      <P>We must not pre-empt the debate which has been sought, Senator Costello.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is ample reason for a good debate. As Senator Manning said, we seem to be a little light on legislative matters and perhaps this is an issue that would bring the Minister for Finance into the House so that we can ask him what he intends to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> I reiterate the point I made yesterday on a debate on health. The Leader of the House indicated he would be interested in facilitating such a debate but considering the publication of a very fine Labour Party document on the matter, will he give us some indication as to when the debate might take place?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

      <P>It is nice to be in the position of worrying how to spend money, not how to generate the income. In that context it would be useful to debate these issues. I commend the Minister for Finance for making the explicit statement yesterday that income tax rates will continue to fall by a cumulative level of 10%.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with my colleagues who have welcomed the surplus of £1 billion. I support the call for a debate with the Minister for Finance. I would be ashamed to be a member of a Government that has a surplus of £1 billion while we have the worst infrastructure and health services in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Opposition and the Independents are complimenting the Minister for Finance and the Government on the excellent state of the public finances. The first thing we must do is ensure that we pay off the national debt that was doubled by a particular Government in the late 1980s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be useful to have a debate on the healthy state of the State's finances. I am very pleased, as is Senator Dardis, that the Minister for Finance indicated yesterday that the Government would honour any commitments given in the agreement reached with the social partners over the past weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the decision made by the Government or the ESB to locate two new power stations in the midlands, one in Shannonbridge and another in Lanesboro. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to ask the ESB what types of materials will be used in these power stations? There are serious implications for counties Offaly, Roscommon and Longford if peat is not used. The material to be used has not been made clear in the statement. Will the Leader establish whether these will be milled peat power stations so that we can assure the hundreds of workers in the midlands currently employed by Bord na Móna on its bogs that they will continue to have jobs? Can the Leader also find out if it is intended to use gas that may be <Col N="1489" /> piped through that region in a link-up between Galway and Dublin?  </P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call to have the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Island present for a debate. I am particularly concerned at the lack of archaeologists in Dúchas. We have unprecedented growth and infrastructural developments, but developers are putting our national monuments at risk. I can cite three examples of monuments in the Limerick area that have been effectively demolished by developers in their zeal to pursue building. If we have to wait for archaeologists then it will be too late for our monuments. I ask that Dúchas be allowed to increase its number of archaeologists. I also ask for the Minister to come here so that we can ensure our national monuments are not obliterated as a result of progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Leader to contact the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and ask him to expedite proposed legislation to enable our naval vessels to arrest fishing vessels outside the 12 mile limit. A recent announcement stated that this matter is with the Attorney General. This is a most serious matter because our fishermen are being attacked, particularly by marauding Spanish vessels. Their gear has been cut and vessels have been rammed. Over a year ago a life was lost when a vessel was rammed off the coast of west Cork. It is ludicrous that our vessels cannot arrest marauding Spanish vessels outside the 12 mile limit. I have a keen interest in this area and I urge the Leader to introduce this legislation early in the next term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if he has any information about the future prospects of the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999. Last week he undertook to find out what was happening in relation to it.</P>
      <P>I suggest we have a debate on competition policy. I compliment the vintners, particularly Senator Bohan, on their success in preserving the capital assets of the licensed trade by not allowing any more licences to be issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's points can be made when the Bill comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We need a comprehensive competition policy. Instead we are getting a competition policy for the public sector. While private vested interests in the legal profession, the licensed trade and many other areas are protected, the public sector is being lectured on a weekly basis about the need to be competitive. There is a need for a coherent competition policy, not one designed to bash around the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Labour Party's conversion to the competitive market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week a report called Food-Agri 2010 was published and the consequences of <Col N="1490" /> it are very far reaching for rural Ireland and Ireland in general. It would be important for this House to have an input into a debate on this matter and I ask the Leader to provide time for such a debate.  </P>

      <P>It is a welcome development regarding a matter which was discussed in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also call for a debate on the NRA. There are marvellous roadworks being carried out around the country, but it is important to have a debate on the concept of road development and how it impacts on small rural businesses, especially those <Col N="1491" /> situated along those roads. Rural development is an important issue. A more flexible approach to road development could be adopted by the relevant local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senators on the number of magnificent contributions made on the statements on litter yesterday. That was very heartening, given the number of Senators who sought a debate on this issue over the past months.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning inquired about the legislation to be taken between now and the Easter recess. Three Bills will be initiated in the House in that time. Second Stage of the Electronic Commerce Bill, 2000, will be taken on Friday, 14 April, by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. The Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill, 2000, will be taken the following week, Holy Week, along with Second Stage of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning and Jackman called for a debate with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands on the future of broadcasting and other aspects of arts and culture. I hope to arrange that for immediately after the Easter recess.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Dardis, Burke, Finneran and Costello welcomed the budget surplus for the first three months of the year announced yesterday. I join in that welcome and would have no problem in putting time aside for a debate on it. There were one million people working in the country in 1990 and today there are 1.7 million people working, with 45,000 people returning in each of the past three years. Most of Senator Burke's concerns are addressed in our national development plan, which serves, in particular&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a wish list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a factual list. We understand that it might not be possible for the Senator to agree with it all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> Senator Finneran raised the issue of the two new power stations at Ferbane and Lanesboro. I will pass on his concerns to the Minister and try to find out the type of fuel that will be used in those stations. I hope, like the Senator, that it will be milled peat.</P>
    <P>I will pass on Senator O'Donovan's views to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. Senator Ryan raised the issue of the telecommunications Bill. I told the House last week that I would find out about it. I am meeting the Minister after the Order of Business today and I will return to the House on this matter on tomorrow's Order of Business.</P>
    <P>I will allow time for a debate on the agri-food report raised by Senator Callanan. I will pass Senator Hayes's views to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn called for a debate on the National Roads Authority. This is a very timely request, given the amount of work to be done over the next seven years on improving our road infrastructure. I will allow time for a debate on this at the earliest possible opportunity, especially in relation to small businesses because I know the Senator has received many inquiries about that aspect. While an improved road infrastructure is fantastic, it should not be done at the cost of dividing parishes, particularly small rural parishes.</P>
    <P>Senator John Cregan inquired about the groceries order. Both sides of both Houses are in total agreement that if it is not retained rural life will become completely diminished and we can do away with our rural development plan and our Minister with responsibility for rural development. I can say as Leader of this House that we are in agreement this must not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and I, as Minister of State, welcome this opportunity to update the Seanad on the current situation in Mozambique. I have just returned from the landmark summit meeting in Cairo between the Heads of State and Government of the European Union and all the African countries. At that meeting we were able to meet with the representatives of Mozambique and discuss with them the measures which need to be taken for reconstruction and long-term sustainable development to help prevent such disasters in the future. President Chissano was very conscious of what Ireland had been able to do so far and expressed his thanks to the Government, Irish NGOs and the people of Ireland. The Taoiseach, for his part, and I were able to assure President Chissano of our personal, genuine, long-term commitment to supporting the rehabilitation effort and to working with Mozambique to ensure it gets back on track quickly to continue its successful programme of economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> Since the flooding, Ireland Aid has been at the forefront of international efforts to provide aid to the victims of this disaster and continued, meaningful, long-term support to the government of Mozambique. I am happy to report that the relief operation has been successful overall. The situation is stabilising. Ireland Aid has contributed a total of £2,365,000 to the relief effort and our support is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The initial rescue phase, which caught the attention of the world as pictures of people stranded on trees and roof tops flashed across our television screens, is now over. Rescue operations are now completed. The relief agencies and donors have moved into the second phase of the operation. Approximately 250,000 people are housed in camps and collective centres. With our assistance, aid agencies are providing shelter, clean water, basic sanitation, food and basic health care to these people, but there are many more people in need. This year's harvest has literally been swept away and even those who did not lose their homes are without food. Currently, 463,000 people, including the displaced and those who have been isolated, are receiving food aid. Airlifts of food and other emergency items are arriving daily.</P>
    <P>As the waters recede, the relief operation is moving into a resettlement and rehabilitation phase, helping the displaced return to their towns and villages and start rebuilding their homes and lives. In addition, roads and bridges are being repaired so that people can go home. We are monitoring the progression of the cyclone Hudah, which is at present over Madagascar. However, at this stage, heavy rain is not expected to hamper the relief efforts and we hope, for all concerned, that the work will not be interrupted.</P>
    <P>While the imperative was to complete our rescue efforts and meet the short-term needs of the people of Mozambique, we are now actively pursuing our medium and long-term commitments. We will not allow the remarkable progress Mozambique has made in recent years to be simply washed away. Much thought and planning is going into this phase of the operation. My Department is working closely with the government of Mozambique, the UN and international donors on guidelines for both reconstruction and future development.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been to the fore in international relief efforts. I would state, however, that the international humanitarian response to the Mozambique disaster from Western countries and the southern African region has been unprecedented. There has been some criticism of the slowness of the response by the international community to the crisis. While there is always room for improvement, it should be noted that the sheer scale of the devastation took everyone by surprise.</P>
    <P>As I outlined in my previous address to the Seanad at the beginning of March, there were three distinct events which resulted in the devastating scale of this disaster. Torrential rains in <Col N="1494" /> February were exacerbated by the arrival of the cyclone Eline towards the end of the month. This resulted in pressure on the dams in other countries upstream. What had until then been a severe but manageable crisis escalated into a major humanitarian emergency. At this stage it became clear that more helicopters, personnel and boats would be needed as whole communities became isolated, cut off by rising flood waters in the southern and central provinces of Mozambique.</P>
    <P>Governments around the world did respond at this point, but it took time to mobilise troops and military equipment and to transport them thousands of miles to the affected areas. The South African Air Force, as Mozambique's neighbour, was available on the ground much quicker and performed Trojan work in rescuing stranded people from trees and rooftops. Although Ireland AID had no helicopters to send, we helped to fund their rescue efforts. Military personnel, planes and helicopters did come from the UK, the United States, Portugal, France and Spain and were sent to bolster the South Africans' commendable efforts.</P>
    <P>If the response was delayed, it did not mean that it was insufficient. On 23 February the UN launched an initial appeal for $13.5 million. Since then, a total of over $118 million has been received. The additional moneys can now be used to fund UN programmes to target basic needs and rehabilitation activities over the next six months.</P>
    <P>If there had not been such an effective response from both the Irish aid agencies present on the ground, as well as from donor Governments and NGOs around the world, the loss of life would have been much more cruel. Ireland Aid's response was immediate, practical and focused. Our embassy in Maputo alerted us to the problems resulting from the initial rains at the beginning of February and took the initiative of organising an aerial survey of the province of lnhambane where some of our major projects are located. The survey, conducted in order to assess the situation and the level of response required, was the first to be carried out in this area.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, our embassy staff and a medical expert, provided special briefings to other donors such as the World Food Programme, Médecins Sans Frontières and Save the Children Fund, sharing with our partners Ireland Aid's in-depth knowledge and expertise of the country and the particular areas that had been devastated.</P>
    <P>In response to the initial flooding and on the advice of our embassy, we made the first emergency allocation of £160,000. The money was provided to the World Food Programme towards the cost of their air-bridge operation in lnhambane province. Money was also provided to Concern, one of the Irish agencies operational on the ground in Mozambique, for an emergency relief project in Maputo, with a view to providing assistance to the most vulnerable people.</P>
    <P>In the wake of cyclone Eline, the scale of the flooding reached a new and devastating scale. <Col N="1495" /> Ireland Aid responded swiftly; a further £540,000 was allocated and provided to the World Food Programme, both for emergency supplies and for the rescue operation being carried out by the South African Air Force. The Irish NGOs, GOAL and Concern, also received funding to support their excellent emergency humanitarian work.</P>
    <P>While the emergency response is concerned with the immediate issues of saving and protecting in lives, it can never be more than a quick-fix solution. Ireland can really make a difference with financial support is in the area of prevention. As Senators will know, Mozambique is a priority country for Irish Government development aid. The budget allocation this year is £7.4 million, up from £6.4 million last year. I have asked my Department to administer programme expenditure with maximum flexibility to help Mozambique to deal with the consequences of this emergency.</P>
    <P>Already £1 million has been reallocated to be used for reconstruction and recovery activities. A further £650,000 was reallocated from a health sector support programme and was used to buy essential medicines and vaccines to prevent outbreaks of cholera and other water-borne diseases.</P>
    <P>On a positive note, as the flood waters continue to subside it is clear that we will continue with much of our established Ireland Aid programme in lnhambane. We are looking at several options to see where we can best add value to this long-term rehabilitation process. In particular, we are looking at a number of road rehabilitation projects, repairing the damage to infrastructure caused by the flooding and, literally, helping to pave the way to future economic growth. This part of the operation must be seen as a joint effort between the international donors and the Mozambican authorities. All consultation and planning is being a carried out in co-operation with the central and local Government to ensure that the best interests of local communities are met.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason that Mozambique suffered such devastating effects as a result of the rains and cyclones is because the country is still underdeveloped and does not have the capacity to cope with anything out of the ordinary. The key issue in preventing the loss of life and devastation caused by natural disasters is the elimination of poverty. Poverty eradication is the umbrella of Ireland Aid policy. Development co-operation and assistance must focus on long-term sustainable development. We are aiming to empower countries to cope better with these crises when they hit. The long-term focus of our priority country programme in Mozambique, for example, is to address the fundamental problem and not just its immediate symptoms.</P>
    <P>Reconstruction and reducing vulnerability will also be the focus of the donor co-ordination meeting being convened in Rome at the end of April. A framework for sustainable recovery and <Col N="1496" /> vulnerability reduction in Mozambique has been prepared by the UN development programme in consultation with the Mozambican Government and will be presented at the Rome meeting.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also provided assistance to Mozambique through our membership of the European Union. The European Commission is making approximately 25 million euros available for emergency aid and short to medium-term rehabilitation of the worst affected areas. Over 4 million euros are being channelled through ECHO, the European Community Humanitarian Office, with 21 million euros earmarked for rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>With a view to longer-term assistance the Commission intends to increase funding under the European Development Fund from 100 million euros in 1999 to 150 million euros this year. Ireland will pledge its full support for these initiatives at European level.</P>
    <P>I am acutely aware of the serious constraints on developments that heavy external debt repayments impose on Mozambique. The Government has been vocal in calling for accelerated debt relief for Mozambique. Ireland Aid has contributed $5 million to Mozambique's debt relief programme. Mozambique's total external public debt exceeds $5 billion at today's values. After implementation of debt relief plans, including the enhanced highly indebted poor countries initiative, it should fall to less than $1 billion. Nevertheless, while these initiatives are welcome, there is a compelling case for the cancellation of all Mozambique's external debt. I welcome the recent announcements by the UK, France and Spain to cancel Mozambique's debt to them. I also welcome the decision by the Paris Club of bilateral creditor nations to defer Mozambique's debts service payments to the group. We would encourage other bilateral donors to take similar action at international fora.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to assure the House that while the television cameras and reporters may have moved on, Ireland Aid is still present in Mozambique. We are there to stay as long as we are needed. Ireland Aid is committed to our partnership with the people and Government of Mozambique. We will continue to work with them to recover from this disaster.</P>
    <P>With your permission, a Chathaoirligh, I would like to mention another critical matter, that is our aid programme to Ethiopia which is another priority country for Government development aid. Drought has led to serious food shortages which could affect over 12 million people. Ethiopia is expected to be the worst affected of the countries in the Horn of Africa and the crisis will impact most on the chronically food-insecure central and northern highlands and the pastoral lowlands. The lack of rain is also leading to problems in feeding cattle and, obviously, with access to water. It is estimated that six to eight million Ethiopians are currently in need of food aid if they are to survive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> We all have vivid memories of the terrible famines of the 1980s. It was in response to these that the Government decided to establish an embassy in Addis and to work with the Ethiopian people on long-term development programmes which help prevent, or at least mitigate the effects of, drought and chronic food deficiencies. Proof of the success of this approach is that the effects of the extreme food insecurity are not as severe in the areas where Ireland Aid is working with the national and local authorities on agricultural development, and land and water management.</P>
    <P>In co-ordination with the rest of the donor community, we also need to provide the right type of humanitarian assistance which will avert this disaster. The international community has already reacted favourably with the EU, the US and other donors pledging about 800,000 tonnes of an estimated one million tonnes required for Ethiopia to the end of this year. The main problem now is not the availability of food aid, but how this food is to be stored and distributed.</P>
    <P>We should not wait for horrific pictures on television to provoke a reaction to the plight of our fellow human beings in Ethiopia. I have been allocating humanitarian assistance consistently over the past year to a number of these forgotten emergencies. For example, a total of £810,000 in humanitarian assistance was allocated to countries in the Horn of Africa in 1999.</P>
    <P>We have been following with great concern for several months the precarious food situation in Ethiopia. A team from the Irish Government, from Ireland Aid, recently travelled widely in Ethiopia and saw for themselves the effects of this drought. I have allocated £359,000 in emergency funding since last December. Most of these funds have gone to Concern which has a long and very credible history of working in Ethiopia and is implementing supplementary feeding programmes there. The remainder has been allocated to the World Food Programme which has a response plan in place.</P>
    <P>Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs have raised the developing humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa on a number of occasions at EU and UN level over the past months and weeks. I am keeping developments under very close review and intend to make further allocations of assistance as the overall international response becomes clearer. The embassy in Addis is currently in consultation with the local and national authorities to ascertain how best to offer additional assistance. I had discussions with the Ethiopian foreign minister at the summit in Africa on this looming crisis in Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>Some concerns were raised as usual about the possible diversion of humanitarian funds for military use. This is particularly relevant in Ethiopia because they are currently at war with Eritrea. This issue arises in many emergencies. Ireland Aid has ample experience of working with national and local authorities on the long-term programmes. In countries where there is conflict, <Col N="1498" /> none of these funds are paid to the central treasury but are used at local and regional level. All inputs and outputs are monitored carefully by our embassy staff in Addis. In emergency situations, funds are usually given through international agencies and NGOs. Ethiopia has a well-established disaster prevention and preparedness commission. Donors, including Ireland, work with this commission to prevent and mitigate disasters.</P>
    <P>The emergency funding has been given to Concern and the World Food Programme who have given us assurances that they will reach the most vulnerable people. We have a moral responsibility and imperative to respond to the suffering of our fellow human beings in Ethiopia and to work with the democratically elected Government of Ethiopia and other members of the international community to prevent the present situation from deteriorating into a major emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, to the House and thank her for the update on her recent visit to Cairo and her meeting with the foreign minister from Mozambique. I join with her in saying that Ireland is proud to be to the forefront in providing assistance and aid. Since Mozambique is one of our priority countries it is all the more important that we are seen to be to the forefront. While we are a very small country internationally, our moral force within the international community has been quite significant. It is highly commendable that we have been to the forefront in this crisis.</P>
      <P>While the Minister praises the response of the international community &ndash; and they deserve praise for their later efforts &ndash; initially their response left much to be desired. There seemed to be weeks and weeks of crisis before there was a serious response from the international community. In an era where literally in 24 hours one can circumvent the globe, it seems incredible that it took so long for some of the aircraft, helicopters, military equipment and assistance to get into Mozambique. It was unfortunate that it did not happen sooner. The Minister has stated quite clearly, and rightly so, that if there had not been such a positive response from the international community, many more people would have been lost in the flooding. I suggest that many people need not have been lost if there had been a quicker initial response to the disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Africa is an extraordinary continent, with absolute extremes, from complete aridity to flooding and heavy rains. The extremes make it very difficult for people to survive. I thank the Minister for the update on the crisis in Ethiopia, which is the complete opposite to that in Mozambique, with absolute famine due to the lack of water. It is a typical example of the extremes within the continent. I thank the Minister for the assurance she has given this House that the funding will be contributed to the local and regional communities rather than to the central treasury to ensure it reaches the people. The direction of <Col N="1499" /> the money to Trócaire, Concern and the NGOs is highly commendable because then one knows it is reaching the people on the ground. That is a very wise direction to have taken and perhaps in many instances that is the only direction. While respecting democratically elected governments and ministers and also recognising that many of these democracies are at a very early stage and that the basics of democracy, as we understand them, could differ quite considerably, taking that direction has been commendable.</P>
    <P>It was quite horrific and frightening to witness on the television and in the newspapers the mindboggling pictures of people hanging off branches of trees waiting for somebody to rescue them. Women with children in their arms, up to their hips in water, were trying to get on to boats or helicopters. It was an extraordinary sight and quite frightening.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the question of future development and the process of reconstruction. This is vitally important, as are the half million people who need food. It must be ensured that they are properly fed and housed to prevent major outbreaks of disease and avoid a further death toll. This immediate problem needs to be dealt with and I am confident the Minister will do everything in her power to ensure that is closely monitored. I compliment the Minister on the work she is doing and the profile she has given this and all the other areas with which she deals within her remit in the Department.</P>
    <P>On the process of reconstruction, I join the Minister in welcoming the decision by a number of countries to waive the debt owed to them by Mozambique. I also join in the appeal to other countries to take the same action. Countries who are involved in the Paris Club of bilateral creditor nations should join with those as well. It is impossible for a country like this to return to any sustainable development while having this massive debt because it is not humanly possible for them to proceed. At a time of a buoyant world economy, the First World can well afford to respond in that way.</P>
    <P>Africa is in great difficulty with many wars across the continent. There are so many immediate difficulties that it seems to be constantly faced with problems, whether political difficulties, famine or flood difficulties. Of all the continents, it is the one which seems to be particularly besieged by difficulties. All the international agencies, the United Nations, the European Community and the major world powers need to get together and identify clearly the areas of potential difficulty relating to climatic conditions, military and political problems and to put a plan of action in place to ensure that something can be done to stave off these dangers.</P>
    <P>Flooding is caused by heavy rain and the bursting of river embankments. The Limpopo is a huge river travelling through Mozambique. The nature of the land is soft and is subject to erosion. It would cost billions of pounds to secure the river, <Col N="1500" /> but there must be sections of it which are particularly vulnerable. Engineering skills need to be applied to reconstruction projects in those areas and this must be done immediately. It is happening in other countries such as Lesotho, where a massive dam sends water to South Africa, and there must be a way of directing the water surplus in some countries to arid countries. The Minister of State should examine this matter in conjunction with her counterparts in the EU and the rest of the international community.</P>
    <P>I commend the staff of the embassy in Mozambique, other Department officials and the Irish people working for Trócaire, Concern and other organisations in the area. These people are meeting the difficulties every day and they are responding very positively. The work done by these people is extraordinary and they deserve the compliments of the House.</P>
    <P>We have allocated a reasonable amount of money to this area, but a wonderful budget surplus was announced recently for the first quarter of the year. The Minister for Finance will be feeling generous and this is a glorious opportunity for the Minister of State to ask him for extra funding to deal with this crisis. I urge her to do so, as she has fought for additional funding in the past and the door should now be open to her. She should act as soon as she can before other Ministers beat her to it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister of State has given us a first hand account of recent developments and the Government's current course of action regarding Mozambique. I wish her well. I am delighted preventative measures are being taken in relation to Ethiopia which anticipate difficulties before they become too serious. I hope that action prevents any major crisis arising in Ethiopia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State addressing not just the ongoing situation in Mozambique but the famine in Ethiopia, where more than 16 million people could be affected in coming weeks. Some people think eradicating poverty and dealing with disasters, natural and man-made, is simple, but these are complex problems and their solutions are even more complex. Such disasters have occurred through the centuries &ndash; floods and famines are mentioned in the Bible so these events are not just of the present but have been occurring for millennia.</P>
      <P>The advent of worldwide television has brought these disasters into the public arena. CNN goes to a disaster area and is followed by other media. These media set the menu of the day by selecting the place that is best for the cameras. People jump on the bandwagon and disappear later, but this does not mean that that particular area is the only part of the world with problems. Such attention concentrates aid in the areas being publicised, which may help, but it does nothing to deal with natural and man-made disasters on a global basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1501" /> The latest buzzword in defence is interoperability and how people are to get together on a global scale to deal with conflict throughout the world. There is a lack of cohesion in international planning to deal with disasters. Everyone suggests a rapid response programme, but how is such a programme to deal with a situation in the Horn of Africa today, Mozambique tomorrow, Sierra Leone the day after, then South America and Asia after that? This is a very complex area. I do not know how the EU, UN, OAU, the ASEAN group and the South American nations are to get together and deal with it, but the problem will have to be solved.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State said, there was a need in Mozambique for helicopters as there was no land transport. In addition, the configuration of the flooded land meant deep draught boats could not be used and vessels with a very shallow draught had to be found. South Africa sent in helicopters very rapidly, but thousands of refugees &ndash; 250,000 in one area &ndash; had to be accommodated. There are huge problems here which cannot be solved by newspaper headlines or facetious comments on television. The real challenge to Ireland and other countries is making available resources to deal with such events.</P>
    <P>The work done in both Mozambique and Ethiopia by our embassy staff has been mentioned, and they do a tremendous job. There are also NGOs such as Trócaire, Concern and GOAL working in those countries and doing tremendous work. There is always tension between Government bodies, international organisations and NGOs which can at times become personal and lead to attacks on Ministers and Governments for not doing enough. The NGOs may feel frustrated that they are not getting enough resources and feel that they can do a better job than international organisations, but there is a difference between fire brigade action and long-term aid.</P>
    <P>Now that the problem in Mozambique is beginning to recede, how is that country to return to the level of sustainable development that was emerging there? After a long civil war Mozambique was beginning to tackle the problem of restoring its economy and, as has been said, there is no doubt that it could be economically successful given its huge natural resources. However, those resources must be used for the benefit of its people, whose income per person was, until recently, at the lowest end of the scale.</P>
    <P>I was in Mozambique some years ago and one of the major problems, apart from poverty and the deprivation caused by the civil war, was the mining of the country during that war. The ongoing international programme to de-mine Mozambique was beginning to have an effect. Farmers were able return to their fields and children could play without fear of being blown up by mines. Following the flooding, there is a danger that mines which were not buried deep in the ground will re-emerge in places which have not yet been mapped.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" /> The eradication of debt is something to which we all aspire. The living standards in countries such as Mozambique are derisory. People barely manage to survive. We must ensure that those survival standards are improved in some small way through the elimination of debt.</P>
    <P>Global warming is creating and will continue to create huge problems, such as increased levels of flooding, in many countries. We have seen that in Ireland too. Flooding problems are natural in origin but cause great devastation, as we saw in Mozambique. One cannot simply go into a democratic country in which natural disasters occur and say, &ldquo;We're here to save you.&rdquo;  There must be a consultation process with democratically elected people but this can often prove difficult and create delays.</P>
    <P>The war between Ethiopia and Eritrea was a very vicious one, as all wars are. I hope the Eritrean Government will allow the 800,000 tonnes of food which is currently available to be delivered to Ethiopia through Eritrea's ports. The alternative will be to fly the food into the country. I have witnessed the problems associated with flying food provided through the World Food Programme through Kenya into southern Sudan. It simply does not work. The troops of General John Garang, leader of the so-called Liberation Front in southern Sudan, get most of the food and may reallocate any food which remains. There is a possibility that food could be conveyed to Ethiopia through Djibouti. Unless the Eritrean Government reacts positively over the coming days, every effort should be made to do that.</P>
    <P>We are not talking today about Mozambique in particular, rather about the response the international community can make to disasters such as the one which occurred in that country. Some people have been critical of the Irish Government's actions in the past. As a Government of a small country, it has done an exceptionally good job and I compliment the Minister of State on her actions in terms of increasing the level of funding available through our aid programmes, be it international assistance, particular assistance to countries such as Mozambique, Lesotho and others or assistance provided through the UN and the EU. Ireland has done more than any other OECD country in recent years, increasing its level of aid at a greater rate than any other country. However, we can never give enough. Given the huge amounts of money coming into our Exchequer as a result of our booming economy, we must fight for those who are worse off than we are, particularly people who live on less than $5 per month. I hope the Celtic tiger will not create an &ldquo;I'm all right Jack&rdquo; attitude or a &ldquo;keeping up with the Jones's&rdquo; mentality. There is no comparison between the level of poverty in Ireland and the levels in Mozambique, Sierra Leone or Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>If we could incorporate the sense of smell into media reports, we might succeed in eradicating world poverty. We see colour reports of people dying but if people could smell the famine, <Col N="1503" /> greater emphasis would be placed on eliminating famine and war throughout the world. Glossy television pictures of horrific events do not do anything for the elimination of poverty in the long term. We must not become overly critical of what is not being done but must praise what is being done throughout the world by various Governments, NGOs and people who make individual contributions to the alleviation of poverty caused by war and natural disasters.</P>
    <P>Natural disasters are recurring and we must mobilise national and international bodies to eliminate their causes. There is no cohort of researchers in the world which could predict the imminence of natural disasters and mobilise forces to deal with that. Sufficient research is not being carried out into where problems might arise in the short term. If the Minister could raise the establishment of such a research facility within the EU, we could possibly achieve a more rapid response to these crises.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House. The more we examine and discuss the problems of poverty, the better it will be for us and those we are trying to help, the poorest of the poor, wherever they are in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the issues of overseas development would move beyond the realm of party politics to consensus. We have done this on issues which, given our historical tradition, are vastly more difficult, such as Northern Ireland. We are moving in that direction regarding overseas development aid. It is not an issue on which I would like to score silly political points, as I am very good at doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Such humility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a trace of it in my body, it is more cockiness than anything else. The Minister deserves some congratulation for the reassertion of the importance of ODA in our foreign policy. There have been hiccups and we will continue to argue about percentages but ODA and Ireland Aid are now seen as one of the ethical obligations we have to the rest of the world and ourselves. We will be a lesser people in terms of how we look at our problems if we decide the rest of the world can wait for help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the apparently inexorable increase in the scale and frequency of natural disasters, which seem to be a fact of life. I will return to global warming. While Governments must operate within budgets, our public finances are in such a condition that we should never say in advance we cannot provide funding. There are two reasons not to provide funding, whether it is emergency relief or, as the Minister identified, the more fundamental issue of long-term poverty alleviation. The first reason is if there is no need, which will never be the case in anyone's lifetime, and the second is if we believe there is no ability to deliver benefits from ODA. <Col N="1504" /> We obviously cannot endlessly supply money. However, we are nowhere near the saturation level at which we cannot find well-run development proposals in a variety of countries.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the long-term solution to a disaster like the one in Mozambique is to enable countries like Mozambique to become rich and powerful enough to minimise the risk and deal with the consequences. Countries like France have had major natural disasters in recent years and have dealt with them with considerable efficiency and without panic overseas because they have the resources to do so.</P>
    <P>I accept the figure of 0.7% of GDP as a target but it should not be a ceiling to our willingness to help. The ceiling ought to be our capacity to find agencies, bodies, proposals and systems which can use resources efficiently and effectively. I make no apologies for saying that is essentially a bottomless pit. However, it is a pit into which we can put resources, provided these conditions are met.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows better than I, a great deal has been written about the enormous waste of ODA resources in the past, particularly money transferred through multilateral agencies. The records of the food and agriculture organisation of the United Nations, the United Nations itself and the World Bank are wonderful arguments against ODA because they have been singularly unsuccessful. The last I read, 65% of World Bank projects had failed. Projects do not fail if people on the ground are in charge and the money is used for what it was proposed. It took a great deal of time for international agencies to achieve these conditions and the World Bank now claims to understand its previous errors. However, I am still extremely wary of multilateral development agencies. The emphasis in the priorities of Ireland Aid should be on bilateral aid, with direct collaboration between the State and successful non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the fundamental problem is poverty. However, we must be wary of some of the utterances from multilateral agencies which assume development and growth are the same. The Indian man who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1998, whose name I cannot remember, wrote a book which I am currently reading called <i>Development and Freedom.</i> He won the Nobel Prize for economics because he demonstrated, better than anyone had done for perhaps 50 years, how growth and development are not the same and that we must look at both. It is ironic that while world economic growth has been reasonably sustained in recent years, economic inequality has worsened. While the resources available on the planet, and therefore the resources available to everyone living on it, have increased dramatically, the resources available to the excluded majority are proportionately less than they were 20 years ago. Nobody disputes the importance of economic growth but it is of no benefit if it does not have in-built mechanisms to use resources to provide basic needs such as <Col N="1505" /> health care, literacy, sanitation etc., whether here or in Mozambique. We cannot gloss over issues of inequality by talking about growth.</P>
    <P>Related to that is the continuing controversy about many of the structural adjustment programmes. Ethical and policy issues are involved in this because structural adjustment has been presented as no more than a rational restructuring of public finances to avoid long-term unsustainability in public expenditure. What has actually happened is that certain areas have been targeted for cutbacks, such as health care, education, literacy and so on. Many countries endeavouring to develop have undertaken more than they can sustain in these areas. However, a great deal could have been done which would not have cost too much and, with proper encouragement from multilateral agencies, could have involved not just global reductions but reorganisation and reprioritisation. This relates to the continuing reservations that I, my party and other parties have about the role of multilateral organisations, particularly the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, although they have a purpose. I am astonished at the willingness of the IMF in particular to tolerate large-scale arms expenditure in countries which are in the middle of structural adjustment programmes while at the same time not being prepared to tolerate the provision of proper basic health care, child care, child health care in particular, women's health care or to deal with basic environmental issues.</P>
    <P>Related to the structural adjustment issue is the issue of debt, to which the Minister has adverted. The Government's position on this has been appropriately far-sighted and generous. I am glad the Minister of State is now in favour of the elimination of debt because I distinctly recollect the Minister for Finance saying here, when legislation in connection with our relations with the IMF was being debated, that he was not in favour of the elimination of debt but was in favour of debt relief. I am glad we have moved on from that, because our objective should be elimination.</P>
    <P>The deliberate linking of painful structural adjustment to debt relief or to debt elimination is not morally sustainable, particularly if this is merely using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. I hope that the fall in the debt of Mozambique from US$5 billion to US$1 billion under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries initiative will not be achieved at the price of further suffering for the already suffering people of that country. Many NGOs argue that this is what will happen because the conditions are too painful.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with the requirement that a rational economic policy should be pursued in any developing country. That is perfectly reasonable. However, a rational economic policy must focus on the fact that economic policy is about achieving other things. It is a necessary but not sufficient condition for development. There cannot be development in the long term without economic growth. However, economic development does not necessarily happen just because <Col N="1506" /> there is economic growth, particularly in very poor countries if large proportions of the population are excluded and do not have political freedom, a decent basic health care system or the freedom to work in a free labour market without conditions of slavery attached. That is why a rational economic policy must have elements of prioritisation and targeting in relation to what is to be done with the achievements of economic growth.</P>
    <P>There are other matters that are of great importance in development and which are also related to poverty. The first of those is trade. There is a view that the world is moving towards free trade. It is doing so in the case of manufactured goods. However, the world is awash with tariff and other barriers when it comes to trade in agricultural products and other primary products. It is those barriers that prevent developing countries from using their comparative advantages in many areas to achieve the redistribution that a fair trade system would produce. That is because there are vested interests in the developed countries who resist that. One of the great disillusionments of the new Government in South Africa has been the time and struggle it has taken to achieve the sort of trading relationship it assumed would be automatic once democracy was achieved. This is true not just of South Africa but of many other countries.</P>
    <P>There are contradictions in our policy on development. One that I have adverted to before is the national celebration we had when the largest ever fishing boat, owned by an Irish person, was launched in Norway. I do not begrudge the man who owned it any of his success. However, a good deal of the gloss was taken off that when it turned out that that fishing vessel was going to operate off the coast of Africa in order to consume resources in an African country's zone of economic interest and bring them back to an already rich continent of Europe, which has already destroyed or is in danger of destroying its own fish stocks. There is a moral question to be answered when a continent that is singularly incapable of feeding itself is exporting fish to a continent that has effectively obliterated a large part of its own fish stocks. These are issues that need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned global warming which is related to this. It is difficult to believe that many international corporations accept that global warming is a problem. Everybody believes there is a different way of addressing the problem from the way that costs them any inconvenience. IBEC has announced that it is not in favour of carbon taxes. That does not come as a surprise. I am sure most motorists are not in favour of carbon taxes. What is undoubtedly true is that we are, as of this moment, in breach of our Kyoto commitment. I do not know what we are going to do about it. I suspect that at the back of people's minds is the idea that we might have a recession for a couple of years before we reach the target date of 2010 and in that process we will cut back <Col N="1507" /> a bit. However, there is no evidence of that and we are well over our Kyoto limits.</P>
    <P>I wonder what we are going to do, because there is a legally binding agreement. Will we move to the issue of whether to cut back on our carbon dioxide production &ndash; which is what we should do &ndash; or get involved in tradable permits, which means buying the spare capacity of other countries? If there were a large number of rich countries with spare capacity who wanted to sell to us, I would not mind so much. However, the most likely place in which Western countries will buy permission to emit more carbon dioxide is among the less developed countries. What we are doing is buying their development, because if we buy what they are currently permitted to release, their permitted releases drop, and since carbon dioxide emissions so far correlate to development &ndash; technology might change this, but however well regulated they may be in countries like Sweden, they still go up with development &ndash; we are actually putting a ceiling on development in other countries in order to minimise our own inconvenience. There is a fundamental ethical issue involved there.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, the issue of poverty, whether in Mozambique or in any of the poor countries of the world, is an issue which comes under the global heading of sustainable development. I have learned over the past number of years that where one is determines which of those two words one focuses on &ndash; we are in the category of countries which emphasises sustainability. The developing countries are interested in a form of development which is sustainable, whereas what most Western countries talk about is a way of sustaining what we have already achieved which is environmentally acceptable. There is a huge difference in priority between the two sides.</P>
    <P>Writing the rules for the convenience of the already developed countries is not the solution to the very difficult problem of how to give the two billion people of India and China, for example, a standard of living, as we currently define it, which is equivalent to that of the average citizen of Europe. Nobody knows how to do that, because the scale of resource consumption that would be required currently to give them that standard of living would mean that every drop of oil in the world would be gone in about five years. We would have such enormous mountains of waste if those two countries had our level of consumption that there would be nowhere to put it. The Himalayas would disappear under a mountain of waste in no time at all.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental issue here, and it goes back to the fundamental issue that the Minister of State correctly identified, which is poverty. It involves definitions of poverty, but it does not involve us making a definition of poverty for other people. It involves us accepting that there are limits to consumption, as there are limits to growth, and that limits to consumption must apply universally. Countries like ours, at our <Col N="1508" /> present level of development, are quite near the limit of what can be ethically justified.</P>
    <P>What is needed in countries like Mozambique where there are such tragedies is a capacity to respond quickly. Even though the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, is right that the response was probably quicker than ever before, the public was and is still annoyed. In Britain, in particular, public opinion was extremely annoyed at what it saw as temporising, delaying and interdepartmental wrangles. We do not have that here because we do things better but if we believe in development and consistency in policy, we cannot talk about development and, for instance, sustain the trade barriers of which I have spoken. Nor can we talk about development and not accept that the debt of many poor countries was unfairly landed upon them, is an unfair burden, must be eliminated, and we should deal with the future of borrowing and make sure that it never happens again.</P>
    <P>There are two other issues, the first of which is that we cannot tell the rest of the world that we are concerned about its development and still set up a sophisticated arms marketing industry in an entity like the European Union to compete ruthlessly to try to persuade as many of those countries as possible to buy as much arms as possible from us. There cannot be an ethical development policy where there is an arms export policy. In general there should not be sales of arms to developing countries. No country that wishes to have a trading relationship with the EU or wishes to be a member of the EU should be under any illusions about that. The other issue, which is one about which we must be careful, is that if we believe in development, we and rich countries generally must look at the question of immigration.</P>
    <P>In terms of strategy and fundamental policy, we should be very wary of ideological certainties. Contrary to what many people think, I spent most of my adult political life trying to argue against the ideological certainties of the left because I never subscribed to them. I am a pragmatist. I believe in what works and much of what has made Europe a civilised society has come from the left, but it is not based on ideological certainty. We need to be equally wary now of the ideological certainties of the right. The belief that economic growth is synonymous with development may be fashionable but it is wrong. There are two tools of development, growth and the use of growth, and we need to emphasise in international fora the importance of the second.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was back in early February that the government of Mozambique launched a provisional appeal for emergency humanitarian assistance following severe flooding which initially affected mainly the cities of Maputo and Mutala. After that, the flooding affected much of the provinces of Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane in the south as well as central portions of Mozambique, namely, the provinces of Sofala and Man<Col N="1509" /> cia. These were the worst floods in 50 years and they resulted in over 70 deaths. They left thousands homeless and more than 100,000 acres of food crops were affected. In some provinces 30% of the livestock was lost. Commercial activities were severely disrupted and damage to infrastructure was extensive. Urgent repairs were required to roads, bridges, railways and electricity networks.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember the damage that was done. One sees it on television and the next time one turns on the television there is another tragedy somewhere else &ndash; there is one in Ethiopia now, for instance &ndash; and, therefore, one forgets about it. Many of the affected areas of the cities of Maputo and Mutala and the provinces of Maputo, Gaza, Inhambane and, to a lesser extent, Sofala were without access to safe drinking water, health care and other basic services. Most of the population in need of humanitarian assistance were displaced people who had to be housed in temporary shelters. Of the 300,000 people affected by the floods, 60,000 were children under five. Inadequate sanitary conditions significantly increased the number of communicable diseases and the risk of outbreaks of diseases such as malaria and cholera. The stagnant flood water and the heavy concentration of people in temporary shelters drastically increased the incidence of malaria. Outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases such as measles and meningitis were also major threats.</P>
      <P>An estimated 15,300 of the 300,000 persons affected were pregnant women, of whom 4,600 were expected to deliver within the next three months. These women require special attention. We all remember the scene of the woman being rescued from the tree where she gave birth to a child. Even under normal circumstances, Mozambique has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, that is, 1,559 per 100,000 live births. Health services in the affected areas were overwhelmed by the number of patients and are working beyond capacity. Drug stocks began to run out and there was a serious shortage of health workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Food is an essential basic need and a high priority in terms of emergency requirements. The excessive rainfall followed by unprecedented flooding in the southern and central provinces caused tremendous loss of standing crops and livestock. Most of the cultivated land in the southern region was affected. About two-thirds of the cultivated areas, that is, about 100,000 hectares, have possibly been lost, totalling 30,000 hectares in Maputo and 70,000 hectares in Gaza. There have been losses of perhaps as much as 30,000 hectares in Sofala provinces and as much as 20,000 hectares in Mancia and Tete provinces. This potential loss is already twice as high as any previous loss recorded due to floods. The situation may seriously affect subsequent crop planting in the region, in addition to diminishing the quality of farm food stocks. The floods have <Col N="1510" /> killed livestock and destroyed farms, homesteads and roads.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of the population affected by the floods were already living below the poverty line and were considered to be highly vulnerable in the context of food security. The damage to the national roads and bridges limited access to the affected population by road.</P>
    <P>Most of the affected areas were without access to safe drinking and sanitation facilities and, although water supplies in the cities of Maputo and Mutala are back to normal in most cases, there is still much work to be done in the valleys of Incomati and Limpopo. Sanitation was a problem in all flooded areas, increasing the number of cases of diarrhoea and other communicable diseases and the risk of a cholera outbreak. A few confirmed cases of cholera were reported in the provinces of Maputo and Sofala. The mosquito friendly environment caused by stagnant flood water and poor sanitation, combined with the high concentration of people in displaced settlements significantly increased the number of malaria cases. Reports show that the instance of malaria was at least three times higher in flooded areas than in normal conditions.</P>
    <P>Some 100,000 people of the provinces of Maputo and Gaza were displaced from their villages which were damaged by severe flooding. Their property and dwellings became submerged under water or were swept away by currents. When I say that 100,000 people were displaced, one must try to imagine that it is like an Irish town being wiped out and left under water, with everybody having to leave and a danger of disease. I do not even what to raise the fact that children will be unable to go to school or the collapse of communications etc.</P>
    <P>As of the end of March, about 15,000 children under the age of five were malnourished in camps for flood survivors in Mozambique's southern province of Gaza. The direct and immediate impact of malnutrition upon children is vulnerability to diseases, while physical and mental stunting are longer-term effects. Those children are also likely not to want to take food, which unfortunately results in death.</P>
    <P>Last night or today a tropical storm bearing heavy rain was expected to reach the far north of Mozambique and, therefore, the trouble is not over by a long shot. This storm has already reached the northern parts of the Mozambique Channel between Mozambique and Madagascar. It is expected to intensify before hitting the Mozambique coastline and heavy rain is expected as far south as Vilanculos. Fortunately, downpours are not expected over the southern parts recently ravaged by cyclone Eline. The storm is moving at about 15 miles per hour, but one must remember that Mozambique is still battling to recover from the worst floods in living memory.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the progression of cyclone Hudah was being monitored. After demolishing almost every building in Antalaha in north eastern Madagascar on Monday, it headed straight <Col N="1511" /> for flood ravaged Mozambique. Although weakened after passing over northern Madagascar, the cyclone will strengthen as it passes over the Mozambique Channel and could deluge areas of Mozambique still struggling to recover from the two other storms which hit the area over the past two months. Two people were reported dead on Monday in Antalaha where thousands of residents were left without power and telephone services. Antalaha was the worst hit area. Most buildings not made of concrete were totally destroyed and many others were seriously damaged. An entire neighbourhood of wooden houses was flattened.</P>
    <P>Cyclone Hudah drifted off the north west coast of Madagascar on Monday after making landfall near Antalaha 12 hours earlier. The storm packed average winds of 62 miles per hour with gusts reaching 92 miles per hour on Monday evening. The cyclone, now downgraded to a tropical storm, was located over the Mozambique Channel on Tuesday, moving towards Mozambique.</P>
    <P>We should try to imagine this in the context of Bray over the past few days where there was a minor storm and when a construction platform with oil which was anchored off the coast lost its moorings and drifted to the shore, causing difficulty for the people in the town. However, houses were not swept away and the people were not subject to disease and have not had to cope with floods for the past two months. The residents of northern Madagascar said cyclone Hudah had caused significant damage to property, with the coast being battered by waves up to 26 feet high. Many of those whose flimsy thatched-roofed homes were destroyed in the earlier cyclones had only recently managed to rebuild them. The road between Antalaha and its airport was cleared on Monday so that relief supplies could be airlifted to the town in the following days. However, the highways to the area, which is in the centre of Madagascar's vanilla growing region, were cut-off while the seas remain too rough to ferry emergency rations by boat.</P>
    <P>The coastal town of Cap Est was flattened and the coastal town of Maroantsetra was also flooded. Cyclone Hudah struck the same region which tropical storm Gloria passed over a month ago. Gloria flooded rice fields and killed thousands of people in flash floods and mud slides, forcing residents to depend on food aid from relief agencies. Two weeks before tropical storm Gloria struck, cyclone Eline destroyed the homes and crops of more than 40,000 people on much of the eastern coast of the Indian Ocean island.</P>
    <P>The death toll from the earlier cyclones in Madagascar has yet to be determined. Many of the areas effected lack efficient communications and have minimal health facilities. These cyclones, together with the heavy downpours which are typical of the region's rainy season, have cost hundreds of thousands of people to lose their homes, belongings and crops, not only in Mozambique, but in Madagascar, Zimbabwe and several other southern African countries since February <Col N="1512" /> of this year. The continuing bad weather has washed away one harvest and has left the ground too soggy for the March-April planting. The next planting is scheduled for September with the harvest being six to eight weeks later. The people of the countries worst affected by the floods will need to rely on basic food support from outside aid until then.</P>
    <P>The sugar crop in Mozambique has been affected. They had a target of producing 310,000 tonnes of sugar by 2005 which will not now be possible as the sugar production area has been flooded. The Mafambisse sugar company in the Sofala district of Dondo will suffer a deficit of 10%. The Xinavane Company in the Maputo province will also suffer a production loss of 10%. The Maragra sugar company near the north of the Incomati river lost all its work of the last two and a half years.</P>
    <P>Mozambique's cereal harvest has been reduced by more than 30%. Southern provinces inundated by floods account for 13% of total cereal output in the country and those effected in the central region for a further 20%. Livestock losses for the three southern provinces are provisionally estimated at 13% of total cattle production.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State in her speech said people are amazed by the sheer scale of the devastation which took everyone by surprise. She also said that we are providing much aid, which is welcome. I also welcome what she said about our embassy in Maputo and that we were able to provide information while embassy staff and the medical expert provided special briefings to the other donors, such as the World Food Programme, Médecins Sans Frontières and Save the Children Fund.</P>
    <P>I am not being critical of the Minister of State, as I think we are blessed to have her &ndash; her commitment is unprecedented and sincere &ndash; but she said that &ldquo;already £1 million has been reallocated to be used for reconstruction and recovery activities&rdquo;. That is a lot of money. However, on Sunday morning my wife and I went to look at a four-bedroomed house selling for £700,000 and a five-bedroomed house selling for £1.5 million in my constituency. I do not mind the people who are selling or buying them, but what will £1 million, the price of a house in south Dublin, do for reconstruction? I ask the Minister to besiege and to beseech the Cabinet to increase the aid we give to these people. I know that giving aid is just one aspect of the matter and I am glad we are recommending the wiping out of the debt.</P>
    <P>The statement by the Minister of State that the Government has been vocal in calling for accelerated debt relief and that there is a compelling case for the cancellation of all Mozambique's external debt is very welcome. I hope we push for this because there are countries, especially in Africa, which simply cannot cope with the natural disasters which have effected them in recent years. If we have any modicum of Christianity we must wipe out the debts of these countries as well as starting a rehabilitation and reconstruction <Col N="1513" /> programme. I again ask the Minister of State to beat the Cabinet into giving her more money as this is a very worthy cause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the wonderful work she is doing. She is certainly a hands-on Minister and is not hiding her light under a bushel. She says what needs to be done and what is being done. I also congratulate our embassy staff in Maputo. I spent a month in Mozambique during the elections and I know that part of the country very well. The people there are lovely, but the level of poverty is unbelievable. We went to a town as big, perhaps, as Lucan was 20 years ago where there was no water, electricity or telephones. The roads were dirt tracks. At one time they were tarred, but they were destroyed during the civil war.</P>
      <P>The country endured the most horrific civil war. One man told us he had four brothers who were forced from their home and escaped in different directions. When he returned to his home a week later the heads of three of his brothers were on the branches of trees in front of the house. The stories of suffering during the civil war which the people told us through an interpreter would make one's blood run cold.</P>
      <P>One night we went to what was a big hotel and walked through it with nobody to be seen. All the doors were wide open and outside was a lovely beach. Our army driver said we would get something to eat there. All they had was fish and chips, which was considered a great meal. The hotel must have had over 100 bedrooms in its heyday. The hotel owner went to the kitchen where he struggled to cook fish and chips for three. We bought four beers and two minerals and then he was sold out of everything.</P>
      <P>The poverty in Mozambique is unbelievable. People live in bamboo huts and build little chapels in the wild. School consists of a schoolmaster teaching children in the open. It was amazing to see how flooded was the country. When I was there the women had to walk four or five miles to a swamp to get water, which one could not drink. Their suffering was unbelievable. It was easy for the floods to cause significant damage because any storm would have blown away the wooden shanties in which they lived. Roads and land were washed away because the soil was sand based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land mines pose a difficult problem in Mozambique. I never saw more people limping around on makeshift wooden crutches similar to those used by World War 1 veterans when I was a gasúr. They had lost limbs in land mine explosions. We were warned not to go off the beaten track on any account, even by a yard, because the countryside was riddled with land mines. I wonder whether the flooding will ease or exacerbate that problem. Despite the fact that the land mines were buried, so much land was washed away they could have accumulated in land banks when the flood waters abated. Will they be more dangerous now or will the water <Col N="1514" /> have rendered them harmless? This issue should be examined because even more damage could be caused.</P>
    <P>The Government must be congratulated because it was on the ball and was not found wanting. As Senator Lydon said, it was able to assist aid agencies as a result of the land survey which was carried out by the embassy staff and advise them on what was best to do. I do not know what that equates to in monetary terms but it was valuable. We sometimes think only of the money that is donated but the advice and assistance that the Irish embassy gave to other agencies when they briefed them before they went into various areas so that they knew what to bring with them was worth millions of pounds. People sometimes forget to include that in the equation when they refer to aid.</P>
    <P>The emergency allocation of £160,000 was significant in Mozambican terms. One could have a large amount of Mozambican currency but it would buy very little. The shops there have nothing and the poverty beggars belief. The Minister of State outlined that the key issue in preventing the loss of life and devastation caused by natural disasters is the elimination of poverty.</P>
    <P>Mozambicans are very intelligent and hard working people. I was amazed when I saw television pictures of some of the areas which I had visited. The people had progressed from living in bamboo huts to living in a better type of wooden building, yet it is only three years since the elections took place there. They are a very energetic people but they have suffered at the hands of God and man over the past 20 years or so and we must do everything in our power to help them.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to give a generous donation to one aid agency because I knew the Mozambican people so well. I appeal to those who can afford a few pounds to give it to Mozambique. They would do so if they lived in the country for a while. When I was there we went into a hotel bedroom and there were three beds in the room but I never saw anything as bad as them, and I grew up during the 1930s when times were bad and people had poor houses. I asked the hotel landlady if there was any water. She said that there was and came back to the room a few minutes later with a bucket of water in which one would not wash one's hands. I slept in a tent and I was happier there than in any other accommodation which I had seen. We eventually found accommodation in a school miles away, which was reasonable in Mozambican terms, but if such accommodation were provided in Ireland, there would be an outcry. However, after what we had endured at the beginning of our trip, it was the equivalent of a Grade A hotel.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on playing a leading role in addressing Mozambique's debt problems. It is easy to pay off debt if one is earning a wage. Mozambicans have no income because there is no work but if they were given a chance they would take it. There is great tourism potential as the country has a beautiful coastline. <Col N="1515" /> This will be developed but aid must be provided. I appeal to Governments to write off the debt. It is grossly unjust and unfair to ask Mozambique to repay it because it cannot afford to do so. When Mozambique borrowed the money it was a reasonably well off country but it has suffered immensely.</P>
    <P>When I was there I visited a little hospital with another lady who was also an observer at the elections. We were sent to the outpatient department which comprised a little stone shed with a wooden roof. There was a stretcher in it on which there was only one yard of white cloth and a brown mattress, and the lady was put on it. I could talk about the poverty and suffering for weeks because it touched my heart.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, her officials, the embassy staff and the aid workers in Mozambique on their good work. Money has been allocated but the work of the embassy and the Minister of State's staff, including the land survey, which is not taken into account, is even more valuable. I congratulate them on having the foresight to carry out the land survey. These actions are forgotten by people but I pay tribute to the embassy staff and the Minister of State for the wonderful job they have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>All the kudos aimed in the direction of the Minister of State is well merited. She is following a proud tradition in Iveagh House of Ministers of State with responsibility for overseas development and Third World development programmes. We have a proud record in that area and I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the precedents set since Ireland became a more wealthy country are acknowledged throughout the world. I would not like her to leave this House thinking that the commendations were insincere; they are not. Whatever else the Minister may do in her political life, her legacy in Iveagh House will stand the test of time.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a unique role to play in Third World development aid, especially in the context of Mozambique and other countries in Africa that seem to be constantly devastated by natural disasters of one sort or other, yet the political bureaucracy does not move fast enough when these disasters occur. Despite the efforts of the Minister and her colleagues at Council of Ministers meetings or crisis meetings in relation to emergency aid, something always goes wrong. In the case of Mozambique, for example, it took a long time before aid eventually got to that country. Looking at the events on television and from what I read in the media, it seemed that only a small number of helicopters were provided by the South African Government. Despite the immense resource of prosperity and economic power in the European Union, we appeared to be impotent in terms of moving quickly to avert the crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one compares the lack of alacrity and acceleration of decision making in that area to the decision-making process in terms of making war <Col N="1516" /> on that continent, there seems to be no difficulty in arranging to have the most modern armaments shipped at short notice. Troop movements and all the other paraphernalia of war can be mobilised very quickly but when it comes to providing basic aid to people, it does not seem to work. We had a similar example of that this week in Ethiopia. Why is it that when people are screaming for the most basic of human needs, such as water, we have a problem of logistics? We do not seem to be able to remove the logjam. If the Minister of State were to do nothing else but shout from the rooftops in the way she has done in other policy areas, she would be doing a good day's work. If I were to say only one thing in this debate it would be to impress upon the Minister the frustrations that all of us who have a humanitarian streak feel when we see the pathetic pictures on our television screens, that we would like her to act on our behalf and, if necessary, do what Khrushchev did in a famous incident in the United Nations, take her shoe off and bang it on the table to get people to move.</P>
    <P>In terms of the good news, I was delighted to find out that the baby who was born in the tree in Mozambique is well and was visited by President Joaquim Chissano recently who said that the Government would pay for her education and a house for her family. A lovely quote from the President read as follows: &ldquo;When I looked at her mother's happy face I could see that she's a woman full of hope and determination, reflecting the image of Mozambican women who know that it is possible to overcome their difficulties.&rdquo;  That statement encapsulates the progressive, positive attitude of these people towards this most calamitous of disasters that befell them in recent months, following an equally calamitous civil war, out of which they were just beginning to reconstruct their country. The baby's name is Rositha and her mother, Sofia, said she never expected to talk to the President in her lifetime. On giving birth in the tree, Sofia, who is 23 years old and has two other children, said that it was not very difficult. That must be the understatement of the year. Men have no conception of what it is like to give birth, and I could see the reaction on the face of my own wife if I told her that giving birth on top of a tree was not difficult. However, there are approximately half a million displaced people in 121 camps across Mozambique. For the media, the story has moved on to another disaster in Ethiopia, but what has happened in Mozambique is still very real to the people of that country.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is to be complimented because I have no doubt that Ireland was in the forefront of ensuring that the people of Mozambique would not continue to be crippled by the overwhelming debt they incurred as a result of trying to rebuild their country. The world reacted with alacrity in this instance, and that should be acknowledged. Mozambique hopes to be able to speed up the rebuilding of flood-damaged infrastructure as a result of the announcement that the country's huge debts have been suspended. I <Col N="1517" /> understand creditor Governments have postponed further repayments pending a final deal to completely cancel Mozambique's debt and that creditors will meet in June to discuss a final plan. I am not sure if the Minister of State will be directly involved in these discussions; presumably she will represent this country. I am sure it will be a happy day for her to be in a position to sign off on something that many people have sought, not just in terms of Mozambique but the entire Third World debt burden.</P>
    <P>In that context, we should acknowledge the outstanding work that has been done by Bono and his colleagues in the music industry. We tend to patronise those celebrities who, for one reason or other, find themselves in the public eye over and above what their natural talent justifies. For example, Posh Spice and David Beckham are constantly in the news but that has nothing to do with Beckham's football ability. Bono has been in the news on a number of occasions, usually to do with Mozambique's internal and external political difficulties. I am not an aficionado of U2 and their music. I acknowledge the great contribution they have made to modern music, but what Bono and his colleagues in the international music industry have done in this instance is to be commended. The Minister of State would be the first to acknowledge that despite the best efforts of politicians to get themselves on the front pages when it comes to the issue of world debt, it sometimes needs the catalyst of an international celebrity such as Bono to bring the issue to the forefront. The late Princess of Wales, for example, highlighted the landmines issue, which had lain dormant for many years despite the best efforts of politicians to put it on the agenda. I hope that the collective contributions of politicians such as the Minister and celebrities such as Bono will result in at least the beginning of an era of relative prosperity for the people of Mozambique and the wider Third World community.</P>
    <P>I understand Mozambique needs aid for another three months. The deputy transport Minister, Antonio Fernando, said that the extent of the damage caused by floods to the country's social and economic infrastructure, coupled with the rains which are still falling in several parts of the country causing further damage, will necessitate further aid. He said the Mozambican Government is working in co-operation with the donors to assess the extent of the damage. He also stated that a further substantial reconstruction will only be planned after a meeting between the government and the donor community, which is scheduled to take place in Rome at the end of this month. I presume the Minister of State will attend that meeting. Mr. Fernando also said that Mozambique wants to persuade the international community that what it needs now, confronted with the magnitude of the disaster, are donations, not loans, to rebuild its infrastructure. That is an important distinction. The Minister of State alluded to that in her opening remarks, and I want to again acknowledge the efforts she is mak<Col N="1518" /> ing, admittedly in a looser fiscal environment than some of her predecessors have enjoyed, to prise more money from the Minister for Finance. The fact that she has succeeded so far and obviously will continue to succeed is a tribute to her lobbying efforts in this regard. I assure the Minister that she has the full support not only of all Members of this House but of the wider community outside it.</P>
    <P>I understand that community aid received so far by the National Disasters Management Institute has consisted of 40 helicopters, 15 planes, 182 boats, US$8.7 million worth of various equipment, US$2 million in foodstuffs, US$790,000 worth of medicine and US$1.379 million in cash. Those figures look impressive but they are but a drop in the ocean. I know the Minister's priority will be to ensure that there is an increased flood of donations into Mozambique. Meanwhile aid agencies, using 37 helicopters, are continuing to bring relief to thousands still affected and left homeless by the floodwaters.</P>
    <P>The Mozambican health minister has warned that the threat of disease has not yet passed and that is an important aspect to remember. It is interesting and salutary to note that Mozambique, despite this disaster, is undergoing a process of rapid socio-political, economic and institutional transformation after 16 years of searing civil war.</P>
    <P>Mozambique has impressive natural resources. It possesses rich land, marine and mineral resources. Almost 70% of the territory is covered by dense savannah and secondary forests and approximately 45% of it has potential for agriculture. There are also extensive wetland systems along the coast and coral reefs offshore in the north and south. Important reserves of sub-surface resources include minerals, coal and natural gas. Mozambique has all this plus an estimated population of 16.5 million which is expected to grow at a rate of 3% until the end of this century. Mozambique is the poorest country in the world but all of these facts point to the reality that it can lift itself up, given the opportunities being presented to it by Ireland, through the efforts of the Minister, and by other donor countries in the light of this disaster. It can change from being a country with the lowest <i>per capita</i> GNP and GDP to a medium sized economy. Perhaps it can become one of the most prosperous countries in the African continent and the wider world in the long term. The statistics I have outlined and its natural resources strongly indicate that that can be done. Mozambique now needs the full and active support of the international community. In the light of what the Minister of State has said here, I have no doubt that Ireland will continue to play a full role in that regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding the decision-making process, I appreciate the difficulties that the Minister of State must face when sitting around a table with ministers and dealing with bureaucracy and red tape. I know from watching her and from the style in which she does things that she finds it <Col N="1519" /> frustrating to be at the negotiating table. Ireland and the wider world will cheer her from the sidelines while she continues to operate in the independent style that we have become accustomed to. At the end of the day it is achievements that matter, not how it is done. The fact that something can be achieved and quickly, in areas where natural disasters descend upon people, is the kernel of this matter. We can have any amount of talk, paperwork, projects and theories but it is what happens on the ground and how help is transferred from A to B that matters. I wish the Minister of State continued success in her efforts and I can assure her that she has the full support of this House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 7, before &ldquo;SEXUAL&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;PHYSICAL OR&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the definition of abuse, which we discussed at length on Committee Stage, and our attempts on this side of the House to include physical abuse under the scope of this legislation. There is very little I can add to the debate on this issue which has not already been said during the debate on this legislation in both Houses. The Bill was originally introduced by my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, as a Private Members' Bill in Dáil Éireann and was accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for which we commend him. During the course of the debate on the Bill in both Houses, we have been happy at all times to amend it and to take on board issues raised by the Minister and the Opposition to ensure the legislation will best reflect the needs of those whom we seek to serve, that is, the many hundreds of people, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery today, who experienced abuse, particularly at the hands of State institutions.</P>
      <P>This is one of a series of measures which my party, the Minister and the Government are promoting to right wrongs, to balance the scales and ensure that those who suffered great injustice, hurt and abuse in the past are given the right to be heard and, most importantly, to have those injustices corrected, as far as is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> The definition of abuse is a core and fundamental part of the legislation, which is why we have pursued this issue at every Stage of the debate in the Dáil and Seanad. I hope the Minister will change his mind, even at this late stage, and include physical abuse in the terms of the Bill. Otherwise, the Bill will be lesser legislation.</P>
    <P>The fact that the issue is with the Law Reform Commission does not necessarily mean it must be excluded from the Bill. There is more than one way to deal with the issue. I do not doubt the Minister's bona fides when he says he will return to the House when the Law Reform Commission has reported to him and when he has had time to frame an amendment to the Bill. However, we all know how difficult it is to get legislative time and to bring a Bill through both Houses. That would probably take as long as the time we have devoted to this Bill, although I hope we would return to it in a number of months.</P>
    <P>By excluding the issue of physical abuse from the Bill, we are creating the wrong impression and are not dealing with the issue as well as we could. It is worth reminding the House that it is very difficult in many cases to make a distinction between sexual and physical abuse, in terms of the experience many people had in the past. In many cases, occurrences of what could objectively be called physical abuse, such as beating, often had a sexual content, although it would not have necessarily included activity we would normally describe as sexual. We are narrowing the frame of the legislation and its effectiveness and sending out the wrong message.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to quite a number of people who have a very strong, personal interest in this legislation and have been following it very closely. They have made a very strong case to me and other Members of the House about the importance of ensuring the definition in the Bill encompasses physical as well as sexual abuse. That was my main reason for tabling this amendment. This is a fundamental part of the Bill and I implore the Minister, even at this late stage, to take on board the views, not only of Members, but also of those for whom this legislation has very personal and important implications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. The amendments tabled by Fine Gael also seek to include both sexual and physical abuse. We support the amendment tabled by Senator O'Meara. Everything she said is correct. I did not get an opportunity on Committee Stage to state why the Fine Gael Party believes that physical abuse must be included. I do not know whether the Minister has had recourse to psychiatrists or scientific evidence. People I have spoken to find it virtually impossible to differentiate between an act of physical or sexual abuse. Obviously, there is a physical demeanour to the sexual act and we could go through the relevant details, although I do not intend to do so. While it is not just women who have been physically or sexually abused, as <Col N="1521" /> a woman I can appreciate the lack of differentiation between both sorts of abuse. The area of restraint is physical and it is virtually impossible to differentiate because sexual abuse is not passive. It is a physical onslaught on an individual, therefore, how can the Minister exclude it from the Bill?</P>
      <P>The physical aspect seems to have been linked to physical abuse in schools. Everyone understands what corporal punishment was. I do not consider myself damaged because I received a few slaps on the hand for not doing what I was supposed to do. That is totally different to the physical/sexual abuse which it is the intention of the Labour and Fine Gael amendments to include in the Bill. Given the resources in his Department, surely the Minister could have found a way to incorporate aspects of physical/sexual abuse in the Bill.</P>
      <P>We are not thinking in terms of people making up yarns about how they feel as a result of physical attacks that were separate from a sexual act. We are talking about physical and sexual abuse, although the Minister is taking the term &ldquo;physical&rdquo; out of that context. I do not know what the Law Reform Commission will come up with in considering this matter. The immediacy of the problem is very important, however, because for 20, 30 or 40 years people have had to put up with the horror of what they were subjected to. It is too dismissive to say we will come back at some other time. People's lives have been wrecked and they are so traumatised that they will never be able to put their lives together again. They will not be able to lead fulfilling lives, as we would want them to, without the support of the Department and the Minister to help them to put the pieces together. Many of them will not be able to do so.</P>
      <P>Others, however, will take civil cases following the enactment of the Bill. They should be given every opportunity to pick up the pieces for the remainder of their lives. They are the forgotten people who have been silenced over decades. Today, with the support of social workers, health boards and family, they are trying to come out and speak. It is traumatic for them to do so.</P>
      <P>The fact that the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; cannot be included in the Bill is a technical matter. These are only words to the people who are affected. They will not be able to differentiate between whether or not an act of abuse was sexual or physical. In this instance it is a combination of both types of abuse, so the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; must be included. Otherwise, the Bill will not be interpreting sexual abuse in the way that it should &ndash; to show that even within that context there is a subjection of physical restraint. In that context, physical abuse cannot be excluded from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At women's refuges I have been told about verbal abuse which is apparently much more horrific than physical abuse. One cannot differentiate in those areas. Anybody who is subjected to such abuse could not go to court and tell a judge, &ldquo;At <Col N="1522" /> this point physical abuse stopped and sexual abuse began.&rdquo;  They have been so traumatised that they would not be in a position to make such definitions. On purely humanitarian grounds the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; must be included to provide support to those who have been so traumatised.</P>

      <P>I second Senator O'Meara's amendments. Late as it may be in the passage of this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas, we must press the Minister to include physical as well as sexual abuse in the Bill because the difficulties of separating sexual and physical abuse in some cases will be profound. Too many people suffered for too long for us to neglect them. I understand the Minister's concerns about corporal punishment and the fact that it was not illegal in the past but, as Senator Jackman said, we are not talking about slaps on the hand. As we explained on Committee Stage, those who were beaten up in institutions &ndash; possibly for the sexual pleasure of those who were doing the beating &ndash; really deserve recognition that they were seriously damaged. The Minister should include the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; in the Long Title to the Bill and section 2, as Senator O'Meara has suggested. The Law Reform Commission will report on this matter, but that is a separate issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We had much discussion and argument on this matter on Committee Stage and, on occasion, the Minister felt that we had crossed the line in how we dealt with the debate, and that we had perhaps not considered his position. In the meantime I have given the matter much thought and I appeal to the Minister to re-examine this issue. It may well be that there is an interim position between including the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; or not doing so. One may be able to table an amendment that would connect physical and sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>Let us put the facts before the House. Physical or corporal punishment under common law was always an accepted part of a disciplinary pattern in the home or in institutions. That was the case in this country until 1982. In that year such punishment was put outside the rules of educational institutions and it could no longer be used as a form of discipline. That remained the position until 18 months or two years ago when it became illegal to use corporal punishment.</P>
      <P>While there have been a number of different stages concerning corporal punishment, it is crucial to go back to the period before 1982 when it was legal and permitted under the common law. Even at that time there was a clear distinction. The use of corporal punishment was not outlawed but there was no doubt that the abuse or misuse of such punishment was unacceptable, illegal and constituted a crime against the person. It was not allowable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In almost every case I have examined regarding people who are concerned with this issue, three points of distinction have run through the state<Col N="1523" /> ments and arguments that have been made. First, people have said that not all those in authority, in whatever institution we are talking about, misused or abused these children &ndash; as they were at the time &ndash; sexually or physically. There were some people, religious in particular, who were still held in high regard by the people who were in these institutions.</P>
    <P>The second point that has come through in all these discussions is that people at that stage were not reacting against corporal punishment. They would regularly say, &ldquo;He slapped me&rdquo;, &ldquo;He smacked me&rdquo; or &ldquo;I was smacked when I did something wrong&rdquo;. That was acceptable and people were not marked by that. It is the next step, however, that gives cause for concern. It is the step where people crossed the line. It is the step where people felt they were being abused and where corporal punishment was not just smacking someone, as would have been appropriate under the common law at the time, but where people were abused by the overuse of corporal punishment. We are referring to overuse, misuse or abuse, which have always been wrong. I said this on Committee Stage and I say it again on Report Stage and there is no escape from that fact. It has always been wrong to overuse, misuse or abuse corporal punishment. Case law deals with that. People have lost their jobs because of this and parents have been punished by the law. That is not new.</P>
    <P>We then come to what has been proposed in this amendment. The amendment indicates to the Minister that he should make the same arrangements to deal with physical abuse as he has made for sexual abuse. That is the point at which we differ and the argument begins. We went through this time and again on Report Stage. It was said on Second Stage. He has dealt with it in the other House. He seems to be unbending on the issue. The Minister takes a strong and honest line on issues and takes action which he thinks correct. I am not inferring, and I would defend him on this point, that he is in any sense deliberately taking a stand against people who have already suffered. I accept that point and it does not need to be restated by him. I ask him as Minister to consider this in terms of how the law and the Legislature respond to people who have suffered and how we deal with it.</P>
    <P>We all know there are people who take pleasure from inflicting violence. This is a fact. We also know that sometimes this is a sexual type of pleasure. We know that some people take pleasure from extreme sexual activities. I defy anybody in this House to tell me the distinction between some of these sado-masochistic sexual activities and physical abuse. There is no difference. That is as much as I know in this area and I am no expert, nor is anyone here. It is true in terms of what we know of life. There is no distinction between them in many cases and in almost all cases there is a fudged boundary between them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> We are discussing institutional care and there were good people who worked in these institutions as well. Let us not tar them all with the one brush and I will keep repeating that point. The adults in control who abused the people in their charge were a disgrace to their office and to the authority and trust invested in them, which is why it was so bad. The Minister and I come from the same county and we have heard on many occasions of people who had unpleasant sexual experiences growing up. There is a difference between the sexual experience from which somebody can run and the sexual abuse within which someone is imprisoned and who has to face it again tomorrow, next week, next month or next year and so it continues. We are trying to address this difference.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to clarify and reinforce the point I was making last time about the lack of distinction between physical and sexual abuse, I tried to obtain some evidence and I received from some people an account of their experiences. I would like to cite some of these experiences from the account given to me by one person:</P>
    <P>He would come down every night and take a boy with him. At least once a week he would come to me and take me to a little room off the dormitory. In that room was a spyhole into the dormitory and if any of the lads were talking&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>From what document is the Senator quoting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement given to me from a person who was abused.</P>
      <P>&mdash;he would give a roar out the hatch to shut up. If they did not he would come down and beat them.  I saw this happening on a regular basis for a period of time and we got used to it. The boys knew to be quiet because they were afraid of their lives. The first night I went with him I went freely to his room. When I was in the room he took off my clothes.</P>
      <P>I will not read the next part because it is not relevant and I find it sickening. There is a description of sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>Eventually I went back to bed and fell asleep. From that time onwards I always tried to avoid him. On other nights I was dreading him coming to me but he would take other boys. The nights I would go with him I went reluctantly to his room which had a single bulb and a single bed.</P>
      <P>He goes on to describe sexual activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On one occasion he pulled me close to him and he was standing with his clothes off. He would tell me I was a good boy if I did what he wanted me to do. If I did not and resisted, he would tell me I was a bold boy and use a leather strap which was thick. He would beat me on my naked body. He did this once a week <Col N="1525" /> for about three months. Eventually this became a pattern.</P>
    <P>At what point did something stop being sexual and become physical? I suggest to the Minister very strongly that it was never anything other than sexual control because very often sexual abuse is about control anyway. The statement continues:</P>
    <P>I could not concentrate on school and I could not sleep. . . . . . I fainted. . . . </P>
    <P>Eventually I got the courage to tell the superior what was happening and about the beatings and the sex. I sneaked away one Saturday and was waiting outside the office and he saw me there. After telling the person in charge, I was not believed. He told me I was telling lies. He took out a leather strap from his robe. He hit me all over my legs and body until I became hysterical. He told me I was not going back until I calmed down. He put me in a room and locked me away and left me to cry there.</P>
    <P>I will skip some of this. He says that he remembers this because it was the day before he went out and he explains why he remembers it in great detail. The statement goes on: </P>
    <P>After Christmas that year he tried to interfere with me again by pulling me out of the bed into his room. He dragged me down to his room. At this time, my bed was halfway down the dormitory and he decided to bring me near his bedroom. I was the first bed beside his door. I went into the room. The same thing happened. He took off his night shirt and fondled me. When I would not do what he wanted, he threatened me.</P>
    <P>Will someone tell me where did it stop being sexual and when did it begin to be physical? At which point does this legislation not come into operation? He goes on to explain more. I will not read out all of this. He says again he had good memories of certain people who worked there. It is a great tribute to some of these people who have been abused that they have managed always to single out people who were kind, patient and helpful. It is important that we keep saying that many of the people working in these institutions were good people. The statement continues:</P>
    <P>I would like to say here that I was wetting the bed and when I did I was beaten. The wet bedclothes were shoved in my face and I got a beating every time it happened.</P>
    <P>This means nearly every day.</P>
    <P>I used to take two of the sheets because I would take the dry one and put it on the bed when it was wet so it would not be noticed. If the bedclothes were wet you got beaten.</P>
    <P>This is a statement of a person who was abused and of someone whom it is too late to protect but to whom we can give some response through this legislation. It is clear time and again that there is <Col N="1526" /> no distinction between the sexual and the physical activity. It is utterly and completely wrong.</P>
    <P>Future generations will not thank us if we do not deal with this issue today. I ask the Minister as a fair man to look at this in the way that he would want to look at it if it were his child we were looking after here or if it were my child or that of anyone else in the House. We do not believe that these instances should be excluded by the Statute of Limitations.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the examples I gave, quite deliberately, were cases of sexual abuse leading to physical abuse and cases where physical abuse was the result of a person reporting sexual abuse. In these situations it should not be necessary to prove that there was sexual abuse in order to take action because of the misuse or abuse of corporal punishment or the abuse of a position of authority, responsibility and trust on the part of those <i>in loco parentis.</i> It is our responsibility and in our power as legislators to deal with this situation in the fairest and most honest way possible.</P>
    <P>My position is unusual in that as general secretary of a teachers' union I regularly deal with complaints against people &ndash; those I represent &ndash; in charge of children. The one statement I have always heard from teachers is that they want to be absolutely fair and honest as they have to be above suspicion in this area. They ask me to ensure people understand that in relation to the period before 1982 there was a distinction between using corporal punishment as part of a code of discipline, which was the norm in schools everywhere in the country, and the physical abuse of children. Those are two completely different matters. To say that we cannot deal with the situation before 1982 is to say in a way that anyone using corporal punishment at that time was breaking the law. They were not, they were doing something that was part of the regime and they should feel that what they did was simply that. They should not feel threatened by moves in this direction.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to concede on this issue, as it is probably the most humane request that will ever be made of him in the Oireachtas when dealing with legislation. Many people are depending on the Minister in this matter and I appeal to him to accept this amendment and respond to people who deserve the most compassionate and caring response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments represent the view among Opposition Senators that the legislation is grossly inadequate unless it deals with both sexual and physical abuse. These two areas of abuse are intrinsically linked and nobody can claim that there is a form of sexual abuse which does not include an element of physical abuse. Solomon in all his wisdom could not have come up with the distinction if he tried. Children have been abused since the foundation of the State and we would be doing them an injustice if we did not recognise, as a State, that we have been grossly negligent in this matter. These children were <Col N="1527" /> under 18 years and many had not even reached their teens when they were put in the care of the State. The Department of Education was responsible for them and those directly in charge of the children either neglected them or were proactively involved in a breach of care and responsibility. If we omit a huge area of abuse from the legislation, that legislation &ndash; our response &ndash; will be inadequate.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to say he is kicking to touch and that he will look at the matter and return to it if necessary. We should introduce the provisions here and if we need to amend the legislation later for some reason, let us do it that way. Let us be generous and say for once and for all,<i> mea culpa,</i> we failed those children and we are going to take thorough steps to ensure justice is done. Justice is impossible in the real sense of the word, as one cannot go back and undo the harm that has been done.</P>
      <P>I know from my years working for prison reform of the numbers of people in prison who were detained in reformatories and other State institutions. Their suffering in such institutions undoubtedly had a lifelong effect and led to them being unable to put their lives together without falling foul of the State in some way. Psychiatrists and psychologists say the best way to overcome trauma and the effect of violence is to face up to it and to recognise that what caused the injustice is taken care of. If people see that the State is dealing with this issue comprehensively it will be of enormous benefit to their state of mind. Having been diminished all their lives, their sense of worth will be boosted by the knowledge that this was not their fault but was the result of someone else's neglect or deliberate abuse.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how the Minister can reject these amendments if the Bill is to be effective. I am sure he will make a long speech detailing how he feels this matter should be dealt with judiciously and that the proper measures should be taken, but we will not have dealt with one of the main causes of abuse and the Bill will pass in a flawed state. Many people who would welcome the Bill's provisions for addressing abuse committed in the past will find this is a hollow victory, as it will not apply to the circumstances of their abuse as children. Is there any sense in passing this Bill if everyone we expect to benefit from it benefits only to a limited degree? That is the kernel of the problem, but the Minister has not addressed it on Second Stage or Committee Stage. This is the eleventh hour, it is our last opportunity to get the Minister to accept the amendment and to return to the Dáil with the new provision. We earnestly request the Minister to reconsider his position and accept these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government position on these amendments remains consistent. The amendments, which seek to include civil proceedings arising out of solely physical abuse in <Col N="1528" /> childhood within the compass of this Bill are opposed. I have made my position on this issue clear on previous occasions but it may not be any harm to set out once again where the Government stands.</P>
      <P>The Government, when considering the whole question of how to address the question of limitation periods in cases of abuse in childhood, formed the view that as far as sexual abuse was concerned the case for change was unanswerable. Sexual abuse of children has always been regarded with particular abhorrence by the community, all the more so when such abuse is perpetrated by the very people charged with the care and nurturing of children. It is universally recognised that the abuse of a person of tender years in a sexual way can result in trauma which can prevent the victim from seeking help or redress for the abuse suffered, in some cases well into adult life. It was clear to the Government that special provisions regarding limitation periods to take account of that lasting effect should apply to civil actions where sex abuse is an element. That is why the Government, on my recommendation, decided that the Statute of Limitations should be amended in order to reflect that view and decided to accept the principle of the Private Member's Bill now before us, to the extent that it dealt with child sex abuse cases as a means of bringing that amendment about.</P>
      <P>The question of how limitation law should apply to other forms of abuse in childhood, including physical abuse, is by no means as straightforward. It is universally accepted that any form of sexual activity with young children is of itself abusive, no matter what the circumstances. As far as physical contact of a non-sexual nature is concerned, there has been historically a very much wider spectrum of degrees of acceptability or unacceptability. Such contact can range from the rough and tumble of contact sports which may result in injury to a child through the administration of what society regarded until not so long ago as legitimate physical chastisement to activity which, by any measure, would be clearly abusive. The link is clear and well recognised between sexually abusive acts &ndash; remembering that any sexual act by an adult in relation to a child is of itself abusive &ndash; and the psychological effects on the victim which, among other things, deter the victim from seeking legal redress through the civil or criminal justice process.</P>
      <P>The link between physical abuse and that sort of psychological effect is by no means as clear. There are instances of physical abuse which, though unacceptably severe, did not cause the type of lasting trauma which sexual abuse regularly induces and where the victim would not be inhibited from pursuing civil redress within the normal limitation period. Of course, there can be other cases where such lasting trauma occurred and which would affect the person's ability to commence court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> The Government is anxious to ensure that any amendment of the law on limitation of civil actions as it applies to cases alleging physical abuse in childhood is drafted having regard to the best advice available. That is why it referred this aspect of the matter, which Senators will recognise is very much less clear-cut than the child sex abuse question, to the Law Reform Commission. The commission is an independent body established by statute and chaired by a High Court judge. It has broad experience in many areas of reform of the law and its recommendations have formed the basis for much significant reforming legislation during the past 25 years. Its report on latent personal injuries led to the 1991 legislation amending the Statute of Limitations which introduced the concept of the discoverability of personal injuries to that code of law. Its report on child abuse gave rise to significant reforms of the law incorporated in the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, and the Children Act, 1997. The commission is ideally placed to offer recommendations to the Oireachtas on this issue which has a considerable technical legal dimension but also one which is firmly anchored in the day to day lives of many people.</P>
    <P>The Government is of the view that before we legislate in this delicate and legally complex area, we should have the benefit of the commission's research facilities, well established consultative processes and, most importantly, independent and considered advice as to the way forward in this area of the law. Some commentators have characterised this decision to seek independent expert advice as an attempt by the Government to &ldquo;park&rdquo; this issue or as a means for the Government to shirk its responsibilities in relation to the victims of child abuse. Such suggestions are not only offensive but also nonsensical. The Government's whole approach to the questions that face Irish society arising out of childhood abuse in the past has been one of openness and acceptance of the legacy of responsibility arising from misdeeds perpetrated in the past against young people.</P>
    <P>I will point up some of the more salient features of that broad-ranging approach, announced in the context of the apology offered by the Taoiseach last May to those who had suffered abuse in childhood. They were the establishment of the Laffoy commission to inquire into child abuse and legislation to make that commission more effective in its work, based on the Laffoy commission's recommendations, has been before the Oireachtas since February; the expansion of the counselling services provided by the health boards for victims of abuse in childhood is well under way, with the help of funding provided by the Exchequer; priority advancement of legislation to include a register of sex offenders; and safeguards against the employment of sex offenders in jobs involving contact with children &ndash; this legislation has been before the Dáil since early January. In the context of these and the other measures put in train by the Government, it <Col N="1530" /> is clear that suggestions of a reluctance to act on the real issues involved are completely without foundation.</P>
    <P>Inquiries made of the Law Reform Commission indicate that it expects to publish a consultation paper in the very near future. I understand the commission is aware of a high level of public interest in the forthcoming publication and I have no doubt that the consultation process will be a fruitful one to which many of the interest groups which have emerged in regard to this matter will be able to have an input. I reiterate my undertaking, already given in this House and elsewhere, that I will act promptly and proactively on the commission's final recommendations when they become available. It simply would not make sense, having asked the commission for its advice, to pre-empt that advice by pressing ahead at this stage with the change which the Senators seek to make with these amendments. While I appreciate the depth of the concerns which gave rise to these amendments, I ask Senators, in return, to acknowledge the Government's sincerity in seeking to ensure that whatever amendment may ultimately be made in relation to past cases of physical abuse of children, it will be made in a fully informed fashion with the benefit of the Law Reform Commission's indepth consideration of all aspects of the matter. In the meantime, it is my earnest desire that reform of the law on limitation periods in cases of child sexual abuse encapsulated in this Bill should become law as soon as possible and I urge the House to deal with the Bill on that basis.</P>
    <P>As I have often stated, this is not a simple matter of defining &ldquo;physical abuse&rdquo;. It is possible to recognise what constitutes physical abuse, but the levels of physical abuse differ. It could be said that it might not prove too difficult to describe or define various levels of physical abuse. The difficulty which presents itself in this matter is what level of physical abuse gives rise to a psychological disability, what level of trauma induced as a result of physical abuse would inhibit a person from taking an action. That is an extremely difficult and complicated question. If there were a simple answer to that question, I respectfully submit that we would be aware of it by now.</P>
    <P>I submitted this question to the Law Reform Commission for its consideration. If the members of the Law Reform Commission were of the view that this was a simple matter, I have no doubt that, with all the expertise available to them, they would have produced a report in a short time. Far from considering the matter to be as simple as some people would like to think it is, the commission has decided to publish a consultation paper prior to producing a final report. Surely, people can recognise that if the members of the Law Reform Commission, a panel of experts whose expertise has been acknowledged and acted upon over many years, find it necessary to publish a consultation paper prior to producing a <Col N="1531" /> report, this matter cannot be a simple one. This is not a simple matter. If it were, I would have legislated for it long ago.</P>
    <P>I again request Senators to accept the Government's sincerity in this matter. I must ensure certainty in the law and when the commission produces its report, I will act on its recommendations in a proactive manner. I cannot go beyond that and do the impossible. I have asked those who can assist me in formulating the law in a proper manner, which would allow people who have concerns to be in a position to take action, to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any Member suggested that defining physical abuse is simple. The issue of retrospection, which we will come to later, is not legally simple either. Nobody is suggesting that it is a simple issue, but neither is anybody suggesting it is insurmountable.</P>
      <P>The Minister has sent the matter to the Law Reform Commission which will produce a consultative report. However, it is also possible for the courts to give their view and, ultimately, they will probably decide the core question identified by the Minister as the level of physical abuse giving rise to trauma. We will have to rely on the courts to make this decision for us. As the Minister said, this is a complex and difficult question. However, we cannot escape these issues, we must deal with them. The failure to deal with this issue in this legislation seems to us, as its original proposers, to undermine it considerably and this is also the view of those whom we are representing.</P>
      <P>The Minister said child sexual abuse is abhorred by society, which of course it is. Child physical abuse is also as abhorrent to us, particularly as we become aware of the incidence of physical abuse in institutions in the past. I respectfully submit to the Minister that we are as abhorred by child physical abuse as child sexual abuse. We have heard of cases, anecdotally or otherwise, where physical abuse has led and can lead to as much trauma as sexual abuse. We have succeeded in defining sexual abuse and it is probably no less complex to define physical abuse. Surely it is not beyond us to do this in this legislation, given the advice available from the Attorney General's office, the Minister's officials and his judgment and considerable legislative experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> The Minister said rightly that the limitation law on physical abuse is not straightforward and there is a wider spectrum of degree of acceptability and unacceptability regarding corporal punishment, particularly in the past. I will not debate that with the Minister, it may be the case. However, we are gradually reaching a position where the level of physical abuse which was acceptable in our schools is considered in the modern era to be almost as traumatic as sexual abuse. Senator O'Toole made some extremely valuable points on corporal punishment in schools and the position before 1982. I do not think there are many people who are incapable of making the distinction between corporal punishment, which was legal at the time, and the misuse of corporal punishment. Perceptions of and attitudes towards this issue have changed, as we have heard of various incidents. We are capable of making that distinction, as is any court.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Minister said, it is not beyond us as legislators to deal with this complex matter. We do it regularly in relation to other issues. The Minister said physical abuse is not clear cut, but sexual abuse is not clear cut either. I do not accept that physical abuse is less clear cut an issue. We are doing a disservice to this legislation, our role as legislators and the people we are trying to serve with this legislation by not meeting the challenge in terms of defining physical abuse.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's bona fides that he will come back to us when the Law Reform Commission has reported. Presumably this will be a considerable length of time if the consultation paper is followed by a report, which will then go to the Minister, followed by legislation and so on. This will probably take two years. This legislation relating only to sexual abuse will be passed and we will then have to wait, probably the lifetime of another Government, to introduce new legislation. That is not right. We are undermining the legislation and its objectives, which everyone wishes to meet in order to balance the rights of those who have been abused and ensure they are heard. The law should reflect our desire and obligation that the injustices done to them are finally righted. I am disappointed that at the final stage of this legislation, we have not persuaded the Minister to change his view on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will recall that when we discussed the question of the retrospective operation of this Bill on earlier Stages I pointed to some serious concerns of principle which must be addressed. The concept of limitation periods in civil cases is a feature of legal systems generally. It enables persons to assert their rights on the one hand while on the other hand it provides for some certainty of the legal position of both parties. It can be argued that it is a breach of normal legal principle to disapply such a concept if by so doing it were to lead to a provision which would treat people differently by effectively removing the disability rule in some cases while others would have to prove that the abuse was of such significance that their will or ability to make a reasoned decision to bring an action was substantially impaired. This could lead to a situation where, as in the case of amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 12 proposed by the Senators, abuse which arose before the passing of the Bill would be treated on a different basis from abuse arising after passage of the legislation. The legislation would thus, it could be argued, discriminate between certain classes of person and abuse on a basis that is open to challenge.</P>
      <P>When analogous changes were made to the limitation law in 1991 by way of introduction of the rule of discoverability, persons were not treated differently by reference to different rules. However, a significant departure from the norm was that the 1991 legislation applied to all causes of action ocurring before its commencement. This was on the basis that to apply the normal rule of non-retrospectivity would frustrate the objective of the reform. That approach to retrospectivity has been followed in the legislation, following my amendment to it, as agreed in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy that, as a result of my examination of the question in consultation with the Attorney General, I have tabled the Government amendments before the House, which treat those cases of past sexual abuse that do not benefit from the provisions of the Bill in a way that targets them specifically so that the limitation period could be <Col N="1536" /> reviewed in respect of them and begin to run again. This approach avoids the serious difficulty that could be created if the Senators' amendments were to be successfully challenged, a risk which would exist in a real way if those amendments were adopted and a possibility which could give a result which no one on any side of the House would want, that of undermining the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <P>Government amendments Nos. 6 to 9 are all of a piece. The aim of the amendments, taken together, is to address the particular cases of sex abuse in childhood where the victim has suffered from the psychological disability which inhibits so many such victims from being able to take the steps necessary to pursue litigation within the normal limitation period, but had emerged from that disability at a time before the commencement of the current legislation. Such persons are, under the statute as it stands, out of time and the legislation, in its current form, would not alter that except for the relatively small number of such victims whose disability had ended within three years before the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The first of the Government amendments represents the kernel of its proposals. It is directed at people who have demonstrably emerged from the psychological effects of sex abuse in childhood which prevented them from taking the necessary steps to commence civil proceedings. It gives them an opportunity to commence such proceedings within 12 months after the passing of the legislation, even though they would have been out of time whether under the present limitation rules or under the new disability rule contained in the Bill. The amendment will ensure that victims of past child sex abuse who had made a criminal complaint about that abuse to the Garda will have an opportunity to take civil proceedings against those responsible for the abuse, even though they were outside the normal limitation period for civil proceedings when they made the complaint.</P>
    <P>The amendment will also apply to victims who in the past decided not to go ahead with civil proceedings because they had been given professional legal advice that they were out of time. This applies whether civil proceedings were commenced. Where a person has already taken civil proceedings which were pursued to a final judgment, the new provision will not operate to reopen such a case. This would be a serious breach of the legal principle that there should be finality in litigation. The classicists among the Members may know the concept better by its Latin name, <i>Interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium </i>&ndash; the State is concerned to ensure that there is finality in litigation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 sets out what is to be treated as a final judgment, namely, a judgment where the time for bringing an appeal is past and no appeal was taken; a judgment where no appeal can be brought, for instance, a judgment of the Supreme Court on appeal from the High Court; and a case where judgment was delivered and a subsequent appeal was withdrawn. Amendments <Col N="1537" /> Nos 8. and 9, taken together, insert into the new section 48A of the Statute of Limitations an additional definition of &ldquo;professional legal advice&rdquo;. This makes it clear that the new provision applies whether civil proceedings had been commenced.</P>
    <P>On the basis that this proposal goes in large measure towards meeting the concerns expressed in both Houses on the difficult issue of this aspect of retrospective operation of the Bill, I ask Senators to consider withdrawing the other amendments, which address the same subject matter, and to support the Government proposal.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for tabling his amendments. The issue of retrospectivity was first mentioned in the Dáil when it transpired that quite an injustice could have arisen in regard to those who had made a report to a Garda station, for instance, or who had an initial consultation with a solicitor or had taken legal advice on the issue of action arising from the abuse they had suffered in the early part of their lives and the result of their having taken such action suggesting quite definitively that they no longer suffered from trauma as a result of the abuse, which would have otherwise rendered them incapable of taking such an action. There was undoubtedly a potential injustice in the legislation in regard to this group of people, who possibly had initiated an action but would not necessarily then have been covered by the legislation.</P>
      <P>This issue emerged in the Dáil but because of the time limits on the debate on Committee and Report Stages it was not possible to pursue the issue satisfactorily. However, the Minister indicated last December that he would table amendments when the Bill reached this House. I accept that retrospectivity is a complicated and technical legal issue and that considerable advice had to be taken from the Office of the Attorney General in order to ensure that the amendment was correct in every way. I further accept the Minister's bona fides in coming back with the legislation.</P>
      <P>The group of people involved have only 12 months to commence an action following the enactment of the legislation, which, presumably, will happen soon. That does not appear to have a long period. I hope it allows people to realise their ambitions and adequately deals with the injustice which would otherwise have arisen if the Minister had not tabled an amendment or accepted ours. I accept that may amendment is quite broad and needs to be refined but I hope that 12 months is sufficient for the people involved to pursue their cases in the proper legal forum.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister tabled these amendments because Senator Taylor-Quinn withdrew a similar amendment on Committee Stage on the basis that the Minister said he would examine this issue. His amendment is similar to the Fine Gael amendment and I am pleased he is proactive in regard to retrospectivity. There are people who have been treated unjustly and they would be affected if they did not have the opportunity presented by these amendments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for tabling these amendments. He promised on Committee Stage that he would review the issue and introduce an amendment on Report Stage, if it were possible to do so. We had a difficult debate on Committee Stage on a variety of matters, including retrospectivity, which is important for people in this terrible situation. The fact that the legislation will be amended before it becomes law is highly commendable. Equally, given that an action must be brought within 12 months of the enactment of the legislation, it is imperative that this section is given proper publicity. It deserves serious public airing to ensure that all people who lodged a complaint with the Garda or sought legal advice in the past but found that they were statutorily barred and could not proceed are able to take action. Those people need to be alerted to that fact and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have an obligation to ensure that adequate publicity is given so that people who fall into this category will be in a position to avail of the provisions made available as a result of these amendments. I appreciate that the Minister has to introduce some finality to this issue and that it is not possible to proceed any further in cases where judgment already has been made. That is acceptable.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister. Despite the ferocious approach taken at times on Committee Stage I am delighted that the Minister and his officials accepted the wisdom that emerged from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I want to record my appreciation that the Minister accepted the views of this House. If the Minister had not brought forward these amendments on this very important issue the thrust of the Bill would have been ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Senator O'Meara on the 12 months limitation, that period should be sufficient because most people who have suffered abuse, as defined in the Bill, are now identified. Many of them are involved in a particular association and once the Bill comes into effect, hopefully in the near future, proceedings can be issued in any court. All one will <Col N="1539" /> have to do is initiate proceedings and issue a High Court or Circuit Court writ. Regardless of whether it takes four years to pursue the case, once the proceedings are issued the person is covered. That is important. The 12 months period is adequate and the Minister has been magnanimous in seriously considering the position. For once, he has been given credit in the debate. This is an important Bill and an acknowledgement of what the Minister has done in the past few weeks should be recorded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the publicity attendant on the passage of the legislation and on the issue of child abuse generally, and in particular the close attention being paid by those who represent victims of abuse legally, will mean that anyone who should commence proceedings within 12 months will be made well aware of the legislation. I take note, of what Senator Taylor-Quinn had to say in respect of giving publicity to the issue and I will bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>In bringing forward these amendments, I am meeting concerns which were expressed in this House and elsewhere, and concerns which I had also. It was important that people who had made a complaint would not be disabled from taking an action on foot of the legislation. It was also important that people who had sought legal advice and who had done something about the abuse they had suffered should not be disabled from taking proceedings. Everybody will agree that it would not have been desirable for me to extend the period beyond 12 months because we have to have certainty in the law. If this says anything it surely says that where it was possible for me to amend the legislation in order to do justice now, I did precisely that. Where it was not possible for me to do so, I had to refer it to the Law Reform Commission to ensure that justice was done. One way or another, there is one thing for certain &ndash; I was not and am not attempting to part any of the important issues raised in relation to child abuse, be it physical or sexual abuse. I am very concerned, however, to ensure that there is certainty in the law, that justice will be done and that the mechanism is put in place so that this objective can be achieved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the significant advances in primary education and the revolutionary changes including, <i>inter alia,</i> the revised curriculum, the introduction of information and communication technology and the piloting of modern European languages; recognises the ever increasing demands on teachers of developments such as the plean scoile of performance management, new codes of discipline, anti-drugs programmes, child abuse guidelines, sex education programmes and new systems of teacher accountability and school evaluation; welcomes the unparalleled contribution made by primary teachers to the design, management and implementation of these positive and progressive changes in Irish primary education; is concerned that there is, among the wider community, a lack of awareness of all that is happening in our primary schools and that there is a dearth of empirical research in this area; and proposes that the Minister for Education and Science initiates an independent performance audit of primary education so that by outlining, describing and confirming the extraordinary activity taking place, the trust <Col N="1541" /> and confidence of the community can be reinforced and so that this vital data can also be made available to those who are charged with determining the rewards, remuneration and career structure of teachers.</P>
    <P>I am trying to achieve two things with my motion. First, I want to give people an insight into what is happening in primary education. Second, I want them to gain an understanding of the demands made on all the partners in the sector, not just on teachers. To that end I tabled this long motion. I am delighted to welcome the Minister for Education and Science to the House. This is the first opportunity he has had to outline his vision for education and I look forward to hearing what he has to say. I have no doubt that his comments will be very supportive.</P>
    <P>The revised curriculum for primary education was introduced after full consultation with all the education partners. It has not happened anywhere else in western Europe that a revised curriculum has been introduced and on the day of its introduction had the full support of parents, management and teachers organisations and the Department's inspectorate. It is a model of how things should be done and everyone involved in education in Ireland should take a bow. The OECD has confirmed that Ireland introduced information and communication technology faster than any other European country. The same applies to the way teachers have been prepared to take on additional responsibilities.</P>
    <P>We should also recognise the increasing demands placed on teachers by developments such as the plean scoile of performance management. Performance management is now <i>in situ</i> in primary education. School staff put together their plan for the operation of the school and deal with everything from the implementation of the curriculum to codes of discipline, relationships with parents, development of the management structures in the school and the organisation of everything from supervision to extra-curricular activities. This is hugely important.</P>
    <P>The new codes of discipline have been discussed in this House on a number of occasions. We have also discussed the anti-drugs programmes, child abuse guidelines, sex education programmes and the new systems of teacher accountability and school evaluation. In other European countries governments and ministers are fighting to introduce and garner support for these measures, yet there is a consensus approach to them in Ireland. I ask the House to welcome the unparalleled contribution that has been made by primary schoolteachers, not just to the changes that I have mentioned but to the design, management, implementation, modification and continuous assessment of them. All of their contributions have been positive and progressive.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the implications these changes will have on primary education but I will <Col N="1542" /> come back to that at a later stage. People who work in schools, particularly teachers, are worried that there is a lack of awareness in the wider community of all that is happening in our primary schools and that there is a dearth of empirical research to show what is happening.</P>
    <P>In general, teachers get a bad press. It is easy to have a go at teachers in the media and journalists are adept at it. I am not trying to bash the media in response but teachers tend not to get a good press for the extraordinary work they do. It is time we had an independent consideration of their work. The Minister should initiate an independent performance audit of primary education which would examine how we approach change, make policies and how we describe, design, manage, implement and modify the change. An audit could examine whether there is a proper level of consultation, resources and support and whether it is moving at the correct pace. An independent audit would, for the first time, outline, describe and confirm the extraordinary activity that takes place in primary schools, in a way that would reinforce the trust and confidence of the community. This vital data could be made available and would be most useful to me in making a case to those who are charged with determining the rewards, remuneration, career structure and promotion of teachers.</P>
    <P>This is the way to go about it. If we examine what is going on in schools then we could show that the changes are worthwhile, important, add value and improve the system. We could also prove that these changes add to our children's education and that the people who deliver that should be properly and fairly rewarded.</P>
    <P>In recent times, there have been the most significant advances ever in primary education and the matters I have mentioned. I cannot recall, from my experience over the past 30 years and my knowledge of the history of primary education, when demands on teachers increased at such a rate.</P>
    <P>The developments I mentioned have resulted in a substantial increase in the workload of teachers. The current pace of change at primary level is quite incredible. Each of those changes adds to the workload of the teacher.</P>
    <P>Teachers have never been more in the firing line and it has never been so difficult to be a teacher. I am not saying that to whinge but to be factual. Many jobs are difficult at the moment, but huge demands are put on teachers. Parents have invested a huge amount in their children. The burgeoning Irish economy has huge expectations of the next generation. That brings its own problems in terms of demands on schools. However, in addition, there has never before been so many social problems and different family models that must be dealt with. Every one of those problems is evident in the school every Monday morning and is part and parcel of the teacher's work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1543" /> Today's primary teachers feel they are the dustbin where everybody's fresh idea for education or every expert's new proposal to cure the ills of society are left to be dealt with. Schools are expected to deal with everything but they cannot. While teachers and schools can be part of the solution to many problems, they cannot do it on their own. Teachers cannot change the attitudes and habits of a generation in the time they have with children because other things must also change. Listening to some commentators &ndash; I ask Members of the House to show some sympathy on this point &ndash; one could be forgiven for thinking that every problem in the country, including litter, vandalism, drug abuse, violence and delinquency, can be solved by teachers, simply by the introduction of yet another specially devised programme.</P>
    <P>This adds to the frustration of teachers. They have, first, the frustration of dealing with these problems in the schools and then the added frustration of a community expectation that, in some way, the problems of litter can be fixed in school. The problem of bad manners cannot be fixed in school. Parents cannot send their children to school to learn manners. If children do not have manners when they go to school, they will not learn them there. That is a simple fact of life. If children grow up throwing litter on the ground, they can be stopped doing it at school but their behaviour will not be any different outside school unless the community attitude changes.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the whole methodology, content and subject range of primary schools are constantly changing. Every week brings a new circular with a new proposal to be implemented. Despite all this, and the fact that every teacher is subject to regular, unannounced inspectors' visits, an annual confirmation of continuance and a full and rigorous school inspection every few years, numerous influential critics continue to bay for more accountability from teachers.</P>
    <P>Primary teachers are accountable and are required to be confirmed in their position every year. School staff are required to be confirmed, at the outside, every four years, but usually much more often than that. Every teacher is visited by a team of inspectors and becomes part and parcel of the school report. That is important and is supported by teachers. In the same way that it is important to have an independent performance audit, we believe in the independence of the inspectorate. We believe we can put our hands up and say we are doing a good job because the inspectors are confirming that every year.</P>
    <P>The whole pace of change which I outlined must be slowed down and managed because it is overwhelming at present. I seek the Minister's sympathy and support in that regard. The pace of change is too fast and teachers are being overwhelmed by a tidal wave of change. Teachers and <Col N="1544" /> school authorities cannot cope with the weight of new proposals. Schools will crash due to overload if this continues. If the process of change moves too fast, it will be ineffective.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to note that I have not rejected any of the proposed changes. We are talking about the management of that change, to make sure it is implemented in a way with which everyone can be comfortable. That means determining the pace of change in a way that is acceptable. We need to manage change in a professional manner. We, as teachers, will embrace that positive change as long as it is introduced in a measured and agreed manner.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted that everyone's work is changing these days. However, teachers must do much more than accept change, we must also manage, implement and evaluate it. Not only that, we also sometimes have to design the changed models. While we have not, at this point, claimed additional money for particular new duties, we believe we have given good value for the relatively small percentage increases we got in previous programmes and that the primary service has gained massively. There seems to be a lack of awareness of this. Teachers are of the view that an independent performance audit should be put in place so that everyone can see what is happening. That is hugely important.</P>
    <P>We are now faced with another barrage of new duties, responsibilities and functions over the next five years. These are all good but will bring a huge new range of demands and will require resources. These arise from the introduction of the revised curriculum, which will be implemented over the next five years, the enactment of new education legislation this year and a large number of new proposals from the Department and the Minister on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to expect a reasonable reward for undertaking this massive turnaround. The INTO, as representatives of teachers, will be seeking a substantial increase for teachers from the benchmarking body under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. We will insist that body comes up with a decent percentage increase, which will reward the unparalleled contribution made by primary teachers to the design, management and implementation of a positive and progressive change in primary education.</P>
    <P>I hope for the Minister's support in ensuring the changes can be managed effectively. The contribution of teachers must be recognised, appreciated and rewarded. I hope we can move forward in a consensus and partnership manner, as envisaged under the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in seconding this important motion, introduced by my colleague, Senator O'Toole. This kind of debate justifies the existence of the Seanad and is precisely its intended function. The Seanad was intended to introduce special areas of expertise. It is a privi<Col N="1545" /> lege to sit in the House with the general secretary of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation because nobody could be better informed than he on this important area of primary education.</P>
      <P>Primary education is the first building block of education. Without a good, firm basis in primary education, a child's subsequent education career can be seriously prejudiced. I will not confine myself to clichés, but I do not want to avoid them entirely because they often enshrine truth. The primary education system has played a very significant role in fitting us for dealing with the unusual degree of prosperity we are now enjoying, known as the Celtic tiger.</P>
      <P>I welcome the terms of the motion. It is very important that we recognise the increasing demands on teachers and that we support them in introducing child abuse guidelines and sex education programmes. I am very glad we have nothing in this country along the lines of the infamous clause 28. I hope the full range of human sexuality will be encompassed in sex education programmes because 10% of children will subsequently turn out to be gay. It is very good to have a reinforcement of their identity at an early stage &ndash; I am not talking about propaganda &ndash; and an acknowledgement of their existence.</P>
      <P>I hope to have time to talk about bullying &ndash; I do not mean the bullying of students by teachers but the serious issue of bullying of teachers by their colleagues and principals. I would draw the Minister's attention to the existence of Teachers Against Bullying, an important organisation that has been formed. I would appeal to him to establish, as a matter of urgency, an independent arbitrator in these matters because, too often, cases of bullying are referred to the board of management which is so clearly influenced by the principal.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has made an important point about the unprecedented degree of change that we are now experiencing in education. We must consider what is currently happening in schools and the vast amount of new information that is coming into the educational system daily. These changes include, as Senator O'Toole said, the introduction of a revised primary curriculum. Last September every primary teacher received a set of 23 documents, containing an introduction to the revised curriculum, 11 curriculum statements and 11 sets of teacher guidelines. When I discovered that, I was heartily glad that I had retired from teaching, although I did not teach at primary level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know exactly what happens, however, when one receives a flood of documentation on top of an already busy day, yet one is expected to absorb all these new ideas. I am very glad to be out of teaching but my heart goes out to people who have to cope with this new information on top of an already overloaded work schedule. Teachers have also been attending in-service training, trying to come to grips with the overall approach and change in emphasis in methodologies con<Col N="1546" /> tained in the curriculum. Therein there is also human strain.</P>
    <P>It was the teachers themselves who saw the need for the revised curriculum and were actively involved in designing it. This gives it additional strength because it is not something that was imposed from outside, it was generated from the teachers' own experience. The resultant proposed content and pedagogy brings the curriculum in primary schools into line with modern European educational theory. In terms of pedagogy, we are ahead of our European neighbours, which is something in which we can take considerable pride.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Senator O'Toole on wording the motion in such a way as to establish facts and understand the situation. He has sought to make that information available to the public and to the Department of Education and Science so that when the question of remuneration arises these factors can be properly considered. It is not bullying, blackmail or the usual trade union argy-bargy. The recompense for teachers will be paid on the basis of the factual information that is derived. That is why it is important for the Minister to give a commitment to initiate an independent performance audit. It is both remarkable and wonderful that teachers are calling for such a thing. Who could say that this would not be a useful instrument in gauging the outcome of wage negotiations? </P>
    <P>Another exciting initiative which has the potential to change substantially the nature of classroom interaction and learning is the introduction of information and communication technology. On this occasion, I wish I was back in school. Despite the fact that I did some advertisements for the Internet superhighway, or whatever it is, I am ashamed to admit that I know absolutely sweet damn all about it. If I had known the kind of material that is contained on the Internet, including child pornography and how to make an atom bomb in your kitchen sink, I would have shut my 18th century drawing room window pretty damn quickly, and kept it out. I am not in any great danger from it, however, because I do not know anything about this technology, although I rather wish I did.</P>
    <P>It is wonderful that young people at school are being given access to this skill which is necessary if we are to compete in the modern world. Primary teachers have welcomed and taken on this new tool. They have undertaken this responsibility by attending various courses in their own time and, in many cases, at their own expense. I commend them on having done so because they have shown initiative. They have not resisted the introduction of new technology in a Luddite fashion, as I might have been tempted to do. They have welcomed it and have used their own time and financial resources to familiarise themselves with it in order to pass on the new expertise to the young people in their charge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> They are using this new technology to share ideas with each other via the Internet. They have subscribed to mailing lists comprising special interest groups and are sharing lesson plans, new ideas and approaches. Teachers have involved themselves in software evaluation and review. Primary teachers have been to the forefront in recognising the potential of modern technology for increasing the quality of learning experience for children with special needs. We all feel strongly about the requirement to help to bring such children up to speed by whatever additional methodology available.</P>
    <P>Primary teachers are now providing a guiding and helping hand in showing all children the potential of information technology for conducting different types of investment in the classroom. New approaches to teaching are reinforcing many aspects of the three Rs which, if I remember correctly, were reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic &ndash; or, as Lewis Carroll said, &ldquo;reeling and rising and fainting uncoiled&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These approaches have expanded beyond the three Rs into critical thinking, contact with other cultures and e-mail. I was delighted to hear Senator O'Toole refer to the teaching of modern European languages because when I was at school all we got was a smattering of Irish.</P>
    <P>Other demands being made on teachers arise from the changing nature of modern society. There are increasing demands for transparency and accountability across all sectors. The implication of such accountability for schools is tremendous. Teachers will be involved in implementing the legislative demands of the Education Act and the new Education Welfare Bill and, consequently, schools will need to be proactive in formulating enrolment policies, codes of discipline and planning whole-school curricular approaches.</P>
    <P>Primary teachers are also being proactive in teaching children about coping with the demands of modern society, educating them about the danger of drugs, introducing the Stay Safe programme and teaching them about relationships and sexuality.</P>
    <P>What about the children themselves? Nowadays, children have so much presented to them in the form of exciting technology, television images, video, cinema and Imax, and teachers have to compete with all this. They must be increasingly colourful and attention-grabbing for children as they are competing with an entire entertainment networking system that sets a standard by which children will judge them. In such circumstances children will become easily bored. Nonetheless, teachers have a huge influence on their pupils and the impact they make will last children's whole lives.</P>
    <P>It is critically important that the public is kept abreast of what is happening in schools. They must be made aware of the degree of change that <Col N="1548" /> has been taking place and with which teachers are required to cope. This can best be done through the alternating process which Senator O'Toole has advanced in this motion, which I am happy to support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to address Seanad Éireann and to put on the record my recognition of the immense contribution made by the teaching profession to the development of the education system. The economy and our society are currently experiencing success on a scale never before experienced. This success is due in no small part to the quality of our education system and the hard work of our teachers. When I am asked about this success I say that its two key elements are social partnership and education.</P>
      <P>Young people are being presented with opportunities in education and in the economy which were not available to their parents and grandparents. However, Irish people are also facing challenges to grasp the opportunities presented and, based on past successes, to continue to build even greater success in the future.</P>
      <P>Grasping the opportunities and facing the challenges also means change and it is clear that in recent years the economy and society generally have faced, and continue to face, unprecedented levels of change. These changes in the economy and society are mirrored in the education system and, indeed, in individual schools. It is in this context of change that teachers are called upon to play a vital part in preparing our children for the many and varied challenges that the new millennium will continue to bring.</P>
      <P>Changes in the education system have one overriding objective, to improve the quality of the education provided to students and their parents and, at the same time, to improve the way in which teachers are enabled to do their jobs. Irish teachers are highly regarded and the profession continues to attract people of high calibre and commitment.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the quality, morale and status of the teaching profession are of central importance to the continuing development of a first class education system in the decades ahead. However, the idea of change sometimes causes concern for people. Teachers, like everyone else, must be given the necessary supports to tackle their changing environments and do their jobs more effectively than ever before.</P>
      <P>As Minister, I will do my best to ensure that the changes which I bring into effect in the education system improve the quality of the education provided and, and at the same time, improve the manner in which teachers are enabled to do their jobs. In this context, I reaffirm my commitment to support teachers as together we face the challenges of a continually changing education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> Partnership is the key to developments in the education system and it will be my watchword as Minister. The partnership which has been an effective part of all education developments in recent years received statutory underpinning in the Education Act. Teachers played no small part in the process of consultation leading up to the enactment of the Act and, as I have said several times since becoming Minister, I look forward with confidence to continued partnership with the teaching profession as, together with the other partners, we continue with the implementation of the remaining provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>More generally, social partnership, in the form of national partnership agreements, has been vital to the economic success and increasing social cohesion of recent years. Partnership for the future is consolidated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It will confer substantial benefits on society and the economy in general and on the education system in particular. PPF will maintain our international competitiveness through policies that encourage enterprise and investment, ensure that those in work have a fair share in our increased national prosperity, substantially increase the resources allocated to social inclusion and enable us to become a learning, knowledge-based society, with the capacity to embrace with confidence the opportunities offered by technological change.</P>
    <P>PPF means many things for teachers. It means modernisation, including school development planning and school self review. It also means further development of the system of lifelong learning, whether formal or informal, with the aim of improving knowledge and skills and promoting personal fulfilment. In addition to wage increases, it includes specific commitments to improvements throughout the system, from early childhood to adult and continuing education. As far as teachers are concerned, it includes improvements in school staffing, improvements in class size in the early years and throughout the system, enhancement of the home, school and community liaison and remedial services, continued expansion and development of the national educational psychological service, establishment of a national educational welfare service, implementation of an integrated plan to tackle educational disadvantage and further strengthening of the educational guidance service in schools. PPF also includes the provision of a further 1,500 teaching posts, in addition to the 1,000 additional posts announced in December 1999. Some 900 of these posts will be allocated to primary schools.</P>
    <P>Other issues covered in PPF include the implementation of the priority recommendations of the report of the working group on the role of the primary principal, the provision of additional resources to develop a comprehensive support service for assessment and delivery of special needs education, enhanced staff development <Col N="1550" /> programmes and specific initiatives to enhance the science, technology and language dimensions of provision. All in all, Members will agree that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness represents a good deal for the education system and for teachers.</P>
    <P>Before commenting further on the PPF, however, I will speak on the achievements of recent months working with the teaching profession and the other partners in the system. The past year has witnessed a very substantial increase in investment in education at all levels. This has meant that many pressing issues have now been addressed successfully. Since taking office my essential approach has been to move quickly and purposefully, and in consultation with the partners, with a view to effecting lasting improvements across a wide spectrum of concerns. I intend to continue this approach during my time as Minister, confident that it is the approach most likely to yield success.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned the Education Act, which together with several other important pieces of legislation, most notably the Education (Welfare) Bill and the Teaching Council Bill, will provide an important statutory underpinning for the education system. Teachers have acknowledged the importance of this legislative base and have worked with my Department in bringing this important legislation to fruition.</P>
    <P>Legislation, although vital, is not enough. The principles embodied in legislation must be given practical expression through the allocation of the appropriate resources. This Government's commitment to investment in primary education is given clear expression in the programme for Government and since we took office in 1997 we have more than delivered on this commitment. Over that period, the funding for primary buildings and renovations has risen three-fold, from £27 million to over £80 million per annum. Under the national development plan, we propose to spend £413 million on primary school buildings over the period to 2006. Also since 1997, the capitation grant has been increased by £15 and a further increase of £11 per pupil will follow in the next school year, representing a total increase of over 60% over the period.</P>
    <P>As Members may be aware, I recently announced a £9 million additional annual allocation for caretaking and secretarial services in primary schools. The additional £9 million annual allocation will be used to bring the grant for schools of 100 pupils and more up to £40 per pupil with immediate effect. Schools of below 100 pupils will, from January next, receive such payments for the first time. The rate of grant will also be £40 per pupil with a minimum grant of £2,400. I hope to make further improvements in this area.</P>
    <P>Our support of the primary education system cannot, and does not, end with the provision of buildings and support services. Vital to the continuing success of our schools is a high level of <Col N="1551" /> resourcing to underpin the work in the classroom. The introduction of the revised primary curriculum is a crucial element of developments at primary level over the medium term. This curriculum, which has emerged following a process of development spanning almost a decade, involving all of the partners in education, provides a clear focus for change and renewal in our schools for the years ahead. The challenge now, of course, is to ensure that the revised curriculum is implemented in classrooms as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am aware that changes in curriculum and assessment demand appropriate professional development opportunities for teachers, so that they can become the most sophisticated leaders of learning in their schools and classrooms. For this reason we have arranged the most comprehensive in-career development programme for primary teachers undertaken since the foundation of the State. Teachers need not doubt my commitment to the success of the revised curriculum.</P>
    <P>In addition to the programme of in-career development, I have provided considerable financial aid for schools to enable them to acquire equipment for the teaching of science. I have also strengthened the initiative to promote school development planning, a process which will assist schools as they carry out their work. Guidelines on the process of planning have been distributed to all primary schools and a support team has been established. Grants have been paid to nearly 500 schools to aid them in addressing their planning needs.</P>
    <P>I have a deep committment to the education of our youngest children and have resolved to direct considerable resources to support this phase of child development. Government policy in this most important area was set out in the White Paper, Ready to Learn. Planning for the implementation of Ready to Learn is under way in my Department. Officials of my Department are currently involved in an extensive process of consultation with the partners concerning implementation.</P>
    <P>Teachers will make growing use of computer technology in the delivery of the revised curriculum. It is nearly two years since we launched Schools IT 2000 and in that time very substantial progress has been made. By now every school has access to the Internet and all schools have received direct funding for equipment and ancillary equipment and, in addition, more than 20,000 teachers have participated in training courses funded by the IT 2000 programme.</P>
    <P>In response to the success of the programme to date, £81 million is being made available over the next three years for a new and greatly expanded programme. This will include a series of ambitious targets &ndash; every individual classroom will be connected to the Internet with high speed access, the ratio of computers to pupils will be significantly increased, Ireland's teachers will <Col N="1552" /> have the most comprehensive ongoing training programme in the world available to them and Ireland will use technology to implement the most advanced curriculum support programme in the world. The funding will be £20 million in capital funding and £7 million in current funding per annum. This will bring the Government's funding for this area to over £121 million for its five year period and I am confident that this investment will pay rich dividends in due course.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that in January we launched the first ever initiative to improve reading standards. My aim is to raise awareness of the importance of reading among the public in general and, in conjunction with this, to improve the quality of the teaching of reading in all settings. I have appointed a national co-ordinator to oversee the initiative and £2.5 million has been provided for the project this year.</P>
    <P>To assist teachers as they go about their work of improving literacy and numeracy standards, I am continuing to develop the remedial service and I am glad to inform the House that every primary school now has access to a remedial resource. Issues remain to be addressed so that we can derive maximum benefit from the service. I confirm my intention to pursue these issues as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant improvements we have made over the past year, and one of which I am very proud, is the introduction of a series of automatic supports for children with disabilities. In a further development in this area, funding has been approved for escorts and for the acquisition of safety harnesses for special needs children who travel to school by bus. There are other areas of special needs that still need to be addressed more comprehensively and I assure Members that I propose to pursue developments in this area urgently and systematically.</P>
    <P>I referred to the important changes that are occurring in the education system to improve the quality of education provided for students and their parents and, at the same time, to improve the way in which teachers are enabled to do their jobs. I have also outlined the many ways in which the Government is providing significant resources, including staffing, training and financial resources, to enable teachers and the other partners to play their role in the introduction of these changes. I am anxious these changes are managed properly and introduced successfully. Senators will know that I have made tackling disadvantage a priority while I am Minister.</P>
    <P>This process involves constant monitoring to try to ensure that changes are made over an appropriate timescale and are supported by both resources and commitment. In relation to pay determination Senators will be aware of the structures, both existing and planned, to deal with such matters and will agree that we should respect the integrity of those structures and the procedures which they establish. In this regard it is partic<Col N="1553" /> ularly notable that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for the setting up of a public service benchmarking body to examine public service pay and jobs, including those of teachers. The programme envisages that unions will have the opportunity of having an input into the work of the public service benchmarking body. It is important that we do not embark on exercises which would pre-empt the work of that body.</P>
    <P>In relation to public awareness of what is happening in primary schools, my view is even more positive than that implied in the motion. There is widespread appreciation in this country of the great work being done in our primary schools. Regarding what Senator O'Toole said, this may not appear in the newspapers, but that work is respected among communities on the ground. Senators have suggested a performance audit of primary education. I have indicated that we must be careful not to pre-empt the work of the public service benchmarking body, but I am also aware of the concern among primary school teachers that change and the pace of implementation of change should be managed in such a way as to ensure that the process achieves what we all want, to improve the quality of education provided to our students. Accordingly, I propose to put in place an audit and examination of the process of implementation of change in the primary school system. Various models for such an examination could be pursued and I would be glad to consider the views of Senators in the matter.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge again the substantial contribution the teaching profession has made to primary education in Ireland. The standards of achievement and the quality of work of our schools and colleges are widely recognised and have played no little part in bringing about the present favourable climate. The Government has given us valuable additional funding and resources and I intend to use them well in the interests of the nation's children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his new Department. I compliment Senator O'Toole on this motion. It is both unusual and timely and strikes a necessary chord. I hope it initiates a much needed public debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one sense there is something defensive about the motion which reflects the current mood. It is strange to have a debate wherein the teaching profession is not so much apologising but justifying its existence. There was a time when being a teacher was in itself a badge of honour and I believe it still is. Teaching always has been and always will be one of the most worthwhile and noble professions. Good educators are among the most precious assets any society can have and a society which does not value its teachers will pay a heavy price both in the short and long term. As Senator Norris said, in some ways what we are saying is a cliché and a repetition of old truths. However, it is none the less <Col N="1554" /> true for that and we can sometimes make the biggest mistakes by ignoring the most obvious truths.</P>
    <P>A few years ago we would not have had a debate such as this. I am glad the Minister has responded to Senator O'Toole's proposal so positively and that he has left the way open for discussions on the form of the audit. I compliment the Minister on his actions, but I would not be as sanguine as he is regarding the perception of the teaching profession or morale in that profession. It is clear to any observer that the teaching profession is going through a period of crisis at all levels. There is a perception among teachers of hostility towards them and towards what they are doing and of scepticism about the value of their contribution to society. There is also a degree of self-doubt among teachers which did not exist in the past and which is very disturbing. They doubt the value of what they are doing and whether it is being appreciated. One hears of teachers saying they would not advise their own children to enter teaching and of young teachers being almost ashamed to admit to being teachers when asked what they do. I have heard these statements being made and hope they are isolated, but nonetheless this is a crisis.</P>
    <P>This motion is important because it gives the lie to teachers' self-doubting image. Senator O'Toole outlined the extraordinary changes which have occurred in teaching and the huge challenges which are being added to teachers' responsibilities. Disciplinary problems and intrusive and badly informed parents make life difficult for teachers. Teachers must now deal with problems such as litigation which never existed in the past and, in some cases, they can be exploited. They must deal with a range of issues such as substance abuse, sex education, civics and citizenship and they must often compensate for what children do not receive at home or in the wider society. They must also come to terms with the full implications of the IT revolution.</P>
    <P>There was never a more difficult time to be a teacher. That is why I find it strange that people do not hold the job teachers do in higher esteem. If this audit becomes a reality and the Minister does what he has agreed to do, we will then have some empirical, independent and objective evidence which will inform the public of what the teaching profession does.</P>
    <P>There is one issue in regard to which I am desperately critical of teachers. Teachers' conferences do huge damage to the image of the teaching profession every year and, if it were up to me, I would abolish them. The conferences were initially held for good reasons but they have now become large media events. Three or four disgruntled sound bites can set the tone for the entire week. The public see head-bangers let loose on platforms at these conferences and hear the collective whinge which rises from their midst. There is a sense of &ldquo;us against the world&rdquo;. The <Col N="1555" /> public see people who almost seem to be involved in their own sense of apartheid, people set apart from the rest of society. What happens at these conferences is utterly at variance with the attitude of the majority of teachers throughout the country and, indeed, with the majority of teachers who attend the conferences. However, we live in a media world in which dissent and disruption make the headlines while the diligent work of the majority of delegates does not receive any coverage. The impression created by these conferences does immense harm to the collective image of the teaching profession and that is very unfair to the majority of teachers. I urge teachers' leaders to find another way to do their democratic business.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole's proposal is practical and timely. There is a need to restore teachers' self-confidence and to allow members of the public to assess teachers as the people they meet on a daily basis, people with whom they interact in their schools and who are leaders in their local communities. Teachers are genuine patriots who make a very positive contribution to society and only ask to be regarded as complete citizens who do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay. Teachers merely want to get on with their work in a challenging, difficult and highly pressurised profession.</P>
    <P>Teachers pass on the values of our society. In many cases, particularly in cases of family breakdown, teachers do the work which, through nobody's fault in particular, is not being done in the students' homes. Teachers work in the most deprived areas of our cities and towns and receive little thanks for their efforts. It is time the wider society recognised the value of the work teachers do and recorded their thanks and appreciation for that. This motion represents the start of that process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well with his new portfolio. I look forward to working with him in regard to any initiatives he may introduce in the area of education. I welcome this timely motion and assure Senator O'Toole that we will not oppose it on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the many changes which are occurring in the area of education. It might be useful to consider the nature of these changes and examine the manner in which primary school teachers are dealing with them. We have the revised curriculum, changes in science programmes, new modern language programmes, intensive career programmes for teachers and the expansion of computer technology. We have the Education Act, 1998, most of the provisions of which have already been implemented and they will all be completed by the end of the year. We also have the Education (Welfare) Bill and substantial increases in the school building and capit<Col N="1556" /> ation grants. However, nobody apart from teachers is aware of these changes.</P>
    <P>The huge workload which teachers carry is never spoken about outside the teaching profession. The motion refers to the need to recognise the ever increasing demands placed on teachers by developments such as performance management, new codes of discipline, anti-drugs programmes, child abuse guidelines, sex education programmes and new systems of teacher accountability and school evaluation. If one considers the problem of discipline in the light of the various family models which currently exist, not alone must a teacher teach in the classroom, he or she must also deal with parents who come into the school to discuss problems which may have arisen at home. Teachers must act as counsellors, carers, educators and administrators and they must also be familiar with the communities in which they teach. They are to be congratulated on the huge workload they carry. I do not know whether the previous generation of teachers would have been able to cope with the changes which have occurred as well as the current generation has.</P>
    <P>Members of the public are not aware of the workload teachers undertake. If a pay increase for teachers is suggested, people point to the holidays teachers receive. They are hung up on teachers having six weeks, two months or three months holidays. Nobody seems to consider the workload involved in teaching from nine o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the afternoon. Teachers are often involved in extra-curricular activities which see them becoming involved in the social activities of their communities.</P>
    <P>Teachers' work must be acknowledged. A public relations campaign should be undertaken to familiarise the public with that work. The Minister stated that a body will be established to monitor public service pay. This will encompass teachers' conditions of work and will ensure they are kept within the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>Major improvements are occurring in the world of education and it is a busy time for everyone. I acknowledge the work being done by teachers. I congratulate the Minister and his predecessor for being aware of educational improvements. However, we have a great deal more to do which can only be achieved by working together to acknowledge the work of teachers. We must inform the public that teachers are doing a superb job and they play a significant role in towns and villages throughout Ireland. I congratulate the teachers. We will help them move forward, but within the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I ask the unions to negotiate. They will have the support of all of us in the House who acknowledge their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion tabled by Senators O'Toole and Norris. I speak as a teacher and a parent. The greatest endorsement <Col N="1557" /> I can give to the motion is that I spent 21 years as a teacher. I am currently the adult education organiser for County Galway VEC. I have tremendous respect for my boss, Mr. Conor Morris, who is about to retire and it is appropriate that I thank him for his enormous contribution to the development of education in Galway. I wish him well in his retirement. He has had many great achievements, particularly the outdoor education centre at Petersburg in Clonbur. However, much as I respect Mr. Morris, if he asked me to return to the classroom next Monday, I would have to decline because I realise the tremendous pressure on teachers which increases as the years go by.</P>
      <P>I am most familiar with primary schools in County Galway. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, who will also be familiar with these schools. These are two, three and four teacher schools and the teachers in these schools take two or three classes together which means their attention is always divided. There are no remedial teachers or counsellors in many of these schools. In the majority of cases there are no caretakers or secretarial assistants to take telephone calls, deal with the post or fill out forms. As someone said to me recently, if their school was not careful, they would be drowned in literature. It is frightening that not only do teachers have to take their classes but they must also deal with forms, statistics and so on.</P>
      <P>I am on the board of management of Lackagh national school, where one of my children still attends, and I see how teachers are involved in fund-raising, organising dances, Christmas concerts, sending circulars and dealing with parents on a daily basis. Teachers do this in their free time and with goodwill. There is no back up service for national teachers in the majority of cases. It is unfortunate that when our economy is booming and a huge amount of money is available, which is wonderful, the majority of national schools rely on community employment schemes for assistance. It is a bonus if a national school is granted a caretaker, a classroom assistant or a part-time secretary. In this day and age, it is unfortunate that we rely on schemes which could be phased out at any time. Teachers in national schools throughout the country have nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times, Uachtarán Chumann Lúthchleas Gael, Joe McDonagh, visited the schools of Galway and Connacht. As the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, knows, Joe McDonagh has been one of the greatest presidents of the GAA in the history of this great association. He visited the schools to meet the children but also to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the huge contribution of national school teachers to the development of gaelic games. They have moulded young people at a time in their lives when they can become involved in nefarious activities. It is wonderful to see young people involved in meaningful and fulfilling activities such as hurling, foot<Col N="1558" /> ball, handball, soccer, rugby and so on. The President of the GAA, Seosamh Mac Donncha, was loud in his praise of the enormous contribution made by primary schools to the development of the character of our young people.</P>
    <P>This motion outlines what should be happening. There should be more recognition of and respect and remuneration for teachers involved in shaping the minds of our young people. It is getting harder to bring discipline into the classroom and parents are becoming more demanding. Senator O'Toole, in tabling this motion, is hoping to confirm the extraordinary activity taking place and that the trust and confidence of the community can be reinforced, so that this vital data can also be made available to those who are charged with determining the rewards, remuneration and career structure of teachers.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a parent and a teacher, this is an excellent motion. From my experience as a teacher and a member of the board of management of the magnificent Lackagh national school in County Galway, where we have four excellent teachers led by the manager of Galway hurling board, Mattie Murphy, I support the teachers of this country.</P>
    <P>I have four children and I will advise them not to enter the teaching profession as it is stressful and difficult.</P>

It is unfortunate that recently some journalists, particularly those writing for Sunday newspapers, have denigrated the teaching profession. I do not think they are <i>au fait</i> with the enormous amount of work being done in national schools. I pay tribute to Senator O'Toole for the work he is doing to promote his organisation. I support the motion.</P>

      <P>Mar a dúirt an Piarsach, is iontach an gairmbheatha an múinteoireacht mar is fút féin a bhíonn intinn an linbh a bhualadh agus a fhíorú. There was a time when teachers were highly valued and respected in communities. That was a time when people had the vision of education that Pearse so eloquently summed up, when people had a different sense of values. Unfortunately, teachers do not occupy the same place in the public estimation now as they did then. For that reason, among others, I am pleased that Senator O'Toole and his colleagues tabled this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is currently a strange dichotomy. Everybody who is present at the opening of a new factory or industry or the expansion of an existing one says that job generating investment comes to Ireland for a number of reasons, first among which is the excellence of our system of education and of the products of that system. Last night on the main news bulletin on RTÉ there was an item <Col N="1559" /> in connection with the announcement of new jobs in Clondalkin in which an industrialist, asked why Ireland had won a particular industry against other competing countries, answered that it was because of the excellence of our standard of education. There is that on the one hand and, on the other, constant sniping at teachers from some quarters. It has become almost habitual nowadays among people who are incapable of reflecting on the contribution that teachers make to the well-being of this country. Perhaps they do not particularly want to reflect on this. If there is any school above any other that ought to be subjected to some kind of critical examination, it is the school of journalism. I sometimes wonder whether some of today's young journalists are capable of being positive or constructive about anything. That does not apply to all journalists.</P>
    <P>Is it not rather strange that on the one hand we value education so much and, on the other, we do not always value those who deliver that system of education? Yeats in a famous poem posed the question: &ldquo;How do you know the dancer from the dance?&rdquo;  I ask how does one know the excellence of our system of education from the people who deliver the service. It is important that we should think rationally on these issues and that we should seek to foster a culture where teachers and their contribution is valued. For that reason, I am particularly happy to support this motion.</P>
    <P>Young people grow up conscious of how their community views its teachers. They pick up attitudes and values from all sources. If they are given to understand that teachers are not very important and do not have a great input into their development, that is the attitude they will bring to school with them. That is damning, because if learning is to fruitful, it has to be a collaborative effort between students and teachers, between teachers and parents. Learning happens best when those three elements resonate and are working in tune with one another. If there is undermining, that has an adverse effect. That is something all of us in this House would seek to eliminate from our society.</P>
    <P>There is no point in saying glowing things about teachers if we do not fight for the level of investment that will enable every teacher to attain his or her full potential. The number of newly emerging demands we as a society have put on the teaching body in recent times is mind-boggling when one sees them written down in one paragraph. Because it has happened incrementally, we do not always realise the extent of it. Now that it is all put down here, it is time for us to stop and think and ask ourselves how any workforce can be asked to meet all those wide-ranging and disparate demands at one and the same time.</P>
    <P>We must have ongoing investment in in-service training. It is grossly unfair to make all these additional demands on teachers if we do not have <Col N="1560" /> a coherent system of in-service training for them. That was grossly lacking within the educational system in all the years I taught, which was until 1987. It was somehow assumed that whatever training teachers got <i>ab initio</i> was enough to keep them going until the day they received the clock. That is part of the reason there is so much stress among teachers. There is not enough investment in ongoing in-service training whereby teachers can have access to programmes to update and upgrade their teaching skills and their methodology, so that they can link into all the new concepts being imposed upon them and feel on top of the new demands at every level. If that were done, there would be a great deal less stress in education. The key point is much more investment in in-service education for teachers.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for more teacher supports by way of classroom aids and the range of supports mentioned by Senator McDonagh. A school without a school secretary is equivalent to a school that has lost a teacher, so central is a good school secretary to the working of a school.</P>
    <P>I am happy to support the spirit and the essence of this motion. If we want to retain and maintain excellence in our teaching body we have to make the investment, if for no other reason than what has happened in countries were teachers have been undervalued, underpaid and under-trained. I do not particularly want to list them. This is a country with a proud tradition of valuing education. We did it when times were bad. For heaven's sake let it not be said that we are not prepared to do it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in supporting Senator O'Toole's motion. I worked as a supply teacher in primary schools at one stage. The only thing that may trouble them is that I am going to ask them for even more. There is not enough public awareness of the role teachers play at community level. There is a lack of awareness of all that is happening in our primary schools. I welcome the fact that Senator O'Toole's motion asks that the Minister for Education and Science initiate an independent performance audit of primary education. This is very important.</P>
      <P>In the past, primary schools were extremely important as a focus for the health of the child. In our more affluent society, this role has been somewhat downgraded. The fact that we are now having to make such a serious attempt at a measles vaccination campaign is phenomenal evidence of the slowing down of the influence of schools in relation to health vaccination programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In America, as I am sure the Cathaoirleach will be aware, it is a requirement that one produces vaccination certificates before one gets into primary school. I do not want to make it mandatory in Ireland because we have been extraordinarily good in the past at getting parents to bring their children forward for vaccination, but various <Col N="1561" /> court cases and stories in the media, some of which have not been well researched or very accurate, have made parents reluctant to bring their children for vaccination. Then one arrives at a situation such as that which exists at present where among children of school age there is a serious epidemic of measles, which still causes death, although people do not seem to realise that, and which certainly causes great disability. We are in the middle of a programme of vaccination at present because of the lack of vaccination of younger children for measles.</P>
    <P>I suggest that primary schools will have to be used as a more effective way of getting leaflets to parents who already have children in schools. I apologise to Senator O'Toole, if this places a greater onus on national school teachers who I realise have plenty to do, but we must return to the way things were. Primary schools used be the only centre for sight testing, dental check-ups and every such matter. We have gone beyond that now but in view of the fact that we have got into such a serious mess regarding measles vaccination, perhaps we should look at that again. This places another onus on teachers but that cannot be helped.</P>
    <P>Another area which we must look at again in terms of primary school teachers is exercise. It is appallingly depressing to see the standard of fitness among primary school children in terms of the European league &ndash; Ireland is well below the middle of that league. That should not be the case in a country such as this. Again I must ask the primary teachers to come forward because I do not know who else will do so.</P>
    <P>I have experience of what primary school teachers have done in other areas which are important in medicine. For example, as one of those instrumental in setting up the sexual assault unit in the Rotunda Hospital about 15 years ago, I will never forget that we thought it would deal with adult rape cases which we thought would be an occasional occurrence. Within six weeks the unit was flooded with teachers bringing in children. This was not because this was a new problem in Ireland but because previously teachers had nowhere to bring these children. When the unit started there were primary school teachers arriving on an incredibly regular basis with children, boys up to the ages of 12 and 14, because there had been nowhere else to bring them. The situation was so serious that we ended up having to open units in Temple Street and Crumlin hospitals. Of course the sexual assault units have expanded since.</P>
    <P>The House debated Report Stage of the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill, 1998, this morning and so sad about the many representations I received was that the children were in very enclosed institutions where they did not have the person of last resort, the primary school teacher who might have been able to do some<Col N="1562" /> thing, to talk to. None of us will forget the McColgan case, where the primary school teacher as well as the general practitioner and the school doctor in the area were ignored for so long. Therefore, primary school teachers have serious duties. I do not like to say that they are other than duties because that is what they are, although I do not think they form part of their job description. We must take this into account and I would like to see this independent forum look at this matter. Social education of so many children in Ireland, particularly in the more deprived areas, is the responsibility of the primary school teacher, and the public is not sufficiently aware of this.</P>
    <P>Local drugs task forces are the response to the drugs problem in Dublin. Indeed, I have great admiration for the former Minister of State, Deputy Flood, who had responsibility in this area, and for the new Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, in what they are trying to do, but teachers are not sufficiently involved in this area. They are not involved in the various strategy teams which liaise with the Department of Education and Science. When local expertise is required, it is the local GPs and pharmacists who are consulted. While these are important people, I suggest that those who are involved in the local drugs task forces must have greater consultation with primary teachers. As somebody who deals with drug addicts on an ongoing basis, I know that unfortunately it is at primary school age that quite a number of children who become heroin addicts become involved in the drug culture.</P>
    <P>I compliment Senator O'Toole on tabling this motion. I regret that I am asking primary school teachers to do even more but I am sure they will rise to the task. I suggest that this independent body assess what they do because monitoring is always extraordinarily important.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Treacy, to the House. At a time when we are talking about schools, I well remember sitting beside him in secondary school many years ago. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Woods, on his new appointment and look forward to debating many issues with him over the next couple of years.</P>
      <P>I welcome Senator O'Toole's motion. It gives us the opportunity to recognise the great work which has been done by teachers for many years. It is a long-standing and deeply held belief in Ireland that education is the key to access and opportunity. Even in the darkest times of immigration, when many of our children were leaving these shores, we could be happy that at least they were leaving with the guarantee of personal success in that they had received a good education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education system has played a major part in the development of Ireland. It is a rapidly <Col N="1563" /> changing area. New technology today will be old hat tomorrow and I imagine that will continue to be the case in the future. It is essential, therefore, that the education system changes with requirements. Not only should it move with the changes, but it should also play a leading role in bringing about those changes.</P>
    <P>Today we face a major challenge in developing education needs. We are also faced with the challenge of educating the people who will be charged with the responsibility of bringing about those changes initially. While we can justifiably rejoice in many of the achievements in the changed curriculum and the greatly increased participation together with the special measures to alleviate the obvious deprivation and distress, there is still a long way to go in that regard.</P>
    <P>When a child is born it may appear that he or she can look forward to equal opportunity, equal access and equal preference. That is certainly what the authors of the Easter proclamation had in mind. The message to us is clear, we must show clear leadership and determination in this regard because there is a rapidly growing population whose knowledge is being tested on a daily basis and who need to be well educated to meet the requirements which will be expected of them.</P>
    <P>The education system has done a wonderful job to date, mostly with scarce resources. If we can say that we provided a good education system on scarce resources, in such times of plenty we should be in a position, even though there are clearly greater demands nowadays, to move ahead and bring about a greater educational force.</P>
    <P>Teachers have played a pivotal role in bringing about advancement, not least in the primary education system where the seeds are sown at a very early stage. The shaping of a student takes place at primary level and from there one can move forward towards the development of a rounded student.</P>
    <P>The motion suggests there are greater demands being placed on teachers, something which is beyond doubt and which must be recognised. The curriculum is now much wider and teachers must be rewarded in this regard. However, some teachers are going off half-cocked with wild notions as to their worth. They should leave such matters to people such as Senator O'Toole who is charged with the responsibility in some respects of fighting their corner. He and people like him are best equipped to fight the corner for teachers. If teachers continue to scream out loud the public will not respond sympathetically. If one debates the needs of a distressed teacher with a man in the street who is working 12 hours a day one will quickly be told to go to hell, that the man in the street is working 12 hours per day and that teachers work from 9.00 a.m. until 2.30 p.m. and have three months holidays. We know this is not true, but that is the perception, which is why <Col N="1564" /> people such as Senator O'Toole must be left with the responsibility of presenting the case of teachers and securing a fair and equitable position for them.</P>
    <P>The quality of primary education has proved to be one of the key pillars through which the education system has supported the development of the country, something of which teachers and those associated with the education system should be proud. However, there is more to be done in mainstream primary education and in the area of special needs. Like health and unemployment, education does not take place in a social or political vacuum. It is about real circumstances and real people and the time for early intervention is when a child is born, with the child's parents being involved in a decisive programme of action in the community which is followed through in play school. Major investment must be put in place for pre-school activities involving parents and children. It is only through such a co-ordinated action programme that genuine and long-lasting benefits can accrue.</P>
    <P>We accept that spending £10,000 at this level could very well prevent a spend of £30,000 down the road in keeping a person in Mountjoy, or a spend of £70,000 on keeping a person in a juvenile detention centre. Wiser heads should prevail and we should realise that money spent at an early age in a child's development will pay dividends.</P>
    <P>An investment in young parents and their children, which combines a comprehensive programme of education and socialisation for both, will bear ample fruit, particularly in marginalised and beleaguered communities. This investment must be continued in play-school and crèches in preparing children for their formal education. We need a greatly increased budget for pre-school services and we must involve people in the community in the provision of such services.</P>
    <P>We should no longer tolerate children leaving school either illiterate or innumerate. I was delighted that the Minister said he would channel his own efforts in that regard. He also referred to disability and the amounts of money spent on escorts on buses, etc. The school with which I work has benefited greatly from such funding.</P>
    <P>Our teachers should be at the cutting edge of any change which takes place in future, as they have been in the past. The suggestion in the motion that their situation needs to be reinforced within communities is not necessary as teachers have been and will continue to be well regarded in communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what Senator O'Toole said applies to all sectors of education.</P>
      <P>About 16 years ago the first of my children started in primary school and 12 and ten years ago, respectively, the other two children started. They all went to the same two local national schools &ndash; one boys' school and one girls' school &ndash; both of which were classified by the Department as disadvantaged. One could not but be in awe at the quality of what was done in those schools. I had my grumbles &ndash; Members would be surprised if it was otherwise as it seems to be in my nature &ndash; but the overall quality of the work of those teachers in terms of vision and imagination left one in awe. These were not all young thrusting people full of idealism, contrary to the myth of those who become tired, disillusioned and fed up. In many cases they were middle-aged teachers whose enthusiasm seemed undiluted.</P>
      <P>I served on the board of management of one of the schools for a few years during my temporary absence from the House when I had time to do a few other things. I was appalled at the budgets within which schools have to operate and the incredibly short supply of funds. I was also amazed by the levels of bureaucracy involved in achieving the most minuscule change in the school infrastructure. I suspect the cost of human resource hours involved in the determination of whether £1,000 could be spent was probably well in excess of the cash value of the funding. I know that has changed &ndash; it changed while I was on the board &ndash; but the contrast between teaching resources and other kinds of resources is one of the indictments of the way we fund primary education.</P>
      <P>The issue which arises in a debate such as this is change. There is a degree to which there is a one or two dimensional view of change in society, namely, that change is a characteristic of the thrusting enterprise sector and that resistance to change is a characteristic of the public sector. Many speeches made by senior Members of this and previous Governments are testimony to this belief. However, the reality is completely different. This morning I was at a committee meeting at which it was admitted that about 60% of Irish businesses have not sorted out what they will do about the euro, the introduction of which is only a year and a half away. Everybody in the public sector has thought about the euro and teachers, among others, are trying to come to terms with it in their school work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers have led change and have been frustrated by the pace of change. They serve on curriculum committees for every subject. Teachers do not hold up work. They have always reasonably asked that resources should be commensur<Col N="1566" /> ate with the change needed, not that change should be held back. If I and everybody else working in the technological sector of education had waited for the Department of Education and Science to put pressure on us to change, we would still be using a slide rule. Every change in this sector in terms of information technology and innovation in teaching occurred because people wanted to change and the biggest obstacle to change was usually the Department. The image of Governments vibrantly demanding change and workers in the education sector holding it back has no basis. The obstacle to change is the lack of vision at the top, not the behaviour at the bottom.</P>
    <P>All sectors of education have fostered, embraced and encouraged change but the recognition and resourcing of such change has always taken place on the assumption that people would do it cheaply. That is why the ideas that are floating around about change are entirely wrong. The Minister of State has special responsibility for science policy, yet the Government has done a remarkable job of ignoring certain sectors of education in terms of recognition and appreciation of work done. I do not want to set one sector of third level education against another. Universities have been consistently underfunded and have performed remarkably well, but I come from a different sector, technological education. That sector is so widely recognised by the Department that it does not have one representative on the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, which advises the Government in this area.</P>

The Dublin Institute of Technology, which does not want to be in the sector and desires university status, is represented but the rest of the sector, which educates the majority of people studying science and technology in this State, is not deemed to be sufficiently capable to be represented on the council.</P>

      <P>One individual from the polymer science department in Athlone Institute of Technology is on the technological foresight working group, which was set up by the Minister of State, and he is the representative of the science and technology sector on all the bodies advising the Government on its future. The body which has been set up to fund badly needed fundamental research also has no representative from the science and technology sector. Give us a break. That is not the way to recognise change, innovation or the capacity to deliver. It represents nothing more <Col N="1567" /> than the limited view of the Departments of Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment on what is education, which is that there are two sectors involved in each level of the education system. I do not want to get involved in a row but their predominant position should be excluded from the process of public discourse and policy making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. It is appropriate that he should be present for this debate. I am at sea with regard to some sentiments expressed by the previous speaker, not that I am familiar with the third level sector. However, the primary sector was the Cinderella of the education system for many years. It was deprived of resources and innovation was lacking. Leadership was also lacking not alone within the Department but also outside it.</P>
      <P>We have reached a very exciting time in primary education and Senator O'Toole should not make an apology to anybody for tabling an excellent motion which focuses the mind of everyone who has had any association with the education system on the enormously innovative measures and initiatives that have been taken, many of which he inspired. I have followed his public statements closely but I take issue with anybody who says that successive Ministers for Education have not shown initiative. The previous incumbent, the Minister, Deputy Martin, was one of the most innovative Ministers for Education ever. He brought forward new, bright and futuristic ideas in the primary, second and third level sectors. If some of the great initiatives introduced by the Department were inspired by Senator O'Toole and his peers, so be it. That reflects partnership in education, in which the then Minister, Deputy Martin, believed, and the fruits of such partnership are evident. There are none so blind as those who do not want to see, and a few such people are still around.</P>
      <P>The motion is all-embracing and focuses our minds on primary education which covers the most formative years of a child's life and is essentially the most vital period in their upbringing. It is proper that the individual charged with giving leadership to teachers in the primary sector by the INTO should challenge us to discuss the entire range of initiatives and innovations and the back-up resources which are essential in ensuring their effective, speedy and efficient implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are experiencing a new era of profound and revolutionary change throughout the primary sector. Given the function of primary education it must be at the forefront of change because it deals with children at the most formative period of their lives. These changes will be driven primarily by the introduction of the revised curriculum, information and communication techno<Col N="1568" /> logies and the pilot programme of modern European languages. I commend Senator O'Toole's leadership of the largest teachers' union and his sense of professionalism on the direction as his vision has significantly enhanced the progression of primary education in tandem with the Minister, the Department and all the other partners in education.</P>
    <P>Primary education has benefited significantly from this leadership and I am aghast at statements, bleating and baying from self-appointed INTO spokespersons who do a terrible disservice to primary teachers and an abominable disservice to primary education through the media. The voice of the professionals involved in the delivery of primary education is vested in the leadership of the INTO and it is right that the drive for change, innovation and additional resources should emanate from there in conjunction with the Department. Statements from such self-appointed spokespersons only serve to drag primary education back into the last century, out of which it has been so ably led by Senator O'Toole and his assistants. The behaviour of these individuals reinforces the veracity of the old adage, &ldquo;Eaten bread is soon forgotten&rdquo;. Some of them will rue the day in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am not here as a defender of teachers, Senator O'Toole is well capable of doing that. As has been put so articulately, the role of primary school teachers over decades, particularly since the foundation of the State, has been vital to our society. Our primary school teachers have been valued highly over the years for the contribution they have made, not alone in the delivery of primary education but also in the work they did for society outside the classroom.</P>
    <P>I gently chide Senator Henry for saying that primary teachers are no longer doing enough as motivators in our community. All the evidence available to me from the parishes in my constituency and surrounding areas points to the contrary. Teachers are motivators, leaders and volunteers. They promoted our national games, our culture and everything that was essentially Irish, and glowing tribute should be paid to them.</P>
    <P>If Senator O'Toole is correct in his perception that the community lacks awareness of the enormous additional responsibilities placed on teachers, it is our duty as legislators to ensure that the public is properly educated and made fully aware of those additional duties.</P>
    <P>Primary education has become a whole new world since I last taught in 1981. Colleagues of mine with whom I am in regular contact tell me there has been a sea change and a new culture in primary education reflecting an evolution in the delivery of primary education. Our primary teachers are being asked to enthusiastically embrace that evolution and the challenges of society, both in the workplace and in the social context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity of contributing to the debate. I commend Senator O'Toole on tabling the motion before the House. I am a great admirer of primary education. We have a fine system of primary education and a fine body of primary teachers. Through thick and thin a quality standard of primary education has been delivered to our children throughout the country. Even when the resources were poor, class sizes were enormous and there was a considerable need for changing the curriculum, the level of commitment and delivery of primary and other teachers was magnificent. That is indicated by the number of teachers involved in various curriculum committees, subject committees and so on.</P>
      <P>What distinguishes the teacher unions from all the other unions is the degree of participation on the part of teachers, not in terms of wages and work conditions but in terms of the input and substance of the material they teach. They are the initiators, the collaborators, the people who actually create the new curriculum. They are the people who form the subject matter that is being taught in the schools. It is highly commendable that that is the way forward, and I commend Senator O'Toole as the leader of the Irish National Teachers Organisation.</P>
      <P>Having said that, a statistic in the OECD report indicates that Ireland has very high levels of illiteracy. We are bottom of the pile in Europe and second from the bottom in terms of the entire OECD group of countries. We also have a poor track record in relation to the numbers who transfer to further education. These are two serious black marks on our education system. An estimate some years ago indicated that 650,000 people were functionally illiterate and innumerate, yet we are still waiting for the long-promised White Paper on adult education. That is a scandal. I am sure that figure has increased to 750,000, yet there is no indication that legislation will be brought forward to address the problem. That is a black mark on our education system. Clearly people are falling through the system, which is a good one in the context in which it operates, but it is almost on automatic pilot in its ability to deliver. The resources are not available to deal with serious problems when they arise.</P>
      <P>I want to briefly identify three areas that are creating problems. First, we have no national pre-school system of education. What we have is patchy and private. We need a national pre-school system of education for children up to four or five years of age. Second, we have 3,000 plus primary schools and 800 second level schools which are all stand alone. There is no educational body that co-ordinates them or involves them with the community. That is a serious defect. Third, there is a lack of interface between the primary and post-primary sectors and a large number of people drop out at those levels. As a result, many people do not go on to further education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> That brings me to a point made in Senator O'Toole's motion that there is a lack of awareness among the wider community of what is happening in primary schools. In many instances, the wider community is not involved in what is happening in primary or second level schools because of a lack of structures. We are responsible for that to some extent because we have not put the structures in place to involve the wider community in the delivery of education. As a result, pupils, parents and indeed the staff in our schools suffer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion. It is commendable that we recognise what has been done and that we should look towards broadening the educational service being delivered. I look forward to that happening in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator O'Toole. I support the thrust of the motion and take this opportunity of thanking primary teachers for their contribution to the nation. Each of us is a product of that system. Many primary teachers gave unselfishly of their time and resources over the years. It was a lifetime commitment on their part. That was endemic among the people who participated, particularly in the early days when the job was badly paid. Those people who taught in our primary schools, be they lay or church persons, gave enormous benefit to the young people of Ireland and played a great part in the success of the country.</P>
      <P>One of the major problems currently faced by our teachers is a basic lack of communication skills in dealing with the general public. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done in terms of more participation of parents and boards of management. There is room for much development in that regard and more initiative and experience of dealing with the general public is needed.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity of welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the House this evening. The Government has responded positively in relation to the provision of structured inservice training for teachers, capital allowance grants for schools, caretaking and secretarial assistance and administrative ways of reducing teaching time for principals. In just two years all those areas have been dealt with but we have failed to sell this message. There is continued support and commitments given in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness plan. This opportunity should be taken to enlarge and develop, particularly by the boards of management. We can get a better message across and a better response to the teachers and their efforts which would benefit pupils, teachers and parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment Senator O'Toole on the way he has represented national teachers. He has given <Col N="1571" /> them a voice in very difficult times. As the economy has progressed he has represented their interests very strongly before the Government and the people. The changes that have taken place have been worthwhile for the teaching profession and he has played no small part. These changes will benefit the pupils and teachers of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming here. I do not often raise matters on the Adjournment. The reason I tabled this motion was that it is of particular importance to Kilkenny and to the south-east area. My motion states: &ldquo;The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the extraordinary lack of investment in industry in Kilkenny, particularly in the light of a recent company closure there and the further loss of 45 more jobs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The company I am referring to is Kilkenny Textile Mills. The company has not closed down but it shed 90 jobs last year and it has told its workers that it will stop production in June. The company has been a very good employer and it provided excellent working conditions. It was a model of how a company should be run. There was good co-operation between the workers, management and trade unions. It is a pity that it will close down.  </P>
      <P>Kilkenny is an industrial base which should be targeted by the IDA. It is a suitable location for anyone who wants good infrastructure, a good base and a well-educated workforce. It has all the elements that we preach about abroad, yet we still cannot get State moneys for the area. We need that support in order to top up the jobs that already exist in the service industries with solid industrial jobs.</P>
      <P>People think Kilkenny is a prosperous and beautiful place to visit and people would like to live there. Unfortunately, we have not secured industrial jobs for Kilkenny. Any jobs that have been created have been as a result of a growth in the indigenous industry. That does not mean that there have not been other successes. The mines are a success but we need natural resources in order to have a mine.</P>
      <P>The largest port in Ireland is located at Belview. It is referred to as the Waterford port but it is based in County Kilkenny. A few spin-off industries have started up and they are very welcome in the Kilkenny area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been only one case of inward investment in Kilkenny town and that has been a company which makes ball bearings. It is an <Col N="1573" /> extremely important company which does an excellent job.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny Textile Mills is located at a well-built industrial facility which was built specifically for the manufacture of towels. As a result of bad decision-making in America and Europe the industrial estate flopped because it did not have a sustainable tenant. Since then a number of indigenous companies have set up and they are doing quite well. But Kilkenny is not getting any inward investment. There is an urgent need to provide jobs in the city, not just to replace the 45 jobs that will be lost in the coming months. There are rumours around Kilkenny about the loss of a further 90 jobs in the next three or four days and, no doubt, rumours can become fact.</P>
    <P>Many people do not realise that the average income in the Kilkenny area, at £7,483, is the second lowest in Ireland. The lowest is in a Border area. Kilkenny can facilitate a huge range of industries, from high tech computer enterprises to heavier enterprises. However, there is not one high tech industry in Kilkenny. I blame the IDA for that. The Minister must look at this.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny, with its central position and surrounded by third level institutions, although there is no third level establishment in Kilkenny, should have been able with the IDA's assistance to get inward investment. Unfortunately, there is no one from the IDA resident in Kilkenny &ndash; it is dealt with from Cork. It is not feasible for an office in Cork to respond to Kilkenny's needs. We were told by the IDA and others that Kilkenny is too small and that the bulk of industrial development will take place in growth areas such as Cork, Waterford and Limerick. As a result, Kilkenny is falling down.</P>
    <P>We have not done well in terms of foreign investment. I blame that solely on the fact that the IDA has not worked with the people in Kilkenny, who have tried everything, including setting up KIDCo, which is a development company. It has built a 27,000 square foot advance factory and new advance factories are located on an adjoining site. However, they are not being used. The infrastructure in Kilkenny is great. However, the response from Government, in terms of foreign investment, has been dismal.</P>
    <P>We in Kilkenny do not tend to say we are setting up a taskforce. However, we see that this has been done in other places around the country. When one looks at the statistics for investment and labour participation, Kilkenny is well below the national average in terms of employment by industrial sector, when one takes out agriculture, which is on a downward trend. We are well below the national average for manufacturing industry. We are above the national average in agriculture, forestry and fishing. We are below the national average for professional services and other industrial services. We are above the national average for building and construction and below it for transport and communications. We are also <Col N="1574" /> below the national average for public administration, water and gas. We are above the average for mining because we have two mines. People are not employed in the IT sector in Kilkenny because we have no IT business. Significantly, Kilkenny has the lowest take up of third level education in Ireland, although there are huge first and second level education resources in Kilkenny. This is one of the reasons we lack investment.</P>
    <P>We rate highly in terms of the criteria for industrial development and foreign direct investment, particularly roads, airports and telecommunications. The improvement of the N9 route will help. However, Kilkenny has not done well in terms of industrial development and foreign direct investment, when compared with the national position or that of the south-east region. I do not want to take Kilkenny out of the south-east region, which has not done well in the past.</P>
    <P>What is going to be done to develop industrially based industry in Kilkenny which will provide the jobs that are needed, so that we will not have to depend solely on the current service industries, such as food and hotels? We need investment from abroad. I ask the Minister to work hard, with KIDCo, the Kilkenny county enterprise board and Kilkenny County Council, to see what can be done to provide those very necessary jobs. There has been a dismal picture of job losses in Kilkenny over the past number of years. No jobs have been created in Kilkenny, apart from those in indigenous industries, in the past two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Lanigan for raising this important matter. I am very aware of his personal concern for the well being of Kilkenny over many years.</P>
      <P>Kilkenny Textile Mills, a wholly owned subsidiary of Santens NV, Belgium, was established in Kilkenny in 1983, following the closure of the Fieldcrest operation. The company manufactures griege cotton yarn for sale, mainly to its parent company. Efforts to sell to third party customers have been largely unsuccessful. At its peak in 1985, Kilkenny Textiles Mills employed 185 people. However, due to a decline in demand, employment dropped to 80 people by 1998. In January 1999, the company announced that, as part of an overall restructuring plan, it planned to reduce its workforce by 40 people. This development was as a result of competitive pressures from towelling producers in the Far East.</P>
      <P>However, the company has experienced ongoing difficulties and the decline in demand for the type of yarn that Kilkenny Textile Mills produces has led to the situation whereby, on 3 April 2000, the company announced that the Kilkenny operation is to close. This closure will be completed by mid-June and will result in 45 redundancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> FÁS has been in contact with Kilkenny Textile Mills' management and has offered to put the following services at the disposal of the company and its workforce &ndash; interviews to be conducted with all pending redundant persons, access to FÁS job vacancies and courses will be provided, information and guidance will be provided on all FÁS interventions, for example, training programmes, schemes, courses and so on and, in consultation with the company and the workforce, FÁS will consider the provision of special training programmes.</P>
    <P>The overseas clothing and textile industry in Ireland has been in decline, with employment reducing from 6,700 people in 1998 to 4,170 people currently. The underlying factor in this continued employment decline is a lack of competitiveness, particularly in the clothing sector where labour costs are high compared with alternative locations in north Africa and eastern Europe. It is anticipated the industry will continue to decline over the next three to five years, as companies continue to relocate to lower labour cost locations to remain competitive.</P>
    <P>Recent closures in the sector highlight the fact that, notwithstanding the recent success of the Irish economy, retaining competitiveness in an international context remains a continuing challenge. Ireland needs to focus its efforts on attracting industry in sectors where we can effectively compete in a global economy. That point was well made by Senator Lanigan. The emphasis must be to concentrate on upskilling and retraining the workforce to meet the demands of this changing environment. The recent budget decision to establish a major new national training fund, amounting to £120 million, in 2000 is an indication of the Government's commitment in this regard.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of job opportunities. The development agencies are now strongly focused on achieving this aim, and resources are being deployed to reflect this focus. Over the past year, IDA Ireland has expended considerable effort on reviewing its role and on planning its future strategy to ensure it continues to meet national needs in 2000 and the following years.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator Lanigan I will convey his views directly to the IDA. He had some very direct messages to deliver on that subject in regard to Kilkenny. However, it is not merely a question of jobs dispersal. The agency is seeking to bring a better mix of industrial sectors and higher value industries to locations around the country, in particular to locations that have not seen the emergence of modern industries. The agency's new strategy also addresses the need to increase the value and sustainability of overseas companies already established or about to establish in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> The development agencies continue to emphasise Kilkenny for new employment opportunities. The 43 acre prestigious business and technology park has been developed by the IDA in Kilkenny city, with two advance buildings, one a 25,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility and the other a 20,000 sq. ft. high quality advance office facility. Both of these buildings have been completed and are being actively marketed for overseas investment. The IDA will also actively market the Kilkenny Textile Mills facility for a replacement industry. I assure Senator Lanigan that the development agencies will do everything possible to try to secure alternative employment opportunities for the Kilkenny Textile Mills' workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I have raised the issue of social economy programmes is basically to establish at what stage the planned programmes currently are and when they are likely to begin operating. It is difficult to obtain information on this matter. The FÁS office in my region has supplied me with some information, however. In some circumstances one can anticipate that the social economy programmes will absorb and take over from the existing community employment schemes. I will refer later to a community employment scheme in Nenagh to which this issue relates specifically.</P>
      <P>Business-related programmes will operate in partnership with various community groups, they will be continuous for a number of years and the participants will be full time. This contrasts with the existing situation where participants in community employment schemes work on a week on, week off basis. Anyone working at local level cannot help but notice that the number of participants in community employment schemes has fallen. This is obviously due to our economic performance and the greater availability of jobs which has led to increased demand for workers at all levels. A number of people who have not held regular jobs for some years now find themselves back in the workforce, a situation which is to be applauded.</P>
      <P>The value of community employment schemes has not just been in their capacity to provide people who hitherto have been unemployed with opportunities to participate in a working environment. The schemes have also contributed to extremely important work in the community, including tidy towns and villages, GAA and other sports facilities, schools back-up services and voluntary community organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recycling scheme in Nenagh closed some months ago but it was thought that it would be re-established or replaced as a social economy initiative in the town. This explains my interest in this matter. I am also interested, however, in the wider context of establishing where the social economy programmes will work, how many we <Col N="1577" /> can expect and what their context will be against a background of falling unemployment, prosperity and rising economic expectations.</P>
    <P>Will the support community employment schemes have provided to community groups be taken up by these social economy initiatives or does the Department see these schemes continuing alongside social economy programmes? I have raised this matter on the Adjournment in an effort to establish when social economy initiatives will be up and running. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The social economy can be broadly defined as that part of the economy between the private and public sectors which engages in economic activity in order to meet social objectives. There is a considerable degree of social economy activity in Ireland and many programmes which seek to support employment or community development objectives also support activities in the social economy, including FÁS community employment and local enterprise schemes, support to partnerships under the local development programme, the EU employment initiative, child care support initiatives and funding to co-operatives located in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>However. the implementation of a dedicated support programme represents a new departure. A working group on the social economy was set up on foot of the commitment in Partnership 2000 to undertake a detailed examination of the potential of the social economy in Ireland. The objective was to undertake a detailed examination of the potential of the social economy, both in terms of employment opportunities and in the supply of services such as child care, care of the elderly and services to improve the quality of life in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The report acknowledged the role social economy activities would play in the regeneration of local economies and improving the quality of life in local communities. Arising from the conclusions and recommendations of the working group's report, the Government decided in July 1999 to approve the introduction of a social economy programme through the phasing in of a dedicated programme with effect from 1999 and the establishment of a national monitoring committee representative of the social partners to oversee the development and implementation of the programme.</P>
      <P>The national monitoring committee for the social economy programme was established in November 1999. It is chaired by my Department and is representative of the social partners and key Government Departments. Its role is to oversee the development and implementation of the programme. Three meetings of the committee have taken place since November 1999 and the committee has now finalised the framework document for the operation of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1578" /> The framework agreed by the national monitoring committee states that the social economy programme, in seeking to maximise the role of social economy enterprises in the regeneration of disadvantaged local communities, will have the following objectives: to promote the emergence and consolidation of the social economy; to maximise the potential of the social economy to generate employment that is sustainable and of high quality, subject to labour market constraints; to regenerate both urban and rural communities by providing urgently needed local services, employment opportunities and experience for people who have been distanced from the labour market; and to promote equal opportunities between men and women.</P>
    <P>The programme will be particularly targeted at disadvantaged communities, communities of interest &ndash; for example, Travellers and disabled persons &ndash; and the long-term unemployed. Under the programme a social economy enterprise will have a traded income with the profits or receipts of activity invested in the viability of the enterprise, rather than accruing to shareholders. It will be professionally managed and will be entrepreneurial in that it functions in the marketplace and has a traded income.</P>
    <P>Activities undertaken under the programme will not substitute for any activities which could be more properly funded through existing sources. A sum of £10 million has been provided in my Department's Estimate for 2000 to launch the programme and to provide initial funding for projects. It is envisaged, as in the Partnership 2000 report, that this will rise to £41 million annually when the programme is fully operational. A total expenditure of £213 million was foreseen for the programme over the period of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>Community employment has operated principally as a part-time employment experience programme, with the intention that participants would, as a result of the experience gained, have better prospects of gaining employment on the open market. In practice, many of the projects have engaged in community development or services projects which would have similar objectives to the social economy programme. However, the latter programme will fund such projects in the form of full-time enterprises.</P>
    <P>Persons employed may be engaged in full-time employment and will operate according to normal business practices. It is hoped that a certain number of the projects may become financially independent over time, either from private revenues, public contracts or mainstream public funding sources. It is expected that a number of existing community employment projects will seek funding as social economy enterprises.</P>
    <P>My Department and FÁS are currently finalising the criteria for eligibility of persons who may be funded by the programme. The next step is the <Col N="1579" /> establishment by FÁS of the local working groups to ensure the principle of partnership between statutory bodies, the social partners and local community-voluntary interests.</P>
    <P>Once they have been established, it is envisaged that community and voluntary groups will be able to apply for funding to establish local social economy enterprises under the programme. There has already been a great deal of promotional effort by FÁS and other interested organisations in the social economy as to how the programme will operate. Once the working groups are up and running, applications can be submitted to the local FÁS office and will be vetted by the local working group in each area.</P>
    <P>In summary, the concept of a formal dedicated social economy programme is new in Ireland. A great deal of work has been necessary on the part <Col N="1580" /> of the Partnership 2000 Working Group, my Department, FÁS and various other public and voluntary groups in explaining and promoting the concept. I stress that unlike community employment, where the emphasis is on gaining experience and progressing to the open labour market, social economy enterprises will provide full-time employment and valuable community services in a market environment. The social partners and the Government are agreed that if this new programme is to achieve its objectives, very careful planning and development with interested parties and potential project promoters is necessary. Funding is envisaged for the seven-year period of the national development plan. The preparation to date will pay off in the quality of projects and value for money.</P>
