      <P>I have notice from Senator Kathleen O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make funds available to upgrade Littleton national school, County Tipperary, which is in a deplorable state and in need of urgent attention.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ann Leonard of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science urgently to grant departmental recognition to the Tanagh Outdoor Education Centre, Rockcorry, County Monaghan, currently operated by County Monaghan Vocational Education Committee without any State funding.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 2, 3 and 18, motion No. 21: No. 2, the Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not exceeding 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not exceeding ten minutes; No. 3, Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000 &ndash; Report and Final Stages. No. 18, motion No. 21, resumed, will be taken from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m. Business will resume thereafter if not previously concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. Will the Leader indicate when he will have the promised debate on Northern Ireland? All sides of the House would like to have that debate in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> Last week an all-party motion calling for an examination of the current state of funding of parties and other related issues was agreed by the party leaders and the Leader gave an undertaking to put it on the Order Paper. When does he propose to do this? This is the most urgent matter facing these Houses at present. It is important that we have a definite indication that we will have a debate and that it will happen at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a matter that I raised last week, that is the question of the continuing debate on corruption and bribery and the commitment given by the Leader that there would be a discussion. Last week I raised with the Leader the importance of having such a debate before names came into the open. There seems to be little regard for due process and people are being found guilty through rumour and innuendo. I still believe what I said last week, that we should deal with this issue. There is a requirement on us, under Article 15 of the Constitution, to protect this House and its Members from bribery and corruption. This House should determine that people found guilty after due process &ndash; I stress those words &ndash; are dealt with appropriately by the House and are suspended from the House or whatever.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that on the one hand this House can suspend somebody for three days for a minor infringement of rules of order &ndash; and I am not questioning the correctness of that. On the other hand, somebody can be suspended for 15 days in another place for something which is absolutely serious and undermines the whole democratic structure.</P>
      <P>I believe in due process and that the House should protect itself. It should also protect the good names of its Members and ensure that due process is properly followed. There is no place in the House for somebody who has been found guilty of bribery or corruption after due process. I intend to table a motion on that basis in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the sentiments of Senator O'Toole. I refer the Leader to motion No. 18 on the Order Paper which refers to a register of lobbyists. There is all-party support for this motion. It could be the beginning of the House's debate on corruption and bribery that is now apparently endemic in certain quarters of the planning process in our local authorities, and perhaps much wider still. We must be seen, as a House of the Oireachtas, to be discussing here what is being discussed in every corner of this country. It would be quite wrong if we were to say that this is being dealt with by the tribunals and outside the House. It must be discussed because there are broader values and principles that have a bearing on this House and on the Oireachtas. I ask the Leader to facilitate the Labour group with Private Members' time next <Col N="467" /> week and we can deal with the register of lobbyists. It would be a very useful start to the debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn has raised on a very regular basis the issue of inflation and I do not want to pre-empt anything he might say. We have been constantly pointing out in this House that the trend of inflation does not concur with what the Government and the Minister for Finance have been saying over the past months. The Taoiseach had to admit that the position is extremely disappointing and some economists have suggested it is almost frightening. The gains made in the agreement with the social partners have been eroded and the inflation rate for the year will be double the 3% predicted by the Minister. There is a need for a debate on the management of the economy and the factors fuelling inflation.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the privatisation proposals for Dublin Bus. There have been many calls in the House for a debate on the broad issue of privatisation. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is drip feeding us with privatisation proposals which are announced every few weeks and there is a need for broader debate on how the issue is to be addressed. There are significant issues to be discussed if Dublin Bus is to be privatised. Will the Leader invite the Minister to the House to have an early debate on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole and I have raised on many occasions the need for a Garda presence on the navigation channel of the River Shannon. In this regard, the House should congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on the launch of a high speed Garda patrol boat on the Shannon this week. Today's newspaper headlines reiterate the need for such a presence in that there has been another major fish kill at Lanesboro, between Longford and Roscommon. Many illegal activities have taken place on the Shannon recently&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is not relevant to the Order of Business and the Senator should find another way to raise the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, a Chathaoirligh, but it is important that the House compliments the Minister because it has called for such a development on many occasions and has debated many issues which could have been dealt with if there had been a Garda presence on the Shannon. This is a welcome development on which the Minister and the Garda Commissioner are to be congratulated. Given the increased traffic and illegal activity on the river, it is a welcome development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years ago I raised the issue of the quality of drinking water as a result of a report issued by Friends of the Earth which is not a radical or extreme group. Friends of the Earth <Col N="468" /> carried out a scientific survey which indicated that the quality of our drinking water was below EU standards. As a result, it successfully took a case against the Government in the European courts and the Government must now impose strictly regulated means of cleaning up rivers to ensure that people have clean drinking water. Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to the House to outline his intentions in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senators in calling for a debate on alleged corruption in local authorities. However, I would not like anyone to think there is corruption in every local authority as that would be unfair to elected representatives. It is important that people are treated as innocent until proven guilty.</P>
      <P>I wish to offer my sympathies on the deaths of the two gardaí who lost their lives in the course of duty this week. Will the Leader highlight to the Minister the fact that 20% of Garda vehicles are below standard and ask him to update these vehicles?</P>
      <P>I will continue to call for a debate on An Bord Pleanála until the end of this session. This is an important issue and I ask the Leader to arrange such a debate. Whatever about corruption, it is unfortunate that the board turns down planning applications recommended for permission by county engineers and councillors. There is a need for a debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the high rate of inflation and the fact that one financial institution today forecast that it could rise to 10%, I join Senator Costello in calling for an urgent debate on the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>For years I have raised the issue of the medical staffing of hospitals. It is a miracle that hospitals are running today but I assure Senators that the strike has only been deferred; we have not reached a satisfactory conclusion. The Tierney report on medical staffing was published five years ago but no action was taken. A medical manpower committee sat two years ago but there was still no action. We will be in a dire situation by July when there will be fresh problems regarding hospital staffing, particularly outside major centres, by non-EU doctors who are finding it very difficult to obtain registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader give some sense of urgency to this issue and arrange a debate? The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has not been in his position very long but I have received petitions from neurologists and urologists and regarding industrial health medicine. The situation is no longer funny. Waiting lists exist because there are no doctors to treat people. I will be guided by what you say, a Chathaoirligh, but July is very near and no notice is being taken of what is happening in hospitals. The strike has been settled because people have been paid money <Col N="469" /> owed to them since 1997. This is ridiculous and nothing has happened as regards the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to refer to the rate of inflation which, at almost 5% and rising, is at its highest level since 1985. Will the Leader outline the measures, if any, the Government has to arrest this extremely damaging rate and to reduce it to more acceptable and manageable levels?</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran complimented the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the launch of a speed boat on the River Shannon. However, Senator Dan Kiely made a more important point calling on the Minister to ensure that there are no outdated or defective Garda vehicles. I also offer my sympathies on the deaths of the two gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the national lottery? A large group of journalists are going to Paris at the expense of the lottery. I wish them <i>bon voyage</i> and hope they have a beautiful junket. It is nice of the national lottery to take them and it is gracious of the journalists to accept the invitation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 800 families on the Maugherow peninsula, north Sligo, but they cannot get a lotto machine. There is no lotto machine between Grange and Bundoran. Cliffony and Mullaghmore are the hub of the tourism industry in the area, yet the national lottery will not provide a machine for the area which is heavily populated and which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every summer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These details can be given in the debate the Senator is seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The national lottery should outline to the House how it issues lotto machines. Does one need a magic wand to get one of them? What are the criteria? If the national lottery is not going to give rural Ireland a fair deal as regards lotto machines it is time we gave the job to someone who will respect rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for comprehensive debates on the register of lobbyists, the funding of political parties and alleged bribery and corruption, which are taxing the minds of the public. It does not inspire much confidence in Senators as public representatives that we have had to call for such debates prior to the Easter recess and again today.</P>
      <P>Before the Easter recess we also called for a debate on the increasing rate of inflation. The latest CSO report shows that it is increasing rapidly and creating great concern among financial analysts in this country and elsewhere. I hope we will deal with this matter immediately and have a constructive debate on how to reduce the inflation figures without affecting the economic success we are now enjoying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If this House is to be meaningful, it must debate the issue of bribery and corruption. The debate must be held now. One is told by Government Senators and others that we should wait until there is a conclusion to the tribunals. I do not believe we can. The Flood tribunal might continue for another two years and we cannot wait that long.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that we should not name names until after due process. There is a danger of guilt being attributed by virtue of one's name being mentioned. If we have this debate, and it should take place soon, we must be careful about how we throw names around. The Flood tribunal is working carefully and definitely towards its conclusions and it is bringing to light many matters which we have not debated previously.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello and others with regard to inflation. Not only is our inflation rate high but the inflation rate in the UK is now the lowest for many years. It is, therefore, not just a problem that the Irish rate is high but also the fact that our nearest trading partner's inflation rate is at its lowest. I have regularly sought a debate on the inflation rate and we had such a debate. The Leader will also point to the regular debates on the economy. We must keep our eye on this matter even if it is only this House that does so.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Manning's call for a debate on Northern Ireland. It is crucial that we are careful about the words we use. It might be too late to speak in a couple of weeks if we do not get the opportunity to do so immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Finneran referred to our waterways. I come from a county that is blessed with many lakes and rivers. Will the Leader allocate time for a debate on water sports and the use of our lakes and rivers? Regrettably, a small number of people make life most unpleasant for everybody else on our waterways. This problem must be addressed in a serious and comprehensive manner. I am not averse to people participating in water sports but when it is done at the expense of others I take note of that. I will not pre-empt the debate.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to come before the House to debate this important matter? Last year there were a couple of near fatalities on lakes in Westmeath. I hope concerted action will be taken as soon as possible to avoid such occurrences in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Border, midland and western regional assembly has published its programme for the next six years. There are serious deficiencies in the programme. Since it concerns 13 of the twenty-six counties, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the programme. It has just been published and sent to Europe for final approval. One striking item in the programme is an allocation of £10 million for deep sea port development in the <Col N="471" /> 13 counties. A sum of £10 million would not build a breakwater in a major port, never mind provide services for ports in 13 counties. A debate on the document is urgently required and I urge the Leader to arrange it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the doctors' strike which was deferred from today, recognition should be given to the efforts of the Minister for Health and Children last week to bring about this deferral. I am glad the doctors' organisation is more amenable to a process of change. There has not been great will in this regard on the part of that organisation over the years. It has seen the light, however, and I welcome that fact. Everybody must change at some stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Caffrey's call for a debate on the BMW regional programme. There should be an immediate debate on it. Will the Leader also arrange for a debate on the gas find in the Corrib basin off the west coast? It would be an appropriate means of assessing what benefits there will be for the west, how the region can garner benefits from the find and whether this will be another gas find where the gas will flow into the national grid and out of the country. The debate should be held in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been waiting a long time for the publication of the White Paper on adult education. I understand there is an ongoing dispute in the Department of Education and Science. That is a pity. We are approaching the end of the academic year and many teachers who are dealing with adult education would like to have plans available for their future timetables. Perhaps the Leader would inquire why this go-slow is taking place and how long we will have to wait for the White Paper. It has been on the books for the last six months and there is concern among teachers and educationists about how long they must wait for its publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the relevant Minister to introduce urgent legislation to enable owners of public carparks at hospitals, supermarkets and so forth to impose fines on motorists who park in spaces reserved for the disabled? I have received an increasing number of complaints in my constituency about greedy, lazy and arrogant motorists parking in these reserved spaces. They cause enormous grief in hospital carparks for disabled patients who must travel daily or a few times each week to the hospital. The same problem applies in public carparks at supermarkets. The grief, suffering and inconvenience caused warrant urgent legislation to enable owners of such carparks to impose fines. I call for the introduction of such legislation.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn raised the inflation issue more than three months ago in this House. At the time the impression was given that <Col N="472" /> such a debate was unnecessary. This is a serious matter. Inflation frightened us for many years in the 1970s and 1980s and we have no wish for it to increase again. Ideas could be put forward by all sides of the House to assist the Minister. It is most important that we have a debate on the matter. When Senator Quinn raised it, a commitment was given. There should now be a commitment to have an urgent debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express our sympathy to the families of the two gardaí who were killed this week, Garda Conor Griffin and Garda Gareth Harmon. They were 25 and 28 years of age, in the prime of their lives, and had completed their training for membership of the Garda Síochána, the force responsible for the orderly conduct of citizens since the foundation of the State. I send our condolences to their families, the Garda Commissioner and everyone concerned.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning and Senator Quinn asked for a debate on Northern Ireland. I will arrange for such a debate at the earliest opportune time and I note the Senators' expressions of interest today. Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Dan Kiely, Jackman and Quinn called for an early debate on the funding of political parties and of politicians. There were requests from the party leaders on this matter last week. The matter will be on the Order Paper tomorrow in the names of the party leaders in this House. I hope to inform Members in the morning of when it is proposed to have the debate. I will allow Members the longest possible time for contributions.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators called for a debate on inflation, now at 5%. I will make time available for this. It is something about which we were forewarned by the Minister for Finance in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is running slightly above that rate. As one who is actively involved in business, I can compare the rate to that which applied in 1986. I look forward to the contributions to this debate from both sides of the House, in particular from the Government side.</P>
      <P>I will also provide time for a debate on the privatisation of Dublin Bus. Such a debate would be timely. I know the Minister will be only too pleased to give an account of her stewardship, which, as I have said on many occasions, has been excellent to say the least.</P>
      <P>Private Members' business is the motion which was before the House last week. I do not expect it to conclude this evening. I expect that next week the Labour Party will use Private Members' time, as the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Senators have done, to continue the debate because many speakers have much to contribute to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> I can pass on Senator Finneran's congratulations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the new Garda patrol boat on the River Shannon. Senator Coogan called for a debate on the report of Friends of the Earth on water control and I can provide time for this.</P>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely again called for a debate on An Bord Pleanála. Recently the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, was before the House and a great amount of time was allocated to it. I understand there are over 800 Committee Stage amendments to it in the Dáil. As I said last week, I will allow time for the matter to be debated.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell called for a debate on the national lottery. I can make time available for this. I noted with interest his concern at how difficult it is to acquire lotto machines, particularly in areas of rising population and in the village to which he referred where they would be necessary from a tourism point of view from April to October.</P>
    <P>Senators Caffrey and Burke called for a debate on the report on the BMW region for the next six years. This part of Ireland has not benefited from the Celtic tiger to the same extent as other parts over the past ten or 12 years and it is an opportune time to debate the report which, as the Senator correctly pointed out, has gone to the EU for approval. I can provide time to have this debated in the next two weeks. I will pass on to the Minister Senator Burke's views on the gas find off the west coast.</P>
    <P>I can have inquiries made into the publishing of the White Paper on Adult Education for Senator Ormonde. Next Wednesday I will update the House on the matter. I can pass on the views of Senator Liam Fitzgerald regarding the abuse of parking spaces for people with a disability in all public places.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce the Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000, to this House. This Bill provides the basis for independent regulation of State airports, a sector which continues to play a critical part in the economy and supports growth in so many areas. The purpose of the Bill is to establish a regulatory body to be known as the Commission for Aviation Regulation.</P>
      <P>In total, the new commission will have responsibility for five different areas of policy. I am glad that we have a chance to discuss it here because people may think the regulator is concerned only with airport charges but he has wider responsibilities. The five areas are the approval of airport and air traffic control charges, the regulation of the ground handling market at airports, the granting of operating licences to air carriers established in Ireland, the administration of the rules governing the allocation of take-off and landing slots at airports and the licensing and bonding of travel agents and tour operators. Before the Senators interject to say that I am being sexist, the interviews for the post of regulator have been held and the person has been appointed. He is acting in an interim temporary capacity and will become the established regulator once the Bill is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before speaking in detail, I would like to outline briefly the rationale for embarking on a new regulatory regime for the area. For some time, there has been a considerable focus on the issue of airport charges. Airlines, as one would expect, <Col N="476" /> seek to have charges as low as possible to assist them to drive growth in their business and increase their traffic flows. Airports are also commercial operations and need a reasonable level of charges to meet their operating costs, pay staff, maintain facilities and fund new developments.</P>
    <P>From Aer Rianta's perspective, while a small number of relatively minor changes in specific charges have been approved, there has been no increase in the landing and passenger tariffs which were approved by my predecessor, John Wilson, in 1987. Since that time, Aer Rianta has offered a range of discounts to the standard level of charges which have helped to add new routes and new business in and out of Ireland, thereby contributing to the growth in our overall passenger numbers. Discounts are also available in relation to seasonal variations on traffic as well as aircraft parking.</P>
    <P>Given that it was signalled in 1992 by the Council of European Finance Ministers that duty free facilities would end in mid-1999, Aer Rianta always intended that the discount schemes would end when duty free sales ended. Airlines were aware of this fact. Aer Rianta took the necessary commercial decision to end the discount scheme last year when faced with substantial revenue losses which resulted from the abolition of EU duty free sales. Yesterday I brought to Cabinet Aer Rianta's results for the year ending 1999 and it will launch its report next week at its AGM.</P>
    <P>In addition, Aer Rianta decided it was time it carried out a total reappraisal of the structure and basis for its airport charges. The business has changed substantially since 1987 with the liberalisation of air travel in Europe and the advent of low cost airlines. It used to be a huge expense to travel but it proves the old adage that competition benefits the consumer. Once competition was introduced on the airlines prices dropped. Travel to London now costs much less than one-quarter of what it used to.</P>
    <P>I recognised the difficulties to which the absence of an up-to-date critical analysis of the charges issue had given rise and I saw the need for a fresh independent examination of the issue. In looking at the situation, it was clear to me that the central issue was the potential for conflict between the shareholder role, whoever was the Minister of the day, and the regulatory role and that this would have to be addressed if real and enduring solutions were to be found to the charges issue. The difficulties of having the roles of shareholder and regulator vested in one Department have been debated for a considerable time. There have been many arguments for and against the separation of those two roles. I took the decision that the best way to resolve the issue was to separate them, as most European countries have done. The UK has had a regulator for approximately ten years, as have most other countries.</P>
    <P>I therefore put to Government my proposals for the independent economic regulation of Irish airports and for airport charges to be one of the <Col N="477" /> areas of policy addressed by the regulator. This is a necessary measure for the reasons I have just mentioned and is without prejudice to the future Government decision on the strategic future of Aer Rianta. No matter what the future of Aer Rianta, the need for a regulator is very clear and stands alone as an issue of merit.</P>
    <P>The remaining area on the charges front, which has been added to the regulator's brief, is the determination of a cap for certain air traffic control charges, specifically those imposed by the Irish Aviation Authority for services rendered to aircraft at the approach and take off stages. These charges are levied at the airport stage, as it were, and are part of the normal airline costs. It was, therefore, a logical progression to include the regulation of these charges, together with the Aer Rianta charges, in the regulator's remit. Although the en route charges are also part of the normal cost base of the airlines, the principles upon which these charges are based are determined by the relevant international aviation bodies and are imposed for the use of Irish airspace as opposed to the use of Irish airports.</P>
    <P>There were also a number of other areas where the Department carried out a regulatory function, either a licensing or market access function. This led us to add to the portfolio of the regulator the areas of air carrier licensing, regulation of the ground handling market, allocation of take-off and landing slots and the licensing and bonding of the travel trade sector.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the beginning when I said there were five main areas of policy and decision-making which would be included in the regulatory commission's brief. In summary, we have assigned to the regulator all the relevant aspects from an economic perspective of the chain of events in which the carriers are involved, stretching from the licensing stage through to the allocation of departure and arrival slots and up to the regulation of ground handling and the determination of charges.</P>
    <P>The objective of the legislation in respect of the Irish airports is to ensure that regulation of charges is carried out in a manner which will facilitate the development of cost-effective and efficient services which will meet the needs of the users. Regulation is to a large extent a balancing act, one which seeks to address the interests of the parties being regulated and the rights and requirements of the users of the services supplied by those parties. The central issue in relation to regulation is how to achieve that balance. I suppose it is not possible to achieve a proper balance for all sides.</P>
    <P>In terms of Aer Rianta, the State airport authority, we have sought to provide that regulation takes into account the various aspects of its role and function. Before framing a prices cap, the commission will have regard to the necessary levels of investment in airport infrastructure, reasonable rates of return on capital employed and the level of Aer Rianta's operating costs, including their employees and so on. From the airlines' per<Col N="478" /> spective, we have sought to ensure that the reasonable interests of users of airport services are catered for. In particular, the level and quality of Aer Rianta's services as well as its effective use of resources will be an important part of the analysis conducted by the commission prior to making a decision on charges. The views of the airlines will be an essential element of the commission's work. Before making a determination on charges, the commission will be obliged under the legislation to engage in a consultation process with all interested parties and is further obligated to outline in a published report the basis on which a determination is made.</P>
    <P>In relation to the commission's role in air traffic control charges, we have introduced measures in the Bill which will balance the competing interests of the service provider and the service user. Among those issues are the levels of investment in services by the Irish Aviation Authority and the quality of the service from the user's perspective. I will leave aside the charges issue to outline the key elements of overall thinking in framing this initiative. I have endeavoured to strike a middle ground but it remains to be seen if on Committee Stage here and in the Dáil other ideas will be put forward which I can certainly consider.</P>
    <P>The route I have chosen draws in the required combination of measures to allow for regulation to take place in that middle ground area. The Bill contains specific references to issues to which the commission will have due regard such as policy concepts in the Department's strategy statement and so on. All the interested parties and relevant Government Departments were consulted. The Bill is framed to provide the commission with the appropriate level of flexibility and discretion in approaching the task of setting a charges cap. However, this flexible approach is predicated on the regulator operating in an open and transparent manner so that the certainty and clarity required by the regulated entities and the sector in general is an inherent part of the process.</P>
    <P>Clearly there must be accountability. This is one of my hobby horses on which I dwelt when dealing with telecommunications legislation in this House. The 1996 Act, which set up the present telecommunications regulator, who is very highly motivated and able, does not include any accountability measures. The regulator was right in saying that she could not be compelled by law to come before an Oireachtas committee. Nevertheless, she did choose to come and has been a very good contributor to it. This Bill provides for accountability because it would be madness to lop off a huge segment of Irish life, in this case, telecommunications, and say the Minister is no longer accountable, and nor is anybody else, when the decisions being taken are intrinsic to everyday life. Similarly, when we dealt with electricity last year we provided in legislation for accountability. Now we are including such provision in this Bill. Not alone must regulators appear before Oireachtas committees whenever <Col N="479" /> they are called, their reports must be transparent and their policy objectives clear.</P>
    <P>This is an issue that has already arisen in other European countries and it will arise increasingly here. Where we have open markets and liberalisation there has to be regulation, but regulators must be accountable. It would make no sense to abrogate democratic responsibility, to give it to somebody else and say that we need never talk about it again. That would be all wrong. I issued a paper setting out a comprehensive set of policy proposals on governance and accountability, on which we received 28 submissions, some of which have been printed. Now we will move to legislate. That is about regulation in general.</P>
    <P>This is the first legislation establishing an independent regulatory office. When we were dealing with electricity last year we did not have the policy proposals. This Bill includes the recommendations from the proposal process which include in particular the issues of transparency, independence and accountability. Independence and accountability are two sides of the same coin. It is important for the development of the market that there is confidence in the whole regulatory process. This is achieved by ensuring that a regulator has the necessary independence to do the job in the manner in which it should be done. That is not the same as saying that a regulator's office is free to behave as it sees fit in all respects. It would not be acceptable in a democratic environment to give to a regulator quite considerable powers and not make him or her accountable for the performance of their functions. I am confident that we have struck the middle ground in these proposals. Again I await with great interest what people have to say.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the main provisions of the Bill. Sections 1 to 4 contain the standard provisions. Sections 5 to 7 provide for the establishment of the commission and for its independence. Sections 8 and 9 assign the other four functions. Section 10 provides for ministerial authority to issue policy directions of a general nature. Section 11 provides for the appointment of the members of the commission. It provides that a commissioner may be removed by the Minister, who shall inform the House of the reasons for removal. Additionally, the established policy of prohibiting employment in the regulated industry for 12 months after leaving office has been continued.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 provide for the recruitment of staff by the commission and the appointment of a deputy commissioner. Section 14 empowers the commission to engage consultants if it wishes. Section 15 addresses the issue of ethical behaviour and controls on staff interests. I drew attention to the importance of these measures in the policy proposals document. The commission is obliged to publish a code of conduct in respect of staff members which will provide guidelines for staff behaviour in respect of business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> Section 16 outlines the usual prohibition in respect of election at local, national or European level. Sections 17 and 18 place a requirement on both members of the commission and staff or consultants to make an initial declaration as to their interests and to make ongoing declarations of interests as appropriate. There is a potential for conflict, or a perceived conflict, between the work of regulatory authorities and the other interests of persons who become members or employees of such bodies. That came up a short time ago in relation to telecommunications.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the standard penalties for the unauthorised disclosure of information. Sections 20 and 21 allow for the creation of superannuation schemes. Sections 22 to 25 provide for the resources and revenues of the commission. In line with arrangements for existing regulators, my Department will provide for the start-up costs in terms of staff, premises and equipment. These costs will be recouped when the commission is up and running.</P>
    <P>It is intended to assign staff from the Department to carry out the functions being transferred. These officers will remain staff of the Department. That is how the staff wish it to be. I had several meetings with staff members in the telecommunications offices and this has been worked out. This arrangement ensures the continuity of staff experience, something which is very important.</P>
    <P>The main provision in relation to funding is the commission's power to impose a levy on the regulated entities, subject to the obligation to set the levy at an amount which just covers the operational costs and expenses of the office. The commission may borrow money but the Department of Finance has a say in what it may borrow.</P>
    <P>Financial reporting is an important mechanism for ensuring propriety, transparency and accountability. Section 26 deals with the reporting measures in terms of financial accounts. The format of these is to be agreed with my Department and the Department of Finance. They will be subject to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Section 27 places a requirement on the commission to report to the Minister whenever requested to do so. Section 28 empowers the commission to require the separation of accounts in respect of any activities regulated by the commission. Section 29 gives scope to the commission to deal directly with its requirements for office premises. Section 30 provides that the commission shall have a seal which shall be used to authenticate documents. I hope it will do so by encryption.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with the primary purpose of the legislation, the regulation of airport and air traffic control charges. Section 31 outlines the scope of the regulation. It will apply to airports having more than one million passengers annually. This threshold may be varied by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>Section 32 outlines the nature and scope of the regulator's role. The framework in which a deter<Col N="481" /> mination is made is laid out. Section 33 outlines the regulatory objectives which will be addressed by the commission prior to making a determination on airport charges. Section 34 amends the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998, by substituting the commission for the Minister. Section 35 deals with the regulation of aviation terminal services charges. Section 36 sets out the broad policy framework. Section 37 amends the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993. Section 38 addresses the issue of the review of decisions by the commission. It is provided that the only avenue of challenge is by way of judicial review. I do not know about that. It is something that will be examined on Committee Stage both here and in the Dáil. Most determinations have an appeal mechanism.</P>
    <P>Section 39 is an enforcement procedure whereby the commission may apply for a High Court order to ensure compliance with its decisions and requests. Section 40 is a standard procedure outlining methods by which a notice may be served on interested parties. Section 41 governs the role and powers of authorised officers. Section 42 empowers them to procure a search warrant if necessary. Section 43 provides the standard indemnification in relation to the bona fide performance of his or her duties by a member of staff. Section 44 provides that, in line with company law requirements, any offence committed by a body corporate with the knowledge and consent of a director or officer of that body shall be regarded as an offence committed by that person as well as the body corporate. Section 45 provides that in line with usual practice, summary offences are prosecutable by the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 46 amends the IAA Act and section 47 provides that the commission will be subject to the freedom of information legislation. Section 48 amends a typographical error in the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998. Section 49 amends the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1973, by inserting a provision in relation to the power of arrest for air rage offences.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I will summarise where we are in the overall aviation picture. All plans are made up of a number of different steps and stages, and the aviation picture is no different. I spoke earlier about Aer Rianta and we are considering all its proposals. It is fitting that I pay tribute to the very important role airports play in our economy and to the hard work and dedication of the people at all levels in State and other airports who have helped to make them a success story. As an island nation we are critically dependent on efficient, reliable, cost effective airports which can meet the demands that our growing economy continues to make across all sectors. The measures in the Bill recognise the role which our airports have to play in response to those demands.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Irish Aviation Authority, we are all aware that Ireland has rightfully enjoyed a good reputation as a provider of quality, safe and <Col N="482" /> efficient air traffic services. Those attributes will continue to be important under the regulatory regime. I am always afraid to say our airlines or railways are safe for fear of anticipating an unfortunate incident.</P>
    <P>On the Aer Lingus front, the Government decided, against the backdrop of a liberalised aviation industry, the requirements of a single European market and the commercial requirements of a modern airline, that the best way forward was to put in place arrangements for an initial public offering of the company. Preparatory work is going on to facilitate this process. I hope developments will take place towards the end of this year or the beginning of next year. This will depend on the state of the markets. A flotation will not take place if the time is not appropriate.</P>
    <P>The regulatory measures which the Bill is putting in place are a key element in the aviation picture and one which will help to bring about, in tandem with other initiatives, the attainment of our objectives for the sector overall.</P>
    <P>Across party lines, there is a great belief in our airports. Apart from the smaller regional airports, all of which are doing well, the State airports have a very good record of providing an excellent service. There has been a wonderful mingling of ideas and initiatives among board members, State employees and successive board chairmen. Ministers hold responsibility for a short time but the permanent government remains. I commend the civil servants who have dealt with airport regulation for many years.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I thank the House for the courtesy extended to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>A commission of three is to be appointed. In my speech I referred to the chairman of the commission as the regulator. It was decided to spread the burden of regulation among the three members of the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. This is extremely important legislation. It is known that Mr. Bill Prasifka is the appointee-in-waiting and will be appointed when this legislation is enacted. I accept that he will need assistance because much research and study will be required to ensure balance and fair play between the customer and supplier of the service. The Department has been doing this work for many years. The conflict of interest which has existed because of the interest of the Department in the national airline has been removed and I welcome this. The Minister can now look at the position of Aer Rianta in a different light while the regulatory function of her Department is assumed by the regulator. I hope she will take this into consideration when she continues her examination of the Warburg Dillon Read report. I suggest that she place that report on a shelf at the back of her office and leave it there. I suspect she may have done so already and I would commend her if she did so. I do not expect the chairman of Aer Rianta to agree with me but I suggest that we, the politicians, put pressure on him in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am amazed to discover that the Bill deals with infrastructure on the ground and not with a wider range of issues relating to aviation. I expected the Bill to deal with the quality and safety of airlines and air traffic control. I realise those matters are dealt with in other legislation but why are all aviation matters not dealt with in a single Bill? This would give the issues clarity.</P>
      <P>Charges are fundamental for the viability of airlines and airports. I will be interested to see the effect of the abolition of duty free sales at airports on Aer Rianta's profits. The abolition will have specific effects on certain airports. I speak in particular of Cork and Shannon Airports. The initial legislation to establish the airports and Aer Rianta contained a social dimension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides the Minister with the power to give general policy directions to the commission. That is very important. Given that we are an island nation and that transport is such a key part of the economy, especially the cost of transport from the peripheral regions to the Continent, it is important that the Minister will use section 10 to give a focus to balanced regional development as it affects airport policy, including charges.</P>
      <P>Some would argue that such an approach would be contrary to EU regulations. However, the EU has a regional policy and issues regional policy directives. We should not confine ourselves to aviation regulations. We need to look at how the regulations impact on regional development. I am sure the Minister and her Department will be in a position to integrate these aspects and will advise the commissioner on how to use them to best advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> The Minster referred to the historical background to the legislation. In the 1950s and 1960s Shannon Airport subsidised Dublin Airport. The Minister can check the records to establish that. It is important that the three airports &ndash; Cork, Dublin and Shannon &ndash; are maintained as an integrated unit, that there continues to be an interdependence between them and that one assists the other with regard to infrastructural development. Good work is ongoing on this aspect in all three airports and I hope it continues.</P>
    <P>We need to ensure that more cost effective airlines use Shannon and Cork Airports to bring more people to the regions and provide greater access from these areas to commercial points in mainland Europe. At present access costs to certain parts of England and Europe are prohibitive, which is unacceptable. I hope the Minister will address that. I compliment her for engaging in extensive tours of all the airports. She has met various interested parties on a variety of matters. She should be aware that inaccurate information on certain airports has been given to her by certain groups.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 and 18 provide that commissioners, staff members and consultants must make a disclosure of interests where they have a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in any matter which is to be considered by the commission. The importance of that cannot be underestimated. It is vital that these provisions are abided by.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section dealing with unauthorised disclosure. It is very important to have confidence in a reliable staff within the commission and that disclosure of information is not used to the advantage of competitors of airlines or airports. It is also important that those involved are above board and are not open to influence other than to the views expressed by the Minister on the public good.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister elaborate on what is meant by section 23 which provides that the commission may make regulations imposing a levy on relevant undertakings to fund the operating costs of the commission? How does it intend to secure such funding? It is an important section.</P>
    <P>Section 33 refers to the policy objectives to be addressed by the commission in determining airport charges. If the Minister were to use this section as the only definition for policy objectives she would, when making decisions in this area, be confined to the provisions set out in section 33 (<i>a</i>) to (<i>g</i>). These deal with detail such as capital, profits, costs incurred and the cost element of running an airport, rather than the broader regional policy development issue. That is not mentioned in this section. I ask the Minister to include a provision that will give her the scope to look beyond the issues raised here. This is necessary to enable the concept of balanced regional development to proceed. It must be included in the overall policy objective.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the special concessions on charges, which could have been given to air<Col N="485" /> lines, have been lifted by Aer Rianta. Some may disagree with that. Special concessions were granted to airlines starting up at Shannon Airport or to airlines starting a new route from the airport which brought in additional passengers.</P>

      <P>Special concessions were granted to airlines in relation to new destinations. They have now been lifted and will no longer apply. Their removal creates a disadvantage for airports such as Shannon. I hope the Minister will look at this.</P>
      <P>On the question of airport terminal service charges, Dublin Airport is a money spinner. The volume of traffic through the airport is huge and the higher the volume the lower the cost per passenger. The same volume of traffic does not use Cork or Shannon airports, yet a similar infrastructure is required. The cost of maintaining it on a <i>per capita</i> basis is higher and this could create difficulties for both airports. I hope it will not hinder their development nor the volume of passenger traffic using them. There is a worry that airlines will use Dublin Airport in preference on the basis that Cork and Shannon are more expensive. We must be vigilant in ensuring that this does not arise. Current free market conditions allow airlines to make such decisions but they have not been made under the Minister's jurisdiction. It is important that the present position is protected under the new regime.</P>
      <P>While it may be argued that these developments are inevitable because of EU policy, it is important to note that there is a regional development aspect to all levels of EU policy. The argument that we are the only island nation in the EU has been repeatedly made in this House, in the other House and elsewhere. We raised the difficulties of a transport infrastructure for an island nation with the then EU Commissioner for Transport, Neil Kinnock, when he visited this House. We get a stock reply to these concerns to the effect that mobile infrastructure cannot be grant aided whereas fixed infrastructure will. Support will be given to the ports but not the ships. I am sure the same applies to air travel &ndash; support will be given to the airports but not the airlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to continue to make our case in Europe, because it is unfair that we, as the only island nation, have to go by sea or air to get to <Col N="486" /> mainland Europe when others have the facility of road transport. We are working at a disadvantage. This important matter which must be consistently and continuously highlighted.</P>
    <P>With regard to the staff of the different airports and how they are treated, I am very concerned that certain sections of the Minister's speech and its general direction might suggest that there is a move towards an IPO or a consideration thereof. Some sections of the Bill and elements of the Minister's speech might suggest that. It is very important that the staff of Aer Rianta are fully protected and that the support systems in the airports, such as flight kitchen support whereby airlines are serviced from flight kitchens operated by Aer Rianta, are protected. I hope that the aviation regulator or commissioner will not have any control over the costs of servicing the airline, such as providing meals and other services required on landing. The regulator should not have a say in that aspect of the business. Those aspects should be left to Aer Rianta who are managing the airports well. Such facilities should remain in their control and under their management.</P>
    <P>On the fixing of prices and the assessment, the formula is very clearly defined and section 32 goes through the airport charges, how they should be decided and the length of time for which they shall be in force. It is important that there is a specific methodology under which the decision will be taken on how charges will be allocated and decided.</P>
    <P>With regard to airlines who provide services with low cost fares, there were discussions and court cases concerning Dublin Airport and the slots provided to Ryanair as against those for Aer Lingus. Fair play should be seen to be applied across the board. Aer Lingus works with certain airlines but not with others and will do ground handling for certain airlines but not for others. It is important that Aer Rianta should service all airlines equally to provide the best value for the customers and the passengers. This matter should be examined by the Minister. We will return to the finer details of the Bill in due course.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome this important Bill which is urgently needed, as she has so strenuously asserted and with which I agree. I am delighted she has initiated it in Seanad Éireann. It is a quite substantial Bill with 49 sections. Recently, the aviation debate has been publicly aired with increasing frequency, particularly between Ryanair and Aer Rianta. It has taken on a significant robustness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has received voluminous submissions and counter-submissions relating to the issues. I assure her that the members of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport have also received voluminous submissions. If I thank her for anything <Col N="487" /> today on behalf of the country, it is for the measures she is now taking that will hopefully eliminate the need for these voluminous submissions and the mountains of paper which her Department must have, which politicians must read and on which we must exercise judgments and that we can proceed with other matters. I am fully confident that the innovative initiative she is bringing forward today will quickly eliminate the robust marketing exercises that have continued apace. Over the past year or two, the media have also joined in this debate, as the Minister is well aware.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on the speed with which she has confronted these issues in this Bill. Essentially, it is a case of the shareholders' role versus the regulator's role and she has gone into that in some depth. I will not presume to do so. There is also the issue of regulatory accountability on which the Minister published a policy proposal recently.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the controversy in the newspapers, in particular Ryanair publicly airing its concerns on charges. As an airline it felt that it needed to have the lowest possible charges to enable it to drive growth and to bring in new business. That is a fair point of view. The Aer Rianta point of view is the other side of the coin. From an airport authority's perspective, it must have reasonable charges to fund capital expenditure to enable the development of infrastructure and to provide more modern and up to date services. The argument of these seemingly divergent objectives of the main players involved have been ongoing for some time.</P>
      <P>At this early stage it is appropriate to remind ourselves of a not insignificant fact about airport charges. The charges, for example, that were approved in the late 1980's are, more or less, those still in place today. Additional charges have not been approved since then by the relevant Minister. On the contrary, over that time Aer Rianta brought in a number of discounts for the airlines and the standard rate is at a discount for various reasons. It took these initiatives mainly to drive new growth and to create new routes.</P>
      <P>In the midst of all this controversy, previous Ministers did not decide to confront the issue &ndash; I am sure I will not be corrected on that. If memory serves me correctly &ndash; not that it always does with the greatest degree of accuracy &ndash; I recall the previous Minister but one threatening to serve or foist doses of salts on these protagonists. Since I have no expertise in the areas of shareholder role versus regulator role, my poor interpretation of the English language still fails me on what doses of salts could do to commercial or semi-State organisations, such as Aer Rianta and others. Anyway, the salts did not appear to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not presume to take issue with her on it and I will very humbly acquiesce.</P>
      <P>On a more serious and relevant note, the Minister decided at a very early stage in her administration that a fresh, modern approach was required and to put fair, reasonable and balanced mechanisms in place to thrash out the issues in an objective manner and adjudicate on them once and for all. The Minister decided to create an independent regulator whose main functions and focus will be the creation of an independent regulation of the services. I am convinced that the regulator's work will put to bed, once and for all, the ongoing, old arguments that it was not fair that the shareholder and the regulator were one and the same, as the Minister mentioned. It is obvious from the Bill that the Minister has decided the time is right to have an independent regulator, to examine all the issues and to make independent, transparent decisions on them with leave to appeal, for which there is a mechanism in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is judicial review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, judicial review. The regulator will be the final arbitrator reporting to the Minister and the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport. That is a very important initiative she has taken, a provision which was omitted from a similar Bill in 1996 dealing with a different service.</P>
      <P>This fresh new approach is an excellent idea. The regulator will be non-partisan and will take a fresh look at the issues involved. The Minister put her proposal to Cabinet last summer, received the go-ahead and immediately set about putting the heads of the Bill together. In the meantime, she also appointed a regulator designate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to hear her mention the other new functions which she has assigned to the new regulator. I will not repeat them &ndash; the Minister referred to them in great detail &ndash; but the regulator will have a broad and important portfolio of responsibilities. The main issue of airport charges caused much grief during the years and came to a head vociferously in recent times. Until now these functions have been performed extremely effec<Col N="489" /> tively by the Department but they require ongoing monitoring. The Minister has correctly and wisely decided to assign them to the regulator. I commend her for doing so. This will allow her and her officials to focus on other areas where new initiatives are required and policy reviews need to be conducted.</P>
    <P>I understand staff are to be transferred to ensure continuity in the performance of these functions, which have been performed extremely well with one or two minor exceptions in recent years. I refer to the travel agency sector in which a number of travel agencies collapsed causing much grief, hardship and inconvenience to the travelling public. In this context the bonding scheme put in place by the Department has proved extremely effective.</P>
    <P>The abolition of duty free sales has been frequently debated since 1997. My esteemed colleague on the opposite side of the House contributed on a number of occasions to the debate, in which all parties spoke with one voice. The resulting loss of revenue presents huge difficulties for Aer Rianta in terms of future capital investment. The Minister has conducted an indepth study of the development of our airports, which need a revenue stream. We will not shed tears for it today as it is a strong and robust organisation, but given that prices have effectively been frozen since 1987 Aer Rianta is, to some extent, in trouble. Given the conflict between being a shareholder and a regulator one is talking, on the one hand, about pumping money in and, on the other hand, being seen to referee an increasingly competitive market, in which Ryanair is an aggressive player. This makes the issue much more complex.</P>
    <P>Against this background the Minister and the Department have, as a primary function, the unenviable task of ensuring a mechanism for the development of the infrastructure of our airports, in respect of which my esteemed colleague on the opposite side of the House has made many suggestions. I will outline some of mine on Committee Stage. From an economic standpoint, this is critical. I concur fully with the Minister and my esteemed colleague that, as an island nation on the periphery of Europe, we depend extremely heavily on our airports in terms of tourism and international trade and commerce. The more the economy grows the more we will depend on them. It is therefore logical that the services and facilities they provide have to be upgraded, modernised and widened to meet increasing demand.</P>
    <P>It is of crucial importance that the correct balance is struck in whatever policies are implemented and in whatever structures or mechanisms are put in place in trying to meet the future needs of Aer Rianta and in ensuring the presence of cost-effective and efficient airline services. If our costs are prohibitive, no one will come here. One of the great strengths of the Bill, in confronting by way of an independent regulator and commission some of the issues which have been left to fester for far too long, is that it <Col N="490" /> does not prevent the future development of our airports.</P>
    <P>I intend to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage which I hope the Minister, given her good nature, will be in a position to accept. They will afford me an opportunity to tease out my concerns about a number of specific areas which I do not want to deal with today. I welcome the manner in which the Bill provides that the office of the regulator will operate in a transparent&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome and commend the Minister on the manner in which the Bill provides that the office of the regulator will operate in a transparent and open way. This should lead to strong public confidence. The Bill also provides for full consultation, publication of outcomes and reasons for certain decisions and accountability &ndash; very important in an area such as this &ndash; through an Oireachtas committee. The Bill further gives the Minister the power to retain the right to give general policy directions. This is vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the future development of our airports which will inevitably raise questions about future ownership, I welcome the Minister's strong assurances that the introduction of regulation in the five areas outlined in detail by her in no way pre-empts, prejudices or inhibits ongoing consultation on the future of Aer Rianta. The Minister is obviously fully convinced that a strong and robust regulatory system is urgently needed. I believe she is correct. She has made no secret of the fact that there is a big issue to be decided. She is cur<Col N="491" /> rently studying the report compiled by Warburg Dillon Read&mdash;</P>

From his professional background and experience he is obviously eminently well qualified to adjudicate on what will undoubtedly be ongoing and robust debates between the main players. I wish him every success in the challenging times ahead.</P>
      <P>Not alone is the Minister's decision to appoint a regulator and commission extremely important in confronting an issue which has been left to fester for too long, so too is her recognition that a regulator needed to be appointed prior to her final deliberations on the future of Aer Rianta. She is focusing on the correct issue, the need for regulation in certain key areas, which was diverting her from her primary role which was the promotion of the Irish economy through the resources available under the Minister's administration, namely, the airports of Ireland. The establishment of a regulator and his commission enables the Minister to continue towards the finality of her deliberations. She will make her decision after examining the consultants' report and her own study. I wish her well and commend the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is connected to airports which are very important. We do not recognise their importance until something goes wrong. I remind Members of an incident that happened in Liverpool yesterday. A plane travelling from Manchester to Belfast had to circle Liverpool for three hours before landing. People had their fingers crossed that nothing would go wrong. It was asked later why they went to Liverpool rather than Belfast, Manchester or somewhere else. That question was answered. The captain probably based his decision to land in Liverpool on his confidence in that airport. It is a reminder to us that we take things for granted until something goes wrong. For example, when we turn on lights and power we assume that there will be electricity to do so. It is seldom that something goes wrong with the <Col N="492" /> ESB but we do not appreciate it until something goes wrong.</P>
    <P>Last year there was havoc in the British passport office when it could not provide passports. We do not appreciate our Passport Office until something goes wrong somewhere else. Our Passport Office works very well and efficiently.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister. Normally my style is to welcome a Bill also and all too often to suggest that it is long overdue. Unfortunately, I am in a quandary over this Bill. No matter how hard I try I cannot find a good reason for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the shareholder regulator and trying to keep one person dealing with two roles? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Minister through that. I hope she will listen to me and decide that I am right and not go ahead with it after Second Stage. That is how confidently I believe in what I am saying.</P>
      <P>We have had a long and, for the most part, successful tradition of hiving off commercial functions from Departments. The postal and telephone services were once an integral part of the Department of Post and Telegraphs. The broadcasting service was also part of that Department if we go back even further. First RTÉ or Radio Éireann was hived off at the end of the 1950s. After 25 years An Post and Telecom Éireann were set up.</P>
      <P>The principle behind the hiving off was a good one. The Government wanted to put distance between itself and the day-to-day running of what was predominantly a commercial service. That move was worthwhile and very successful in most cases. As a result we have given birth to a clutch of State-sponsored bodies. Their status has meant that they enjoy a freedom of action and the knowledge that they need to serve their customers. They would not have that freedom if they were still part of a Department. Some of these State-sponsored bodies have moved completely into the private sector through privatisation. I am delighted to hear the Minister is suggesting that further steps could be taken in that area with regard to transport. Whenever that status seemed to be the best way of fulfilling the Government's mission they used it. So far so good. The principle of separating a Department and providing a commercial service is clear and easy to follow. We have done that very successfully with a number of semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>Equally there was a clear principle behind the setting up of purely promotional bodies such as the IDA and Bord Fáilte. They were not carrying on a commercial function. They needed a commercial ethos in order to fulfil their mission well. The Government has done very well with those bodies. There is a clear justification for having promotional agencies as free standing entities rather than as part of Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is when we come to a third type of body that we arrive on ground that is not quite so clear. <Col N="493" /> This is when you set up a body primarily to have it independent of Government. It is a public body and it carries out a public service function. It is sponsored by a Department but it is deliberately set up to be independent. A good example of this is the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. This office is independent of the Government but it is accountable to the Oireachtas. It acts as a watchdog and monitors the way the Government spends our money, the money that the Oireachtas pledges to it in Votes. Similarly, the Office of the Ombudsman is independent of the Government. This means that citizens can lodge an appeal with an independent person if they feel they have been treated unfairly by the Administration. My third example is the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. There is an obvious need for this office to be independent of Government since the Government or a future one could be massive abuser of the information that is stored in the data network.</P>
    <P>I have explained my case and given three types of bodies. We start to run into difficulties when we come to a subset of these independent offices. These are the independent regulators where the Government hives off not the responsibility to provide a service nor a watchdog function, but the central core function of Government itself, the regulation of an industry or sector. A characteristic of these regulators &ndash; a worrying one as some people would suggest &ndash; is that they seem to be answerable to no one. Independence cannot go any further than that. There is a reason for doing that in some of the cases I have mentioned. The need to create these regulators arose with the shift away from public monopoly in public services like telecommunications. Originally the Government was the regulator and provider of the service. Later, after Telecom Éireann was hived off, it owned the service provider.</P>
    <P>When the monopoly was broken up and other players were invited in, it was clear that the Government could not be a player and a referee at the same time. When the telecommunications regulator was being set up I said I thought we had got it the wrong way around. The Government was giving up its referee role in order to continue being a player. This was some years ago. I said then that it should have given up being a player to continue being a referee. I said that because it seemed that a telecommunications referee should be more than an impartial arbiter or non-biased referee between competing parties. There was also a national development agency which the referee should be insisting on as a basic rule of the game. The referee should have an interest in what game is being played and how it is being played. He or she should be indifferent to the detail of who won but they should ensure there is fair play.</P>
    <P>My suggestions would probably have been taken as no more than common sense but for the fact that at the time there were ideological objections to the Government getting out of the ownership of Telecom Éireann. One role had to <Col N="494" /> be given up and it was the referee role that the Government hived off some years go.</P>
    <P>I accept the principle that in a non-monopoly situation the Government cannot be a player and a referee. I do not see why the Goverment must give up its referee role &ndash; which is the basic core job &ndash; where it is not a player or intends, as Senator Liam Fitzgerald just said, to stop being a player in the near future. The Government is no longer a player in Telecom Éireann. It is not a referee either because that company has its own referee. Perhaps the Government will still be a player for another few months because it still has some shares.</P>

      <P>We have given a job to a regulator when we are no longer a player. We now have an independent telecommunications referee but the Government should have that job.</P>
      <P>This Bill wants to create a commission of aviation regulation for almost the sole purpose of setting airport landing charges. We have added a few other aspects as well. I say &ldquo;almost&rdquo; because the additional functions of regulating package holidays and so on are almost cosmetic additions to fill out the picture but the basic role of the regulatory body will be to set airport landing charges. In other words, its job is that of referee. This is taking place at a time when it is extremely likely that, in the foreseeable future, the airports will be privatised. When that happens the Government will neither be a player nor a referee so I do not see the benefits of such a development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so and perhaps we will learn something. I do not see the benefits of this but I see two particular disadvantages. The Minister may correct me and I hope she will explain where I am making my mistake. The first disadvantage involves cost and complication. The Minister has created another mini empire with separate staff, offices, website, annual report, the usual consultants and so on, which is almost certainly more costly than the present system. The fact that this cost would not be paid by the Government but by a levy on airport users is not relevant because the cost has increased, no matter who pays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second disadvantage is much more important and fundamental. In walking away from the role of referee when it is not a player, the Government is giving up an area of control and influence which it might regret doing. The setting of landing charges is not a purely commercial function which can be carried out in a quasi-judicial way. It has to take place within a framework of concerns for the long-term national interest, but these concerns might not get full attention if price setting decisions are taken solely <Col N="495" /> on the basis of arbitrating between commercial interests.</P>
    <P>In the area of telecommunications, for example, if we as a State decided that we wanted to be the hub of e-commerce and telecommunications, if we wanted to make ourselves the best in the world and decided the way to do so was to drive down prices, then it would not be enough for the telecommunications regulator simply to ensure fairness between the parties. Of course the regulator would do so, but perhaps the regulator's function should be to encourage more competition in order to make Ireland the hub of world e-commerce. That would be a national interest but it should be held by the Government and not by an independent body which is not responsible to Government, or only so in a roundabout way. This is not a task which should be carried out with complete independence of Government.</P>
    <P>The Government has a policy of encouraging tourism, but at some point in the future it could lose control if it hands responsibility for airport charges, for example, to a regulator. This is the power which the Government should continue to hold, yet it is proposing to give it away by setting up this commission and regulatory system. It is far more important to hold on to that power than to the running of the airports. Running airports is a professional matter best left to professionals, those who run them first and foremost as a business and who will succeed. The Government should relinquish its hands on approach to the day-to-day running of the airports, and I support the Minister on this point, while maintaining the element of control through its pricing mechanism to ensure that the long-term, strategic development of the airports happens in line with our national interests, rather than handing that power over to someone else.</P>
    <P>In seeking to set up a regulatory system, as proposed by the Bill, the Government is holding on, and I have to be careful in my words, with great care to the bath water &ndash; and I am afraid to mention baths in the Minister's case &ndash; while throwing the baby away without a care in the world. The only reason for having a regulator is that the Government should not be referee and player. If the Government is not to be a player, then in the national interest it should continue to be referee rather than handing the power over to someone else. The Bill should not proceed past Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and look forward to welcoming her again with her future proposals. The Minister has given her <i>raison d'être</i> for the legislation in that it was signalled in 1992 that with the change in duty free facilities and deregulation there was likely to be a move towards independent regulation in line with EU policy. I support the Bill and do not agree with Senator Quinn that it should go no further than Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> Much depends on the interface between the Minister, the Department and the regulator. Much also depends on how the regulator will operate, how the regulator's functions work out in practice and how comprehensive they are. These functions refer mostly, if not exclusively, to the economic operation of airports. I had not realised the extent to which duty free sales were a major factor in landing charges implemented by Aer Rianta and how it could juggle the charges and offer discounts, provide incentives and so on. From that point of view, it is a pity that duty free facilities are gone, given that we are an island which is so dependent on air traffic. We are expecting about six million visitors this year and we will have a bumper year given the exchange rates with sterling and the dollar.</P>
    <P>The new body will regulate landing charges, the operation of licences, ground handling services and will have the important economic function of licensing and bonding tour operators and travel agents. I wish to refer to the views expressed by trade unions regarding ground handling services and the link between the new regulatory commission, existing requirements concerning health and safety and the aviation authority. What will happen in this respect? Will the new body extend its remit to cover ground handling and general health safety matters? There was a recent near miss at Heathrow Airport. Who will be responsible for overall safety at every level? Will it be the Health and Safety Authority, the Irish Aviation Authority or the new regulatory commission? What will be the interface between these bodies or will we find mistakes taking place and people trying to scapegoat each other?</P>
    <P>With regard to Aer Rianta, the Minister said it was not in any way prejudiced for the future. Has the Warburg Dillon Read report which the Minister commissioned been published and is it available for public perusal?</P>

      <P>The report looked at the future operation of Aer Rianta. It would be helpful to hear the Minister's thoughts on that matter. There is much concern about whether Aer Rianta will be allowed to continue operating its current monopoly or whether there will be competition in that area. I understand the Bill does not affect that and Aer Rianta will continue to operate as before.</P>
      <P>Will the Bill deal with tour operators and travel agents? How will it affect the bonding and licensing of tour operators? How broad will be the parameters of its remit in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> I welcome the legislation. It is important to provide for independence and accountability. With regard to accountability, what reference will there be to the Houses of the Oireachtas? How will the reports be sent and what say will the Houses have with regard to the commission fulfilling its brief? Perhaps the Minister will deal with these questions. I hope this will be useful legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their contributions. The debate in the Seanad is always more lively and different from that in the Dáil. If I had my way I would introduce every Bill in the Seanad because the debate provides an insight into various matters.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinnn spoke about section 33 and the need to insert an objective to ensure balanced regional development. It was an interesting point of view. Perhaps she or Members of this side of the House will put down an amendment in that regard. The Labour Party is always ready to put down amendments.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn told the House that historically Shannon Airport subsidised Dublin Airport in air transport. When I was a child, Shannon Airport was viewed as a type of Mecca. One saw film stars arrive dripping with pearls and ermine. They might stay overnight before swanning away again. It was very glamorous. One thought that anything to do with airports was glamorous. There is still that type of allure about an airport. There is the feeling that one is going somewhere or meeting somebody who is arriving from somewhere exotic. In those years there was also the mystery of how one could fly, how the plane got up into the sky and back down.</P>
      <P>The Senator also said the regulator would have to be extremely vigilant <i>vis-à-vis</i> Dublin, Cork and Shannon and ensure that staff levels were maintained. Her contribution was most interesting.</P>
      <P>Senator Liam Fitzgerald spoke about a salts initiative. The Senator will have to explain what that means. He spoke about the regulator and shareholder and how difficult it is to balance the roles. He also spoke about an island's strategic need to have great regard and care for its airports and how they were treated. He welcomed the fact that the regulator is already in place. It is a good policy and the regulator is already reading himself into his brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn is in a quandary. He wants me to leave with my tail between my legs and not return for Committee Stage. I am interested in the point the Senator made about regulators and shareholders. I have pondered the matter at great length. I spoke earlier about my concern that we are giving over huge segments of Irish life by transferring responsibility from a Government Department to another body. One example is telecommunications, which affect everybody in their daily lives and will increasingly do so with the arrival of new technologies. That led me last <Col N="498" /> year to initate a proposal, which I brought to Cabinet, to issue a paper on regulatory matters. I produced a policy paper and the Department advertised for submissions in the newspapers. We received 34 submissions which we are now considering. The result will be legislation and statutory instruments relating to governance and accountability.</P>
    <P>It is wrong in democratic terms that Departments should hive off large sections of Irish life and thereafter consider the matter closed. If we do not establish proper accountability procedures for regulators, we will rue the day we introduced them, even though we had to, without providing for redress and balance. The Senator says I or the relevant Minister should still be the referee, despite having sloughed off the shareholder role, in the interests of competition. The Minister would keep his or her hands off the daily running of the operation but would assume the role of referee. How competitive would that business be if the Minister of the day was still the referee and was daily in the Dáil or Seanad &ndash; not that I would object &ndash; to account for why a flight did not leave Dublin Airport at a certain time? Whether a train leaves Heuston Station at a certain time is still my business. Does the Senator see my point? How competitive would that business be if the Minister was still the referee? It would not be competitive.</P>
    <P>Some Ministers are hands on and some are hands off. According to the previous chairman of CIE, I was too hands on and that was his gripe. People also vary according to their tastes and preferences.</P>

      <P>No. I cannot see that industry performing properly in a competitive environment in that scenario. Other countries are wrestling with this. We must wrestle with it and produce proper accountability and governance. That is why there will be three people like Ms Etain Doyle on the commission for telecommunications and three people on the commission for electricity. Clearly this will be combined with some other transport infrastructure and there will be a regulator for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> It is not possible to do it. I have wrestled with those ideas in my mind. That is why I took such a decision to get that policy paper moving and why I thought the 1996 Act was so bereft. It was not really bereft; it was the first essay into regulation. I am not faulting those who produced it because it is an evolutionary process.</P>
    <P>Clearly the Senator has been thinking about the matter as he referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Ombudsman. It is just that I cannot see it working.</P>

      <P>The cross-over between the political and the administrative would be entwined in that version, but I thank the Senator for his thoughts.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello raised two issues &ndash; the travel trade and ground handling. I met Mr. Peter Cassells and the group which represents the combined interests of people who work in ground handling, and I heard from nearly every Senator and Deputy about the ground handling issue. The proposal is to transfer the present functions to the commission. I am aware of the concerns expressed by trades unions regarding the safety aspects of third party ground handlers operating at airports, to which the Senator referred. No doubt airports can be hazardous environments. We agreed that my officials would bring together the IAA and HSA. As each authority would state that they are responsible for this, we will get the two together at the one desk to find a way to resolve the problems in that regard. I would be glad to come back to report on that matter.</P>
      <P>All functions of the travel trade, licensing, bonding, etc., are being devolved to the commission; therefore the commissioner's remit will include all aspects of it.</P>
      <P>As always, it has been a good debate. I thank my officials for the work they have put into the Bill. I also thank the legions of people who work at the State airports and those who worked in them over the years for the commitment they have given to the development of the island economy. I look forward to Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 40, after &ldquo;Act,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and subject to an order of the Court on granting a particular licence or at any time thereafter varying the application of this section to the licensed premises concerned having due regard to the size and location of the premises and to relevant local circumstances, residential amenities and transport services, provided that the Court shall have due regard to avoiding any anomalies in the opening hours of adjacent and nearby premises&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope we can get through Report Stage expeditiously because we have been over much of this ground already. This amendment reflects the amendment I tabled on Committee Stage. The purpose of the amendment is to provide some flexibility to the licensing authority in the granting of licences at times different from those specified in the Bill. These would depend on relevant local circumstances, residential amenities and transport services, and the courts would have due regard to all of the anomalies which might arise.</P>
      <P>The reason I am providing for that is the system being introduced will involve a greater degree of uniformity. Public houses will be able to open at the same time in the morning and I hope there will be a reduction in the number of times they can close early in the course of a week, but public houses come in a huge variety of sizes and there are different circumstances involved in many cases. A number of public houses in new residential areas are like big barns which are not suitable for socialising in a built up area and they should be subject not to a uniform system but to one for suburban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>Facility should be made for small family run public houses. We should be encouraging such intimate social establishments which allow for much less gregarious behaviour than some of the larger ones. We must take into consideration the substantial disturbances of noise and traffic and the effect of large numbers of people decanting onto the streets at exactly the same time, whether after the half hour drinking up time on Sunday at 11.30 p.m. at midnight on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays, or at 1 o'clock on Thurdays, Fridays and Saturdays. There is a need to provide a degree of flexibility to get away from the rigidity of the system and to concern ourselves with the transport exigencies of a number of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that public transport will not be available on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, the <Col N="501" /> licensing authority should be given further scope, as is the case in continental Europe and will be the case in Britain. This is also the advice given by the Garda. There is no support for rigid closing hours for all public houses as proposed in the legislation because of the factors which could give rise to disturbances, hassle for residents and many other hardships, including difficulties for women trying to get taxis.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have a fresh look at this issue. The Minister is bringing forward legislation in an area which few other Ministers have had the courage to tackle because of the complexities involved and, rather than doing a half-hearted job at this stage, he should address thoroughly all the issues so that we can be more sophisticated in our attitude to closing hours than is the case at present or is proposed in the legislation.</P>

      <P>The concerns expressed by Senator Costello are important. On Committee Stage I referred to a premises in Malahide which was originally an hotel, then a pub and I understand is now a barn. Will the Minister assure the House that the concerns of local residents will be taken into account? I do not think this matter is given proper consideration in the Bill as it stands and I urge the Minister to give Senator Costello's amendment the consideration it deserves.</P>

This was a very quiet, small hotel some years ago but it was transformed into a semi-disco, then into a hotel and it is now a disco-cum-bar. This is a very quiet road but there is a lot of unrest in that area of Malahide. I assure Senator Quinn that the Garda in Malahide is keeping a close eye on the premises. The owners of the premises have been warned on a number of occasions that the licence will be opposed when they seek to renew it unless they change the manner in which it is operated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, which is a variation of an amendment before the House on Committee Stage, will allow the court when granting a licence, or at any time after the grant of the licence, to provide for particular hours of opening for particular premises, depending on local circumstances. The variation referred to seeks to avoid the creation of anomalies in opening hours of adjacent and nearby premises. I give Senator Costello due credit for what he is <Col N="502" /> attempting to do. However, I must outline what the amendment would do in my view.</P>
      <P>The change proposed by Senator Costello makes the point I made on Committee Stage on the original amendment. The amendment as re-worded demonstrates eloquently the inconsistencies that might arise in working through the practical application of this provision if accepted. This amendment would be even more difficult to implement than the original one. How would the court go about avoiding the creation of anomalies? Would it, in order to deal with the licensed premises that is the subject of the order in question, also order restricted opening times in respect of all other premises in the locality, thereby removing the anomaly, or would the solution be to avoid making an order, given that the making of the order in respect of one or two premises in the locality would create an anomaly? It would be difficult, as the Senators recognise having amended their original proposal &ndash; to restrict the hours of one premises in a locality without creating an anomaly. The only solution would be to restrict similarly the hours of all premises in the locality. This would have the effect of penalising those premises in the locality which would have been entitled to operate the normal permitted hours.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how the amendment could operate in a practical way. The effect of applying the order to all premises in the locality, however that is defined, could have the effect of creating virtual ghettos where licensed premises could remain open late, thereby drawing customers from other areas, not just to the detriment of those areas but eventually to the detriment of the areas with later opening hours. The sensible and practical way to deal with the issue is the way in which the law already operates. Where there is a problem with a particular premises, there are already provisions under the planning laws and under the intoxicating liquor laws which would come into play either at the development stage of the premises or at the renewal of licence stage.</P>
      <P>Reference was made on Committee Stage to the growth of the &ldquo;super pub&rdquo; and the undesirability of this development. It is the inflexibility of the existing licensing system which has led to the creation of the such premises to which Senators have referred. I do not believe this is the whole answer. There is a certain market, particularly in the 18 to 35 year old cohort, for such premises where a variety of bars provide different forms of entertainment and opportunities for social interaction in different parts of the premises. I believe, however, that the changes in the licensing system which will follow the enactment of this Bill will address this situation where a market is identified by permitting greater mobility of licences from areas of over-provision and mainly rural areas to locations where there is a demonstrable need for such licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the provisions of the legislation regarding the licensing of premises are implemented, there will be a greater number of licensed premises in <Col N="503" /> the areas of greatest need. This should result in opportunities for the establishment of more intimate premises to which some Senators have referred. I would not, however, be confident that this is what will be demanded in all circumstances. Neither would I suggest that those in the 18 to 35 year old cohort do not prefer premises which are more intimate.</P>
    <P>While I understand the concerns which motivated the amendment and while I have some sympathy for it, my difficulty is that from a practical point of view it would be difficult, if not impossible, to implement. I hope this explains the position in even greater detail than I explained it on a previous occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in trying to devise a degree of flexibility without creating further anomalies. However, the inflexibility in relation to the present licensing system has led to the development of big barns of pubs. I do not think the measures allowing for the transfer of a licence from a rural area to an urban area will address this issue because the present system is here to stay. The Minister is not creating new licences, he is allowing them to be transferred from rural areas to urban areas. The legislation does not address the difficulties that exist. There will not be a situation where residents can deal adequately with the difficulties that arise, as that very eloquent letter in relation to Maud Plunkett's Hotel, Malahide, highlights. The difficulties they experience, the noise and traffic will not be addressed. The Garda Síochána has been seeking a degree of flexibility, which this legislation does not give, in its wish to handle people coming out of pubs without finding that its resources are stretched when every part of the city is suddenly overwhelmed at one o'clock in the morning.</P>
      <P>Anomalies exist already and it is up to us to try to address them. I would like the Minister to have looked at the systems that operate in other countries, particularly in continental countries which never seem to experience the types of problems we experience at closing time, and it is closing time essentially as well as the later hours that can give rise to inordinate difficulties in terms of discos, music and the activities that tend to go on in larger pubs. Larger pubs lend themselves to noisy events that would otherwise take place in other venues. They are event centres in their own right and they tend to bring about a distortion in terms of the clientele who frequents them. This is undoubtedly causing massive problems and will cause further problems now that the licensing laws are being extended to later in the morning.</P>
      <P>There are problems and the Bill does not address them. I hope the Minister will take on board what has been said, tease it out before it is discussed in the other House and perhaps come up with something that might address the problems we have raised here.</P>

Up to now the position was that in an urban area if one wished to open a new licensed premises one had to get a licence from within the urban area, from a scheduled list of cities or towns. In a rural area, one could not open a public house within a mile of another public house. If one wanted to get a new licence, one had to surrender two licences. These are all very restrictive measures. There are 11,000 licences in the State and there is no question that there is an under-provision of licences in the Dublin area. The size of the population relative to the proportion of licensed premises in a place like Tallaght is obviously far greater than it is in County Mayo. The objective of the exercise is to remove restrictions so that in the future one will not have to extinguish a licence in an urban area in order to open a new public house in an urban area and one will not be able to object to a person opening a new pub less than a mile down the road in a rural area. In addition, two licences will not be required in areas which are not scheduled in order to open a new licensed premises. It will be necessary only to purchase a licence in any part of the State and it will be possible to open a public house. It will be possible, for example, to purchase a licence in Mayo and open a pub in Tallaght, subject to the rules set out in the legislation. To that extent, I am convinced that the market will find its own level and the licences will find their own market.</P>
      <P>With regard to people coming out of pubs and discos at all hours, no matter what hour I put in as closing time, there will be the same difficulty. It is not possible to reconcile the anomalies with sensible legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 21, to delete &ldquo;11.00 p.m.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;11.30 p.m.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to Sunday closing. Last week I moved an amendment seeking to have closing time on Sunday nights set at the same time as on the other weekend nights, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, namely, 12.30 a.m. with half an hour's drinking up time. In this amendment I have moved back the time by one hour to 11.30 p.m. bringing closing time into line with that on <Col N="505" /> every other day of the week with the exception of weekend nights. Closing time would be at the same time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights. This 11.30 p.m. closing time is a recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Sub-Committee which produced a very good report. I ask the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <P>There may be objections. There is the religious significance of Sunday. People object to overlong public house opening hours on the sabbath. The point is made in the report of the sub-committee that there is a regenerative, recuperative and psychological value to having Sunday to rest at home and not in a public house. However, Sunday night is part of the leisure patterns of the weekend, especially in rural Ireland. It is unusual to have late opening on Thursday night in rural areas. Late opening on Thursday night is suitable in large centres like Dublin, Cork, Limerick and the other large city boroughs. In rural Ireland, which is still a very significant part of the country, Thursday night is not a great night for going out drinking &ndash; weekend entertainment and leisure do not really start until Friday night. Sunday, as any Senator here who has knowledge of what I am talking about will fully agree, is very much part of the leisure pattern of a weekend.</P>
    <P>Current closing time, at least during the summer, is 11.00 p.m. We are asking that this be moved forward by half an hour with half an hour for drinking up. That would mean that public houses would be cleared by 12 midnight. If nothing else, it would bring the law into line with practice. There is wholesale non-observance of closing time, especially on Sunday nights in rural areas. The last thing that should happen is that the law is honoured more by non-observance than by observance. Nothing creates more contempt for the law.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this. It is not a major request. He will come under much pressure in the Dáil on this issue. We would be delighted if this concession, which the Minister might have to make in the other House, could be made here on the basis of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. Of all the amendments before us, this is the one with which the Minister should have no difficulty. It is eminently sensible. I cannot see how it could cause difficulties with publicans or customers. The legislation provides for three closing times, 11 p.m., 11.30 p.m. and 12.30 a.m. That is too many. A closing time of 11.30 p.m. is the same as that proposed for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Sunday is the preferred night out in much of rural Ireland when people like to have an extra half hour drinking time. The current closing time is more honoured in the breach than the observance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no argument against this amendment. On Committee Stage the Minister argued that late opening on Sunday would make it difficult for people to turn up on time for work on Monday morning. If that problem exists at present it is <Col N="506" /> because the present closing time rule is regularly breached. In many areas, Sunday is the same as any other day of the week. I cannot see any advantage in legislating to make it otherwise. I understand that the Minister wishes people to go home early on Sunday night so that they will be in time for work on Monday but that is not how things are. We must recognise in legislation what is happening in practice.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach visits at least three public houses every Sunday. The poor man must be rushed in his effort to complete his visits by closing time.</P>

I agree with Senators Connor and Costello that three different closing times cause confusion, especially to visitors.</P>
      <P>The sub-committee gave this matter a great deal of consideration.

His colleague, Deputy Healy-Rea, has said that he will not support this measure. The Minister has said that the Taoiseach supports the restriction of Sunday <Col N="507" /> opening to 11 p.m. because to allow later opening would be damaging to the moral fibre of the country. Deputy Healy-Rea has been quoted in a Sunday newspaper as saying that he would go to the Taoiseach, &ldquo;a man who takes a drink himself&rdquo;. In describing the removal of the reasonable belief plea, Deputy Healy-Rea said, &ldquo;The likes of it would not happen in Russia.&rdquo;  I am disappointed that the Minister is unable to accept the amendment but I predict that he will be obliged to accept it in the other House.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 19 to 24, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)ordered by or on behalf of that person at the same time as a substantial meal is so ordered, and</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained on Committee Stage that under existing law, hotels and restaurants enjoy more liberal hours of trading than public houses where alcohol is supplied in conjunction with a meal, subject to the certain conditions that the liquor served in conjunction with a meal is ordered and consumed at the same time as that meal, is supplied and consumed in the portion of the premises set aside for meals and paid for at the same time as the meal. Senator Henry and Senator Quinn questioned this on Committee Stage. The law is contained in section 13 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, as I explained, as amended by the Act of 1988 which provides that the premises, which is a hotel or restaurant, is entitled to supply intoxicating liquor in conjunction with a meal to persons on the premises for up to an hour later than it is permitted to remain open for the sale of alcohol only. I promised the Senators, in deference to the points made by them, that I would return to the issue on Report Stage. While the existing law is specific, based on the premise that the sale of alcohol is ancillary to the main restaurant business, I accept that the conditions attaching to the sale of liquor in such premises are over-prescriptive.</P>
      <P>The conditions which ensure that the meal is ordered by the person at the same time as the substantial meal is ordered and the condition that it is consumed at the same time as and with the meal, as reworded in the amendment now proposed, achieve the desired result. The effect of the amendment will be to continue to tie the consumption of intoxicating liquor in the circumstances to a meal but it will not overly restrict where on the premises the liquor should be consumed. This should provide restaurants, hotels and their patrons with a certain flexibility while ensuring that the premises will not be used for the purposes of obtaining alcoholic drinks only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> To ensure that the law relating to serving intoxicating liquor in clubs registered under the Registration of Clubs Acts is kept in conformity with the law as it stands relating to hotels and restaurants, it is also necessary to amend section 7 of the Bill. Amendment No. 6 achieves that result.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the attitude he is taking and the amendment he and his officials have drafted. It will be much easier to enforce than the way the previous conditions were in the first place. They take my concerns into account. I would not like the Minister or anyone else to think that I had a string of found-on convictions from restaurants and that this was why I was so concerned about it. The only time I ran into trouble was as a student and I quickly leapt into the kitchen and started with the washing-up, thereby avoiding a great deal of trouble and detection. If one keeps semi-sober and keeps one's wits, one can get on very well in life. These amendments cover everything I wanted and I thank the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Connor. I explained on Committee Stage that section 9 as it stands provides for an increase in the number of area exemption orders from nine to 12 and that under this section the 12 days may be divided into not more than four periods consisting of one or more consecutive days. The early exemption orders are granted where a particular local area in need is identified and it is accepted by the court that the area exemption order is necessary in order to accommodate an influx of persons visiting an area because of some period of special festivity.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor made the point that a festival in a rural town may run for just a weekend and the licensees would not require the area exemption for three days. I accept that point. The festival may be on Friday and Saturday but licensees are obliged to take another exemption for Sunday or Thursday when they may not have as much business.</P>
      <P>To meet Senator Connor's point, supported by Senator Costello and privately supported by Senator Bohan, that there should be some flexibility in the number of days for which the area exemption would be allowed, I propose the amendment now before the House. This will have the effect of retaining the character of the area exemption order in that it is necessary to accommodate extra persons in a locality because of a special event such as a festival. Under the amendment it will be possible to seek area exemptions orders in respect of special events that take place over a range of periods lasting two, three, four, five or even more days or in respect of a 12 day event. This should meet with the agreement of all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 in the name of Senator Connor and Senator Manning would allow an area exemption to be granted in respect of a single day and, therefore, allow a total of 12 such orders to be made in a single year. As I said on Committee Stage, this would not be in keeping with the spirit of the area exemption order. I have introduced, in the Government amendment, sufficient flexibility into the provision without compromising the underlying character of the area exemption order which is to provide for a special event that attracts people into a locality and takes place infrequently and not, for example, once a month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, I am anxious to ensure that the special exemption order procedure is not cir<Col N="511" /> cumvented by the utilisation of the area exemption order, which is a possibility if one were to allow for 12 single days. I have increased the number of days. I have also made provision for greater flexibility in regard to the periods during which a special exemption order may be in operation. I trust I have satisfied Members in that respect.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to remove the mandatory nature of the temporary closure order. I dealt in some detail with the effect of this amendment on Committee Stage and signalled my strong opposition to it. The effect of the amendment would be to take away what I regard as not just a significant strengthening but a desirable one in tackling the under age drinking problem by targeting those who engage in this trade. I was gratified by the strong support I received from many Senators on this topic who <Col N="512" /> support strong sanctions against those who engage in a criminally irresponsible act.</P>
      <P>We discussed on Committee Stage the huge problem of under age drinking. Reference was made to the fact that it is a greater problem than the abuse of controlled substances and that the age at which persons are now presenting themselves at alcohol treatment centres has fallen dramatically. It can only be inferred from that latter observation &ndash; one I do not dispute &ndash; that persons are accessing alcohol at a much younger age than heretofore and that they are abusing alcohol from an early age.</P>
      <P>We must have tight controls in this area. If every person charged with an offence in relation to under age drinking could say that the premises was, for example, crowded on the night in question, this section would not be worth the paper it was written on. It would be pointless. I accept that this provision is the toughest legislative provision which has been brought into force against the scourge of under age drinking in our society since the foundation of the State but it has been introduced for a very good reason. Under age drinking is a serious problem and becoming ever more serious. It must be tackled.</P>
      <P>I have been offered an opportunity to make a difference in the fight against under age drinking and I intend to take the opportunity offered. It would be remiss of me not to do so. It should be borne in mind however that the court does take into account the circumstances in which the sale to the young person takes place. I have also been careful to ensure there is no minimum period which the court is bound to impose by way of closure. Licenceholders who uphold the law will have nothing to fear but those licenceholders who continually and consistently flout the law will feel the full force of its effect. I make no apology for this. As I have said before, there are only a minority of licenceholders involved in the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor to under age persons but even that small minority is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>The amendment would serve only to dilute the strength of section 13 of the Bill and would lead to a situation where the section would not operate to any particular effect. That would defeat the purpose of the section and depart from the policy suggested by the joint Oireachtas committee and endorsed by the Government. I am sure Senators will realise that they and I have a duty to tackle this problem. I am not for one moment suggesting that the sponsors of the amendment hold a different view on under age drinking &ndash; far from it. All I am saying is that the effect of the amendment would be to ensure the Houses of the Oireachtas pay lip-service to the problem of under age drinking and would not tackle it in any meaningful way.</P>

      <P>Initially I was very concerned about this section of the Bill but having listened to the Minister on Committe Stage and today I am not as concerned in the sense that the courts will have discretion. I originally thought that the sentence was mandatory once a licenceholder was charged with an offence. I now understand that on conviction a premises may be required to close for a period of one or two hours or up to seven days. I agree with the Minister. The people I represent abhor the few premises in which under age persons are served. Nobody supports this. Having listened to the Minister I am much happier.</P>

      <P>Until I read the section carefully I was concerned about the possibility of overkill. I have no doubt that the Minister is correct. The sentence does not need to be mandatory. As Senator Bohan said, not only is the judge not obliged to close a premises for a period of six days, as I thought originally, he does not even have to close the entire premises. He may close one part of it &ndash; this had not dawned on me &ndash; for just one hour but I assume it will be for a longer period. The matter will therefore be in the hands of the judge. This is the correct approach. I applaud the Minister for his determination not to move on this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister advanced many cogent arguments but what I have in mind is the question of mandatory sentencing which is not part of our jurisprudence. The courts should have scope to make the decision taking all circumstances into consideration.</P>
      <P>The other side of the coin is implementation of the law. Intoxicating liquor law is often honoured more in the breach than in the observance. Given the difficulties being experienced, has the Minister considered establishing a special unit to deal with under age drinking, whether it be in public houses or public parks, similar to the drugs squad and other similar units in the Garda Síochána? Unless implementation is sufficiently sophisticated there is no sense in enacting a Bill of this nature. Has the Minister had second thoughts about establishing a special unit in the Garda Síochána?</P>

      <P>On the question of enforcement the Senator will be aware that I have made statements to the effect that it is the intention <Col N="514" /> that the laws contained in the Bill will be enforced. Under age drinking is a matter of deep concern to me and the Garda Commissioner. It can be taken as read that the provisions relating to under age drinking contained in the Bill will be enforced.</P>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage the intention is not to penalise those who are not engaged in this practice. Unfortunately there is a very small minority who are engaged in supplying intoxicating liquor to under age persons. I outlined in great detail that the parents of teenage children are deeply worried that their children can be supplied with alcohol by these people. There are horrific stories, for example, of children coming home to their parents on the night they received their junior certificate results hopelessly drunk. The vast majority of publicans and people involved in the off-licence trade would not serve drink, under any circumstances, to people who are under age. There is a small minority throughout the country who will and this problem must be tackled. As I explained previously, it can be tackled by lip service in this House or we can deal with it meaningfully. The way that it is proposed in this legislation makes it a statutory imperative for the court to demand a closure. An order can last for one hour and up to seven days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is at the discretion of the court. I also outlined that the court, in determining the duration of a closure order, may seek a report from a member of the Garda Síochána involved in the investigation of the offence on the circumstances in which it was committed and any other information which might be pertinent. While it is an offence for one young person to be given intoxicating liquor in a public house, it would not be as grave an offence if the publican said that he made a mistake. On the other hand, it is a different matter if a busload of young teenagers were served alcohol in the lounge of a public house or in a disco. The scale of the offence is different. In those circumstances the judge might take the view that the premises should be closed for a week.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the closure order there is also provision in this legislation that the premises in question will be obliged to affix to the exterior of the premises and in a conspicuous place the reason the premises is closed. The length of time the premises will be closed must also be specified. The Garda Síochána are long enough in the business to know for whom this legislation is meant. It applies across society but there are people who habitually supply alcohol to young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Quinn correctly pointed out, this legislation also provides that the closure order does not have to apply to the entire premises. It may be made in respect of any part of the premises. The court might decide to shut down the portion of the premises where young people were <Col N="515" /> served. It might hold that the lounge should be closed but the public bar should remain open and <i>vice versa.</i> There is a degree of discretion involved which should be noted.</P>
    <P>It is true that habitual offenders receive little or no mercy in this legislation. I do not believe that anyone would argue that habitual offenders should receive any mercy for serving drink to young teenagers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the argument that the publican or the off-licence holder could make a mistake, I have explained that I introduced a national voluntary identity card in April 1999 by way of regulation under the 1988 Act. Those cards are available from the Garda. Any person who is over 18 years of age but looks younger can go to a Garda station and apply for an ID card by producing his or her birth certificate, a photograph and paying a fee of £5. The application, documentation and fee are forwarded to the Garda headquarters in Phoenix Park. The card will then be issued in a short period of time. In so far as is possible the card is tamper proof. If a publican or a person involved in the off-licence trade has a doubt about a person's age then they can ask for their ID card. If a card is not produced and a doubt still exists then the strong, cogent and only advice I can give is not to serve them. If a large number of people enter a premises and the publican or people serving on the premises do not know whether they are serving a young person under 18 years of age, why should the licensee not be responsible for making absolutely sure?</P>

      <P>It is possible for the licensee in those circumstances to make sure that the mistake does not occur. The alternative to what I am doing is quite simple &ndash; it is ifs, buts and maybes. If I start off like that then we will be right back where we started.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the support Senators have given to this measure. To be fair to the intoxicating liquor industry, the representatives of the publicans, discos, hoteliers, restaurateurs and all involved have made it clear to me that they want to assist in clamping down on under age drinking. The Government deeply appreciates their support and it would be wrong of me not to acknowledge that publicly and magnanimously. Any watering down of the provisions of this Bill would be a disservice not just to the parents of young teenagers now and in the future but to the young teenagers as well.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;15&ndash;An under-age person having reached the age of criminal responsibility will be <Col N="516" /> liable to prosecution for purchasing or attempting to purchase intoxicating liquor in a licensed premises.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My amendment attempts to strengthen the Minister's hand in relation to fighting the scourge of under age drinking. I decided to table an amendment on this issue on Report Stage even though I did not have one on Committee Stage. I have no doubt the Minister will tell me that provision has already been made in other legislation to cover my amendment, perhaps in the 1988 Act. I apologise that I have not read it nor checked it since the last day.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to ensure that the burden of responsibility for under age drinking is shared with young people who have reached the age of criminal responsibility. I would like to see the age of criminal responsibility increased to 14 years of age. This would send a clear message to young people.</P>
    <P>The initiative to procure drink in a licensed premises is by the customer in the first instance. Young people who look more mature than their years enter licensed premises and there is not a compulsory age card. I accept the Minister's argument that the licensee should insist, when he or she is in doubt about a person's age, on the production of an identity card. I believe the Minister should introduce a compulsory age card but I may be in the minority. If he decided to go ahead and do that then I would support him.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to place on the licensee alone all the burden of responsibility for the offence of serving drink to a person who is under age. Senator Bohan, other Senators and myself gave an example last week of a person over 18 years of age purchasing an alcoholic drink, taking it to a table where there is an under age person and handing it to them. I know extenuating circumstances can be taken into account in court by the judge but the publican faces a closure order, if only for an hour. In a case like that the responsibility should be shared by the young person who tries to procure alcohol.</P>

      <P>It might appear harsh of me to push the issue of placing legal responsibility on under age persons and that they might find themselves prosecuted for a criminal offence. However, so widespread is the scourge that urgent and strong action is required on the part of the Legislature. On many occasions, in both Houses, I have said that I am not a supporter of draconian legislation. However, if this is a draconian response then so be it. If this provision is included in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, there is nothing wrong with including it in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this amendment. The Minister may say this provision is included in other legislation but this will strengthen the provision. The closest comparison I can draw involves bribery. If there is a law which stipulates that accepting a bribe is a crime but offering a bribe is not a crime then that is bad law. The person who offers the bribe and the person who accepts it should be guilty and there should be laws against both.</P>
      <P>In this case, it seems that if an under age person seeks alcohol they should be as guilty as the person who sells it to them. The Minister may say there is already such provision in law and may argue that this amendment is unnecessary. However, the amendment would strengthen the case and reiterate the strength of the Minister's opinion on under age drinking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment provides for the prosecution of under age persons for purchasing, or attempting to purchase, intoxicating liquor. The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, already contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to tackle the problem of under age drinking. Chief among those provisions are that it is an offence for any person under 18 years of age to purchase alcohol in an on-licence or off-licence premises, or to consume it in any place other than a private residence in which he or she is present by right or permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also an offence for any person to purchase alcohol for consumption by a person under 18 years of age in any place other than a private residence. Intoxicating liquor in the possession of under 18s in any place, other than a private residence, may be seized by the Garda. No person <Col N="518" /> under 18 years of age is allowed on the part of a licensed premises where an extension or special exemption order is in force and under 18s are not allowed in off-licence premises unless accompanied by a parent or guardian.</P>
    <P>These provisions, when taken together with the tougher sanctions provided for in this Bill, are, in so far as legislation can contribute to combating abuse of alcohol by under age persons, generally regarded as strict and up-to-date and go as far as legislation of this type could reasonably be expected to go. In that context, they more than satisfy the proposal put forward by Senator Connor.</P>
    <P>Under section 33 of the 1988 Act, it is an offence for young people to demand drink knowing they are under age. Up to now, however, because evidence of age was not routinely sought, offenders were not easily identified with the result that this provision was difficult to enforce. I am confident that enactment of the provisions in this Bill, together with the national voluntary age card scheme which is already in operation, will strengthen those measures already provided for in 1988. The new provisions will place the onus on the licensee to ensure that intoxicating liquor is only supplied to those legally entitled to purchase or consume it. Under age drinkers must also be made aware that they are also in breach of the law when they represent themselves as being over 18 and demand that intoxicating liquor be sold to them or when they permit it to be bought on their behalf.</P>
    <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, following passage of the Bill it is my intention to begin an advertising campaign to publicise the age card scheme. As part of that campaign I also intend to emphasise the consequences of conviction of an offence under section 33 of the 1988 Act. I am determined that this Bill will once and for all tackle the scourge of under age drinking and I firmly believe that the measures I am putting forward will go a long way towards achieving that aim. The Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000, will make a difference. If I thought Senator Connor's amendment would add to the law I would be happy to accept it. However, it will not do so and, therefore, I do not propose to support the amendment.</P>
    <P>As regards making the age card compulsory, it has to be remembered that the card will be required by a person who is over 18 years of age and who feels that he or she may be refused alcohol because the person behind the counter or in the off-licence thinks that he or she is under age. If I were to make the card compulsory it would mean that I would make it compulsory for young people over the age of 18, about whom the same doubt may exist, who have no intention of obtaining alcohol to also carry the card. This would not be fair or right and I do not think it is desirable.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to pursue this amendment. However, I am glad the Minister <Col N="519" /> noted how comprehensive the provisions in the 1988 Act are in prohibiting under age people from purchasing drink. I hope that he will soon better define the age of criminal responsibility. It is too low at present and I believe he has proposals to bring it into line.</P>
      <P>The advertisements for the age card scheme should include public notice to those young people at whom they are targeted that, under sections of the 1988 Act, it is a serious criminal offence for an under age person to purchase or to attempt to purchase intoxicating liquor in an on-licence or off-licence.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)The Court may waive the requirement for the surrender of an existing licence if it is satisfied that it would be proposed to do so having regard to the population in the area where the premises to be licensed are situated and the scarcity of licensed premises in that area.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a laudable amendment and the Minister said that present difficulties concerning &ldquo;super pubs&rdquo; in built up areas are due to the inflexibility of existing licensing laws. I am seeking to add greater flexibility by allowing courts to waive the requirement for the surrender of an existing licence if warranted by population trends in an area or the scarcity of licensed premises. This could avoid the difficulties which arise in built up areas such as Ballymun, Tallaght and other areas where there are massive pubs and not enough licensed premises.</P>

      <P>Section 15 introduces new provisions concerning access to the market by the creation of a nationwide single licence area and the standard requirement of the extinguishing of one licence in any part of the State when applying for a new licence. The amendment would waive the requirement for the surrender of an existing licence based on a set of factors which do not, as I said on Committee Stage, make sense. Such factors as the population of the area where the new licence is to be located and the scarcity of licensed premises in the area are, given the fact that the prohibitions in current law would no longer apply, the factors which should have the effect of attracting persons to set up new premises in those areas by moving from areas where there is an over supply of licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expressed the view, which I stand over, that section 15 as it stands would see greater mobility in licences to areas where there is a scarcity of licensed premises. Market forces will dictate such <Col N="520" /> a movement and not the fact that they are permitted under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 15 also introduces a new concept of adequacy. This is not a means whereby existing licencees in an area can have a veto on the establishment of new premises. In fact it is the opposite. The court will, where an application for a new licence is in question, assess, for example, need in an area by reference to the existing number of outlets of a particular type, for example, the number of existing public houses.</P>
    <P>The adequacy test is one that would operate to the advantage of places that are currently under served as far as licensed premises are concerned. The effect of the Senator's amendment would be to create a different and uncertain standard in some cases. That would not be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved my proposal for the establishment of a commission on licensing. The commission will have ample scope to deliver quality advice to the Minister and Government in relation to such diverse areas as access to licences, nature of premises that can or should be licensed, the distribution of licences and the licensing system. Incidentally, it is my intention to ensure that the commission on licensing will be broadly based and that all sides of the equation, so to speak, are represented on it.</P>

      <P>23.&ndash;A person who is the holder of a wine retailer's on-licence (within the meaning of the Act of 1910) or a wine retailers off-licence may offer beer for sale for consumption off the premises.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the Minister has extended the right of restaurateurs who hold a wine licence issued by Bord Fáilte to sell beer. They previously only had the right to sell wine and spirits. Small family supermarkets, which also hold a wine licence to sell wine, believe this provision is discriminatory in that they cannot benefit from this extension.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to ensure that small family-owned supermarkets which have a licence to retail wine should also be allowed to sell beer, usually cans of beer. It is a reasonable provision. People buy wine as a take home drink and cans of beer are equally popular, if not more so. The Independent Liquor Licensing Reform Group has threatened to go to court on the basis that the provision in the Bill is discriminatory. It has been given sound legal advice that it is discriminatory and the group has a good chance of winning its case.</P>
      <P>The Minister should make this simple adjustment. It will not increase the level of drunkenness or alcohol abuse. It would be helpful to a sector of the retail trade which, as a result of the huge competition it faces, is now struggling to survive. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

The small supermarket owner who might employ eight to ten people is not in a position to compete.</P>
      <P>Last Christmas Eve I was in a shopping centre in Ennis. I was confounded to find a queue forming at 10 a.m. When I asked the reason I was told they were queuing for the off-licence of a certain large national retailer. I will not promote the name by mentioning it. The queue was of no benefit to the publicans or small shopkeepers of Ennis. There would not have been that level of congestion in the shopping centre if we had a wider and more even distribution of licences across the town and county.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained on Committee Stage, any person, subject to meeting certain conditions, may apply to the District Court for a certificate leading to the grant of a beer retailer's off-licence. In common with all such applications, there is an application for the grant of a certificate for a spirit retailer's off-licence and a full publican's <Col N="522" /> licence. It is a condition that an existing licence or licences are extinguished. No such requirement exists for the grant of a wine retailer's on-licence or off-licence. In section 15 of the Bill the condition relating to extinguishment is relaxed in that the licence may be sourced from anywhere in the State and only one extinguished licence is required in all cases. In addition, a publican's licence can be offered directly in substitution for an off-licence.</P>
    <P>The amendment would permit the holder of a wine off-licence or on-licence to sell beer for consumption off the premises on foot of such a licence. Wine licences are granted without the need for a certificate of the court. There is, therefore, no examination of character of the applicant for a licence and no opportunity to examine the fitness of the premises in terms of its location and suitability. The amendment fails to address that point.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it would be an error to compare the off-licence situation to the sale of beer with a meal in a restaurant that is provided for under section 22 of the Bill. That section is in tune with consumer demand. The section is framed to operate responsibly in that it is subject to certain conditions. In any event, it is not correct to argue that because a shop has a wine off-licence or on-licence attached, it should also be permitted to sell beer. In fact, in section 31 of the Bill I am ensuring that shops which wish to sell wine will do so by virtue of wine retailer's off-licence and not, as is now most common, by virtue of a wine retailer's on-licence. That section removes the anomaly in the current law whereby it is easier to receive a wine retailer's on-licence, which also permits sale off the premises, than to receive a wine retailer's off-licence.</P>
    <P>We have devoted much time in the course of this debate to discussing the problem of under age drinking. I do not wish to beat that drum too much but I believe a proper balance has been achieved in the Bill as well as updating and achieving progress in the licensing system. I undertook on Committee Stage to refer the nature of the off-licence to the commission on licensing. I understood that Senator Connor, as a result of that statement, was withdrawing the amendment. I still believe that is the best course of action.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister has not accepted my point of view. There is a time constraint on the debate so I cannot say much. I am not convinced by the Minister's arguments. This amendment simply permits the sale of beer in small, usually family-owned, supermarkets. They are allowed to sell intoxicating liquor in the form of wine. The Minister has not made a convincing argument against extending that permission to the sale of beer. Beers are taken home for social occasions in the same way as wine bought in supermarkets. There is the problem <Col N="523" /> that this type of alcohol might get into the hands of under age drinkers but that will always be a problem.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>While we are grateful for our success on one amendment, we are disappointed that the Minister did not accept other amendments. However, this is good legislation. While it is right to liberalise closing time, I want the Bill, above all, to be an attack on the scourge of under age drinking. There should be a way of auditing its performance.

      <P>I thank the main spokesperson on the Government side for all the work he put into this legislation. I deeply appreciated it. Indeed, I thank all the contributors on the Government side, particularly the Chief Whip. I also thank the chief spokespersons for the Opposition parties and other Members who contributed to the development of the legislation during its passage in the House. I also extend my deepest thanks to the Independent Senators who contributed so much to the passage of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill marks an important milestone in the Government's approach to the modernisation of the licensing laws. It can be described as the most comprehensive single package of reform measures ever introduced in the Oireachtas on the issue. It is of tremendous significance that legislation such as this was introduced in the Seanad. That is due in no small measure to the commitment of the Members of the House to reforming legislation which is deeply appreciated.</P>
      <P>The legislation reflects the thoughts and concerns of the general public on the intoxicating liquor laws and the availability of alcohol. It does this in a number of ways and there is no need for me to go back through them now other than to say that the legislation is mature in many respects and that the increasing awareness and worries of parents about under age drinking is reflected in the legislation, as is the view of the consumers.</P>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your assistance and I thank the staff of the House. In particular, I am deeply grateful to the officials in my Department who worked so hard over such a long period to ensure that the legislation arrived in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. Last week I listened with great interest to the debate on the relaxation of the libel laws. At times the debate is quite confusing. One can see right on both sides of the argument.</P>
      <P>I grew up in an era in which one's good name was sacrosanct. Indeed, one was meant to defend it, even with one's life or at least at the risk of getting a black eye in a scuffle with the school bully in the school yard. At the time there was another prevailing philosophy which one might call a theology, that one never spoke ill of the dead. I was thinking of that irony here on morning on the Order of Business when the Cathaoirleach allowed me to speak on a topical matter and I found myself defending such diverse characters as Archbishop John Charles McQuaid and General Eoin O'Duffy. I felt both had been maligned in articles and obviously were not in a position to defend themselves.</P>
      <P>On the other hand we all grew up in an era when we respected and realised the need for a free or unmuzzled press. To an extent it came to me again strongly this morning in a story from Bosnia, where the local police raided the television station simply because it had been adopting a line which did not suit the establishment. The official version of the story was that they were suggesting an uprising against the establishment. However, we have seen such action in so many dictatorships throughout the world &ndash; whenever it was endeavouring to arrive at the truth the media was always sidelined or, worse still, put out of action. At such times we were particularly pleased that we had a free media of our own because we could well understand the frustration of not being allowed to put across a legitimate idea. Nobody should feel threatened by legitimate ideas and it is important that ideas would be published, debated and that people would be given the opportunity to put forward a point of view. We have always held that view in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, it would not be an exaggeration to state that there have been severe abuses of that same freedom and there is not always an opportunity to put forward a reaction to those <Col N="526" /> abuses. For instance, I am always disappointed by certain Sunday newspapers where five columnists may write on the same subject and sing from the same hymn sheet on the same page. That is disappointing because the least one expects is that a counter argument might be made and there is an opportunity to inform, educate and, if necessary, provoke the public. I see nothing wrong with that, given that we have such a high level of education and that there are so many discerning commentators among the public and in public life. These people are well able to take that provocation. However, I do not think it helps the good name of journalism or that it is ethical that this should happen. We must consider the whole area of ethics in journalism if we are to defend the notion of a free press.</P>
    <P>This was brought home to me recently when a particular member of a religious order was demonised and, having subsequently been found not guilty in the courts, this fact was set aside. There was not the same balance of coverage for the exoneration of this person as there should have been and I believe if there had been, it would have done more credit to the media.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties at present is the perception abroad that the whole area of journalism is being driven in the context of profit. Perhaps this is one of the side effects of competition. For instance, the more newspapers, television stations or radio stations there are, the more competition grows and, because it grows, it seems to be important to introduce sensationalism on a daily basis. I am sure many Members of this House who travel by bus or train have picked up a newspaper and found that the content under the headline bore little or no relationship to the headline. This is sensationalism for the sake of sensationalism and for the sake of selling a product. I am sure that if any other product was being sold on the same basis, such as genetically modified foods or another product where one must protect against false claims, there would be an outcry if such an extreme scenario prevailed. This is far more important in the area of journalism because of the power of journalists and the media.</P>
    <P>We have imported from abroad some of the worst tabloid excesses in this regard. On the other hand, it is fair to say that the local press and media create a balance which very often restores our faith in that fine profession of journalism. This is also true of local radio. As the local media is so close to the local community, it quickly realises that whatever about titivating one's desire for sensationalism, people still want very solid news, very solid reporting and very solid provocation for public opinion. That has been my experience with the local media. As I said, this in many ways restores our faith in the media.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> It is also true that there is a great effort on the part of some people in the national media to uphold those high standards. However, what I find missing is a willingness to criticise their own. There are maverick journalists, who are certainly in the minority, but I do not find many sections of the media prepared to criticise their own when they step out of line. If this is not done, it will indicate perhaps in the context of this debate that the media are not prepared for self-regulation. They must prove to many people that they are prepared for self-regulation.</P>
    <P>I recall one case in the last 12 months which some might refer to as a mellowing concept on the part of a journalist. I very much admire this journalist for what he has done and he could in no sense be regarded as wimpish in the area of journalism. He has adopted a very independent role. He is no longer one of a herd and is prepared to look at the other side of the story. In one or two cases I found reference to him creeping into other sections of the media. Here was someone who was endeavouring to set the record straight and display a fair mindedness and some journalists were prepared to criticise him for leaving the herd in that particular case. This attitude did not last for long but they did rise above the parapet in that case.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the national interest which is very important, no more so than in relation to Northern Ireland. There are times in very sensitive situations when the necessary elements come together for a solution, when people are prepared to work and compromise in reconciliation. However, very often the challenge in a negative and almost destructive manner tends to come first of all from the media. I would like to know where the responsibility lies in relation to this. Is there the question of the greater good or the common good or is there the question of the national interest? I look back to a former Government Minister who sat at the Cabinet table and would have had access to State secrets. When he was no longer a public representative, he took up a position as journalist with an English newspaper. This was at a very volatile time in the North of Ireland. It was at a time when the situation could develop one way or another. Every time our Government endeavoured to pursue a particular line of action based on democracy, the common good and reconciliation, this person who had sat at the Cabinet table used a particular journal outside the shores of Ireland to undermine each step that was taken. Can that in any circumstances be justified? I am inclined to say it cannot be justified in such a case and that where the national interest is involved journalists must show common sense.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we did not have a free press and free media, I believe many wrongs would have been perpetrated against people who were vulnerable. The media were needed in those <Col N="528" /> situations. I would again like to balance my comments by saluting the contributions made by the media at that time. However, I hope the ethics of journalism will come to centre stage and that the influence and power the media have will be balanced with a degree of fair play and common sense.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the argument that one of the reasons the libel laws should be relaxed is because of what we are now hearing from the tribunals. I do not accept this because it would make bad law. Let the media make the case for the relaxation of the libel laws not for any specific period or any specific incident, but with a broader vision of what the media should be doing.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate will not conclude at this time because it needs to be ongoing. It is an evolving matter and there is a huge element of responsibility on us all. We should not rush our fences, but we should listen to both sides of the argument. I hope the media will continue to convince us that they will act responsibly at all times and endeavour to regulate their own area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is very important and the subject matter should have been aired long before now. Its timing is particularly appropriate given the publicity there has been in relation to the tribunals and investigations taking place. It must be acknowledged that particular journalists have done the country a great service in certain areas of investigative journalism. Through their investigative journalism, they have prompted further investigations via the establishment by the Houses of the Oireachtas of various tribunals.</P>
      <P>The public has a right to know what is going in the public service generally and in the Houses of the Oireachtas. They have a right to know how politicians conduct their business. It is important that there is openness, transparency and accountability at all levels and at all times. However, we all have a right to privacy, whether we are politicians, private citizens, professionals or school children. Whoever we are, we have basic constitutional rights and it is important that those rights are valued, protected and defended. They can be defended and protected within the law of the land and it is vital that the law does so.</P>
      <P>In debating these issues it is important to preserve a sense of balance. All laws should strive towards balance. In the case of reform of the libel laws we need balance and fair play. Nobody should be put at a serious disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission that the defendant in a defamation case should have to prove that he or she has nothing to disprove. That is wrong. It would mean that any of us could at any time be put on the rack and it would be up to us to prove our innocence. If libel is committed against an individual, the onus is on him or her to prove their innocence. Immediately and automatically they <Col N="529" /> are at a huge disadvantage. I fundamentally disagree with that principle. There is a need for balance.</P>
    <P>In the discussions that take place on this, it must be appreciated that there is a certain element of concern and fear among the public and among public representatives in particular. There are outstanding journalists, highly professional, ethical people who operate to very high standards. They are honourable, decent people who do a very professional job, convey the essential element of whatever public debate is taking place and who are very mindful of the protection of the rights of individuals. That is what must be striven towards at all time.</P>
    <P>In relation to libel cases there are particular difficulties. Among the public at large, politicians and in the media, there is good and bad on all sides. It is not a case of &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo;, rather it is important that the overall general good is protected. At present there are difficulties in how cases are conducted in the courts, in relation to how long it takes to process them, how long after libel is alleged that a case gets to court and how it is dealt with. There is a need to speed up the litigation process considerably. Some cases have taken four to five years from the time of the allegation to get to court. I refer specifically to the print media and in that context we are talking about the libel laws and the grounds for taking an action.</P>
    <P>With regard to compensation resulting from such cases, currently a judge is not in a position to give guidelines to juries as to the amount of financial compensation they can award. I am not sure that is wise. It is important to have a yardstick relating to the damage that is done to a person in a defamation case. In the past juries adjudicated on insurance cases. Legislation was passed to enable such cases to proceed without a jury, but there has been no great change in the amount of awards. In relation to all such matters there is a need to have criteria laid down. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law reform should issue judges with guidelines relating to acceptable levels of compensation for various categories of injury.</P>
    <P>In relation to defamation, defendants cannot make a lodgment in court without admission of liability. This is a bit far fetched in the year 2000. There is a need to have issue of admission of liability substantially reviewed. I hope that in the course of the debate somebody can come up with a proposal in that regard.</P>
    <P>There are huge fears with regard to the media industry. As public representatives we are looking over our shoulders all the time. Every meeting to which a public representative goes at this stage, whether it takes place in a local authority, in the House, at a committee or elsewhere, there is openness, transparency and accountability. However, people are also now so careful and cautious that it is nearly obscene. They fear being <Col N="530" /> open and saying what they feel like saying, within reason. They feel inhibited and that is not necessarily good for openness of debate or freedom of speech. It is a matter on which we need to be vigilant.</P>
    <P>It comes down to the fear of being misinterpreted as a public representative. Some politicians are extremely articulate and can precisely put their points in the most effective way. Others get it wrong and convey a message other than what was intended and that can be misrepresented. That must be appreciated. The media need to appreciate that from the point of view of a public representative such fears exist.</P>
    <P>Equally, one can also appreciate that journalists need to get a story. A newspaper is a commercial business. It is a competitive business and those involved have to get headlines, sell newspapers and keep a commercial operation viable. We are lucky to have a number of very good national Irish-based newspapers which are commercially viable, and long may that last. It is important, in the interest of Irish society and of our culture and ethos that the publications of Independent Newspapers, <i>The Irish Times </i>and The <i>Irish Examiner</i> maintain their hold of the Irish market and continue to report on matters of national and international interest. Imported newspapers, particularly tabloid newspapers, which report stories with little substance but a high level of sensationalism, do not serve the interests of the Irish people. I hope Irish newspapers go from strength to strength. It may be necessary to establish a regulator to maintain standards in the press. The press council applies standards to its members but difficulties arise when journalists operate outside the national remit of the press council.</P>
    <P>The journalist, Sam Smyth, suggested recently that if a person in public life can prove that he or she was libelled with recklessness and malice, he or she should be entitled to compensation. If someone is libelled it should not be necessary to prove that the person who committed the libel did so recklessly or maliciously. This puts an unacceptable onus on people in public life and the idea should not be entertained.</P>
    <P>Our overall concern is for fair play and a balance of rights. It is important that we maintain standards. I appreciate the fact that the media have pushed back frontiers, particularly on social matters, and have helped to bring the country into the 21st century. However, when this interferes with the constitutional rights of the individual, frontiers are being pushed too far.</P>
    <P>It is good that we are having this debate and I hope it will lead to a reform of the libel laws.</P>

      <P>It appears that journalists are the only people in the country who are above reproach in matters of morality and integrity. They resemble pharisees while public representatives are cast as publicans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> A short time ago an RTÉ journalist, in his contribution to &ldquo;Thought for the Day&rdquo;, expressed the opinion that there were some bad teachers. He was sacked immediately. RTÉ apologised to the teachers' unions and, although a brilliant man, he was never allowed to work on RTÉ again. I loved to hear him on that programme but now &ldquo;Thought for the Day&rdquo; is neither one thing nor another. Where was that man's freedom and how was it recognised by his colleagues? </P>
    <P>Douglas Gageby once said that the duty of a good press man was to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted. I do not agree. A good journalist should be fair and balanced but many are not. I have sympathy with today's journalists because many of them are freelance or are employed on short-term contracts. Unless they produce scoops they do not make any money. How often do we read a headline which bears very little relationship to the article below it? </P>
    <P>It is right that scandals are exposed. We must all be above reproach. I have been in politics for almost 37 years and I am confident that no skeleton will be found in my cupboard. When we examine scandalous behaviour we must ask ourselves what is the end product of that behaviour. The end product of the planning scandal which is reported every day in our newspapers is that thousands of people in this city have affordable homes and jobs. Of course, the system by which this was achieved was not correct. The end product of the Blood Transfusion Service Board scandal is death and destruction but which scandal gets bigger headlines? Senior people in the Blood Transfusion Service Board retired with large cheques and golden handshakes. Why do the media not report this more fully? On &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last Monday evening half an hour was spent discussing the political scandal but less than five minutes on the BTSB scandal. Is this balanced, fair or just reporting? I ask people in the media to examine their consciences and see if they are being fair. Politicians go before the public every three and a half years, on average. How many journalists go before the public? </P>
    <P>Those who work in the media are interested in stories as products. They campaigned to have the proceedings of the Dáil and Seanad televised, but only the titbits which journalists consider to be interesting are broadcast. Excellent debates on subjects such as child care are completely ignored by the media because they do not sell papers. The business of journalists is to sell a product to make money for themselves and a profit for newspaper proprietors. Local newspapers provide a community service. They are mostly privately owned and run like any family business. They give fair coverage and have a feel for what is happening in their areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> Not long ago an RTÉ employee was found to have taken money but it was not suggested that everyone in RTÉ was dishonest. However, a very eminent reporter claimed on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; a few evenings ago that everyone knows that money was being paid to every politician in the country. What happened in one area of Dublin was not happening in rural Ireland. The councillors and politicians of rural Ireland are decent people. I have seen many millionaires around the country try to become Members of this House. If they could buy votes money would not stop them and if I had to compete against them I would not be here. I went around in my small car, stayed in bed and breakfasts and got elected. I speak on behalf of the county councillors who are decent, respectable people. They can hold their heads high.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous that people in the media, who talk of balance, put us all into one category. There are also journalists who are not right. The same thing happened with the clergy. A handful of priests did wrong but the media branded all the clergy as being wrong. There was no mention of the good work done by priests and nuns who sacrificed their time and their lives to give people an education and to help them. Where was the balance in that? Why did the media not talk about the good that was done? It was far greater than the evil, yet the bad acts were highlighted.</P>
    <P>I always return to the gospel. Our Lord had only to pick 12 people. He picked one bad one who sold him down the river and took the 30 pieces of silver. There are bad people in every section of the community. Human nature has not changed. A small number of people are keeping the law courts busy. If everyone was like the people attending this debate there would be no need for lawyers, gardaí, social welfare workers or the courts. Many people would be out of work. A small number of people who are not living within the law are making many people rich.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I called in this House for the establishment of a press council. The media were not anxious about having one. On that occasion only Senator Manning, Senator Cassidy and I spoke on the issue. Nobody else wanted to talk about it. There should be a press council. Who watches the press? Nobody. People in the media will write something in the newspaper under a large headline which perhaps three months later will be retracted by an apology printed in a small corner. Where is the balance in that? Why is the apology not given in headlines of the same size? There is a balance in the media, but it is not fairly represented in the national newspapers or the tabloids. The tabloids contain as much good reading as the broadsheets.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an ombudsman for the media has been suggested, but that would be a very bad job. It is important to remember the old saying, he who pays the piper calls the tune. If the media were to pay for an ombudsman we <Col N="533" /> could not expect much fair play. We need an independent press council with teeth, not an ombudsman. Journalists could be represented on it.</P>
    <P>With all the lawyers they employ, people in the media can write articles and fail to mention the name of the person involved, yet everybody knows who is being written about. The planning scandal contains nothing but allegations. Nobody has been accused of anything, yet the media are prepared to accuse many people of a lot of things.</P>
    <P>Do the media pay for stories? Journalists say they do not, but do they get their stories by way of expenses? Some reports indicate that the writer is in receipt of Garda files. Often a photocopy of the file will be published. How are such files obtained? Are they paid for? Every person has their price. I often wonder how journalists get confidential information, such as Garda files.</P>
    <P>The media are running the law courts, the politicians and the country. Journalists often telephone people with questions but they are unhappy if the answer is not what they want. A journalist contacted me recently in connection with a speech I made in this House on alcohol abuse. However, he did not want my views on that; he wanted me to say something on another matter mentioned in the debate. I refused and told him I wanted to talk about alcohol abuse. Did he publish that? Did I get a headline? No blessed way. It was not news for him, but if I was daft enough to comment on the matter he wanted me to I would have been in the news.</P>
    <P>The Garda have the power to question people but they must have a reasonable case. It is time we had a privacy law. We need privacy. Journalists have a cheek to telephone somebody at home on a Saturday or Sunday morning to ask questions. People telephoned me recently on a couple of matters but I told them what to do and I did not use parliamentary language. They have a cheek. Who do they think they are? Do they think they are lawyers? They seem to think they have more power than the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I question the sincerity of people in the media. I know they must write to earn a living, but they are not being as fair and honest as they purport to be. Many solicitors and people in other professions have broken the law in a big way, yet we do not see solicitors being accused <i>carte blanche</i> of being dishonest. However, because a few politicians are only alleged to have taken money, we all stand accused by the media who say we are all at it. I want the media to be fair.</P>
    <P>I have been in public life for 36 years. The following are lines from the poem <i>The Village Blacksmith</i>:</P>
    <P>His hair was black and shiny,</P>
    <P>His face a golden tan,</P>
    <P>His brow was wet with honest sweat,</P>
    <P>He earned what ere he can</P>
    <P>And looked the whole world in the face</P>
    <P>For he owed not any man.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> Thank God I can look them all in the face after 36 years. I am not one of those accused. The great majority of the county councillors and Deputies are decent, honest, respectable people. It is scandalous of the media to try to paint us all with the one brush when as yet it is all allegation. There is not one criminal before them.</P>
    <P>The media have taken to calling people by nicknames. A poor fellow got into trouble with the law and he was called by a nickname. Regardless of whether they are criminals, people have been christened and given a name. The media have even taken the liberty of calling Ministers by nicknames. That is scandalous.</P>
    <P>If a Deputy or Senator has done something wrong in public life let him be confronted here. Why should his house, wife and family be photographed? The family is not involved. Human beings are involved here. The behaviour of some cameramen who use telephoto lenses on cameras to try to photograph innocent people is scandalous. There should be more rights to privacy because we need privacy for our families and our homes.</P>

      <P>I would seldom speak on an issue such as this because I would find that I had something else to do. However, at this point the problems have become so manifest that people must speak out. Now is the time to ask how we got so far before we met these people. That worries me more than what these people are saying. Senator Farrell has just made the point about requesting apologies. There is not an edition of the six o'clock news during which one would not see the High Court in the first four minutes. In times past one would never see the courts on the news but one sees the courts in the news every night, whether in cases of murder or an apology. It is in court that one must seek an apology, which is a sad reflection on the broadcast and print media.</P>
      <P>I find it disturbing that people are printing articles just to make money on the basis that if they do not print, they do not make money. I am only about 23 years in public life but up to ten or 15 years ago the journalists were a different calibre of person. Why is that? I always understood that if one was going to be a journalist one studied in the college in Dún Laoghaire and people studied very hard. In the past one always stood up for them because they were trained journalists. Nowadays anybody can write for a newspaper just to make money. I find that upsetting, particularly with regard to the regional rather than the national papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I did not agree with it in the past, a press council is needed. It would be in the interests of the genuine journalists and everybody else, in making sure more money does not have to be paid to people and in facilitating apologies. Although I do not know anything about press councils or commissions, it seems that since the <Col N="535" /> press council came into being in Britain the system works much better there than here.</P>
    <P>I do not want to criticise journalists for the sake of it because I might criticise them for doing just that. Only a few weeks ago in Cork city, there was a discussion about a sale of land in the city. A member of the council made negative allegations in the<i> Irish Examiner</i> against politicians and ex-politicians in the council and other councils. By the next evening, at city council level, the councillor was prepared to say that he was misquoted and had not said what was reported. As Senator Farrell has said, there was no attempt by the relevant paper to give an impression that what they printed was wrong. I cannot say whether the councillor made the remarks or not, but he said publicly in the council that he was misquoted and that he did not make them. In other words, there was an apology to the council.</P>
    <P>Some days afterwards, a column by a journalist in the paper was printed, making the point which the councillor had made, that there was a question mark over the sale of the land to this particular developer or developers. I readily admit that the argument made by the journalist was fair and I am not saying he should not have made it, but if there was any question mark over the sale of the land to the particular developers and if the councillor was making the point on the night, why were there no objections by the councillor when the sale of the land was being made? The press did not bring that matter to the fore or question it.</P>
    <P>That is where I want to see the line being drawn &ndash; I like to see both sides of an argument being put fairly. I know this journalist very well and he is a good friend of mine. I telephoned him and said that I did not understand what he was doing and I asked him why he did not put this question. He said it was only relevant during that week. It is very sad to see that in public life people are prepared to print something just for the sake of it. If people are going to do that, they lose their standards. I had rated him very highly but my opinion of him fell.</P>
    <P>I asked him why he did not question why there were not objections to the sale at the time but that three years later there are objections because a person involved is under question with regard to other matters. I carry no flag for that person or any other. I carry the flag as a city councillor for Cork city and as a Senator of the State. I carry the flag for Cork city and I make no apologies for that. I felt the development was badly needed, irrespective of who bought it and we received a great price. I suppose if we had held it back until today, we might have received more for it. I would not mind holding it back if the city would make more money. I do not care who does it as long as it is done. That is all that worries me.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Examiner</i> was giving the impression that everybody bar one person was wrong, and it <Col N="536" /> was right. That is why I asked at the outset how we got so far before we met them. At that rate, we would do nothing &ndash; I would not get out of bed in the morning if I thought that was the situation. They are right and we are all wrong. How did the city develop so well or so far before these people came in and started making the point that they think it should be done a certain way? Why are they not asking what happened in Dublin, which is another matter?</P>
    <P>I do not want to make points against Dublin, but why is the press not asking how all this came about or how was it created? Why was there was so much corruption created by so few and the opportunity given to them &ndash; if indeed there was corruption because there is still a question mark over this at the tribunals? Obviously, some people are still being questioned. Why was consideration not given by everybody at council, city, county and administrative level to ensure there was a proper development plan that did not create corruption? One creates corruption by giving people the opportunity. That is a sad reflection on us.</P>
    <P>There is no way it could be done in Cork city because in 1969 we had a development plan. We added to it in 1974 and again in 1979 and nobody had any say after that. There was the development plan and we had to work on that. Our tunnel was under consideration in 1972 and it opened in 1999. That is how far ahead we had to plan for development. The Minister knows that is the way we worked. However, that did not happen in Dublin.</P>

      <P>We probably did and that is why Dingle is doing so well.</P>
      <P>Why did we not see this coming and being highlighted by journalists? Why are they not asking how it was created? They should be asking who was wrong, seeking to find out who was not broadminded enough. That is the question I would ask.</P>
      <P>There is a sad state of affairs in County Dublin, not in Dublin city thankfully. The way County Dublin has been planned is something else. Monday after Monday it was expanded by rezoning field after field instead of having a long-term development plan and had there re-zoning to be done it could be done over a five year period. That is what happened in Dublin. Everybody, unfortunately, was lobbied to do various things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no excuses for anybody but a newspaper gave an impression that there was a question mark over Cork city planning when I know there was not. If there is any question of any of the 31 members of that council taking any money, I would walk on his or her corpse. I would find it very disturbing. I can happily say it did not happen but that was not the impression given by the <Col N="537" /><i>Irish Examiner.</i> I resented this as a real Cork man and could not understand why the newspaper did not state on the Tuesday that it was wrong when the relevant member said that he had been misquoted. It should have had the guts to do so. That is what I call calibre.</P>
    <P>An issue may be raised on a local radio station and the impression is given that what is being said is correct. No matter what one does one cannot make contact with the radio station on the two or three telephone lines available. How did we get so far before we met the persons concerned? It worries me that they always seem to have the opportunity to express their point of view.</P>
    <P>There are some excellent and classy journalists in the country whom I give great credit. I read Stephen Collins's column every Sunday. I probably have spoken to him only once but he is very fair and down the middle. I would read his column one thousand times over. I read the columns of one or two others in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>of whom I am very proud because they write about issues in general terms, the way I like them to be discussed &ndash; in other words, in terms of what is best for the country.</P>
    <P>The question is never asked, &ldquo;How was the Dublin issue created?&rdquo;  The people of Dublin do not deserve this. Neither do genuine politicians. I know of city councillors in Cork who are so committed they would die for the place. I know of councillors who are never in a hurry to get home on a Monday night. They would do the same on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights. I am not looking for glory but I would do the same myself. The same is true of councillors in Kerry, Clare and elsewhere. Opportunities should not be created to make money. One should do what is best for one's area.</P>
    <P>Dublin is in a mess. I cannot believe the way it is going. Over a period of seven to ten years it has reached the stage where there is no movement. This is not fair to those living in the capital. One of the persons involved in a particular shopping centre is a Cork man. I am aware of his affiliations and understand the way he thinks. I carry no flag but if the person in question had not built three developments in Cork they would never have been built. I make no apology for saying this but if there is a question mark it is only right and proper that he should be questioned and the media generally should be saying this. I heard a funny joke on an American public television programme last week: &ldquo;How would you know an Irish person with Alzheimer's? They never forget a grudge.&rdquo;  It is sad but that is how they think of us.</P>
    <P>The only place where one will get an apology from journalists is in the courts. There is therefore a need for a press council. I have never spoken about journalists in this way before; I just want them to get on with the job they have to do. We have reached the stage where every little person writing for a newspaper does not know <Col N="538" /> what the particular city or region is about. There are people writing in the<i> Irish Examiner </i>who would not be able to spell the word &ldquo;Cork&rdquo;, who do not know what the people living there are saying and talking about. The rest of us do and they are insulting us by giving the wrong impression.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who took part in the debate. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave us a full statement last night not just on the issues of censorship and defamation but also on the question of ownership of the media and the Government's intentions.</P>
      <P>Although it has not come to any great conclusions, it has been a useful debate. We start from the position that there should never be a close or cosy relationship between the media and those in politics. There must always be tension between us. We see the world in different ways. Mr. Eamon Dunphy once described some of the Irish soccer writers as fans with typewriters. If political journalists were to become fans with typewriters we would be in a bad state. We have to expect therefore a certain stringency, distance and suspicion on the part of the media in all that we do.</P>
      <P>As politicians, we can be very quick to rush to judgment and doubt the motives of journalists who disagree with us. We are very quick to categorise them. If this debate can do something to let each side see the genuine problems of the other and the dimensions within which each works it will have been useful. I have a number of specific proposals to make in this regard.</P>
      <P>There is a big difference between this debate over the last two weeks and a similar debate on the media about five or six years ago on the same issues. At that stage the media represented with a degree of accuracy that the laws of libel and defamation represented an enormous economic drain on newspapers in particular. That case is no longer made. The newspapers and the media generally are among the main beneficiaries of the economic boom. While the libel laws are an irritation and constraint, they do not represent the same degree of threat. It has been said that certain newspapers were prepared to pay out £1 million or £2 million per year in libel costs because the stories which generated the libel payments boosted circulation. While that is a charge that has often been made, it is good that we are not discussing the issue in the context of an immediate economic threat to the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to state that we are discussing this issue in the context of an unprecedented amount of scandal, admittedly in a very limited area of Irish public life, a matter about which Senator Cregan spoke at some length. Whatever the scandal, it is in one specific area. Every other council has a clean bill of health. The scandal has left most figures in national life with their characters unassailed. It would be wrong, therefore, to <Col N="539" /> change the laws of libel and defamation as an immediate response to a crisis. It would be better to change them because they deserve to be changed or not at all.</P>
    <P>As an earnest of good faith I ask the Minister responsible to consider introducing an interim Bill on the reform of the laws of libel and defamation. I think it was Senator Quinn who made the point last week that the Bill promised by the Government is unlikely to see the light of the day in its lifetime. It is No. 65, out of 66, on the C list announced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach at the beginning of this session.</P>
    <P>There is agreement that there are a number of specific changes that could be made, the first of which is a change to the apology laws. If a newspaper makes a mistake and issues an apology this is regarded as an admission of guilt and they cannot do it. I will be very specific here. If a mistake is made about me on the front page in large headlines then the apology should be equally prominent and large. However, if an apology is given in good faith, and very speedily given, where a genuine mistake is made then that should be sufficient. Any fair minded person would regard that as something that can happen, especially at the speed with which the media operate. I would see no difficulty with having that written into law.</P>
    <P>The media request for judges to give a guideline on the financial cost or damages to be awarded is not unreasonable. It is not a guarantee that the awards will come down. In the insurance industry when juries were abolished the judges made higher awards in very many cases. However, if the media would feel happier with judges giving a more informed estimate of the actual damage done to a plaintiff, then I would have no great difficulty with that. I would also have no great difficulty with the lodgment of sums of money in court. These are three immediate reforms. I believe the Minister, having listened to his speech, would have no difficulty with them either. As an earnest expression of his intent that would be well worth doing.</P>
    <P>The media promised to establish a press council or ombudsman but they have not done it yet. They say they will not do it because the libel laws have not been reformed. A press council or ombudsman should be established because it is the right thing to do. Last week I used the phrase &ldquo;a confidence boosting measure&rdquo; to describe it. The public would be assured that if they have legitimate complaints against the media they will be examined inexpensively, speedily and by an impartial person paid for by the media. That would go a long way towards rooting out many of the complaints that are left unresolved because the person making the complaint cannot afford to go to court or being resolved very expensively in court. I urge the media industry to establish an ombudsman fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="540" /> One of the most disappointing parts of the debate has been the reaction of many media people outside the House. They can clearly see the changes they want and make a strong case for them but they do not seem to understand the genuine fears very many people have about giving more power to the media. Those who speak out, as I did last week, will be accused of trying to defend a vested interest, of trying to stop the frontiers being shoved back or of not wanting to see greater freedom of the media for some defensive reason. That is not the case. As Senator Maurice Hayes said in a very eloquent contribution last week, we are talking about a balance of rights &ndash; the right of the individual to privacy, the right of families not to be intruded upon and the right of people to their good name. All these are rights that were hard won and fought for. They need to be protected as well. If we allowed almost unlimited intrusion or if we depended on the media to restrain themselves, the evidence to date would not give us much confidence that this would happen. Media people seem to find it hard to grasp the fact that there is a balance of rights here. They will argue that they will be responsible and will show restraint.</P>
    <P>Our media are not homogeneous. There are all sorts of different newspapers, agendas and standards. Newspapers fight circulation battles by appealing to the lowest common denominator, intruding into privacy and grief and writing stories which can do enormous harm and where there is no justifiable news value involved. These things happen on a daily basis and ordinary people resent this aspect of the media. They are suspicious of change. It is not just the politicians who are suspicious or resent change and who want to see the media restrained. If the media cannot restrain themselves then someone else must do it. The laws of the State and constitutional protection are factors that must also be taken into account. That is the eternal problem.</P>
    <P>For a joke a colleague of mine in the other House, who has raised media issues for quite some time, asked a senior journalist in this House last week why he does not pay some attention to the side of the story which calls for the continuation of certain controls and the establishment of an ombudsman. He was told, &ldquo;You do not pay my salary.&rdquo;  In other words, this is the agenda of the media. If members of the media were to apply that standard to other aspects of public debate then only one side of the story would be reported. I regret that only one side of this story is being reported at present. Those people who support reform of the libel laws will get coverage for their views. The only parts of my speech last week and that of Senator Maurice Hayes that were covered were those that called for change. There was nothing about the part of my speech which said why we should be reluctant or suspicious of change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> If the media are serious about moving this debate on then they should recognise the legitimate fears many ordinary people have about some of the proposed changes. They should also accept that this is an area where a little humility would not go astray. Journalists have said that they will wage war on politicians until they get what they want. They have threatened to do various things until they swing public opinion behind them. I do not believe that they will swing public opinion. We are a conservative and fair minded people and we do not like seeing anyone being done in by the media. People often turn against that type of treatment.</P>
    <P>At the beginning and end of this debate we talked about the balance of rights, fairness and the right to know and to publish as against the constitutional rights of the individual to privacy and to their good name. I am glad that this debate has started. I appeal to my friends in the media to at least open their eyes to the other side of the story.   </P>

      <P>The Minister of State has come here to reply to this matter which the Cathaoirleach kindly allowed me to raise on the Adjournment this evening. It relates to the very serious concerns which have been raised with me by the parents association of Scoil Caoimhghín, Littleton, County Tipperary, which is situated near Thurles. Members who travel the Dublin-Cork road or N8 route will know where Littleton is because they must drive through it.</P>
      <P>Members may be aware that the primary school serving the children in the area is in a deplorable state considering the state of the economy. The prosperity we are experiencing at present has added to the feelings of frustration and anger of the parents of the children attending the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a detailed description of the state of the school which was prepared by experts in the Mid-Western Health Board and the fire office of North Tipperary County Council. The parents association has arranged a meeting for next Monday evening in Littleton because they want to highlight their concern, anger and frustration at the state of their school. They describe it as not <Col N="542" /> a fit, secure or healthy environment for the education of young people and I agree with them. In response I undertook to raise this matter in this House. I hope the Minister of State will give me a response that I can relay to the meeting next week and to the parents and community in Littleton.</P>
    <P>Littleton national school was built in 1947. It consists of eight classrooms, and that includes remedial and special need classrooms. Approximately 153 pupils attend the school, 84 girls and 69 boys. There are nine teachers and one office. The description of the school in reports by the Mid-Western Health Board, a surveyor and a fire officer clearly highlight that standards, particularly those in the toilets, are well below what one would expect. There are not enough toilets for the number of pupils and conditions are very poor. There is no drinking water or hot water in the school, despite the numbers of pupils. One part of the school is covered by a flat felt roof which has cracks and on the inside of which mould is growing. All the windows are defective and repair work is needed. Quite an amount of water lodges directly outside the school, taps malfunction and the roof needs repair. All door frames are defective and need replacing and the drains and gullies are not up to standard.</P>
    <P>This description is also underlined by an engineer's report which points out that all the windows need replacing and the fire officer's report is worrying in that it points out that a number of items need to be addressed. There is no emergency lighting, escape doors were locked or not available for use, escape routes were being used as cloakrooms and cross-corridor doors may be required on the main corridor. This expert information bears out the anger, concern and frustration felt by parents.</P>
    <P>Certain funding has been made available by the Department through some schemes but more needs to be done. I do not wish to sound trite or clichéd in saying that people expect better for their children in this day and age. The quality of education provided by teachers is second to none, as is our education system. We have invested heavily to ensure that our children get the highest possible standard of education. However, the physical environment is very important.</P>
    <P>Last September 12 months, the Gaelscoil in Nenagh moved to a new building from a very over-crowded old building originally built by the Christian Brothers. The quality of the new environment has made an enormous difference and provides proper physical space and so on. It is very important that the physical environment reflects the high standards we expect from the education system and I hope the Minister of State will give a positive reply concerning the necessary repairs and funding required to bring Littleton national school up to the standard we expect and to which our children are entitled.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position regarding an application from the management authorities of Littleton national school, County Tipperary, for additional accommodation. At present, the staffing level at the school includes a principal, five assistant teachers and shared remedial and resource teachers, so the school is well staffed. The current accommodation includes six permanent classrooms.</P>
      <P>The Department received an application from the school authorities seeking grant assistance towards refurbishment and ancillary accommodation. The Department's planning and building unit is assessing the long-term enrolment. Such an assessment will assist in determining the future accommodation requirements, something which is now done on a continuing basis. This is unlike the past when each school was treated as it stood, necessary improvements were assessed and, eventually, may have been carried out. We now plan for the future by carrying out a demographic and structural assessment following which positive decisions are taken. A member of the Department's architectural service will shortly visit the school to carry out a technical inspection of the building. When that assessment has been completed it will be possible to determine how the accommodation needs of the school can best be met.</P>
      <P>The Senator will appreciate that a very large number of schools building projects are being processed. Much of the problem is due to the huge amount of money made available which has created a pile-up in the delivery of the programme. Due to the priority which this Government has given to reversing the neglect of primary schools, the spending Estimates show primary schools building and renovation funding increasing by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation under the previous Government. In addition, we have significantly reduced the burden of fundraising faced by schools and communities. We have reduced local contributions and, in some cases, we are giving 100% grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Senator that the application by the management authorities of Littleton national school will be dealt with as speedily as possible and I thank her for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position. I listened with interest to the litany of problems listed by the Senator. I am somewhat amazed by them as we have had an aggressive schools building and renovation programme over the past number of years and there must have been some local problem which led to the school being in this state. Otherwise, we would have attended to it heretofore. However, the Department's professional staff will <Col N="544" /> shortly visit the school and we will take the necessary action when we receive the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This matter refers to the Tanagh Outdoor Education Centre, County Monaghan, which is facing ever more urgent problems. The centre is one of six outdoor activity centres which receive no State funding, as opposed to nine centres which are State funded. Legislation to be introduced in January 2001 will regularise safety codes for outdoor centres but will mean that the Tanagh centre will be unable to continue in operation.</P>
      <P>The centre was established in 1993 and is completely self-financing, except for a £30,000 annual grant from the local VEC. This centre is fortunate in that it is situated in idyllic surroundings beside a forest which is conducive to many of its activities, and near Annaghmakerrig lake which is renowned for its beauty and facilities. The centre is leased from a local religious order for a very small annual rent and would have been in a financial crisis long ago if it were not for the generosity of the brothers. The closest activity centres to County Monaghan are in counties Louth or Donegal. A large number of counties do not have these facilities.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline the activities which take place in the Tanagh centre and its need for funding. The activities include hill walking, rock climbing, archery, canoeing and orienteering. Last year, for example, the centre catered for over 4,000 young people from national schools north and south of the Border, as well as for many non-educational and youth groups. As many groups return to the centre, it is providing acceptable facilities.</P>
      <P>Over 4,000 people avail of the centre's facilities each year and there could be 50 young people there at any one time on a daily, weekend or five day basis. The fee charged by the centre is approximately 50% less than other VEC or privately run centres. The reason for this is the management and staff of the centre believe that the facilities are so archaic and in such a deplorable condition, it would be unfair to charge more.</P>
      <P>The centre is run by a manager and extremely dedicated and committed staff who work on a part-time basis. The low income from fees and the small amount, when one considers how much it costs to run such a centre, from the local VEC mean it is becoming more difficult to provide more facilities and to improve existing ones in order to provide appropriate activities for an adventure centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The anticipated legislation from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is expected to provide that each centre should improve the ratio of instructors and leaders to participants and employ better qualified staff. <Col N="545" /> The Bill is also expected to provide that centres upgrade existing facilities. Anybody would agree with such safety measures but, without State funding and recognition, the activity centre in County Monaghan will be unable to comply with the Department's legislation and regulations.</P>
    <P>The buildings were previously a monastery and they have been upgraded to the highest possible standard over the years. However, they are extremely old and need refurbishment. I listened to Senator O'Meara speaking earlier and I would love to show her the bathroom and shower facilities at the centre which young people, their leaders and instructors are expected to share. They are archaic. In this day and age, regardless of how well the economy is doing, the problem must be urgently addressed in the interest of privacy. Such standards are no longer acceptable.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group was established which published its report in June last year. It outlined recommendations which should be complied with by all activity centres. The first recommendation was that the facilities of existing recognised centres be improved &ndash; there are nine such centres. It is then envisaged that the facilities of the six unrecognised centres be upgraded. That means it will be approximately three years before the Tanagh centre will be considered for refurbishment.</P>
    <P>What would recognition from the Department mean? It would mean a centre such as Tanagh would be guaranteed approximately £50,000 per year from the Department to improve the activities and facilities it provides and to provide high quality instruction to participants. The Minister for Education and Science has been forceful in encouraging physical education and recreational activities for young people. Since physical education is now part of the school curriculum, it is more important than ever that we enhance the facilities in centres such as Tanagh. That would comply with the Department's objective of encouraging physical and recreational activities for young people.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give consideration to expediting the process of funding existing adventure centres. Under the new legislation providing for safety codes, centres such as Tanagh will not be able to continue. I fear that by imposing these regulations, we will lose a valuable resource in County Monaghan. I look forward to a positive response from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter. Since the 1970s a number of vocational education committees have established outdoor education centres on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. There are currently nine VEC outdoor education centres recognised by the Department of Education and Science which are in receipt of annual grants towards the cost of staffing and equipment. These grants have been paid by the Department since 1988. There are six other outdoor education centres operated by vocational education committees, including the centre at Tanagh, County <Col N="546" /> Monaghan, which are not recognised by the Department and are not in receipt of such grant support.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to the Tanagh centre is that in 1990, County Monaghan VEC sought the approval of the Department to acquire a former secondary boarding school for the purpose of establishing an outdoor education centre. The Department did not give approval to this request on the basis that no further centres should be recognised until a review of the work of the existing centres had been undertaken. However, in January 1992, County Monaghan VEC informed the Department that it had rented the building in Tanagh, initially for a five year period. The building was subsequently refurbished, funded by a FÁS social employment scheme and County Monaghan VEC.</P>
      <P>In order to assess the operation of the outdoor education centres a working group chaired by Mr. Tom Rice, a former Cork city manager, carried out a review of the centres and reported last year to the then Minister for Education and Science. The working group had as its terms of reference to analyse the operation of the recognised outdoor education centres and to make recommendations for their future operation and development. The analysis was to include the drawing up of guidelines for the administration and operation of the centres, consideration of the safety requirements of the centres, the resourcing of the centres, qualifications and registration of staff and range and nature of activities to be provided in the centres.</P>
      <P>In addition, an interdepartmental group under the auspices of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources last year considered the question of safety in adventure centres, including the VEC outdoor education centres. That group has recommended the introduction of a statutory regime whereby adventure centres, including outdoor education centres, will be required to register and to comply with safety standards to be drawn up and monitored by an independent statutory authority. These reports are under consideration in the Department of Education and Science with a view to developing future policies relating to VEC outdoor education centres.</P>
      <P>The position of Tanagh and other VEC outdoor education centres which are not currently recognised for the purposes of funding towards the cost of staffing and equipment will be considered in that context. However, any expansion of the network of outdoor education centres will, among other things, be subject to standard budgetary constraints in relation to the availability of funding.</P>

    <P>I commend Senator Leonard for raising this matter. I have a strong interest in outdoor education centres having been a founder member of the Petersburg Outdoor Education Centre in Galway. It was acquired for the paltry sum of £1 from Galway County Council, when I was chairman of the council, and was transferred to the VEC. Since then approximately £0.5 million has <Col N="547" /> been raised through local funding and £2.5 million through international and national funding. The final phase of the centre on the shores of Lough Corrib will be opened on 2 June.</P>
    <P>The centre in County Monaghan is located in a wonderful area both environmentally and from <Col N="548" /> the point of view of outdoor activity. The project deserves every support and I will recommend to the Department that it adopt a positive attitude to it.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 May 2000.</P>
