      <P>As I understand this is the final sitting day before the Christmas recess, I extend seasonal greetings to all Members of the House and all members of the staff of the House. The past year has been an extremely busy and productive one for the Seanad. I thank the Leader of the House, the Deputy Leader, the Government Whip, the Leaders and Whips of the other groups and all Senators for their assistance and co-operation during the year. I especially thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Cosgrave.</P>
      <P>The construction works carried out during the year in proximity to the Seanad Chamber resulted in some discomfort and inconvenience for Members and staff. I thank everyone for their understanding in this matter. I pay a special tribute to the Clerk and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad whose hard work, devotion to duty and helpfulness we sometimes take for granted. I know that the friendly and accommodating attitude which obtains at all times in the Seanad office is appreciated by all Members.</P>
      <P>I wish everyone a relaxed and peaceful Christmas and a happy, healthy, prosperous and election free new year.</P>
      <P>I have notice from Senator Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to take immediate action in the interests of safety to provide extra carriages for the DART service which is at present dangerously overcrowded.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to recognise in a material way the under-funding of the Aer Lingus pension fund over a period of years and to take action to bring Aer Lingus pensions up to the level enjoyed by pensioners of other semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of all Members of the House, I wholeheartedly congratulate our distinguished colleague, Senator Manning, who was conferred with a Doctorate of Literature at the conferring ceremony yesterday by the Pro-Chancellor of the National University of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999 &ndash; motion to withdraw, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion re Extradition Act, 1965, to be taken without debate; No. 3, motion re Article 3 of the Fourth Protocol set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam, to be taken without debate; No. 4, motion re earlier signature by the President of the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 2000, to be taken without debate; No. 5, motion re earlier signature by the President of the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2000, to be taken without debate, and No. 6, National Training Fund Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages, not to be taken before 11 a.m. today. The final item on the agenda is statements on homelessness, to be taken from 12 noon to 1 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for his very kind remarks, congratulations and good wishes which I very much appreciate. I join the Cathaoirleach in extending seasonal greetings and wish to thank a number of people. I thank the Cathaoirleach in particular. He sets the tone in this House and has the great quality of a good chairman in that he has great authority which he rarely has to use. We are very lucky to have him as Cathaoirleach. I also congratulate and send good wishes, which I will do in another place later, to my good friend, the Leas-Chathaoirleach. Perhaps future publications should include some of the one liners of the Leas-Chathaoirleach. They can be most effective in bringing to a stop Senators who tend to be long winded in their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the Leader I extend our good wishes to the Clerk, Assistant Clerk and staff of the House. The House is run in an efficient way and a great deal of work takes place behind the scenes. They have great patience, tolerance and good humour in their dealings with us. Sometimes that tolerance is not merited. An effort has been made by the press over the last while to give better cover<Col N="1591" /> age to the Seanad's proceedings, especially by RTE and <i>The Irish Times</i>. I urge the other newspapers, which do not have a journalist dedicated to covering this House, to look to the example of RTE and <i>The Irish Times</i>. I also extend thanks to the ushers, the reporters and my colleagues for their work in the past year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Order of Business, it is the right of the Leader to withdraw No. 1, a Government Bill which was put on the Order Paper by the Government. However, some explanation might be offered as to why it was left on the Order Paper for so long and why it is now being withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Leader on ensuring that the Electoral (Amendment) Bill will be initiated in the Seanad. I see that it provides for voting machines. Until Florida most of us thought a dimpled chad was a dog that ran badly at Shelbourne Park. Now we know differently. This Bill will give us an opportunity to examine the range of voting arrangements and the anomalies that exist.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader, with the co-operation of all parties, put the issue of Seanad reform high on the agenda in the new year? There is much talk about Dáil reform at present and we have been left behind. All Members have ideas for reform and I can assure the Leader of the full co-operation and support of this side of the House in the new year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Cathaoirleach in thanking everybody involved in the work of the Seanad in the past year. This has been a year of achievement, the result of the hard work and dedication of everybody the Cathaoirleach mentioned. I include Members of the House in that. Speaking on behalf of the Opposition side of the House, there has been a considerable amount of working together in the past year. That did not come about by accident but through the good humour and help of the Cathaoirleach's team. The year 2001 is the first year of a new century and I hope will be one of achievement.</P>
      <P>The House basks in the glory of achievement and Senator Manning's achievement yesterday is one of which we should be proud.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different types of doctorates and an honorary doctorate is most welcome as a token of recognition. However, Senator Manning's doctorate was hard earned with a great deal of work. I have just read a list of his achievements. I was only aware of three of his four books and of his novel. However, looking at the list of articles and his other literary achievements, one realises how fortunate we are to have him as a Member of the House. He has been a Member since 1981 and only left this House once, when he was demoted to the Lower House for a number of years. I will not list his other achievements but we share in the glory, success and <Col N="1592" /> recognition of one of our Members. We appreciate the great work he does and the manner in which he has handled his task in this House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Order of Business, I am not sure of the protocol when the Leader announces that items will be taken without debate. I have never heard so many items being taken without debate. No. 1 will not easily be glossed over. It has been on the Order Paper for a long time and to remove it like that is at least open to question. An explanation is required.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to an item I have raised in the past, particularly at this time of the year. We are into the Christmas season, when accidents involving drink driving are a great concern. I was surprised to learn in the last 24 hours that insurance companies had insured people against being drunk and having an accident. The intention to remove this facility was announced yesterday. If that is the case, I am horrified that until now it was possible to insure oneself against an accident occurring when one was drunk.</P>
      <P>What is even more horrifying is the number of provisional licences that have been issued, a total of 380,000. That is something the Government can deal with. The waiting list for driving tests is now 90 weeks in the Navan area and 45 weeks in the north Dublin area. I ask the Leader to draw this to the attention of the Minister and Ministers of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This is a scandal that must not continue. While I am glad action is being taken in regard to reminding people about the need for safety on the roads over Christmas, the driving test delay is an issue that must be dealt with by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the congratulations to the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Clerk, Assistant Clerk and the staff of the House on a productive year in the Seanad. We have worked well. An increasing number of Bills are initiated in the Seanad rather than in the Dáil and a large number of amendments are accepted. This puts an extra burden of work on the Clerk, Assistant Clerk and staff but this work is carried out effectively, efficiently and with great charm.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate Senator Manning. As Senator Quinn said, it adds to the reputation of the House and we bask in the achievement. It is a hard earned doctorate. Senator Manning is a prolific writer and it is fitting that he has now been conferred with a doctorate. Congratulations are also due to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the National Library for purchasing the Circe espisode of James Joyce's <i>Ulysses.</i> I understand this is the first significant piece of Joyce's manuscript to be brought to Ireland. It is a great achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now sound a jarring note in relation to the Order of Business. A number of speakers sought an explanation from the Leader of the House as to why he seeks our agreement to the withdrawal, after more than 18 months, of the <Col N="1593" /> Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill. I will go a step further and propose an amendment to the Order of Business that it not be withdrawn. There are solid reasons for this proposal.</P>
    <P>We welcomed the Bill when it was put on the Order Paper. It provides a mechanism to control the digging up of the streets in this city and elsewhere. I raised this matter last Monday night at the city council meeting. The city manager is eagerly awaiting this Bill's provisions so that local authorities will have some control over the inordinate level of digging up of streets. The Bill will, I hope, allow network operators in the telecommunications sector to share infrastructure and to carry out work in an organised way. The Bill should be debated in the House.</P>
    <P>Senators received a document this morning from the Simon Community about the number of people sleeping rough in Dublin. We should acknowledge that homelessness is one of the biggest problems facing us today.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will have an opportunity in the afternoon to deal comprehensively with the issues I assume he intends to raise at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wanted to point out that homelessness is a very serious issue which should be discussed at every opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Leader and other speakers in congratulating Senator Manning on his D.Litt conferral. This is a major academic distinction which the Senator richly deserves. I do not know whether the late James Dillon had any influence in regard to the awarding of the doctorate which reflects well on Senator Manning and the House. I know he will carry the burden lightly.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether it was a mere felicitous coincidence that the Circe manuscript was purchased yesterday. Perhaps Senator Manning had some indirect influence on its acquisition by the National Museum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Costello in welcoming its acquisition. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is to be congratulated on acting so efficiently and effectively. She provided much more money than was ultimately required to acquire the document.</P>
      <P>I, too, thank the Cathaoirleach for conducting proceedings during the year with his usual good humour and tact. I also thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and recognise and appreciate the work carried out in the Cathaoirleach's office and the Seanad office. The staff's burden of work seems to be increasing dramatically and it is time someone in authority seriously considered providing additional manpower and financial resources in this area. The staff do tremendous work under great pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" /> I thank George Devlin of RTE and Jimmy Walsh of <i>The Irish Times</i> for their balanced coverage of Seanad proceedings. I also thank the ushers and the reporting staff for their contributions during the year which are much appreciated.</P>
    <P>It would be useful to discuss Seanad reform as there are aspects of our work which could be improved upon. Perhaps Senator Manning will convene the sub-committee after Christmas so that we can discuss these issues in detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach's comments this morning prove that he is a kind and gracious man. I was particularly struck by his remarks concerning the accommodating and friendly attitude of the Seanad staff and endorse them wholeheartedly. The Cathaoirleach also displays an accommodating and friendly attitude, for which I am personally grateful. I also concur with the Cathaoirleach's remarks about the Leas-Chathaoirleach and others, particularly George Devlin, Jimmy Walsh and other journalists who cover the House from time to time.</P>
      <P>I join my colleagues in congratulating my leader, Senator Manning, on receiving his D.Litt. The award is a very fitting and well deserved one which reflects Senator Manning's various worthy works over the years. As has been stated previously, he will wear the honour lightly.</P>
      <P>I am sure we are all disturbed to note that IBEC may withdraw from the national agreement and partnership process due to the raising of the PRSI ceiling in the recent budget. This prospect is a cause of great alarm. Three announcements have been made in the past few weeks in regard to skilled job losses in Motorola in Dublin, a company in Cork and an industry in Sligo which is due to relocate in Hungary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is Senator Manning's day. I <Col N="1595" /> do not understand people saying his award is a reflection on the Seanad. He received the D.Litt because he is excellent in his field and we should congratulate him without seeking to bask in his reflected glory.</P>
      <P>There is a biblical saying, &ldquo;Suffer the little children to come unto me&rdquo;. As Christmas approaches, children throughout the world are suffering. As people sing Christmas carols throughout Ireland, children in Africa, Europe and elsewhere are dying because the United Nations, of which Ireland is a member, is imposing sanctions on these countries. We should reflect over the coming days on the consequences of our actions for children throughout the world. We may not approve of the regimes in which they live and we may not like their leaders but we must recognise that children are dying as a result of UN sanctions. Christ said, &ldquo;Suffer the little children to come unto me&rdquo; but by relying on us for assistance, via the UN, these children are dying.</P>

      <P>The Red Cross has received several hundred applications for relief from Irish flood victims. We all recall the heartrending scenes of sheer devastation during the recent floods. Young couples had their dreams shattered and old people were reduced to a state of fear and anxiety. The Government has asked the Red Cross to handle this matter. Perhaps the Leader will raise this issue with the relevant Minister because Christmas will be a very bleak time for these people. If these people were to receive some good news over the coming days, it might make their circumstances more bearable. Nobody can truly appreciate how they have suffered. If we do not indicate to them that they will be assisted in some way, they will feel that the flooding could recur at any stage.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator Manning on his doctorate. Everyone is so enthusiastic about the matter that I am beginning to fear for my medical practice.</P>
      <P>Would it be possible for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House later today to explain what is happening in terms of the Human Rights Commission? A very important committee was set up to put forward names for this commission and many of them have been ignored by the Government. If they ignore the committee is amending legislation not necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that No. 5 is being taken without debate, would it be possible to have a debate on fisheries early next session? The Council of Ministers met over the past two days to review the coming year. We have lost quite a substantial amount in terms of the white fish industry due to negotiations which were finalised. It is good the mackerel fishery has increased by an <Col N="1596" /> additional 2,000 tonnes. While we have suffered greatly in relation to the reduction in cod and hake quotas, the Government, through the review group, proposed that conservation and management measures be introduced for white fish stock for the next five years, which has been accepted by the Commission. I hope the same will happen for other species. I would like the Minister to come to the House early in the new year to advise us in particular on the negotiations which took place in relation to set aside of certain fisheries and compensation for fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my esteemed colleague and convey my compliments to everybody for the Christmas season. Unfortunately, I do not think the widow of Jerry McCabe will be having such a happy Christmas. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform said a report would be issued regarding the exact grounds of these prisoners' release. Having listened to what Deputy O'Malley said, I am horrified to think that it would appear one of the prisoners was released on passionate rather than compassionate grounds, which is terrible. It is obnoxious that the man had the comfort of a woman for the night &ndash; I do not think that was part of the deal for the temporary release. It is reprehensible that this sort of thing can happen. The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, promised a full report and I ask the Leader to have it sent to us during the recess as I am anxious that such an outrage is not perpetrated again against the family of a person who was murdered by terrorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in wishing goodwill for everybody, including Senator Manning whom I always thought was a doctor. He certainly has the presence of a professor and his award was a great achievement.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leader for sending the appropriate Ministers to the House yesterday, and I hope that continues. I think it was particularly appropriate and clever that on the Appropriation Bill, the only case where there was a need for a baby sitter, the Leader brought the Minister of State with responsibility for children to the House. Perhaps in the future we should have guarantees that debates are taken by Ministers who are qualified to speak on Bills.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan raised the possible withdrawal of IBEC from the partnership agreement because of PRSI, and I support the call for a debate. In the context of the first PPF, IBEC said the deal should stand but are now whinging because they did not get what they wanted in the budget which shows they are not people with clout. I suggest some members should withdraw from IBEC rather than IBEC withdraw from the partnership structure.</P>
      <P>I second Senator Costello's amendment to the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to be in a posi<Col N="1597" /> tion to thank the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Leader, the staff of the House and the serious media which have been able to reflect the importance of the House and the contributions of so many. I wish everybody a happy Christmas and seasons greetings for 2001. In particular I thank the Leader whom I have always found to be very courteous and obliging.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of another debate on Seanad reform. I ask that as part of that agenda the by-election system be considered. It needs consideration as it does not work in the interests of either the Opposition or Government sides. I know it is not just a matter for this House, but it should be part of the debate if we are to be democratic in how we proceed.</P>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in congratulating my colleague, Senator Maurice Manning. I also thank him on behalf of his current and past students, one of whom specifically asked to be remembered to him. They above all appreciated his contribution through the years. We are delighted to be in a position to formally recognise the long overdue achievement of Dr. Manning.</P>
      <P>Will there be in the near future a debate on the Nice Summit and the post-Nice agenda? I would appreciate if such a debate could be timetabled as soon as possible as I would like to make arrangements to be here. Members on both sides would like the opportunity to air their views and have a constructive debate.</P>

      <P>I join in the good wishes to Senator Maurice Manning on his further elevation. It should also be pointed out that in recent days he headed the poll in the election to the governing body. Some of us could do with seeing a doctor this morning, but perhaps Dr. Manning may not fit the bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the confirmation by the Tánaiste of the announcement by Deputy Belton of 1,300 additional jobs for Longford.</P>
      <P>I express my thanks to the Cathaoirleach and the other Acting Chairmen. If others wish to gain valuable training experience they are welcome.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I call for a debate on motor insurance. The Committee on Enterprise and Small Business has done much research into insurance and all the <Col N="1598" /> insurance companies appeared before the committee. We have a wealth of knowledge that we could make available which would be helpful to many young people seeking insurance. I would, therefore, welcome a debate on the subject in the new year.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleagues in congratulating Senator Maurice Manning on his doctorate, which is well deserved. He has been an academic all his life. He has done wonderful historical research which will be a legacy to this State in the future. This is an honour he eminently deserves.</P>
      <P>What is the position in relation to the ratification of the UN International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination? When does the Leader propose bringing this before the House for a full debate? It is something that should be discussed in detail and I hope an opportunity will be provided to do so soon.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Extradition Act, 1965 (Application of Part II) Order, 2000, there is a need for full discussion. I hope the Leader will be in a position to provide us with an opportunity to contribute to a debate on that important issue.</P>
      <P>I also request the Leader to provide time in the House to discuss the conclusions of the Nice Summit. Some of the decisions made in Nice are fundamental and will have huge repercussions for this State in the future. This House should be afforded an opportunity to discuss them.</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues in offering the compliments of the season to everybody, particularly Senator Manning. Regarding Senator Avril Doyle's comments on the system of by-election in this House, in the spirit of good will that pertains at this time of year, I will presume that no reflection on the most recent by-election victors was intended. Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to get to know Senator Doyle, as I have her colleagues. However, in the spirit of the season, I will give her the benefit of the doubt.</P>
      <P>I note that today, probably for the first time in some weeks, we have heard no calls for a debate on education. While that is entirely reasonable, given that our next sitting will not take place for some considerable time, nevertheless I ask the Leader not to have a debate on education until such time as all the other processes and structures available to the teachers have been availed of. The current situation is most unfortunate. If the teachers were to enter into the spirit of the season and remove the pupils from the equation and the difficulties in which they have placed them, I am sure that gesture of good will would be reciprocated by the Minister and we could look forward to coming back in the new year with the teachers' dispute a thing of the past.</P>

      <P>We should all take on board the point made by Senator Avril Doyle. It applies mainly to the Opposition. If a Member of the Opposition loses or gives up a seat in the Seanad, the Government side of the House takes it. It is from that point of view that by-elections to the Seanad are not satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Doyle's call for a debate on the Nice Summit. It would appropriate to have an early debate on that.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, Dardis, Avril Doyle and Glennon called for another debate on Seanad reform. As has already been stated, there is a sub-committee under the chairmanship of Senator Manning in place and its deliberations on Seanad reform are at a very advanced stage. It is hoped we will have concrete proposals to put before the Seanad for consideration early in the next session. We have seen the proposals on Dáil reform. We have proposals that I am sure the Seanad will approve, which will enhance its proceedings, broaden its whole operation and include facilities for MEPs, North and South, to speak and enable us, on Fridays, to discuss European reports with our European colleagues. It is nice to see Senator Avril Doyle here this morning.</P>
      <P>Senators Farrell and Quinn called for a debate on the insurance industry. Senator Quinn highlighted that 380,000 people have a provisional driving licence. I will pass his views to the Minister. It certainly is an enormous number. It is much too high. I hope the matter will be addressed in the near future.</P>
      <P>I call on the insurance companies to show their concern by doing something to encourage people not to drink by giving a 25% reduction in premium to members of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. It is time the 200,000 people in Ireland who respect the spirit in which driving licences were given to us by the Government got some encouragement. We should encourage young people, in their early years at least, to realise that there is an alternative. There is the sporting life and enjoyment without over-indulgence in alcohol. Unfortunately some young people, having over-indulged, take the keys of their car and drive and the result is what is perhaps the most unpleasant experience any family endures, the loss of a son or a daughter through driving while under the influence of drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will pass Senator Coghlan's view to the Minister. I know he would wholeheartedly congratulate the Government on creating 150,000 or more new jobs since it come into office in 1997. I will <Col N="1600" /> pass Senator Ó Murchú's views about the Red Cross to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry called on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to explain what is happening in terms of the Human Rights Commission. I will pass her views on to the Minister also.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner congratulated the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, on negotiating a very difficult trade deal at the EU which concluded only at 6.00 a.m. today. I congratulate everyone involved and all who were successful in having the Irish proposal for conservation measures accepted. Ireland is such a small country, but such an important one in the context of the fishing industry. The Minister, Deputy Frank Fahey, all his officials, Joey Murrin and everyone associated with the fishing industry can be proud of the job they have done under extremely difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>I will pass Senator Ridge's views on to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Ross's point once again. However, he labours the point every day. Is a Minister, Senator, Minister of State or Dáil Deputy to speak only on issues with which they are familiar? That would not be fair. There is precedent over the years for Ministers of State coming to the House as a result of requests to me as Leader of the House to facilitate Senators' calls for Bills, statements or debates. The Senator is perhaps being a bit mischievous but it is not reasonable that he should continue to make these demands. Senator Ross has been known as a reasonable man in the 20 years he has been a Member of this House and he should not change coming up to Christmas.</P>
    <P>In response to Senators Doyle and Quinn, I can inform the House that on Tuesday, 3 February, we will have a full day's debate on the Nice Summit.</P>
    <P>I will pass Senator Taylor-Quinn's views on to the Minister. I understand the Minister for Foreign Affairs is meeting the foreign affairs committee this morning at 11 o'clock and that matter will be discussed. I will pass Senator Glennon's views on to the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate you, Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Deputy Leader, Senator Dardis, Senator Manning and all the other leaders of groups in the House, the Government Whip, Senator Fitzgerald, who has done a magnificent job&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to accept this amendment. An analysis of the levy grants accounts for the past four years revealed some interesting facts. For example, the <Col N="1603" /> levy grants schemes have high administrative costs associated with them. Administrative costs account for approximately 50% of the expenditure from the levy fund grants over the period 1996 to 1999. Payments for administration actually exceeded payments made to training projects in two of the past three years. For instance, payments for industrial training projects in 1999 amounted to £1.8 million. The administration payment to FÁS from the levy grants fund amounted to just over £2 million. In 1998, more money was spent on the administration of the schemes than was even received in the levy.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion that the surplus levy should only be used for the development of training within the sector from which the levy was collected, this would create new rigidities and would be even more restrictive than the situation as it has operated up to now under the industrial training committees.</P>
      <P>Funding paid out to different sectors has been disproportionate to income received from those sectors over the past few years. For example, in 1999 the construction sector received £1.77 million for training projects but the sector only contributed £11,000. The levy grants surplus is decreasing very slowly. It stood at £11.7 million at the end of 1997 and reduced to £11.2 million at the end of 1999. While FÁS's accounts indicate that £5.68 million of the surplus at the end of 1999 was committed to grants to employers and training projects on the basis of the past experience, my officials estimate that approximately £4 million is likely to be spent in the year. That includes £2 million for administration of the schemes.</P>
      <P>Our intention is to review existing schemes in consultation with FÁS. I can envisage, however, that any scheme which demonstrates that it is relevant, serves a real need, is reasonably costed and provides added value in terms of human resource development of employees will receive support from the national training fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was also moved on Committee Stage in the Dáil and, as I explained in my comments on Report Stage, if this amendment were to stand it would make the fund completely unworkable because money could not be disbursed from the fund until there was full consultation with employees and employers. Disbursement would be tied to consultation. What we have written into the Bill instead is that there will be consultation on the programmes and the overall approach that is being adopted in relation to the use of the fund, but the notion that there would be specific consultation in relation to each disbursement would be unrealistic and unworkable. It would effectively paralyse the operation of the fund and would be of no service to either employers or employees.</P>
      <P>It is my intention, as I explained in the Second Stage debate yesterday morning, to set up a national consultative committee, an advisory committee, to advise me and my Department on the fund generally. The consultative committee will be made up of employers, employees, representatives and others who have expertise in the whole area of training. I want the expert group to advise on the overall approach. The detail on individual projects which will require funding from the fund should be done on an independent basis and not on the basis of consultation all the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the payments to be made out of the fund at the discretion of the Minister. In her response to Senator Coghlan, the Minister referred to the establish<Col N="1605" /> ment of a consultative body. Will this body be statutory or purely consultative? In the context of her remarks that she is anxious to have the widest possible consensus, will she give serious consideration to ensuring that locally elected representatives are included on the consultative body? I ask this question because there seems to be a mind-block within some Departments on using the expertise which is obviously available at local authority level. I was one of the Senators who some years ago tabled an amendment &ndash; it was accepted by the then Government &ndash; to ensure that councillors would not be excluded from the State body being set up. A number of Acts have specifically excluded members of local authorities and I do not understand why this blockage exists. Local authority members have the widest possible experience and expertise across a large number of areas and as they are part-time politicians at local level they earn their keep in a variety of skills and industries.</P>
      <P>This legislation is about paying out money for upskilling. I assume &ndash; I ask the Minister to confirm this &ndash; the payments will be made in the context of addressing need at local and regional level rather than at national level. Will the area partnership boards be paid money out of the fund for their many schemes? Will local authorities be paid out of the money for upskilling under their future terms of reference under the Bill to be introduced next year? I am attempting to establish the mindset of the Minister and whether, in forming a consultative body which will be national in character, she will bring in the old usual suspects &ndash; the social partners, IBEC, trade unions and the voluntary sector. I know it cannot be done specifically in the Bill but I ask her to indicate her views on this matter. I want to put it as strongly as I can that it is unfair and unacceptable that more than 1,500 elected representatives who give of their time and expertise to the development of democracy at local level should, for some strange, unknown and obscure historical reason, be excluded from consideration in appointments to national boards.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn is elected by a different constituency and no doubt he will want several graduates from the NUI to be on the advisory board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> I do not favour politicians being on boards of this kind. This is an advisory board and there is no provision in the legislation for such representation as circumstances change over time and we want some flexibility. Writing such a provision into legislation would been much too rigid and inflexible. I am not saying this is the position in all cases but I do not favour putting politicians on boards or advisory groups as it politicises them and puts the politician in a difficult position. If I decided to nominate a councillor with expertise in training from a particular party no doubt an effort would be made to have a member from every party to avoid the politicisation of the advisory group.</P>
    <P>The people on the board will have expertise in this area. I have an open mind on who they might be. Obviously I would like representatives of employees and employers as the purpose of the fund is to focus companies on the need to upskill and train their workers and also heighten the awareness of employees of their development as employees and the need to place a constant emphasis on upskilling themselves. I also want to ensure that the unemployed and those entering the labour market have the necessary skills for the jobs being created.</P>
    <P>An area in which I am particularly interested is the training of people with disabilities. I would like to have somebody appointed to the advisory group who has expertise and an interest in this area. Disabled people have not had a fair share of the resources allocated to training in the past. This is a major problem for us as we move forward. Disabled people should have the opportunity to lead more independent lives and to participate in the prosperity which has been generated. They deserve to be able to access the jobs being created in the labour market. We did not place enough attention on this in the past.</P>
    <P>I have taken on board the points made by both Senators. If there are councillors who have strong views on training or expertise in this area I would like to hear from them. I could not agree to the appointment of a councillor from whatever party, even an independent councillor, to the national advisory training board as it would be a retrograde step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy for the Minister in terms of the difficulties which face any Minister in making appointments to State boards. However, like a dog with a bone, I am not inclined to let the issue rest there. Without labouring the point, I understand there is a list of eminent people which is provided to Departments by outside bodies. For example, I am aware of the existence of a list of eminent women who are available for appointment to boards. I have no doubt there will be a consultative process involving IBEC, the trade union movement and voluntary sector in the context of the establishment of the advisory board. The Minister will not be arbitrary in her decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding her marked reluctance to <Col N="1607" /> involve herself in the appointment of people because of their political character and in the context of my earlier comments on lists of suitable people, I ask her to give consideration to a concept I had up my sleeve in the event of her answer. There are three representative bodies of local authorities &ndash; the AMAI, the municipal authorities organisation; the Local Authorities Members' Association, LAMA, and the General Council of County Councils, GCCC. Without committing herself today, and in light of the difficulties which face her and her colleagues in making these appointments, will the Minister indicate whether she will consider accepting a list of suitable eminent people from these professional bodies which represent the body politic of local government? This list, which would come from the professional bodies, could be used as a basis for consideration and, therefore, the anticipated opposition the Minister seems to think she would encounter by appointing politicians might be avoided.</P>
    <P>I enthusiastically welcome the Minister's remarks on disability. As a member of the labour shortages sub-committee of the National Economic and Social Forum I was very honoured to have been part of the consultative process that led to the publication of its Report No. 19 which the Minister and her officials are aware of. I made a generous reference to it in my Second Stage contribution yesterday. Elements of this report are worthy of serious consideration and they could be implemented in the short term rather than having another think-tank to reflect on them. The forum set up the process to fast track these ideas and concepts because it wanted them to be swiftly transmitted to the Minister's Department and her colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. The bulk of the forum's recommendations are aimed at both Departments. There are very specific recommendations on disability and on giving access to disabled people to allow them enter the workforce.</P>
    <P>There are very specific recommendations in relation to a matter which I have raised over of years on the forum, that is, making work accessible to older people. I compliment the Minister on having made a public statement to this effect in September last. When I heard her comments I said to myself that the scales had dropped from the eyes of the Department at last and it will now look at older people. In the 1990s many people in their early fifties were made redundant by State bodies and throughout the rest of the workforce. They have a very valuable contribution to make but it seems that ageism has crept into industry. Statistics released in Britain recently showed that there is a very discriminatory attitude among employers to employing people over 45 years of age.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will elaborate, not today necessarily, on the statement she made in September in this regard. This cohort of workers <Col N="1608" /> would make a very valuable contribution to industry and they would help address the serious skills shortages we are experiencing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's views on disability and the fact that she highlighted the importance of access to the workforce. Many Departments have not achieved their 3% quota of disabled people and that is the first place the Minister could start.</P>

      <P>I have long been an admirer of the Minister's appointments, particularly her two most recent ones, the successor to Judge Declan Costello, Judge Seán O'Leary, and the eminent senior counsel, Michael Cush.</P>
      <P>I can understand the difficulties that could arise with the appointment of politicians, but I feel strongly that they should never be discriminated against. Recently there are difficulties for politicians in other fora. However, we should not allow what happens to a few to colour our overall thinking. I know this is not the case with the Minister. She talked about the practical difficulties that we all know could emerge from a particular appointment, but an individual should not be ruled out by virtue of being a politician who might be very suitable for a position.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the comments made by the Minister on disability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not that. It was because of his competence, knowledge base and the fact that he is independent minded. The group was made up of a lot of vested interests. I wanted someone who could pull everything together and provide us with a report quickly. I am very open minded to appointing the best people rather than thinking about the category from which they come from or categorising them into various representative groups. I may appoint a politician with the relevant expertise to the advisory committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney asked me if a list of eminent local authority members was sent to me by the association. If a list was sent to me 1,500 names would be on it because I do not know any politician who does not regard himself as eminent or would want to be excluded. I get the gist and understand the politics of what is being said here. I have an open mind about the appointments. I <Col N="1609" /> have not thought about possible candidates. Senator Quinn would be an excellent representative on bodies dealing with employer interests&mdash;</P>

      <P>I share Senator Mooney's views on ageism which now begins about the age of 40; it used to be 65. Because of high unemployment in the past all of our schemes and policies were geared towards getting people out of work. We must reverse that, both in relation to what the State does and in private practice. Some northern Scandinavian countries have introduced innovative pension related proposals which deserve our consideration. It never ceases to amaze me that we expect people in the Garda Síochána to retire at the age of 57. People in the Civil Service must work 40 years before they get a full pension. You must be 20 years in politics to get a full pension. Those of us who came in 23 years ago have gone past the full pension stage, believe it or not. We must look at the way pensions are constructed with a view to encouraging people, if they wish, to stay longer in the workforce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her kind words about appointments.</P>
      <P>Section 8 deals with offences and penalties. Section 8(1) states: &ldquo;An employer or the agent of an employer who does not pay a levy which is due and payable under <i>section 3</i> shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;  But section 8(5) states:</P>
      <P>Whichever is the later, but no such proceedings shall be instituted later than 5 years from the date on which the offence concerned was committed.</P>
      <P>I am sure there is no danger of its going unnoticed by an employer. Perhaps a person who noticed that he broke the law but had not realised it at the time could be the victim of a vindictive prosecution four and a half years later. I imagine that the two previous subsections cover this aspect. Perhaps the Minister would put my mind at rest and tell me whether it is possible for someone to unwittingly commit an offence yet be made aware of it four and half years later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator can take it that several reminders would be sent to the employer in question. It is not envisaged that someone would be unaware that they committed an offence. This <Col N="1610" /> is a fairly standard provision in legislation of this kind. The national training fund will receive 0.7% of an employer's PRSI. The authorities would send several reminders to the employer in relation to the payment of that money.  </P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for indulging Senator Coghlan and me but they were important matters.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to know if the Minister intends to refocus and rebalance traditional departmental policies. She referred earlier to the ageism issue. I am thinking about people who are medium to long-term unemployed. Many of them are in my part of the country and in the more economically disadvantaged areas of the Border counties and the west, which to me stretches from Donegal to Kerry. There are other pockets of unemployment as well. There are, however, difficulties peculiar to the topography of that part of the country.</P>
      <P>I do not want to make a Second Stage speech but I cited the best example of this yesterday. The Minister's officials will be aware of the series of articles published in <i>The Irish Times</i> that I referred to about the unemployed. A reference was made to a gentleman in County Cavan who had 45 job interviews. He sold his farm six years ago and he genuinely wants to work. The report was a sad reflection on us.</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to interrupt the Senator but these matters do not arise under section 11. As the Senator said, they are more appropriate to Second Stage. Section 11 deals with the short title and commencement of the Bill. I will, however, allow him ask the Minister a brief question. I am sure she will be pleased to respond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, a Chathaoirligh, for your indulgence. This is my only opportunity to raise this matter and I do not want to delay the House.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that when the Bill is enacted there will be a refocusing on and targeting of those who genuinely want to work but cannot, for reasons that are not most obvious in an urban environment such as lack of transport, lack of access to regional growth centres and lack of upskilling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, only yesterday I met FÁS representatives. Only one individual in the north west took up an apprenticeship as a plasterer, which is incredible. The region includes Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and other counties. The bulk of apprentices are in their late teens or early twent<Col N="1611" /> ies but many people could upskill themselves and increase their earning capacity as they get older. They would be quite suitable for apprenticeship and other forms of training. That is the intention.</P>
      <P>There is a small group of long-term unemployed people. The number has reduced to almost 25,000. We must concentrate on reducing that number further. The challenge is to equip such people with the skills necessary to access a job in the labour market. I assure the Senator that is one of the intentions behind the new strategies we are implementing.</P>

It was valuable to explore specific aspects of the legislation to find out her thinking because of the legislation's importance in the context of our continuing economic growth. I wish the Bill well but I hope the Minister in rebalancing and refocusing will look again at CE schemes and the valuable contribution they make in rural areas such as those in Leitrim, County Kerry and in Galway where the Minister comes from. There are two Irelands, urban Ireland and rural Ireland. There are difficulties in rural Ireland that the termination of these schemes will not address. I hope there will be flexibility in this area. I look forward to the Minister returning to the House at a future date.</P>

    <Title>Homelessness Incidence: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to addressing the problem of homelessness and, in this regard, published a formal integrated strategy last May to tackle homelessness. This strategy provides for an integrated response to homelessness by all the agencies involved, both statutory and voluntary.</P>
      <P>The essence of the strategy is the preparation of action plans by local authorities at both city and county level which will detail how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all the agencies involved in providing these services. In addition, a homeless forum is being set up in each county under the auspices of the local authority housing strategic policy committees. Local authorities, together with health boards and voluntary bodies, are preparing these plans and have been urged to complete them as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The plan for the Dublin area is practically finalised and should be completed and adopted shortly. Under the strategy, local authorities are responsible for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons and health boards are responsible for the care and welfare needs of homeless persons, including the provision of in-house care. It is the case, however, that many voluntary bodies provide accommodation and care for homeless persons and their work is invaluable in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial additional funding is being made available to local authorities to ensure the measures in the strategy are implemented. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the next five years and current funding is being increased by £6 million per annum to <Col N="1613" /> increase bednight contribution rates to voluntary bodies and other support services.</P>
    <P>Housing output in the voluntary housing sector is being increased to a target of 4,000 units per year over the lifetime of the national development plan. It is expected that at least half of these units will be provided under the capital assistance scheme which is used extensively to provide special needs housing for certain groups, especially the homeless. In addition, the expanded local authority housing programme of 25,000 units over the four year period 2000-03 will also provide additional accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
    <P>On the health side, the Government strategy provides funding of £6 million a year for the care and welfare needs of homeless persons. The distribution of this funding to health boards is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children. It will take some time to ensure that all the services outlined in the strategy are put in place. However, the Government is anxious to ensure that services for homeless persons are improved in the meantime. It is a matter of serious concern that even one person should be homeless and forced to sleep on the streets of Dublin or anywhere else in the country. As part of the action plans, additional facilities and accommodation will be provided for people who are forced to sleep rough.</P>
    <P>However, as it will take some time for these to be put in place, the Department of the Environment and Local Government recently asked Dublin Corporation to develop urgently proposals to provide additional night-time service facilities which would provide people on the streets with basic shelter and food at night as an emergency interim measure. Dublin Corporation is anxious to provide these facilities and is seeking suitable premises and facilities.</P>
    <P>Another area where there has been some improvement recently is emergency bed and breakfast accommodation. The Government's strategy calls for the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for anything other than short-term emergency accommodation of less than one month, particularly for families, to be phased out.</P>
    <P>At the instigation of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Dublin Corporation, as a first step, has carried out inspections of all such accommodation in the past year and has entered into agreements with landlords whereby many of these facilities have been converted into shared living accommodation rather than simply bed and breakfast accommodation. The residents now have free access to come and go so that they do not have to vacate their accommodation during the day, and there is 24 hour management and security. While this is a move in the right direction in that it resolves some of the acute difficulties, there is still a long way to go. This will take some time as alternative sources of accommodation will need to be found. In the meantime, local authorities will need to continue to use bed and breakfast accommo<Col N="1614" /> dation to accommodate homeless persons on an emergency basis, but the use of it will decrease as alternative accommodation becomes available.</P>
    <P>A key element of the Government's strategy is the provision of additional accommodation and a greater variety of it to cater for the varying needs of homeless persons, including homeless families. In particular, additional transitional and move-on accommodation will be provided to enable people to move out of emergency accommodation, whether bed and breakfast accommodation or hostels, into accommodation that is more suitable to their needs.</P>
    <P>We will see real improvements in the provision of accommodation and support services for homeless people. The Government has set out a clear framework and there is a genuine willingness to tackle homelessness. Local communities have a key role to play in supporting measures to be taken at local level to assist homeless persons and I hope the spirit of willingness to see the matter properly addressed carries through when it comes to providing services at local level. The Government has put a clear strategy in place to address homelessness in a comprehensive way and it is supported by the necessary funding and resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement by the Minister of State is excellent. However, there is a great deal of hope in it and not a great deal of factual detail as to when these services will be provided. Having listened to his speech, there was not one tangible provision. It was all &ldquo;hopefully&rdquo;, &ldquo;when&rdquo;, &ldquo;if&rdquo; and &ldquo;in conjunction with&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I remind the House that we are regressing. It is three years since I spoke about people sleeping rough in Molesworth Street, probably because they were highly visible, and the problem has spiralled downwards at an alarming rate. It is so bad now that the local authority housing waiting list in South Dublin County Council has 4,951 applicants and that is just one local authority area of four in the greater Dublin area. Kildare has had a 98% increase in applications with 2,229 on its housing list. I accept to a certain extent that we have been overtaken by an amazing increase in the number of homeless people, but that sudden increase is not a sufficient excuse for not having emergency measures in place at least.</P>
      <P>A possible emergency measure which could be taken here is taken in Helsinki, Finland, where homeless people are collected every night from the nooks, crannies, doorways, footpaths and shelters where they sleep and are brought to a central area where there are beds and food. I appreciate there will always be the odd nomad who does not fit into the normal pattern, but the young people on the streets in Dublin at present are by no means in that category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of a local authority, I know for a fact that many young families spend up to six and seven months, not in bed and breakfast accommodation, but in hostels. I know of a young mother who used to live in Clondalkin and is <Col N="1615" /> unable to send her children to school. Her current place of abode is a hostel on the North Circular Road. To get there by 9 a.m. she is required to take two buses.</P>
    <P>While the intention is that local authorities will provide emergency accommodation, the allocation for which has been increased by 100%, there has been no movement. The strategic policy committee on housing in the local authority of which I am a member is not at work because of a staff dispute. I can see no value, therefore, in informing us that there will be a service when it is patently obvious that the preparations have not reached an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it is, probably, due to my esteemed colleague's anxiousness, but I cannot speak unless someone is listening to me. Whether the Minister of State heeds me is another matter.</P>
    <P>The time has come to establish an emergency centre in every local authority area, but particularly in the greater Dublin area. Strange as it may seem, constituents of mine do not know where Great Charles Street is, the only centre where what is laughingly called emergency accommodation is provided by the health board. It cannot be described as emergency accommodation when one has to live there for nine months.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that we still have what are called winter hostels. There appears to be a presumption that from the end of April to the beginning of November there are six months of glorious sunshine and no need to provide shelter. That is both laughable and scandalous.</P>
    <P>Why should people living beyond Blanchardstown and in west Tallaght, near Wicklow, be sent to accommodation within the functional area of Dublin Corporation? Why is the available funding for housing the homeless being concentrated in one local authority area? Why are people on the waiting list who cannot afford to either rent or buy being carted around the city to geographical areas of which they have no knowledge and from where they will find it exceedingly difficult to keep in touch with their families? It would be more realistic to provide emergency accommodation locally. This can only be done by first acknowledging that there is an emergency and by allocating funds to local authorities to build. This should be done immediately. It is laughable that in Christmas week in the year 2000 &ndash; it can only be described as Dickensian &ndash; that there are people huddled in corners. All we are waiting for is Ebeneezer Scrooge to emerge and for some snow to fall to complete the picture. While it may look nice on a postcard, the reality must be absolutely horrific.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not mention the lack of rented accommodation, one of the main reasons people are homeless. The cost of rented accommodation has jumped by 176% since 1995, which is way out of the range of most ordinary applicants on the housing list. While I am always reluctant to mention rent control, could we not <Col N="1616" /> have a situation &ndash; the Minister of State alluded to this at one level &ndash; where private landowners would enter into a contract with local authorities in the greater Dublin area and those other parts of the country where problems are being experienced to provide accommodation, the cost of which would not increase and out of which people would not be turfed? We all know of people who have been given one month's notice and literally have nowhere to go.</P>
    <P>While one can applaud the economic growth and the achievements of the Government, the major stain on its record will be the lack of care for those who, for varied and multiple reasons, are unable to provide for what is the basic need of all human beings, namely, shelter. I often wonder why the newspapers do not emphasise more how inappropriate a booming economy is to someone living in a cardboard box. The figures are staggering. If one multiplies my figure of 5,000 in the greater Dublin area by four, one is talking about a figure of 20,000 in need of accommodation. The rot set in when the emergence of the problem was ignored.</P>
    <P>It was announced in May that health boards would work in conjunction with the local authorities. I am a member of both a health board and a local authority and there has been no movement. While many promises have been made, there has been nothing concrete. I ask the Minister of State to consider taking people off the street for Christmas &ndash; an unusual thing for which to ask &ndash; by providing emergency accommodation, which this country has been able to provide at different times for various groups. For example, a section of Cherry Orchard Hospital was made available for Bosnian refugees. Emergency housing was also provided in a disused Army barracks on the South Circular Road. It, certainly, did the trick. I am certain that there are many buildings which could be used. It is a shameful blot on the history of the Government that even one person should be on the street, winter or summer. I await the Minister of State's response with great interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the person responsible, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate. I also welcome the Minister of State who is always willing to help in solving various problems.</P>
      <P>Senator Ridge said that she is a member of a local authority. Has she tabled any resolutions condemning the cause of homelessness &ndash; alcohol abuse? While thousands of Irish people have done very well in England, a small number have done badly and are now homeless because of alcohol abuse. Alcohol is the most dangerous and potent drug in the world. If it was to come on the market today, it would, as an eminent doctor in Dublin said &ndash; I cannot recall his name &ndash; only be available on prescription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extra £6 million a year is to be spent on initiatives to tackle the problem of homelessness. Many organisations are involved, including the <Col N="1617" /> various corporations and county councils, health boards, CORI, the Simon Community, Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Combat Poverty Agency. What do their administration costs amount to? Yet, the problem of homelessness is getting worse. None of the organisations mentioned has the courage to say to the drinks industry that it is responsible for the problem. Drinks companies have youth officers in our colleges selling drink. On &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; the other night a college professor said that there were four notices on the notice board from different drinks companies advertising free booze in different parts of the college in question. Is that the way they should be behaving? They are criminals, no better than those selling illicit drugs. There is no difference. They are selling potent drugs to young people.</P>
    <P>I am a little disappointed with my organisation, the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. It is not popular to say what is causing this problem and the organisations are running away from doing it because that is popular. I call today for the abolition of alcohol advertising. It was shown on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; that consumption of alcohol in one country dropped by one third when it prohibited advertising of alcohol. That is a significant amount.</P>
    <P>Let us get to grips with homelessness and stop throwing more money at it. The sum has gone from £20 million to £40 million. I congratulate the voluntary organisations. They are doing a wonderful job. How much money are they putting into this problem? They are putting in more money than would house the homeless. However, we cannot house them or solve the problem until the root cause is solved and people are strong enough to say what is the root cause. I call on the organisations, instead of looking for more money, to initiate a grassroots campaign to highlight what alcohol abuse is doing to this country and its children.</P>
    <P>People frowned on me when I spoke about a brilliant young man who lost his life after hotels gave him so much drink he got drunk and was unable to get home. He fell and lost his life. Hotels should be prosecuted for giving somebody that many drugs, which is what they gave him. There have been several murders in the past 12 months. There are people in Mountjoy for stabbing their spouses and other people because they were high on drugs and drink.</P>
    <P>Alcohol is the main source of the majority of our problems with homelessness, trouble on the streets, fighting and carousing. Consider that 40% of the people attending accident and emergency units at weekends are drunks. They are young people. In my youth it was old men who were drunks. It was pathetic to watch the television programme showing young girls being picked up off the streets, put on trolleys and into ambulances to be brought to hospital. These young people should be out enjoying themselves.</P>
    <P>When I went to dances in this city as a young man &ndash; one venue was the Top Hat in Dún <Col N="1618" /> Laoghaire &ndash; people who had drink on them were not allowed into the dancehall. I also danced in the National Ballroom beside Barry's Hotel. If anybody had a sign of drink on them, they were not allowed in. The same applied to all dancehalls throughout the country. They were always packed and there were no rows or fighting. Those dancehalls did good business.</P>
    <P>What ruined Ireland was the arrival of lounge bars and supermarket off-licences. The young men interviewed on the programme spoke about getting a few dozen cans from the off-licence and drinking them before they went out. They do not drink for entertainment but to get sloshed &ndash; that is the trendy phrase for getting drunk and falling around.</P>
    <P>A total of £40 million is being spent on homelessness but the problem is getting worse. It will get more terrible unless there is an uprising in the country, that rises from the grassroots, to campaign against alcohol abuse. It is our main problem. I call on the Minister to introduce rules to prohibit drinks companies from sending youth officers into colleges to sell drink. Students are walking the streets claiming they do not have enough money. On their own admission on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; they are spending between £80 and £90 per week on alcohol. Imagine spending that amount of money on drink. That is what the drinks companies are after.</P>
    <P>We must be serious about tackling homelessness. I do not wish to see anybody homeless but I make a special plea for one man. Some of the homeless are great people. I have seen people who are brainy and great business people caught in the alcohol trap. When they went to the AA and gave up drink, they rose from the ashes and got their businesses back. They were bigger and better than ever. They went into the gutter but re-emerged. The trouble with alcohol is that one must hit the gutter and lie in it, like the late Matt Talbot, before one sees the light or before AA or anybody else can help. By then, one is too far gone. It is sad to see the calibre of the people who are living on the street. They are brilliant people and should not be there. They are there, however, because they are drugged by a legal drug.</P>
    <P>A bus driver's life was saved by a man who lives on the streets. I congratulate that person and I am disappointed CIE, the health boards, county councils, the Government or any voluntary organisation did not approach that man to make sure he was not homeless for Christmas. He saved a life and I am delighted he was presented with a medal and a watch for his bravery, but he should have been given a home. I do not know him but on the television he appeared to be a fine, hardy young man. He waded into the water and saved a man's life by pulling him from the driving seat when it was filled with water. That man should be looked after. Perhaps the Minister will contact the social workers and ensure he gets a home for his bravery. He should have a home at least for Christmas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> Mark my words, a number of people who are today hearty and healthy will have interviews with St. Peter before Christmas is over, and the 12 days of Christmas are not far away. What will be responsible for that? Alcohol abuse. There is a great campaign against smoking, and rightly so. Smoking is bad. However, a person never broke up a family, beat up his wife, broke up his home or went bankrupt as a result of smoking. Why is there such benevolence to, and why do we see so much good in, the curse of alcohol even though we see it ruining our youth and the old people of this country? It is very sad.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the people of Mayo who are bringing home our emigrants in London. These emigrants left in the 1950s and 1960s and some of them only returned once or twice. They had great jobs and made big money. What did they do? They made millionaires of others. People often compliment me on driving a nice car. I have always driven a good car. I tell them, &ldquo;You would have a nice car but you cannot pay for two nice cars.&rdquo;  When they ask me what I mean I tell them that if they want to buy a nice car for the publican, they cannot have a nice car for themselves as well.</P>
    <P>Too many of our youth and our homeless are making many people wealthy, even millionaires, while they are down and out in the gutter. An old friend of mine used go on the beer after being off it for years. He would regularly say, &ldquo;The publicans are nice people who are warm and welcoming when you arrive in the pub after being on the dry for 12 months or so and have plenty of notes in your pocket, but after three months, when you are broke and going through the waistcoat pockets for the price of a pint, they can be damned nasty and insulting.&rdquo;  The same holds true today. While people have money they are welcome but they are not wanted when they have no money.</P>
    <P>I congratulate RTE. It is the first organisation to highlight the dark side of the drink problem in this country. It highlighted the homeless and what is happening to them. The Minister can throw another £40 million and the same amount again at this problem, but we must deal with the cause of it.</P>
    <P>It annoys me to hear people calling for a debate on the quality of tap water. As far as I know, tap water never killed anyone. Senators call for debates on mobile phones and ESB pylons, although there is no proof that their effects have killed anyone. However, nobody talks about road accidents, stabbings and domestic problems. Sports people want to be fit but they celebrate by filling the cup with whiskey. We celebrate everything by drinking alcohol. I am amazed at the popularity of alcohol and I do not understand why so many people keep drinking it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the pioneers to forget about being popular and running with the crowd. I never drank alcohol because I recognised the dangers of drink at an early age but I enjoyed life and danced and enjoyed entertainment as much as <Col N="1620" /> anyone else. As a 12 year old during the war, I went into the brewery in Sligo every Saturday with a jennet and cart to carry out beer for the local pub. I could have had all the beer I wanted to drink for nothing but because our house was up the road from the pub and I saw drunk people fighting on their way home from the market every Saturday, I vowed I would never get into the same state. Thank God and his blessed mother I was able to honour that.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that car insurance companies will offer reductions to pioneers and teetotallers. I welcome that move which I advocated on many occasions to insurance industry representatives who attended meetings of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. People who do not drink alcohol should be rewarded and should receive at the very least a 25% reduction in their insurance premia. That would encourage more young people not to drink.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House and applaud him for the work he and the Government have done. I appeal to the Government to recognise that alcohol is the simple cause of homelessness and to consider ways of addressing the matter. Alcohol is the most potent drug in the world. If people get hooked on it, it is no better than illicit drugs. I ask the Minister to appeal to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce legislation prohibiting the advertising and glamorising of alcohol.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Senator Farrell is quite right to express his strongly held views on alcohol abuse but it breaks my heart to hear him denigrating those organisations which deal with homelessness by saying they should face up to the hard fact that 80% of homelessness is due to alcohol abuse. I encounter homeless people every night as I walk up Baggot Street. The Senator obviously did not read the surveys on homelessness published by the Department of Health and Children, the ERHA, Focus Ireland, Combat Ireland and the Simon Community. He is stereotyping homeless people as winos, but I assure him that many of them are not and it is most unfair of him to denigrate them in this way.</P>

      <P>The Senator said 80% and the surveys prove that is not the case. I am furious that he should come into the House without having researched the matter properly. The Minister will be aware that psychiatric illness is one of the most <Col N="1621" /> serious causes of homelessness. Between 30% and 40% of homeless people suffer from psychiatric illness. Some 15 years ago, a policy was introduced to bring people out of psychiatric institutions into the community. The Senator may nod his head but he did not mention this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not high on the Senator's list. These people were supposed to receive care in the community but that is not happening. Without any specific training, the Simon Community, Sr. Stan in Focus Ireland and others are trying to help these people who need, but are not receiving, psychiatric help.</P>
      <P>While I understand the Senator's concern about alcohol abuse and agree that the recent RTE programme was terrifying, we cannot paint sick people as drunks lying on the street when they are not drunks and are homeless because of our failures. A very high number of homeless people are psychiatrically ill. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, will be aware of this because he will have read the reports. We are trying to appoint consultants to see how we can deal with homeless people with psychiatric illness. Once these people are on the streets, they do not take their medication and are not in touch with social workers.</P>
      <P>We &ndash; and I am part of the system &ndash; created a further problem through the introduction of sectorisation in the psychiatric services. If as I walk up Baggot Street I meet someone who is obviously seriously psychiatrically ill, I cannot get them into a hospital in the city if they are from Blanchardstown or some other area of Dublin. They must go to their local hospitals. This is a serious problem which must be addressed.</P>
      <P>I walk to work along the canal where I see nests of people, many of whom are psychiatrically ill, sleeping under pink blankets and cardboard. During the day, they transfer themselves to a position outside the TSB at the corner of Baggot Street. I implore the Minister to give priority to the problem of homeless people with psychiatric illness. In the past, there were wards in St. Brendan's, where I completed part of my training, for people with no fixed abode.</P>
      <P>If people are not on the streets, they are in prison. Surveys reveal that almost 30% of prisoners are described as psychiatrically ill, with 10% being described as seriously psychiatrically ill. These are scientific surveys. People commit minor offences when they are out on the streets but, rather than putting them into a hospital, they are sent to prison. The Minister is well aware of the concerns about prison psychiatric services. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was in the House recently and agreed with me that this was a serious issue and that psychiatrically ill people were ending up in prison, having committed minor offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> This is an international problem. People were supposed to be cared for in the community on coming out of psychiatric hospitals but nobody realised how expensive and difficult it would be to achieve that. It is the health service which should deal with these patients, not these organisations which are not in a position to deal with them. The hostels which were spoken of in the budget cannot be built too soon as it is very hard to deal with people such as this in an ordinary hostel setting as they are ill, are difficult to deal with and are not taking their medication. I quite understand the trouble they must be. Also, people who get out of prison have absolutely nowhere to go.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for getting so cross about this matter, but it breaks my heart to see ill people denigrated as drunks and, worse still, those trying to deal with them described as fools. They are not fools &ndash; Sr. Stan is unbelievable as are those who run the Simon Community, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the organisations which are working terribly hard and doing very well. Of course, drink is a serious problem. Between 20% and 30% of homeless people are on either drink or drugs or both and I trip over them as I go home. However, most people are homeless because of a life crisis such as losing a job &ndash; as Senator Ridge said, rented accommodation is extraordinarily expensive &ndash; the breakdown of marriage or involvement in a court case.</P>
    <P>Nobody really knows the number of women who are sleeping rough as they have to make themselves far less obvious. However, there are many homeless women. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, and I have frequently spoken about the problem of children. She said she becomes quite cross when they are described not as being homeless but out of home, as if there was somewhere they could go if they were so minded. We must ask why such children have left home. We see all sorts of unfortunate cases of abuse and neglect coming before the courts, which must be a significant factor.</P>
    <P>Could the Government try to continue the community employment schemes with groups such as the Simon Community, Focus Point, the Combat Poverty Agency and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul? Frequently those employed are from the community and are very good at getting back to the community. The National Training Fund Bill has been passed by the House and FÁS has brought people from a very low ebb to being in full employment. It is only through this gradual help to improve people that we can do something about the problem.</P>
    <P>We must try to get homeless people into some sort of home. We have many young people on the streets. I spoke to one young person near Baggot Street Hospital who was sitting on the ground on blankets. When I asked him what he was doing on the street he said he had a fight with his father and that his mother was on holiday until the end of the month. How long would he be on the streets before he was in real trouble? We urgently <Col N="1623" /> need short-term emergency accommodation and try to ensure young and old, children and women are not put in the same accommodation. For example, that young boy about whom I spoke should not be put in accommodation with the winos about whom Senator Farrell spoke; to do so would not be to his betterment.</P>
    <P>I apologise to Senator Farrell for getting so cross, but I know very sad cases and the surveys back up what I say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello has raised this matter many times on the Order of Business and has shown a deep concern for the homeless. I also compliment Senator Farrell who asked for the debate and who has spoken in a sincere way, as has Senator Ridge. Some days ago on the Order of Business I raised homelessness in Ireland and the high incidence of homelessness among the Irish in Britain. In London it is estimated that up to 40% of those who are homeless are of Irish extraction.</P>
      <P>I was very impressed by the Minister's contribution for two reasons. First, there was an underlying humanity in what he said and he clearly made the point that it was not acceptable to have even one homeless person. At the same time he outlined a long-term strategy and interim measures which are particularly important.</P>
      <P>This matter should be entirely removed from the political arena as it is too important and serious. We all feel very deeply about it. There is nothing more traumatic than to walk along a street and see a person sleeping rough, with those going home from parties stepping over them. We should remember that in the past if a person saw someone lying in the street for whatever reason, be it health or drink, they would stop, lift them up and help them. That was the culture and philosophy in Ireland years ago. This has changed and the reasons for the change must be examined as no matter what is done by Government or local authorities, the problem will not be solved unless the reasons for homelessness are identified and community attitudes are changed.</P>
      <P>In fairness, I think Senator Henry misrepresented what was said by Senator Farrell. He was not pointing a finger at the helpless person but at society which accepts the abuse of alcohol and at those who advertise alcohol to the point of abuse. It is important that this be put on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless we do something about the exceptionally serious and growing problem we will always regard it as a blight on our success and on our nation. On reviewing the unusually good budget this year, which spread the wealth and helped the less fortunate, it struck me that such measures are diminished when we think of those who are suffering as a result of homelessness. We should examine the reasons for homelessness, one of which is alcohol. The psychiatric issues raised by Senator Henry are also definitely relevant. Another issue is the breakdown in the cohesive<Col N="1624" /> ness of family life. In the past there was a cohesion in families whereby people looked out for each other, and not just in the immediate family.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the changing attitudes in America over the past 20 years one will see a huge peer pressure on young people to leave the family home before they are even capable of looking after themselves. I am not taking from the economic reasons or social pressures, but the forcing of young people through peer pressure to leave the family home is an important factor. They feel they are independent and can look after themselves, but they are very vulnerable at that age and when a problem comes their way they are unable to deal with it and are too independent to return to their family. Families should endeavour to look out for such problems as it is a basic factor.</P>
    <P>Another reason is if people have no purpose in life, and there are many such people. Recently both Fine Gael and the Labour Party have been making a point about the quality of life. We could all make that point. A wage packet does not guarantee security, contentment, happiness, concern for others. The wheel has come full circle. We are realising what we have lost &ndash; our spirituality. When religious communities looked after the homeless we had little difficulty. We have seen what happened to the Mercy order. I am not saying there were not exceptional cases. However, the whole order is tarred with the same brush, as are the Christian Brothers and the clergy, yet 99.9% of them took over responsibilities we should have had. They are not here today and the problems are being thrown out on the streets where they were never thrown before. Natural community spirit is disappearing because the city is growing at such a fast rate. The sense of community is disappearing in smaller towns also. There are few community and voluntary bodies or religious groups, no sense of understanding within society that affluence sometimes brings isolation from other people.</P>
    <P>All of those issues need to be looked when making policy. That is why I said there was humanity in what the Minister said today. We need partnership and a return to the ideals we had in the past. We welcome affluence, but we must recognise that if we do not tackle the source of the problem of homelessness, everything else we do will be but a cosmetic exercise and the problems will grow. We should bear in mind also that the person lying on the street is totally helpless, having reached that stage, and not every section of officialdom will reach him or her. Individual concern definitely will.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up any more time because I want to allow Senator Costello to enter the debate as he has spoken on this subject many times. I make a final appeal to take this issue out of the political arena. Officialdom and money will not solve the problem if we do not recognise that we are losing important values. We must recognise that tackling this problem requires partner<Col N="1625" /> ship. I compliment the voluntary bodies, the Simon Community and others who, over the years, fulfilled a role that we were either unable or unprepared to fill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú for giving me some of his time. I can hardly improve on what he said.</P>
      <P>This is about quality of life, social cohesion, community values, the standards of latter days. It is about a new society, the tiger economy which seems to have little respect for the person, the family, the community, and seems to breed individualism, self interest, greed and lack of caring in a community. We are at a threshold, and there is more affluence in our society than kindness and caring.</P>
      <P>It is terrible to see the statistics day after day, the information from the Simon Community today about the doubling of the number of people sleeping rough in the past three years and, in today's newspapers, the information that an inner city day centre notes the numbers availing of the service it provides to homeless people have doubled in the past 12 months. The statistics are certainly very stark. According to the ESRI report, 4,000 people are known to be homeless in the city of Dublin alone, and there are probably many more because it is very difficult to do a count of the homeless. In excess of 1,200 of those are young people and approximately 100 young people are sleeping rough every night. The number of people sleeping rough in Dublin is two thirds of the number sleeping rough in London, a city with a population ten times the size of Dublin, and approximately 40% of the homeless in London are Irish-born, as Senator Ó Murchú said. The situation is dire.</P>
      <P>The obvious question is what to do about it. Many of the homeless people who come to me in my clinics looking for accommodation have been evicted. They have been told to quit or have been evicted by landlords who do not want a particular type of clientele. Such people are the most vulnerable of all. Landlords do not want anybody who is a drug addict, who has an alcohol problem, who is a single parent, and they do not want families. They want single people who are employed, who have a good income, who will give them no trouble and who will be able to pay the current exorbitant rents. The problem is equally bad in shelters and hostels which have a policy of not allowing in anybody who might have a drug abuse or alcohol problem. It is these people, who are particularly ill and vulnerable, who are sleeping rough. That is a major issue we must face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Ó Murchú said, the religious orders are now depleted and the service that was provided by them has been reduced enormously. A very worrying aspect is the number of teenagers who, for one reason or another &ndash; rows and difficulties in the home &ndash; are out on the street fending for themselves. Drugs are a major aspect and this ties in with a survey carried out in the north inner city last week which showed that of 100 <Col N="1626" /> teenagers interviewed, 40% were abusing illegal drugs, 80% were abusing alcohol, and all were well under the age of 18. The problems have been brought about partly by affluence and partly as a result of changes in society and the breakdown of social ties.</P>
    <P>Accommodation is the major key to what can be done. I am not satisfied with an extra £20 million in capital funding over a five-year period. That is not nearly good enough. That is a national figure of between £4 million and £5 million per annum and it will not deal with the crisis we are facing. We need to establish a task force on homelessness. We need to give to a single body the authority to deal with the issue. We should no longer have both health boards and local authorities involved, but one or the other. The local authority, as the housing authority, should deal with homelessness. However, there should be a separate area in the local authority that would deal exclusively with the matter as part of a task force on homelessness.</P>
    <P>We must also introduce new landlord and tenant legislation because the incredible situation here is that somebody must be <i>in situ</i> for 20 years before they acquire any rights as a tenant, no matter how good a tenant they are. The result is that landlords, seeing neighbouring landlords doubling their income, often serve their tenants with notice to quit, even if they are good tenants, because the tenants cannot meet the demand for an increase in the rent. This is particularly true of the elderly. An increasing number of elderly people, single people, couples and families are being forced out of what was reasonable rented accommodation because prices have gone through the roof. It is these people who are now on the local authority housing list, and that is the cause of the crisis whereby it will be two or three years before anybody on Dublin Corporation's homeless list can expect any accommodation. That is true of families as well as elderly people, and young people do not have a hope of getting accommodation. A single young man or woman will not be housed by any of the State services because the demand from single parents and couples with families is so great.</P>
    <P>At Christmas time it is important that we register our concern and I echo the last point made by Senator Ó Murchú that we should not play politics with this issue. As the Minister said, if only one person was homeless, we should be concerned about it. We must urgently put together a decent response that would provide the funding and the mechanism to deal with the problem of homelessness.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am sorry the senior Minister is not here but I hope my remarks will be conveyed to her. Given that the Minister of State is from a constituency which has several DART stations, I hope he will take on board what I have to say.</P>
      <P>I want to refer first to the question of overcrowding on the DART system, which is reaching a dangerous level. I am already aware of various accidents that have taken place, with older people being pushed around. About two years ago an old friend of mine was knocked down getting off a DART, an incident which led to her early demise some weeks ago.</P>
      <P>There should be a complete review of the DART system in relation to the need for extra carriages, expansion of the stations and the service currently being provided. This week a mudslide near Killiney prevented the DART operating between Dalkey and Greystones. If a tree falls down near the Merrion gates it causes the system to come to a halt.</P>
      <P>There should be a complete review of what is a very good service which runs from Greystones to Howth, and hopefully, on to Malahide.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support that and I am sure Senator Glennon has other suggestions. There should be an overview of the whole system because a tree coming down near a line, a mudslide or a driver not turning up for work for one reason or another should not bring the ser<Col N="1628" /> vice to a halt. The Minister of State knows the system well and I ask him to urge his senior colleague to order an immediate review of the entire system.</P>
      <P>We need to find out what is happening on the ground in relation to the DART service. There is overcrowding, some stations do not open and we are still waiting for ticket machines. In any other country one has a ticket to leave the station but here there is a man at the exit trying to collect as many tickets as possible. The current system is Dickensian and it needs a total review. The operation of stations, the platforms, etc. must be examined. Every time I travel towards the airport I can see new larger carriages parked near Fairview. Are they merely on show? I do not believe they are operational.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is well aware of the problem. He is a reasonable and level-headed man. I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has not come into the House to reply to this matter. To return to what Senator Ross said this morning, any Minister comes into this House but the one who should be here. I am sure Senator Glennon will agree that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, should be in the House. Perhaps she has other business to attend to; I saw her in the building. I ask the Minister of State to respond as positively as he can to the various matters I have raised. A disaster is waiting to happen if matters are not addressed immediately.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to the House and thank him for his interest in this topic. Not only is he representing the Minister but, coming from the Wicklow constituency, he knows very well what we are talking about. I particularly thank Senator Cosgrave for sharing his time with me. It is an indication of the gravity of the problem that there is a cross-city and cross-party desire to have it dealt with as quickly as possible. Senator Cosgrave has put the case particularly well in relation to the DART. If we cannot extend the DART line to Skerries, at least we can extend this discussion to Skerries, Balbriggan and even further afield.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there is a serious overcrowding problem on the DART, and it is not confined to south County Dublin. I spoke recently about accidents waiting to happen. I also raised the issue recently of a 12 year old girl who had been assaulted on a train. That incident was caused by overcrowding. I am not talking about assault in the usual meaning of the word in terms of her being pushed or shoved. It was a most unfortunate incident and, as often happens in these cases, because her parents considered that pursuing it would cause more trauma for the girl it has been dropped, although officialdom was notified of it. This incident happened as a result of overcrowding. Incidents similar to the unfortunate one involving Deputy Cosgrave's elderly constituent happen day in, day out. This is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> It will be said that overcrowding is a problem in every major conurbation in Europe and elsewhere in the world. That may be the case but it has not been the case in Ireland and we should not allow it to develop. What we are doing is creating an acceptable level of discomfort and risk. We have already exceeded that acceptable level and are now into the realm of unacceptability.</P>
    <P>There is massive good will and sympathy among the commuting for what CIE and its staff are doing and an acknowledgment of the scarcity of funds, historically, for investment, particularly in the rail structure. However, the time has come for massive and immediate investment in this area. The good will of the public is there for this to happen and I urge the Minister to respond as positively as he can. If Percy French was alive today and launching his song about the west Clare railway he would be up there with the huge earners in show business worldwide. I hope there is not another Percy French out there, although it might need that type of attention for action to be taken. The one thing we do not need is another accident similar to the one referred to by Senator Cosgrave or the one involving the 12 year old girl to whom I referred. I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter and Senator Cosgrave for sharing his time with me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Cosgrave and Glennon for raising this important issue. As a TD for County Wicklow, I have a vested interest in this matter and share some of the sentiments expressed by the Senators. I am pleased to be able to report some of the major action taken by the Minister for Public Enterprise with a view to bringing about substantial improvements in this area, about which we are all concerned.</P>
      <P>The issue of overcrowding on suburban trains, particularly during peak periods, is raised frequently by commuters on DART and other suburban services. Iarnród Éireann has informed the Minister for Public Enterprise that the DART carriages are designed to operate in an urban environment and can cater for a large number of standing passengers. The DART is being operated within its design capability and the company has assured the Minister that this practice is safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been aware of the overcrowding experienced by users of the suburban rail network, including the DART. Until recently the DART fleet comprised the 80 carriages it had since its commissioning in 1984. Ten new carriages have been delivered in recent months and eight are being brought into service. These new carriages will enable Iarnród Éireann to provide increased capacity on DART services, particularly on the Greystones to Malahide line, and will help to alleviate overcrowding. Two more carriages will be available for use at peak times from the end of the year. These new carriages represent a 12% increase in capacity on the <Col N="1630" /> DART system. A further 16 carriages were delivered recently and will enter the service next spring, following commissioning. Twelve more carriages have been ordered and are due for delivery late next year and early in 2002. The additional 26 carriages will increase capacity on the DART by more than 30% by next spring.</P>
    <P>The DART service increased from a fleet of 80 and a carrying capacity of 14,000 from 1984-September 2000 to a fleet of 90 and a carrying capacity of 15,750 by December of this year. The service is anticipated to increase from a fleet of 106 and a carrying capacity of 18,550 in the spring of 2001 to a fleet of 118 and a carrying capacity of 20,650 by the summer of 2003. Capacity on the suburban rail network, apart for DART, did not increase substantially until this year when 20 diesel railcars were delivered to Iarnród Éireann. These carriages are undergoing commissioning and will increase capacity by 2,500 places when put into service.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise has been informed by Iarnród Éireann that 16 of the 20 new railcars will enter into revenue service on the Connolly to Maynooth service on 2 January 2001, with the remaining four going into service in February 2001. The introduction of these carriages coincides with the introduction of the double line from Maynooth into the city. Over the coming months commuters on DART and suburban rail services will see an improved level of service in terms of increased capacity and a more frequent service.</P>
    <P>Last Friday, 8 December, there was a mud slide down onto the tracks near Killiney DART station. As a consequence all rail services beyond Dalkey station had to be suspended. Iarnród Éireann worked around the clock to remove further loose mud and reinforce the hillside above the track to prevent a recurrence of the mud slide. The area was difficult to reach and the overhead line equipment and track had to be removed to facilitate access to heavy machinery. However, I am glad to report that the line will reopen today and normal services should be restored by rush hour this evening.</P>
    <P>The DART timetable will be extended to facilitate the late night &ldquo;DART in-DART out&rdquo; service. Late night services ran on Thursday, 7 December, Friday, 8 December, and Saturday, 9 December, and will run on consecutive Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays up to Christmas. Additional capacity was provided on DART services on Saturday, 2 and 9 December, and will also be provided on 16 and 23 December. An additional Sunday service was provided on Sunday, 3 and 10 December, and will also be provided on 17 and 24 December. In conjunction with Bus Átha Cliath, the expanded Nitelink service is being promoted and a special &ldquo;DART into town-Nitelink home&rdquo; ticket, priced at £4, is being advertised. As a result of a recent agreement between the unions and the company, a full DART service will be provided on the Malahide <Col N="1631" /> and Greystones lines from next Monday, 18 December.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Aer Lingus Pension Fund.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for being present. It is refreshing to have a Minister from the relevant Department take this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the Aer Lingus pension fund has been a running sore for many years. The appropriate time to tackle this issue, which has already been addressed by both Houses, is before privatisation, which is around the corner sometime next year, and when the Government will have a great deal of funding and resources as a result of privatisation. Some of these funds, and we are not talking about vast sums, should be used to address a matter of gross discrimination against Aer Lingus pensioners. The problem is that they are paid a great deal less than other semi-State pensioners. That is an injustice and the reason for it is historical.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will know that the Aer Lingus pension fund is not normal. For historical reasons it is run by trustees and they decide how to administer it and on any increases. As a result, there are no real rules or index linkage and pensions have fallen a long way behind. In addition, this pension scheme has been poorly funded. The reason for this is that the pensioners paid 5% of their salaries into the fund while the employer, who is the State, did not pay the normal amount paid by an employer and only matched the pensioners' amount; in some cases it did not equal it. This means the fund is grossly under-funded and the amounts that can be paid out are limited by the way the fund has been managed. I think the Minister of State will acknowledge that this is an anomaly in the semi-State system and it is one which the 1,200 Aer Lingus pensioners feel extremely sore about. They feel particularly sore because at the time of the Cahill plan, when Aer Lingus was in such appalling trouble, the State came to the rescue by injecting £175 million. That is a past battle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cahill plan was a successful rescue job. Bernie Cahill and the Government rescued the national airline from bankruptcy. There was an awful lot wrong with Aer Lingus at the time. Many of its staff were required to make great sacrifices in terms of working conditions and salaries. This restraint meant that their basic pay was lower than it would have been and they fell behind the normal rate paid in other semi-State bodies. This restraint was fine as a temporary measure and is laudable and the employees who made these sacrifices should be applauded for what they did. However, they probably did not think that when they took a reduction in pay their pensions would be affected. By making this great sacrifice at the time of the Cahill plan these <Col N="1632" /> people have landed themselves in a situation where their pensions are lower than normal.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State would be aware, as I would, if we in the Oireachtas had to take a serious reduction in our salaries. Whether we should do this is another issue. If we did this it would have a long-term effect on our pensions. Perhaps a sacrifice of this sort should be expected from public servants when there are extreme difficulties in the national finances or finances of semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>It is not fair for these sacrifices to continue in perpetuum because Aer Lingus has come out of its difficulties. Last year it made a profit of £53 million or 75 million. That is a tremendous achievement for an airline that was in receivership and bankrupt a few years ago. A few bodies have been strewn behind, not only those who took voluntary redundancy but those who made a sacrifice. They made a sacrifice, in effect, for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>The disparity in pensions can be best illustrated by one figure. Since 1990 pensioners in other parts of the public service have received an increase of about 55% while Aer Lingus pensioners have only received an increase of 26%. That is pitiful for those who were prepared to make personal sacrifices to save the airline.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State will know, the problem is not so much the income requirement but the capital requirement. A capital injection in the pension fund is needed more than anything else. The pension fund is under-funded and is unable to give these people what they require and deserve.</P>
    <P>Apart from topping up the pension fund in order to draw more income from it, the Minister of State should give a commitment here that at the time of privatisation, when the money will be flowing in for fleet replacement and other purposes, the Government will bring Aer Lingus pensions into line with other semi-State bodies. I do not know how much such a move would cost. Perhaps the Minister of State has an idea about that. The amount would not be anywhere near the amount of money that will be paid to the advisers working on the flotation. In the case of Eircom, between £60 million and £70 million was paid to advisers. A lot less would be paid to them when Aer Lingus is floated. But proportionately it would take only a small amount to top up the pension fund in order to make the lives of those who made sacrifices far more tolerable and remove a running sore.</P>
    <P>This pension fund should be index linked. It is very unfair that it is not index linked and is at the mercy of its trustees. If there is no money in the fund the trustees cannot grant an increase in incomes. They have increased the pension and they will do it but there has been one occasion where they have not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> There is a need for the spouses of the Aer Lingus pensioners to live. Their pensions are reduced accordingly when their spouses die. They should be able to live in the sure knowledge that their pensions will be safe and will not deteriorate and devalue over the years to come.</P>
    <P>I beg the Minister of State not to palm me off with a reply written by his civil servants. I want him to give me a commitment that this matter will be examined. I know there is a new plan in train. It addresses the income issue but not the basic problem of the very low wages paid to these people which resulted in low pensions. I beg the Minister of State to give me a commitment that he will consider the base position as a source for what will be a tiny amount of the capital and proceeds of the flotation in order to help these people who made such a great sacrifice for the national airline.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>My compliments to Senator Ross for raising this very important issue.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta share a common pension scheme called the Irish airlines (general employees) superannuation scheme for their serving staff and pensioners, which was originally established in 1954. The scheme is a defined benefit scheme in which the employers match the contributions of employees. The object of the scheme is to provide pensions which are in accordance with the rules of the scheme for the benefit of members and their dependants.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise has been advised that, on the basis of the current terms of the scheme, it is not under-funded. According to the most recent actuarial valuation the scheme has a surplus of over £249 million.</P>
      <P>Under the rules of the scheme, members pay a contribution calculated as a percentage of their salary. For staff recruited prior to 1970 this contribution is 6.375% while for staff recruited after 1970 it is 5.1% approximately. The employers contributed a similar amount. The benefits of the Irish airlines scheme have been agreed by its membership. The rules of the scheme to do not provide for any automatic pension increases. However, in line with the discretion available to the trustees under the scheme, they provided pension increases in line with the annual consumer price index.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise is aware that some members of the scheme have expressed concern at the indexation arrangements attaching to their pension entitlements and other issues. Following representations by retired employees, the Minister asked the chairmen of the companies concerned to establish a task force to tackle the concerns expressed to her. The task force reported to the chairmen at the end of May 2000. Following receipt of the report Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta commissioned separate reviews of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been advised that Aer Rianta <Col N="1634" /> proposes to establish a new scheme in due course in accordance with section 32 of the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998, and the company is considering the matter.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus, as a result of its review and having regard to the structure and terms of the scheme and the Government's decision in regard to the IPO, decided the most appropriate course of action was to establish a separate pension scheme for serving staff and pensioners. The existing scheme is a multi-employer scheme and is not appropriate in the context of the proposed flotation. Given these circumstances, the airline has been discussing the terms of a proposed new pension scheme with employee representatives. The company has also outlined its proposals to the Retired Aviation Staff Association.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus management has proposed that in the new scheme pensions will be guaranteed to increase in line with the CPI provided that it does not exceed 5%. Furthermore, should it exceed 5%, the trustees of the new scheme may at their discretion award further percentage increases to pensions in payment on the basis of advice from the scheme's actuary. It is also proposed that the new scheme will provide improved benefits in areas such as guaranteed pension payment periods and death-in-service benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise has been advised by Aer Lingus that the company contribution will be increased to meet the proposed new scheme's funding costs for future service liabilities on the basis of the terms referred to earlier. Employee contributions will remain at the current level. Past service liabilities will be funded from a share of the surplus in the existing scheme. Aer Lingus has also advised the Minister that the overall terms of the proposed new scheme will be in line with practice in the private sector and in many cases will have better benefits.</P>
    <P>The company does not propose to provide for pension increases in line with salary movements for ongoing cost reasons as it would necessitate a substantial capital injection significantly more than the £76 million suggested by the retired staff association.</P>
    <P>The Minister understands from the Department of Finance that there is no general policy which imposes an obligation on State bodies to provide pension increases in line with public service pay increases. Enhancements to the existing entitlements of pensioners must be linked to and in line with any improvements that emerge from negotiations between staff interests and Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta concerning the proposed new pension schemes.</P>
    <P>There is no question of a subsidy being provided by the State towards the Irish airlines general employees superannuation scheme or the proposed new pension schemes to be established by Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. I will bring the <Col N="1635" /> salient points raised by the Senator to the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I understand what he said about the future and I accept it was said in a spirit of goodwill but he has not given a great deal of comfort to the victims of the past. I will pursue this matter in the months before the flotation. All I wanted as an <Col N="1636" /> initial step was the Minister of State to consider the use of proceeds from the flotation to improve the base of the pension fund so that victims of past inadequacies could be recompensed.</P>
