      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make every effort to resolve the trade union recognition dispute at the Aldi retail outlet in Parnell Street, Dublin 1.</P>
      <P>I regret that I have had to rule the Senator's matter out of order as the Minister has no official responsibility in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed Order of Business is No. 2, Statute Law (Restatement) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, and also Committee Stage if that is agreeable. It is not proposed to take Report Stage. It is also proposed to take No. 3, Harbours (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages. In respect of No. 2, the contributions of speakers shall not exceed 15 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for the arrangement regarding No. 2 and for the fact that Report Stage will not be taken today. There may be some changes to this Bill. It is a short Bill and it is quite appropriate to take Committee Stage but not all Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask your advice, Sir, with regard to the Harbours (Amendment) Bill, 2000. Some people believe that this may be a hybrid Bill and may not have been properly taken the last day. You have ruled to the contrary and I accept your ruling completely in the matter. However, my understanding is that this is likely to be challenged further and may ultimately be dealt with in the courts. Because of the danger of the legislation ending up in the courts, it is important to place on the record of the House the question which has been raised as to whether the Bill is a hybrid Bill and can properly proceed to Commit<Col N="1226" /> tee Stage today. You have ruled, Sir, and I accept your ruling. I simply wish to make the matter clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not rule. I have jursidiction to refer a Bill to the examiner but a Bill can only be referred to the examiner of Private Bills once the Order for Second Stage has been made. The Order for the taking of Second Stage of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill, 2000, was moved by Senator John Cregan on Tuesday, 13 June, and agreed to by the House before the commencement of Second Stage. It is to this Order that Standing Order 60 of the Dáil and Seanad relative to private business refers when it states:</P>
      <P>Where a public Bill is ordered to be read a Second time in the Dáil [or Seanad] on a day appointed. . . </P>
      <P>There appears to be some confusion between the making of the Order for the taking of Second Stage and the substantive motion that the Bill be now read a Second Time. I hope this clarifies the matter. I did not refer the Bill to the examiner because the matter was not raised at the opportune time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir. However, I advise the House that the ruling will probably be challenged on the grounds that the objection could have been made at any point during Second Stage. I leave the matter there and I thank you for your clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning and I rarely disagree but I fully support the view that the Ballylongford and Foynes Shannon Estuary Bill should be enacted as quickly as possible for the good of north Kerry and west Limerick. I am sure there will be much support for that. For the third consecutive day, I am grievously disappointed that the Deputy Leader did not use the opportunity to show that his party thinks separately from Government.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that we are not welcoming somebody new to this side of the House this morning. We had roses under the desks here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked for the past three days that the issue of inflation be debated as a matter of urgency in the House. I regret that the Government is running away from this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister for Finance said last night that he is not prepared to take any particular action. The Government should examine this. I appeal to my friends on the far side of the House to consider even a single issue, the problem of the price of drink as it impacts on inflation to 1.2%. The difference between London and inner Dublin is that in London, there are ads and posters outside the pubs trying to per<Col N="1227" /> suade people to come in. In Dublin, guys in monkey suits are trying to keep people out. That is what is wrong with the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow Senator O'Toole to go into detail on these matters on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, a Chathaoirleach, but I ask the Deputy Leader for an answer. He gave us partial commitments and strung us along. We welcome movement from the Deputy Leader of the House. This is crucially important and needs to be discussed. The fabric of social partnership is about to implode. It is being eroded while the wages of workers, in the public service or private sector, are being eroded by inflation. Something had better be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has made his point. I cannot allow such detail on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that I crossed the line on that one. Before I conclude, I heartily welcome Senator Helen Keogh to this side of the House. We will present her with the bouquet afterwards. We wish her well and hope that now she has reshaped her political objectives, we can look forward to dealing with her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that this item on inflation be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome Senator Helen Keogh to this side of the House. The Labour Party is the one which provides the bouquet of roses. She is welcome to come along in this direction as well.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Cathaoirleach found he had to rule out the matter I was proposing on the Adjournment. All I asked was that the Tánaiste should make every effort to resolve the problem of trade union recognition in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot discuss my ruling with the Senator on the Order of Business but he is more than welcome to come to my office and I will explain the reasons for my ruling to him then as a matter of courtesy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very kind of the Cathaoirleach and I am sure he will explain and reiterate them. I raise the matter on the Order of Business and ask for a debate on the issue of multinationals operating in this country which engage in different industrial relations practices from those in their home countries where they have <Col N="1228" /> trade union recognition. They deny it to workers in this country and in other European countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello must not subvert my ruling by getting into these details on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely explaining very briefly the need for a debate and the anomaly that exists. I thank the Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator O'Toole. We do not have any firm date for a debate with either the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste, as requested very strongly in the House yesterday. Has the Deputy Leader had any success in the past 24 hours in getting the Minister for Finance to agree to a debate? The Minister is prepared to meet Congress but is he prepared to meet this House? He will be able to find time to do that but he does not seem to be able to find time to address this House and explain his position on inflation which is totally out of line. He was advised by the Members here on numerous occasions. He simply castigated us but now we find that he is the one who has made the mistake.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the European Commissioner, David Byrne, on his victory over the tobacco industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">

      <P>Belated recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>When recognition is due it will be given. I am delighted to offer my congratulations to the Commissioner and I ask the Leader of the House if our Minister for Health and Children will act in accordance with the decision taken by the MEPs in Europe and if tough measures will be introduced relating particularly to under age smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>But for the intervention of Senator Costello, I would have seconded the motion of my colleague, Senator O'Toole, on the economy, although I distance myself from his warm welcome to Senator Keogh. I have to say quite seriously that to me it has all the hallmarks of cynical opportunism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It calls into question the whole method of election and nomination to this House. Let us now have a full examination of the way&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing Senator Keogh's political affiliation and the Senator's comments are not in order on the Order of Business. If you have a question for the Deputy Leader on the Order of Business, you should put that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amused by Senator Manning's reference to rotten boroughs. He should have a look around and see the other rotten boroughs. <Col N="1229" /> At least I have about 40,000 electors which is more than most other people.</P>
      <P>Had I been allowed to second Senator O'Toole's motion, his revision to the Order of Business, I would have said that it would provide a welcome opportunity for Senator Keogh to give us a view of her revised opinions on the economy because I presume there has been a sudden change. I presume this would be in the manner described by Swift in <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> where politicians achieved office by performing somersaults on a tightrope&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children &ndash; I appreciate that he was here last night &ndash; the report today by the Irish Heart Foundation which calls for co-ordinated strategies for the prevention and treatment of strokes in hospital. It is a very serious area where there is a need for extra resources. It is important that the matter is brought to the attention of the Minister so that extra resources can be provided for the care and treatment of victims of stroke.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long time since we mentioned in this House the matter of a single regulatory authority and it is a much longer time since the Government mentioned the subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so. It is a very important matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator has a question for the Deputy Leader of the House, he should put the question to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I have. One would have thought that despite the other difficulties which might be somewhat more intractable, on this matter the respective office holders in the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment might have been able to agree, but for some reason, despite all of the promises, we have not heard anything on the matter. I would like a response today from the Deputy <Col N="1230" /> Leader on what, if anything, the Government has in mind on this matter in the short term or whenever.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator O'Toole. There is genuine confusion, and the Deputy Leader might clarify this, as to the approach of the Minister for Finance. Some people, including Senator O'Toole, believe that he will do nothing. Others, I read this morning, believe he is prepared to look at it. On this all important matter of the rising inflation level which has hit the highest peak in 15 years, I would like to hear the Deputy Leader's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked previously for a debate before the end of the session on the position of Irish people in England, in particular, those who have socio-economic problems. There have been serious reports on the number of Irish people who are homeless or are in psychiatric institutions and in prisons, particularly in London. We should try to find time for a debate on this before the end of the session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader convey our compliments and congratulations to the Minister for Finance on his foresight and his brave decision to protect the interests of pensioners and social welfare recipients in the interest of the future of the nation? It was an important decision. For too long we have read headlines about the dangers of the growing numbers who will be in receipt of pensions in future and the ability of the State to protect their interests. The Minister for Finance has been to the fore in protecting their interests. I ask the Deputy Leader to convey our compliments and thanks to him. I am sure everybody feels indebted to him because he is thinking of their futures at a time when he can afford to take such a measure.</P>
      <P>It is quite extraordinary that somebody who joined the Opposition ranks only yesterday can be elevated to a top position today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is due to announce certain changes later regarding the housing industry. As a rule the House does not deal with financial matters, even if they are introduced late in legislation, such as a second Finance Bill. Will the Deputy Leader schedule a short debate next week on the measures? According to newspaper reports some of these will be welcome and it might be no harm to have statements on the matter.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy Leader for his kind and considered words recently. I received some very generous approaches from my good friends on the Independent benches, particularly Senators Norris and Ross.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's motion on inflation. We cannot let it go any further without making a point if the House is to be relevant.</P>
      <P>I almost hate to ask whether time could be found to have a debate on European matters but I was unaware of the summit in Portugal next week during which a charter of fundamental rights and a report on the intergovernmental conference will be discussed on which decisions may be reached. We have not debated the possibility of a two speed Europe which will be discussed next week. If we do not have a chance to debate that, we need to influence the Government because while decisions may not be reached, the House may not reconvene before the European leaders meet again in Nice in late October or early November when decisions will be made.</P>
      <P>We have not had an opportunity to debate European matters in recent times and it is late to be doing so if a summit is taking place next week. We do not want to find ourselves left out in a two speed Europe. If that happens we must ensure that we have had a voice in it before any decisions are reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the calls for a debate on inflation, which I assume will be granted by the Deputy Leader following his remarks yesterday, because I am sure nobody wants to call a division at the end of the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I call for a debate on the Bacon report, which will be issued at midday. This is one of the most serious social and economic issues to face the country during the economic boom and I presume it will not be relegated to the autumn. It is a matter of immediate concern which should be considered in this House. If the Deputy Leader wants help, I will table a motion.</P>
      <P>As the last person to cross the floor of this House I wish Senator Keogh greater success than I had in joining Fine Gael.</P>

    <P>I ask for the last time this session for a debate on water pollution, water quality and environmental issues in general. I made the case as well as I could on a number of occasions and nothing happened. However, a number of other Members and I, who care deeply about these issues, will be disappointed if the Minister for the Environment and Local Government does not come to the House before the end of the session to debate water pollution and related environmental issues. We have had a few stabs at these issues. A hap<Col N="1232" /> less Minister of State has come into the House on each occasion and it has been frustrating. I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will come to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to follow up on Senator Quinn's remarks. I requested a debate yesterday on what will happen in Europe over the next six months. The Feira summit next week will be important. I referred to qualified majority voting and Commissioners. European matters should be debated. The issues known as the &ldquo;Luxembourg leftovers&rdquo; pertain to Ireland and have not been addressed over the past six months during the Portuguese Presidency, although it was a good Presidency. The French have suggested that they will address these matters which are pertinent to our future in Europe. A debate should be held before the French Presidency commences which means that it should take place before the end of this session.</P>
      <P>I wish the new Opposition front bench, which I am sure has been enhanced, the best. Time will tell.</P>

      <P>A few weeks ago, I raised the issue of the 75 people who died as a result of receiving infected blood products. I requested the Leader to seek a discussion with the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children, particularly in regard to pursuing criminal negligence cases against those responsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the tribunal there are ways and means through which criminal matters can be investigated. The tribunal need not necessarily be a factor in prohibiting such investigation. Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to discuss the possibility of proceeding with a criminal investigation?</P>
      <P>I refer to the third Bacon report which is fundamentally important. Its proposals deserve to be debated in the House with a view to an action plan from the Government.</P>

    <P>I assure the House that there is no question of the Government running away from the issue of the economy and inflation, as has been suggested. In addition, I have made every effort over the past few days to try to have this matter debated in the House. The Government will bring forward important measures later to deal with aspects of inflation and the problems in the housing market. That will require legislation, which I confirmed in my contacts with the Whip's Office earlier. It will <Col N="1233" /> have to pass through the House before it recesses and both housing, which has been raised by several Members, inflation and the economy will be appropriate matters for that debate. It would not be helpful to have a debate and then another the following week. At this stage almost all the issues have been debated on the Order of Business and there is not a great deal more to say about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>When the legislation comes before the House, I am sure there will be a full attendance to participate in the debate. That deals with the point that was raised by Senators O'Toole, Norris, Costello, Quinn and Ross, both with regard to inflation and the housing situation.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello raised the issue of the recognition of trade unions by multinational companies. While this would be an appropriate subject for discussion, as the Senator is aware, we are coming towards the end of the session. In a moment I will tell Senators about the Bills we intend to dispose of. Time is difficult to find but that is not to say we will not try to find it. To be honest with the Senator, however, the probability of such a debate taking place before the recess is somewhat restricted.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate of me as Deputy Leader to enter into some of the party political matters that have been raised, other than to say that I very much regret that Senator Keogh has left the Progressive Democrats. I am personally disappointed but I wish her well in her new position across the floor of the House.</P>

      <P>That is all I wish to say about it. Senator Costello mentioned Commissioner Byrne and I share his view that the Commissioner is to be commended. I will bring that to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children. Senator Chambers raised the issue of stroke victims and the Irish Heart Foundation. That matter would be appropriate as a motion on the Adjournment but I will also bring it to the attention of the Minister.</P>
      <P>As regards the single regulatory authority, I know from my membership of the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Service that this issue has been discussed. I am not sure at what stage the legislation currently is, but I will make inquiries.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry mentioned the issue of homelessness and people with psychiatric problems living rough in England, and the attendant problems in prisons. I will bring those important issues to the attention of the Minister. We will try to find time for a debate on those matters but, as I have said, we are restricted because we are approaching the end of the session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> I endorse Senator Finneran's remarks. It has been farsighted of the Government to take a long view knowing that there is an aging population and that provision has to be made for that. The Minister for Finance has to be commended for the measures he has taken with regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>Senators Cosgrave and Ross raised the new housing measures and I have dealt with them already. I detected a certain fluidity in the personnel across the floor this morning but Senator Cosgrave obviously has no crisis of identity, so I will not comment any further on that issue.</P>
    <P>Senators Quinn, Lanigan and Taylor-Quinn raised the important matter of the forthcoming European summit. Whether or not this issue is debated in the House, I know the Government will resist a two-speed Europe. I do not see the Government subscribing to that idea at all. There is also concern about the institutional framework in the context of an expanded Europe. These are issues that would merit discussion but we are restricted by time.</P>
    <P>I am happy to advise Senator Quill that we can accede to her request for time to be made available next Tuesday to discuss water quality.</P>

As the Cathaoirleach has pointed out, these issues are before a tribunal, in addition to which, criminal issues are matters for the Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Her views, however, will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I was asked by Senator Manning what legislation it was expected to take in the House over the next two weeks. As I understand it, we will be taking the following legislation: the Town Renewal Bill, 2000, the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999, the Firearms Bill, the Courts (Supplemental) Bill, the Hospitals Trust Bill, the Gas (Amendment) Bill and the Local Government (No. 2) Bill. There will also probably be a Finance Bill arising out of what has been discussed today.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> Yesterday, Senator Manning also raised the question of item 1, the Trinity College, Dublin and the University of Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Bill.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to confer on the Attorney General power to make available versions of Acts of the Oireachtas in a more readable form. These updated versions, to be known as restatements, will not alter the substance of the law and, accordingly, will not require the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas. However, once a restatement has been certified by the Attorney General under this Bill, it may be cited in court as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the legislation set out in it.</P>
      <P>The background to the Bill is the need to take steps to modernise the Statute Book. Every year 50 to 60 Acts are enacted in the State, many of which amend previous Acts. A user of the statutes will be familiar with the problem of having to consult several Acts in order to identify the statute law on a particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to modernise the Statute Book was recognised by the Government in June 1999 in Reducing Red Tape &ndash; An Action Programme for Regulatory Reform in Ireland. This programme was based on the report of the strategic management initiative's working group on regulatory reform and is aimed at improving the quality of regulation through a process of consolidation, revision and repeal. The programme required each Department and office to identify the scope for consolidation and repeal of primary and secondary legislation. The aim was to simplify, wherever possible, the process of doing business with Government and to make legislation more coherent and accessible. As a result of this report, consultations have taken place between the Department of the Taoiseach, the <Col N="1237" /> statute law revision unit in the Office of the Attorney General and Departments and offices to identify areas of statute law in need of revision and consolidation.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission consultation paper, Statutory Drafting and Interpretation: Plain Language and the Law, provisionally recommended that &ldquo;priority should be given to the consolidation of statutes, in order to facilitate readability&rdquo;. The commission also recommended that &ldquo;attention should be given to the updating of older legislation, and its re-drafting in modern language and format&rdquo;. A programme setting out proposed areas to be consolidated and restated will be brought to Government in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The problem of the untidy state of the Statute Book has not been addressed by the State. In other common law states there are policies in place to have regular revisions with the result that the laws in Canada and Australia are made more accessible through regular programmes of revision. As part of the initial programme for statute law revision, the Attorney General advised the Government that it would be helpful to introduce legislation under which the Attorney General may prepare versions of Acts of the Oireachtas in a more readable form without altering their substance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Variations on this process of restatement operate effectively in other common law jurisdictions such as the United States, Canada and Australia. The model proposed in the Bill is most closely analogous to the systems in place in New South Wales since 1972 and Queensland since 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is proposed under this Bill is that the Attorney General will be enabled to publish a certified version of the text of an Act incorporating any amendments made by subsequent Acts into one up to date statement of the Act. The proposed process is most easily explained by reference to an example, the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, which was amended by the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980. Once this Bill is enacted, the Attorney General may publish the Sale of Goods Acts, 1893 and 1980, in a restated form. Textual amendments, that is, amendments which replace text in the Act of 1893 with new text taken from the Act of 1989, will be set out so that the Act of 1893 may be read as amended. Where provisions are repealed, they will not appear but a brief note or explanation will be provided so the reader of the Sale of Goods Acts, 1893 and 1980, will be able to read all the relevant statute law in the one text. This exercise will pave the ground for the ultimate revision of the law <Col N="1238" /> and the replacement of old Acts with new more readable formats.</P>
    <P>A policy of restatement will be particularly useful for Acts which have been consolidated and subsequently amended. For example, the excellent work undertaken in relation to the consolidation of income tax and successive efforts to consolidate social welfare law will be supplemented by restatement so that consolidated Acts that are subsequently amended may be kept up to date. The Bill allows a restatement to gender proof and reformat the text of legislation so that, if necessary, the sequence of sections may be reordered to make them more easily readable.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that a restatement will not amend existing legislation and, accordingly, the process of restatement will not require scrutiny by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 4 of the Bill expressly confirms that a restatement will not in any way alter the substance of any Act or statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides that once certified by the Attorney General under this Bill a restatement may be cited in court as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the legislation contained in it. A court will take notice without formal proof of a restatement. This provision ensures that a restatement will be of practical use to the citizen. This initiative, together with regular updating of statute law on CD-ROM and making statutes available on the lnternet, will go a long way towards providing a modern, user friendly Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Those are the main provisions in the Bill. The innovation provided for is important and timely and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her clear statement of the principles of this Bill, which I welcome. Any measure which makes it easier for people to access and understand legislation is welcome. It is surprising it has taken until now to introduce such a measure. All of us who deal with legislation on a regular basis know it can be cumbersome and puzzling and that checking statutes cited in legislation can often involve much research. This is part of what should be a constant process of updating and simplifying legislation.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the parliamentary draftsman's office. When I was Leader of the House I was a member of the legislation committee. I saw at first hand the enormous pressure under which that office worked and the high levels of skill, patience and dedication required by the people there and the wide range of scholarship which is a <i>sine qua non</i> of an effective draftsman. They are some of the unsung heroes of the public sector. They are rarely, if ever, given credit for what they do, yet their output is prodigious and their work is of the highest standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one problem with this Bill. I disagree with the Minister of State who said that restatement does not need parliamentary scrutiny. It is in the nature of legislation that it ema<Col N="1239" /> nates from and is examined in Parliament and it bears with it the seal of parliamentary approval. Without Parliament, it would not have the status of legislation. Even if we are assured that restatement does not involve any change in the law, there should be an element of parliamentary consultation in the process.</P>
    <P>I have tabled an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage which I am sure will be welcomed by all sides. There should be a small special joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas which would meet in public and to whom the Attorney General would explain what is involved in the restatement and answer any questions people may have so there is an element of certainty and openness before the restatement takes effect. It could also be done as part of the workload of one of the existing committees. It would only need to meet once or twice a year to do this work.</P>
    <P>While I am on that subject, it is a great pity that the committee on statutory instruments no longer exists, or if it exists it does not meet. Part of the ongoing work of Parliament should be a constant examination of statutory instruments and the way in which they are applied. We all know that one of the ways in which the intentions of Parliament can either be abused or, more usually, stretched is through the use of statutory instruments and we fall down very badly in not making the scrutiny of statutory instruments part of our ongoing work. I would like to see a committee established before which the Attorney General would appear once or twice a year to explain what is involved in the restatements, answer any queries and assure Parliament that the intentions of those who passed the Bill in the first place are not being altered in any way by the restatement. I do not believe that any change would be deliberate but we live in an age where matters need to be explained and seen to be done with an openness and accountability which is not in the Bill and, consequently, I will be tabling an amendment to it.</P>
    <P>Much of the confusion about legislation is not due to the archaic nature of Bills. Surprisingly, many of us find when we read Bills drafted before the State was set up or in the early days of the State that the language frequently has a clarity which is not always present in latter day legislation. I would exhort those who draft laws to seek, as far as possible, to respect the English language &ndash; I know Senator Dardis has strong views on this as well &ndash; and strive for clarity and simplicity. It would be useful also if the parliamentary draftsman's office could provide seminars from time to time to Members of Parliament on the language and the complexities of legislation because most of us have no previous training in the reading of laws, yet we are expected in a very short time to master the details and the complexities of the language of legislation. It would be a useful function if, from time to time, the <Col N="1240" /> draftsman's office held a seminar which would benefit not just new Members but all of us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is useful, necessary and timely and I wish it a speedy progress through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation before us. It is overdue and desirable because even for people who are familiar with dealing with aspects of legislation, the difficulty of cross-referencing and consulting earlier Bills where there is not a consolidation Bill in place makes it difficult to understand what is at stake. I sometimes believe this is a deliberate ploy by the legal profession to ensure they are kept in continuous employment over an extended period of time since they are the only ones competent to translate this inscrutable language, the provisions, subsections and so on.</P>
      <P>To a certain extent this Bill should not be necessary. That goes back to a point Senator Manning made. The legislation itself should be clear, readable and easily understood. It is certainly easy to read and understand legislation drafted in the last century. The Local Government Bill of 100 years ago which set up the county councils is a case in point because it is easy to understand the language. I could go on at some length and bore Senator Quinn and the other Members of the House about my campaign, which Senator Quinn will recall when I was on that side of the House, about the &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; disease. The &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; disease reached epidemic proportions in legislation. It is not quite as evident as it was then but I do not know why the term &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; is used when the small preposition &ldquo;by&rdquo;, &ldquo;with&rdquo; or &ldquo;for&rdquo; will suffice. The campaign has been somewhat successful in that there is a diminution of the &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; phrase in legislation.</P>
      <P>Even in the Bill itself, which is designed to make matters clear for people, section 3(1) states: &ldquo;A restatement shall be identified on its face as a restatement and, where applicable, by the most collective citation of the statutes restated to which it relates.&rdquo;  I do not understand that and I doubt if many people would. Perhaps there is a certain contradiction in trying to make matters clearer and then putting in a phrase like that.</P>
      <P>I recognise the practical difficulties faced by the draftspersons and I agree with Senator Manning that they do a remarkably good job because it is rare for us to find textual errors. We may disagree with the content of the Bill but it is quite rare for us to find errors of syntax or language which would make an amendment necessary. It sometimes happens but it is rare and from that point of view the people do a very competent job and they are to be commended for it, but they should look at the clarity of language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the restatement which the Minister has spoken about, a valuable job could be done by somebody in a university or perhaps a practising journalist or journalists in terms of translating, if I may use that word, Bills into <Col N="1241" /> accessible language and making them easily understood. I have said that before and I believe there is some merit in it. The Law Reform Commission produced a consultation paper, which the Minister referred to, on statutory drafting and interpretation, Plain Language and the Law. A seminar was held on language and the law which I attended in Government Buildings arising from the Law Reform Commission paper. The Minister quoted a phrase from that paper: &ldquo;Priority should be given to the consolidation of statutes in order to facilitate readability.&rdquo;  Why not say &ldquo;to make them more easily read&rdquo; or words to that effect? Even the people who are trying to make matters clearer seem to have some difficulty with the language and perhaps that is something to be examined. There is a terrible tendency to put in big words and complex phrases when small words and simple phrases will work just as well or even more effectively.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about legislation being on CD-ROM, the Internet and so on. I am very impressed by the Oireachtas site on the Internet. It makes it very easy for Members to go back over debates to find material. There is a very good cross-referencing section. I had reason recently to try to find a few sentences referring to part of legislation and I did not have a great deal of trouble finding them. The people responsible for that need to be commended because it is an excellent facility. Apart from the assistance it provides to Members, it helps to make the work of Parliament much more accessible to a wider audience and indeed to an international audience.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a sensible move in the right direction and I very much welcome it. I share Senator Manning's reservation that there should be some degree of parliamentary scrutiny, whether by way of committee or some other system, and I hope it will be dealt with. There should be some consultation and I ask that the Minister consider that when replying. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Bill. I was unaware of the Bill until I came across it and my eyes have been opened to the need for it. I am delighted we are not taking Report Stage today because even in the case of a Bill like this, which is welcome, I disagree with taking all Stages on the one day.</P>
      <P>It was not until recently, when looking through the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, that I realised the need for this Bill. We are talking about 1904. When I queried something with the Minister, he corrected me by quoting section 3 of the 1927 Act, which turned out to be incorrect when examined, but that will be sorted out. I realised the need for restatement, for consolidation and for easier language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a look last night at some of the problems and why definitions are created, not necessarily in legislation. I read an article which stated that 70% of employees in Europe were questioned as to whether they would accept less money for a changed title. That may explain why we some<Col N="1242" /> times use other words. Apparently a cleaner, if called an environmental technician, would be willing to work for less, and a tea lady, if called a catering supervisor, would be willing to work for less. There may well be reasons why, in other businesses and other places, words like that are used.</P>
    <P>The biggest offender in this regard is not the parliamentary draftsman's office, although they may have got away with it in recent times. The European Commission is to blame for most of this. If it is desired to downgrade a civil servant, he becomes derepersonalised &ndash; a word I have not heard before, but apparently it is common. Another lovely one is that if a person is over somebody, he now has hierarchical authority. I can see where these words come in. The best of all was one from the Information Society Directorate which has a section called the &ldquo;Integrated Management of Resources and Horizontal Questions&rdquo;. That is from Europe. We will not take responsibility for it other than keeping our eye on it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as a long overdue step towards making our statute law more comprehensible and more accessible to the general body of our citizens, not just to those of us involved in the Legislature. If we are to have true democracy, we must have rule by law, but that law must be as simple as possible, as understandable as possible, and as accessible as possible. Few would argue that our lawmaking in this State has, up to now, passed muster in all or any of those respects. In inheriting a legal system from our colonial masters some 80 years ago, we unfortunately embraced some of its bad aspects as well as its good ones.</P>
    <P>On the issue of accessibility, a major step forward was taken in 1998 with the publication on CD-ROM of all the statutes from 1922 to 1997 and the associated publication of those statutes on the Internet. I found it of huge benefit to be able to access them. When that first CD-ROM was published we were promised that it would be updated each year, but for some reason that I cannot understand this has not happened. As a result, the statutes for 1998 and 1999 are not yet available in electronic form, either in CD form or on the Internet. That is a gap which should be filled as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the restatements envisaged by this Bill start to appear, they will be published electronically at the same time as on paper, and as part of the same integrated publishing operation, not as an afterthought that happens at some indeterminate later time. It is interesting that some Ministers make sure this happens every time, while in other Departments it seems to be done as an afterthought and only some time later. We now recognise that publication can be done in that manner and it is of huge benefit.</P>
    <P>Making the statutes available electronically not only replaced whole shelves of volumes with a single CD, which was an obvious advantage, but the nature of the electronic medium made it <Col N="1243" /> much easier to follow up all those cross-references that we are trying to correct here. That is absolutely essential in a situation where we tend to legislate by repeatedly amending existing legislation. It is a very rare Act that is complete in itself without reference to other statutes.</P>
    <P>We make this situation worse by an apparent reluctance to pass consolidation Acts, which bring together all the legislation on one topic that we have ever passed in the State. The only consolidation Bill that I can remember in my time in the Seanad is the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. I understand it is policy to consolidate Finance Acts every ten years.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas where law would become more accessible if it were consolidated, for example, the raft of employment legislation that has been passed over the past 20 years, and more particularly in the past ten years. For small companies that do not have the luxury of a personnel department, compliance with all this legislation is made much more difficult because it is so fragmented and is scattered around in so many different pieces of legislation. If I understand the object of this Bill correctly, a major purpose of these restatements will be to provide that consolidation effect and, perhaps, a more practical way of satisfying that need than passing a whole raft of consolidation statutes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the implicit recognition in this Bill that the language in our statutes can often be a barrier to understanding them. I hope, however, that the availability of this restatement avenue will not deflect the parliamentary draftsmen from the need always to search for simpler, clearer language when they are drafting original Bills. I agree with Senator Dardis who cited one or two examples, even from this Bill. It would be a retrograde step if they gave up on the need to make Bills clearer than they were before and used the excuse that plain and simple language is just for the restatement and that they can be as obscure and convoluted as they like in drafting Bills. The danger is that they might focus on the restatements and process new Bills in the way we have developed the habit of doing in recent times.</P>
    <P>There is a need, which I am not sure is fully recognised within the legal profession &ndash; and maybe with the ulterior motive that Senator Dardis says &ndash; to update and modernise the language and the phrasing that is used in legal matters. I know the Attorney General thinks the same. Every profession has its own jargon, which is useful up to a point. However, in the case of the law, there is a need for a precision that goes far beyond the use of ordinary language. There is a natural temptation, which is not always resisted, to hide behind the legal jargon and to use it as a means of keeping lay people out of the professional area. I agree with Senator Dardis that there may be an ulterior motive. That is wrong and it springs from the misconception that the law belongs to the legal profession. In a democracy, the law should belong to the people. It should <Col N="1244" /> belong to the citizens, and the role of professional legal people should be as facilitators for the general body of citizens, not as high priests jealously guarding their sacred books.</P>
    <P>We have not been given any examples of what a restatement might look like. It is hard to judge its potential effectiveness from the descriptions we have, in spite of the Minister's explanation. The proof of the effectiveness of this approach will be available only when the restatements begin to appear. I am inclined to be optimistic about the potential for communicating legal matters more clearly so that they are much more easily understood than they were before. One has only to look at the explanatory and financial memoranda that accompany new Bills. They are often models of clarity, and I have often wished we could pass the memorandum itself into law rather than the Bill to which it refers. Very often I do not look at the Bill until I have gone through that, and I wonder why we need the Bill at all.</P>
    <P>I welcome not just the Bill in itself but what I take to be a new resolve to make our laws more accessible and more understandable, a resolve that will manifest itself in other ways, in addition to the restatements that will flow from this Bill. I believe the intention is there to achieve and that this wording will do it. I look forward to any amendment that may be made. Senator Manning has referred to his amendment and I am happy to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This legislation is long overdue and extremely welcome. I commend her for it.</P>
      <P>I join Senator Manning in commending the work carried out by parliamentary draftsmen over the years. We tend not to notice the work they do until it gets too complicated and then we complain about it. I hope that in launching this Bill the Government is also committing itself to providing the resources for the parliamentary draftman's office. This is highly labour intensive work and it is rather futile to have the intention of doing something without providing the means. That office needs resources to enable this to be brought about.</P>
      <P>I fully support Senator Dardis's plea for plain language. I am glad he too likes the Local Government Act, 1898. These great 19th century local government and public health Acts were models of clarity and plain language. I commend the plea for plain language in our legislation.</P>
      <P>We are faced with difficulties because Acts of Parliament are technical documents. There will always be a tension between the technical needs of legal interpretation and the clarity which makes it accessible to the ordinary reader. There should be an effort made to shift the balance back to the side of clarity which has been lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is important because it can make law accessible to people. It is ridiculous that a person must ferret around among 20 to 40 Acts to find out their rights or obligations, particularly with regard to the licensing Acts and industrial <Col N="1245" /> relations Acts. The ideal would be to have obligations or responsibilities regarding a particular set of activities clearly stated in one consolidated Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State was possibly a little over confident in saying that the restated version does not change the law and does not need the scrutiny of the Oireachtas. I am quite sure that the intention is not to change the law in substance, but the danger is that every now and again it might. Restatements do have that effect. For instance, a change could be made to the order in which things are done and the position of a clause or phrase in an Act might run the risk of changing the purport or intent.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of clarity and readability runs the risk of effecting change. It also runs the risk of losing the benefit of quite an amount of case law. For that reason I rather hope the Minister of State will be able to accept Senator Manning's amendment, or some variant of it, and at least allow the restatement to be run past the House or an Oireachtas committee. This would be a useful process. It might only throw up a difficulty one out of ten times or perhaps more often. This process would be an important safeguard. It would also indicate that the law, as Senator Quinn has said, is not the property of the lawyers, draftsmen or courts but of the people and it is the people who appoint the Oireachtas to deal with it.</P>
    <P>With that reservation, which is rather a proposal to enhance what the Minister of State is trying to do, I commend the Bill and welcome it. I hope it means that there will be a real attack on this area and that resources will be put into it.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Quinn, I too would like to see the day when the Statute Book is available on CD-ROM. We must think of ways people can access information and adapt to these new technologies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with virtually everything that has been said. I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This welcome legislation is long overdue. We have a restatement of text which is parallel to the existing legislation. Perhaps the Minister of State might table an amendment to the effect that this applies not just to statutes but to statutory instruments as well. That would cover the whole gamut of legislation passed through the House.</P>
      <P>We have all been baffled by various legislative formats and texts presented to us, trying to decipher what is the precise meaning of legislation. It is very difficult to do this in many cases and it has not got any easier over the years. Textual material seems to have become more complicated, waffly and greater use is being made of big words, subjunctives and clauses that modify or enhance what could be stated in a simpler form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join in complimenting the draftspeople on the very disciplined way they carry out their work. It is very seldom that flaws of any substance appear in a text. Nevertheless, draftspeople, civil servants and bureaucrats seem to live in a world of their own in terms of the categories of words that they <Col N="1246" /> use in texts. I often think that the Minister of State, myself and other people who come from the teaching profession would be the best people to run this type of material past because we have the experience of explaining complicated matters to students. Students would laugh at the text that comes before us and appears in many official documents. They would not tolerate it at all.</P>
    <P>Perhaps legislative text could be subjected to a refining process. Someone could rewrite it &ndash; and this would be separate from the restatement &ndash; in a fresh manner. Many speakers have referred to the freshness and the specific nature of the legislation that was passed in the last century pre-1922. Legislation from that era is much clearer and more easily interpreted by the ordinary citizen than the legislation being produced in the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I would like an improvement in the text presented to us. Even with the best of text, in terms of legislative provisions coming through, there is a need for the equivalent of an explanatory memorandum or a restatement of the text in meaningful language. I do not mind as long as it is meaningful when it is restated. We have no guarantee because no one has chosen to present us with a restatement. Canada, the United States, Queensland and New South Wales have been given as examples but we do not have a sample of the text of a restatement before us. In a sense we are buying a pig in a poke. We do not know what we will get. There is only an assertion that there will be a restatement which the Attorney General will stamp. The Attorney General is a lawyer, a profession with a sympathy for archaic language. Lawyers are the high priests of a discipline and are happy within it once they have spent years learning it. It is advantageous for them to use language that the ordinary citizen does not understand when he or she needs professional help.</P>
    <P>The Minister assured us that there is nothing unconstitutional about delegating these powers to the Attorney General. She told us that we are not amending legislation and the seal of approval of this House is not required. This Bill provides for information which will run parallel with the original Bills passed by these Houses. It would be better for the Oireachtas to go through such information rather than leaving it to the Attorney General. Putting it to the Houses would allow for debate and discussion, as happens with many other statutory instruments.</P>
    <P>There are instances in the Bill which propose amendments and changes. Section 2(3) states:</P>
    <P>A restatement may renumber the provisions of a statute or portion of a statute and otherwise alter the form of a statute or portion of a statute.</P>
    <P>What does &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; mean? That is left to the discretion of the Attorney General, meaning that the statute can be changed. It is not the function of the Attorney General to renumber or otherwise alter the form of a statute or portion of a <Col N="1247" /> statute &ndash; that is the function of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I cannot accept the delegation of that function to the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Section 2(4) allows a word or words importing either the masculine or feminine genders in a provision to be substituted for a word or words importing both such genders in a restatement relating to it. Gender proofing will, therefore, become the remit of the Attorney General. It is the function of the Oireachtas, not the Attorney General, to gender proof legislation. How can that responsibility be delegated to the Attorney General?</P>
    <P>Section 5(1) states:</P>
    <P>A statement purporting to be certified under <i>section 2</i> shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the law contained in the provisions to which it relates of any statute or statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>How can it be <i>prima facie </i>evidence if the Oireachtas has no say in the matter? Evidence of that nature has legal authority. I also cannot accept that as a function of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Has the Attorney General given his opinion of this? He is conferring authority on himself when he is not an independent person. All power now lies with him and he is the arbiter, the person advising on the legislation. How can that be the case? It is inappropriate that the Attorney General can approve a Bill which confers on him powers parallel to those of the Oireachtas. He has encroached on our domain. I have not heard any legal arguments which justify that position.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with amendment No. 8<i>a</i> proposed by Senator Manning. I understand the intention, to prevent a situation where the Attorney General rubber stamps the restatement and the Oireachtas has no role, but the amendment only suggests that the Attorney General advises a special joint committee of the Oireachtas of his intentions. Such committees have no constitutional standing in legislative terms. If this legislation is unconstitutional and we should require the Oireachtas to look at the matters referred to here, a joint committee would not suffice.</P>
    <P>The restatement process is desirable and I will be delighted to see the final product. It is a pity we do not have the text of a Bill and a restatement so we can see if it is any better than the original. We do not know if the restatement will be any clearer for lay people. If it is not, it will not be not much use. That is the purpose of restatement &ndash; so Seán and Mary Citizen can see the contents of legislation, as well as consolidating legislation which has been amended over the years.</P>
    <P>What happens if there is a conflict of interpretation between the Attorney General's stamped restatement and the Bill? The Attorney General will be reading many restatements for his stamp of approval so he will have to read the legislation as well. He will be a busy man if he is to do that personally. If he is not going to deal with them <Col N="1248" /> personally, who will deal with them? Can he delegate this function? If we delegate it to him, can he further delegate it to his legal officers to ensure that the restatement conforms to the text of the legislation?</P>
    <P>Has there been any progress in dealing with pre-1922 legislation? There is an entire body of pre-Independence and pre-Act of Union legislation which should be looked at with a view to consolidation so the entire body of legislation would exist under the auspices of this State. There are many Acts going back centuries which still operate and which are not appropriate in a democracy.</P>
    <P>What resources will be required to enable this work to be done? That is not mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for the welcome they have shown the Bill. We all agree that there is a need for legislation which is accessible to the public. The restatement process will be of assistance in that regard.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators commented on the language used in legislation. I accept Senator Costello's point that a teacher armed with a red pen could cut through a great deal of this language in a short time. Legislation, by its nature, tends to be complicated but that does not mean that the language used should also be complicated.</P>
      <P>A great deal of legislation, particularly in the areas of tax, social welfare and finance, has been consolidated in recent years. As Senator Quinn said, this means that there is a need to update the CD-ROM which details all statutes enacted between 1922 to 1997. He also referred to the need to make all restatements of legislation available on the Internet. I understand that the CD-ROM to which Senator Quinn referred will be updated, before the end of the year, to include legislation enacted up to the end of 1999. In the future, it will be updated on a regular basis and all restatements will appear on the Internet as soon as they become available. This shows that we are moving in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning suggested that seminars be held by the parliamentary draftsman's office to allow Members of both Houses to become more familiar with the way legislation is drafted. The Attorney General is organising a conference on this matter which will be held on 6 and 7 October, but it is largely for the benefit of public servants and lawyers. I will ask the Attorney General to invite Members of both Houses to this conference or to arrange a similar conference for their benefit. This is an important matter, particularly in light of the fact that all legislation is introduced and enacted in the Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning raised a valid point about the need for the Houses of the Oireachtas to scruti<Col N="1249" /> nise restatements. I indicated earlier that restatements would not require scrutiny, but in the interests of good practice and parliamentary accountability it might be good if we found a method by which restatements could be returned to the Houses to be scrutinised. Failing that, perhaps the Houses could decide what should happen to restatements in advance of their introduction. We will deal with that matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senators Maurice Hayes and Costello referred to the level of resources available to the parliamentary draftsman and I can inform them that a number of new members of staff have been appointed recently to his office. The output of the office in recent years in terms of the amount of legislation it has drafted has been extraordinary. The Government is committed to strengthening the parliamentary draftsman's office by providing further resources.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to the use of <i>prima facie</i> evidence in court. It is important that restatements can be used by the public. Restatements will ensure that senior counsel will not be the only people in a position to use legislation in court or to understand such legislation. We may be able to address the Senator's concerns if we are in a position to accommodate Senator Manning's suggestion that the Oireachtas be given power to approve, in some form, legislation which is restated.</P>
    <P>Other Members' comments related largely to language and the need to ensure that legislation is readable. It is important to reiterate that restatements will not change legislation, they will merely ensure that Bills and Acts appear in a more reader friendly format. As Senator Dardis stated, there is a tendency in legislation to use words which are not needed. I was astonished when the Taoiseach in announcing my appointment referred to me as the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, at the Department of Education and Science and at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with special responsibility for children. It took him five sentences to indicate the office I hold. I do not object in any way to the Taoiseach's use of that long title but I frequently refer to myself as Minister for children. There are occasions when we do not object to the use of too many words.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their comments. We will deal with a number of the specific points they raised on Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These are technical amendments which refer to the application of statutes. The Bill appears to apply to Acts passed by the Westminster Parliament after 1800 but not to those passed before 1800. I am seeking to ensure that all legislation will be covered by the Bill. Two Acts of Union <Col N="1251" /> were passed during the period to which I refer, one at Westminster and the other in Ireland, but the Bill appears to refer only to the Westminster Act of Union.

      <P>I am reluctant to provide an answer to a question asked by an historian such as Senator Manning.

I do not know the exact number but I will ask my officials to provide the Senator with the information he requires.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 2 and 3, section 1 states that the term &ldquo;statute&rdquo; refers to Acts of the Oireachtas and Saorstát Éireann, Acts of Parliament of the former United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Acts of a Parliament sitting in Ireland at any time before the coming into force of the Union with Ireland Act, 1800. I accept Senator Costello's point that two Acts of Union were introduced. We will check if a gap exists between these Acts and if legislation exists which might fall outside that gap, if that is the case we will return to this matter on Report Stage.

      <P>In page 3, lines 34 to 36, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>I referred to this matter on Second Stage. There appears to be a very fine line in the Bill, at times, between restatement and amendment. Section 2(3) seems to be amending legislation. It states:</P>
      <P>A restatement may renumber the provisions of a statute or portion of a statute and otherwise alter the form of a statute or portion of a statute.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that a restatement should renumber the provisions or alter the form of a statute because to do so would interfere with the work of the Oireachtas. Perhaps the best way of getting around this problem is to delete the subsection and not allow it to comprise part of the restatement. Surely one would want the restatement to be as true as possible to the actual text. If people want to look for particular provisions, there is not much sense in restating, renumbering or altering the form of a statute. Although the form may be altered textually to make legislation more understandable, every other aspect of the statutes should be kept as close as possible to the original legislation. If legislation is altered, that will interfere with the legislative process.</P>

Unless those carrying out the restatement process are allowed to simplify provisions or delete extraneous matter, the process will not be successful and we will end up with the same type of bulky, cumbersome legislation we set out to restate.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge Senator Costello's concerns but I believe that my forthcoming amendment, which would ensure that concerns would be met on an ongoing basis, will meet his concerns. Senator Maurice Hayes made the point earlier that while the intention might not be to change the nature of the law, that could happen. This section is essential to the working of the Bill.</P>

I am not sure I understand the word &ldquo;form&rdquo;. Perhaps the Minister would clarify its meaning. If <Col N="1253" />&ldquo;form&rdquo; merely refers to the order or layout of provisions, which is clearly the Bill's primary objective, I would not have any difficulty with its use.

      <P>I concede that there is a difficulty here which is probably a language difficulty, the very difficulty the Bill seeks to address. It seems to me that the restatement would merely seek to make it easier to lay out provisions in an orderly sequence but that point may not be sufficiently explicit. It is possible to interpret this subsection in another way, namely, the way in which Senator Costello has interpreted it.</P>
      <P>The primary difficulty seems to relate to the word &ldquo;form&rdquo; rather than the renumbering. If the content of the subsection were to mean that the form of legislation could be fundamentally changed, difficulties could arise. However, I believe the word &ldquo;form&rdquo; refers to the layout of legislation rather than its substance, and the alteration of that layout may be necessary in order to make the legislation more accessible. I am aware that there is a difference between the words &ldquo;form&rdquo; and &ldquo;substance&rdquo;. We are back to pedantry again here. There is a difficulty with the clarity of the subsection.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;form&rdquo; refers to the appearance or layout of legislation as opposed to its substance or content which the Attorney General would not intend to alter in any way. The central purpose of this Bill is to make the layout of legislation more clear. If, after discussing Senator Manning's forthcoming amendment, it is necessary to clarify the matter further, we will return to it on Report Stage. The Attorney General felt that this subsection was necessary in order for the option to reorder paragraphs, etc., in legislation to be available.</P>

      <P>Renumbering is probably the most crucial element of restatement which seeks to put all consolidated Acts into a simplified form. It would be necessary to renumber provisions in order that people would not have to go from one end of a statute to the other to see what amendments were made. The purpose of restatement is to link provisions while ensuring at all times that the content of legislation is not interfered with. That would make the legislation more readable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (4), line 6, after &ldquo;genders&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided that such amendment has been effected by an Act of the Oireachtas, either by way of specific amendment or of a general amendment of references of a particular category specified in such Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My concern is that when we are restating the law, where masculine and feminine are intended to be construed, this should be specified in the restatement. I understand the Intepretation (Amendment) Act, 1997, will cover this. However, to transfer to the Attorney General the authority to conduct his own gender proofing as he thinks fit encroaches on the responsibility of legislators. The Attorney General and not the legislators will decide what was intended and will be responsible for interpreting gender proofing when restatement takes place.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if this matter is best dealt with by this amendment or by Senator Manning's. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">

      <P>I see no reason to return to this amendment on Report Stage. We are dealing with consolidated legislation. This might involve legislation passed in the last ten years which would have been gender proofed being added to earlier legislation which would not. In some cases the form he/she would be used and in others it would not. In no circumstances would the actual meaning of the legislation be changed. This is a matter of simple gender proofing and does not affect the meaning of legislation. The same applies to forthcoming amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8<i>a</i>:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;Before endorsing any restatement the Attorney General shall advise a special Oireachtas Joint Committee on the reasons for, and the nature of, the restatement and receive the approval of the Committee for the restatement.</P>
      <P>This matter has been discussed already by almost everyone who has spoken. The amendment will improve the Bill for two reasons. It is important that the principle of parliamentary involvement and accountability be expressed in the Bill. Such a committee would embody that principle. My proposal is merely a statement of principle rather than a suggestion regarding the shape of the committee. A sub-committee of the committee on legal affairs or preferably a dedicated joint committee to which the Attorney General reported on a regular basis would be very useful. Such a committee could be in a position to get its own independent legal advice as to what is being proposed, where necessary. There is a danger, despite the best intentions of the Attorney General and those who draft restatements and all the expertise available, that changes may occur or things appear which were not intended in the original law. A level of scrutiny of restatements is important.</P>
      <P>The amendment is also important in terms of communicating with the public so they can see what the changes are, hear them discussed and be made more fully aware of what is happening. This could best be done through some sort of committee.</P>
      <P>We should examine carefully what has happened to the old committee on statutory instruments, which are little devils which need to be examined on a regular basis. Things can happen under statutory instruments which legislation never intended or they can develop out of proportion to what was intended in the legislation.</P>
      <P>I will be happy if the Minister of State can accept the principle of my amendment and give some thought to the nature of the committee between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Manning. I understand his objectives. He hopes to copperfasten the security that no changes will take place which are not open and understandable. This amendment may not be the ideal way to ach<Col N="1256" /> ive his objective; the Minister of State may say there is another way. However, we must overcome this problem. Senator Manning's amendment is sensible and appears to be valid and operable. It may well be that the Minister has an alternative which can be discussed on Report Stage. The objective of the amendment is to make sure nothing slips through without being open and clear. Senator Manning's wording is a sensible way of achieving that.</P>

      <P>I was conscious, when we were ordering the business this morning, that this would need to be looked at. That is why we did not propose to discuss all Stages today. It is right that we take time to reflect on what has been said.</P>
      <P>In her reply on Second Stage, the Minister of State referred to the matter raised by Senator Manning. It would be appropriate to find some procedure to ensure a degree of scrutiny. An important reason for this is contained in section 5 and relates to the <i>prima facie </i>aspect, to which reference has been made. If a restatement is to have standing before the courts, difficulties could arise if it were not subject to some sort of parliamentary scrutiny. This is an added reason to give this amendment some consideration. I have no fixed views regarding the wording of the amendment so long as the principle is taken into account. Senator Manning appears to take a similar view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning has attempted to deal with our concerns regarding this legislation. The amendment proposes that the Attorney General advise a special Oireachtas joint committee regarding the reasons for and nature of restatements of legislation. If section 5 gives a strength of law to a restatement by making it <i>prima facie </i>evidence, we must be very careful what is contained in it. Members of both Houses must be aware of the text of any restatement and be satisfied that it conforms to the provisions of the legislation. If not, a conflict will arise and the restated legislation will not have been dealt with by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I wonder if this amendment meets all our needs. What is the standing of a joint committee of the Oireachtas? It does not enact legislation. What would be the strength of the approval such a committee could give to a restatement? Let us suppose a constitutional question arises with regard to a restatement of legislation and to items of change in the legislation and it is left to the discretion of the Attorney General to make his decision on it. If we move that a step further and the Attorney General advises the joint committee, can we leave it at that? That still does not fulfil the duties of both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to respond on that point because if there is an initial difficulty in terms of us, as legislators, doing our business my <Col N="1257" /> fear is that a special Oireachtas joint committee will not do the business for us. I understand Senator Manning's point that this should be examined by the Minister of State, the draftspeople and the officials and that we might come back to it on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this issue earlier. I support Senator Manning's draft proposal and I welcome the Minister of State's willingness to consider it. It is important to remember that the substance of the law would not be at issue, rather whether restatement has unwittingly or otherwise effected a change in the law. We need to devise a procedure which focuses on that point and prevents somebody going to town in an attempt to change the law itself. There was a time I would have dismissed that possibility but having witnessed the ingenuity of some of my colleagues in making debates on the Order of Business I can quite easily see how any sort of opening could be taken.</P>
      <P>There is a suggestion, which I offer to the Minister, that possibly a variant of the negative resolution procedure might be used, where the matter is scrutinised by the committee, is laid before the Houses and can be taken as having been approved unless we move against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Costello on the status of a joint committee, it would be quite sensible to do it by joint committee because the function would be to spot the error, so to speak, and in the event that the error is spotted it can be referred to the House. The House can then deal with it. It is not as if we are making legislation, if so it would have do it by select committee. It is a matter of scrutiny and in the event that a defect appears the House can deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point made by Senator Costello, I agree with Senator Dardis that effectively the committee would first scrutinise and, thereby, reassure both Houses that no liberties have been taken or that there are no changes. As to what powers the committee would have, in the real world if a joint committee made up of all parties felt uneasy or unhappy with the changes then it would be a very foolish Attorney General or Government which would not listen to what was being said and seek to put it right. We are not discussing issues of confrontation or the principle of Bills, we are simply discussing procedures and ensuring that matters are dealt with properly. I would not have any worries on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to an issue raised by Senator Manning on Second Stage, as to whether the Bill should be classified as a hybrid Bill and, therefore, dealt with under Standing Orders relevant to Private Business. While this is a matter which falls to be determined in accordance with standard procedures applicable to the implementation of Standing Orders, I would like to clarify the position in terms of the advice available to <Col N="1260" /> me. Under Standing Order 128, a hybrid Bill is defined as a public Bill, not being a Bill to confirm a provisional order, affecting private interests in such a way that if it were a private Bill it would, under Standing Orders relevant to private business, require parliamentary notice before its introduction. A private Bill is a Bill which is promoted for the particular interest or benefit of any person or locality, as distinct from measures of public policy.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the Bill has not been regarded as hybrid if all the persons or bodies affected by it, and no others, belong to a category or class germane to the subject matter of the Bill. It is not the practice to treat as hybrid Bills dealing with matters of public policy whereby private rights over large areas or of whole classes are affected.</P>
      <P>Having consulted with the Attorney General, I am advised that this is not a hybrid Bill. The Bill amends the Harbours Act, 1996, and as in the case of that Act, applies to the management, control, operation and development of a number of harbours, a defined class by reference to criteria germane to the subject matter of the Bill. Clearly, it does not affect private interests, that is, it does not affect private interests by promoting the particular interest or benefit of any person or locality. The Attorney General is satisfied that this is not a hybrid Bill and, accordingly, I would submit that it would be bad practice should it be so treated in the course of its passage through the Oireachtas. The Harbours Act, 1996, and the Harbours (Amendment) Bill, relate to measures of public policy and are dealt with, therefore, as public Bills.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that a number of amendments have been tabled. As I do not wish to delay the House any further, I will deal directly with amendment No. 1. Section 1(2) provides that the Minister may, by order, where he is of the opinion that efficient and effective implementation of an order under subsection (1) so requires, provide that the number of directors of the transferee company shall not exceed five. The duration of any such order shall not exceed two years. The provisions in the main Act which relate to employee and local authority directives, section 30, and the chief executive as an <i>ex officio</i> director, section 36, are excluded for the period of the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hallmark of the implementation structures provided for in this Bill is that they are designed to be simple, effective and non-divisive. It is of vital importance that the implementation board will have a short shelf-life and be tightly focused, and for this reason I have decided to keep the numbers low, with balanced representation from each company and an independent chairperson. It also has a clear-cut and focused remit and while one could argue for more or less members, it is my judgment that a board limited to five <Col N="1261" /> members will facilitate the orderly and speedy conduct of its business.</P>
    <P>Among the tasks of the implementation board overseeing the unification process will be the close liaison with the company boards and their advisory boards. In order to ensure the smoothest possible transition to a new single port company structure the advisory boards, comprising the directors of two or more port companies being amalgamated, including the employee and local authority directors, will have a real and important role to fulfil in assisting the implementation board of the new company to pursue difficult decisions which are vital to its future success and the development of business at the port facilities. This arrangement maintains equal and balanced representation of the interests of each of the amalgamating companies while ensuring that vital focus on the part of the implementation board.</P>
    <P>The implementation process should be completed within 12 to 18 months. As far as the proposed amalgamation of the Foynes Port Company and the Shannon Estuary Port Company is concerned, I hope the task can be completed within an even shorter timeframe. The normal board structure will then come back into play. Consequently, I do not intend to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated, the headquarters of the new single port company for the Shannon Estuary will be located at Foynes. That is my view and it has been placed on the record. It has been communicated to both boards and I understand it has been accepted by both.</P>
      <P>I made this determination because the headquarters should be located at the nerve centre of the new company's business. This is the location over which the new company will exert the most business influence in terms of facilities. At a meeting with me, the local community council in Foynes raised its serious concerns about the critical drop in the number of pupils attending schools locally. Centralisation of the headquarters in Foynes will help the village and the local community. It is the correct decision in my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment addresses concerns raised by Senators and empowers the Minister, in adding to prescribing by order matters such as the company name, to provide also for the identification of the headquarters location which will be at Foynes in the case of the new Shannon and Foynes Port Company to which I have made a commitment. Regarding inserting a specific provision in the Bill that the new headquarters will be at Foynes, I am <Col N="1262" /> not convinced that this is necessary or in line with good legislative practice. Consequently, I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

I never doubted his position, but it is a positive move that the Minister will be in a position as a result of the amendment to locate by order the operational headquarters in Foynes. He will then be in a position to name the new company the Shannon and Foynes Port Company.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, paragraph (<i>c</i>), line 15, to delete &ldquo;or the harbour master&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment follows the argument I made in regard to the previous amendment about enshrining the name of the new company in the legislation. While I agree with the Minister, the Bill is not sufficiently specific. The chief executive should be the one person who controls the whole operation. This is why I propose the deletion of &ldquo;or the harbour master&rdquo; in line 20 on page 6.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 seeks the deletion of &ldquo;or harbour master, respectively,&rdquo; in line 20 on page 6, while amendment No. 5 seeks to ensure the provision is in the singular and not the plural. If the singular is used in one part, it must be used throughout the section. I ask the House to accept the amendments to ensure the operation is streamlined and that there is one chief executive with total responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

      <P>The section provides for staff transferring from one company to the other and for the continuation of the protections afforded under the Harbours Act, 1996, in relation to scales of pay and conditions of service. However, it provides that the statutory office holders of chief executive and harbour master of a transferor company are not required to be appointed <Col N="1263" /> as chief executive or harbour master of a new or transferee company.</P>
      <P>It is clear that in a new single port company entity, only one chief executive officer and one harbour master can be in charge and responsible. There is no intention to undermine the employment protections given under the Harbours Act, 1996, or that staff members transferring from predecessor harbour authorities shall be brought to less beneficial conditions of service or remuneration than those to which they were subject immediately before vesting day of the new port companies. However, no business can be run effectively with two or three heads in charge. It would undermine the thrust towards unification of two or more companies if any elements were left separate in the technical, management, administrative or other areas.</P>
      <P>In any event, under section 37(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Harbours Act, 1996, a harbour master can authorise a member of his staff to perform functions conferred on him or her by the Act. In discharging such a delegated function, the person to whom it is delegated assumes the full authority and powers of the harbour master under the Act. It would be a matter for the new Shannon and Foynes Port Company to decide how best to deploy the significant resource of six persons currently employed as harbour masters, deputies or assistants. Such delegated functions can be put in place in the interests of good governance and this has the benefit that it can be retracted as well as given to meet particular circumstances which vary from port to port. Flexibility is provided under existing harbours legislation.</P>
      <P>Enshrining the amendments in the Bill would undermine the whole thrust of unification and help to maintain and encourage a separate empire mindset instead of a dynamic, unified new company operating on the same basis as competitors such as Dublin and Cork. As it stands, a harbour master may attend board meetings in accordance with the provisions of section 17(5) of the Harbours Act. This is unusual because, for example, this statutory provision does not apply to other senior professional staff of port companies, including the accountancy and engineering disciplines, all of which contribute equally to the efficient operation of ports.</P>
      <P>Increasing the number of harbour masters in attendance at board meetings would only exacerbate this dichotomy. It is open to the board to require any member of the staff to be in attendance at a meeting, depending on the business being transacted. I contend that an identical argument could be put forward for a similar provision or exclusion to apply to the position of chief executive. It would be equally unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the arguments put forward and I am not convinced that the amendment would serve any useful purpose. It would start a pre<Col N="1264" /> cedent where, if there were two harbour masters, there could be two chief executives. Undoubtedly, given the pressure I have been under from people in Limerick, I would have to go back on my decision to have one headquarters in Shannon. If I broke this principle, the headquarters would be split in two and that would run counter to the ethos of unification and one strong port company. Therefore, I do not intend to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I endorse the Minister's comments. In any organisation where there is amalgamation or transfers, the staff carry all their entitlements in terms of pay and conditions but there must be one senior executive officer to run the show. I have experience of the City of Dublin VEC and I know it would be difficult to have a combination of factors where people would be moved from one area to another. It would not be possible to have two units of an organisation working in conflict. It would be a bad move to suggest that two authorities should be combined in one single unit because it would not work.</P>

This can be done by regulations made under that Act. In the circumstances, it would be more appropriate to have the port companies included by way of such regulations and not by provision contained in this Bill.

Local authorities are prescribed by regulation as it stands. The appointment of three local authority nominated directors is a matter to be determined upon the formation of a new port company.

KPMG consultants recommended in their report, after a comprehensive public consultation process,that the name of the new company shall be the Shannon and Foynes Port Company.

In terms of actual tonnage, the Shannon Estuary Port Company has a multiple of eight times that of Foynes.</P>
      <P>I would like the implementation board to decide on the name of the new company.

      <P>An environmental impact assessment has been integrated into various Irish development consent systems through the European Communities regulations of 1989 to 1999. Projects needing environmental impact assessment are listed in the First Schedule of the EIA regulations. The EIA regulations amend the governing harbours and planning legislation and provide for an environmental impact assessment. All relevant development proposals within that consent system are required to undergo environmental impact assessment. A consent application for such development must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement which is a statement of the likely significant environmental impacts, good and bad, of the proposal. The competent authority, in its consideration of an application, must carry out an EIA of the proposal based, among other things, on information contained in the environmental impact statement.

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions today and for their co-operation in getting this legislation quickly through the House. As I emphasised on Second Stage, this is important legislation for the Shannon Estuary, the mid-west and the whole western region. As a Galway man I consider the Bill to have as much significance for Galway as it has for Foynes and Limerick because much of the business of the west coast will now begin to come through Foynes in particular. That is something I will encourage. I had a telephone call this morning from a Dutch industrialist asking me questions about the possibility of setting up a major facility in Foynes.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that we will see immediate and significant development in the Foynes region as a result of this legislation, which is a long time coming. It has a sad history and I hope we move forward now in a positive way. I intend to conclude some further proposals in the Dáil debate but we can now see a new era of development in the Foynes-Limerick region. The new port company will be a driving force for economic development along the west coast and into the south-west. We need to improve other infrastructure. Obviously we have got to build the major roadway and we need by-passes in Limerick; they are now being built in places like Newmarket-on-Fergus, Clarecastle, Ennis and Gort. Development like those projects are of major significance. Knock Airport and Foynes will become major developments in air and sea and will bring about the kind of development that all political parties want &ndash; decentralisation, the development of the spatial policies that are now the buzz word and getting major development out of Dublin and into the west and the south-west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not put through these Houses more important legislation than this Bill, whether I am <Col N="1270" /> weeks, months or a year or two in this Department. I thank the Senators. I appreciate the concerns of some people but I assure them we want to proceed on the basis of partnership and trust and not doing anybody any harm. We are trying to do good for everybody. I thank my own staff in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources for the efficient way in which they got this legislation together. We have set a record in the sense that we have completed in this House the first part of the legislation, which was produced quickly arising from a report produced by a firm of consultants, and I sincerely hope we can complete the second part of the legislation in the Dáil before the summer recess and allow this new company to be set up and get on with the development work that we all want to see happen.</P>

Anything that will divert traffic from the eastern part of the country has to be commended. We all know that the ports on the east coast are very congested in terms of traffic and that the movement of goods in the State has to go from west to east, south to east or whatever.</P>
      <P>I had minor reservations about some aspects of this legislation but I am glad the Minister will consider some of the amendments when the legislation goes before the Lower House. I hope that in the time available to him to reflect on it that he may change his views on some aspects of those amendments. I am delighted that the Bill has passed through the House and that we were mostly in agreement with the broad thrust of the Bill. In the context of commercial activity and for the greater good of the mid-west region, this amalgamation could prove to be a watershed.</P>
