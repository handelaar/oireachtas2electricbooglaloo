      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline the deliberations of the UN Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders which took place in Vienna in April 2000, and Ireland's views on restorative justice.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Coghlan on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to make a statement on the local fishermen's traditional rights on the Caragh River and to clarify if a map can be produced clearly indicating ownership of the various sections.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is No. 2, Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages. Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I draw attention to the protest outside the gates of the Houses today by the parents of deaf children. They are making the case that there is no service available from the Department of Education and Science to teach deaf children sign language. If that is so, the situation must be addressed immediately. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to come into the House and explain this state of affairs? His attention must be drawn to the matter so that <Col N="678" /> immediate action can be taken to remedy the problem.</P>
      <P>I also draw attention to the report published in London yesterday by the housing charity Shelter which states that 10% of those sleeping rough in London are Irish. There is no reason to believe that the report is inaccurate. We should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to get up to date information on this matter from the Irish Embassy in London and report back to the House. It is a matter of great concern to all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The main news which has broken since yesterday's Order of Business is that a former Taoiseach received more than £8.5 million. We should see that in the context of other issues we have been discussing. The motion to discuss how this House can deal with corruption and bribery, as we are required to do under the Constitution, which was agreed by the Leader of the House and all the other parties, is still not on the Order Paper. I will not allow this issue to go away even if I have to raise it <i>ad nauseam.</i> If we, as a House, are not seen to take control of the issue, we will become the laughing stock of the electoral process. This morning I again propose an amendment to the Order of Business that motion 21, in the absence of an agreed motion, be taken first.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning in his comments and remind the House that we tabled an amendment to the Education Act on the question of signing for the deaf, but it was rejected at the time. We made representations at all levels and put the amendment to a vote. It would be interesting to hear the Minister explain why the Department has not responded on this issue.</P>
      <P>I will press my amendment to the Order of Business and will continue to raise the issue until we can show the electorate that we are trying to deal with the issue in an adequate fashion. I am not saying that I am any better than anyone on either side of the House but we have a duty, as parliamentarians, to deal with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment proposed by Senator O'Toole to the Order of Business. It is not good enough that we have to raise this issue at each sitting. The Leader of the House made a commitment that there would be an agreed motion. The leaders of all the parties met and agreed a motion but it has still not come before the House.</P>
      <P>I will not accept the amendment tabled to the Registration of Lobbyists Bill last night as a joint motion. The terms of reference were not agreed and there was much with which I disagreed. We had a joint motion which was to be the focus for the debate and all sides of the House were involved. It dealt with all the issues, bribery, corruption, standards for politicians and how lobbyists should behave. The motion has still not come before the House even though the issue is being discussed everywhere else. Even when we agree to put a motion on the Order Paper, it does not appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> I also raise the issue of the deaf children and the Department of Education and Science's failure to provide a service to teach deaf children sign language. Now they and their parents are protesting outside the Houses for a basic service which should already be available.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader of the House arrange for a debate on Northern Ireland next week? The Ulster Unionist Council will meet this Saturday when the fate of the Good Friday Agreement will probably be decided. Following that meeting there will be an opportunity to see how the cards fall and it would be appropriate to have a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am not agreeable to taking Committee and Remaining Stages of the Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000, today. There is only a reference to Committee Stage on the Order Paper and Report Stage should be left until next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all gobsmacked about the scale of the payments which appear to have been made to Mr. Haughey and the affair raises serious issues. There was a widely drafted amendment last night which dealt with many of these matters and it was open to people&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been going on for a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to contribute on those issues. The question on which the Chair might rule is whether we can return to those issues within a six month period. I only raise the point; I am not saying it should not happen. I am aware of the procedures which operate in the House.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello on the importance of discussing Northern Ireland. The general consensus was that it would be preferable to wait until after the Ulster Unionist Party meeting and its decision as to the future of the executive and so on. In the event of that decision being made at the weekend, which we hope will be favourable from the point of view of Mr. Trimble and the Irish and British Governments, we should have such a debate. The House has a good history in terms of debates on Northern Ireland being balanced, reasonable and fair.</P>
      <P>It would be important to consider the question of employment opportunities for people with disabilities. It appears that many who are well qualified have failed to find employment. There seems to be prejudice among employers regarding people who are well qualified. I know of a case where somebody in a wheelchair with a third level education is finding it extremely difficult to get employment. Legislation should be considered in that context. There has been legislation on equal opportunities which means people with disabilities cannot be discriminated against. However, this matter merits careful discussion and we could usefully put our points of view to the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of our prisons need refurbishment and special facilities need to be put in place for some offenders, particularly juveniles. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to discuss the programme for building another 1,700 prison places before we embark on this incredibly expensive capital programme, irrespective of the cost? A debate is needed on the treatment of offenders, not on prisons. As the Leader and other Senators are aware, representatives from the probation service and the Irish Penal Reform Trust expressed grave concern about the prison building programme and highlighted the fact that little notice has been taken of reports which suggest that the treatment of offenders is amiss.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come here to discuss the fact that some people of Irish origin are in dire situations in England. DÍON, which is administered through the Irish Embassy in London, has done great work. Senator Manning is right that 10% of those who are homeless and sleeping rough in London are of Irish origin. We are also grossly over-represented in the prisons and psychiatric institutions there. Many prisoners, those sleeping rough and those in psychiatric hospitals in England, have transferred from institutions here. They were cared for so poorly that they went to English institutions.</P>
      <P>These matters marry into each other. The treatment of offenders is appalling. A great number of people in the prison system have psychiatric problems yet they are not being treated. This matter has been raised since I became a Member of the House. Will the Leader arrange to have a debate on the treatment of offenders and on our responsibility for those of our diaspora who have not done so well in England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the recent Ombudsman's report, which we received yesterday, I was surprised to note that 20% or more of the complaints to the Ombudsman derived from complaints against local authorities, of which most of us are members and through which system many of us are elected to this House. I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on this issue. The complaints related to enforcement of planning conditions and regulations. There are different problems in Dublin in terms of planning, etc., but it is not acceptable in the new millennium that there is such a large number of complaints against local authorities. As the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, has passed through this House and is with the other House, it is important that the Ombudsman's report is discussed as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader agreed last week to have an all-party motion on bribery and lobbying generally. There was a debate last night on this matter and I agree with the points made by Senator Dardis. It is imperative that we have an <Col N="681" /> all-party motion in the interests of this House in particular. Under no circumstances should Members vote in a manner which, as happened last night, gives the impression that there is disagreement regarding an all-party motion. Senator O'Toole has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business with which I do not agree. It is imperative to have an all-party motion on lobbying and bribery generally. I want all-party agreement that there will be a discussion, without a vote, which will be in everyone's interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Manning and Senator Henry regarding the Irish in England, particularly in London. I assure the House that what they described is the case. There is a further group, middle aged and elderly males, who live in poor conditions whose plight has been highlighted through the London associations with whom I have had contact. A debate in this House with the Minister for Foreign Affairs would be useful. The local authorities, through the county associations, should play a role in bringing these people back to this country and rehousing them. The conditions in which some of them live are deplorable.</P>
      <P>I support the call by Senator O'Donovan with regard to the Ombudsman's report. It is a terrible indictment of the local authorities and, as elected representatives of local authorities, we should have a debate in which we will have an opportunity to give our views openly on their performance on a national basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on the Ombudsman's report, a report which we should discuss each year as a matter of course. I disagree with Senator Dardis's point that as we had an opportunity last night to debate lobbyists there is no need to take the motion put forward by Senator O'Toole. I see a considerable difference between the two matters. We had a very good debate on lobbyists last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the amendments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is a considerable difference between that debate and the one Senator O'Toole is looking for. I support him on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I want to make. We are talking about action rather than just talking. There is a huge difference between the amendment on the motion last night and Senator O'Toole's and the Independent's motion. I remind Senator Dardis that all five Independent Senators spoke on the motion last night. It is not that we did not have an opportunity to speak but <Col N="682" /> we really believe that Senator O'Toole's motion should be considered now and taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>Members will have received a communication recently from the National Representative Council for People with Disabilities complaining bitterly about the current disability allowance, which is somewhere in the region of £73.50. They want the Government to look seriously at raising this to a minimum of £100 per week. We all know that people with disability have ongoing costs in terms of wheelchair repairs, apart from having to live off a meagre amount of money. I ask the Leader to talk to the appropriate Minister and appeal to him to look at this in a serious way at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to have an urgent debate on the continuing housing crisis, particularly the significantly increased number of young people who are unable to purchase a home of their own. I am inundated with queries from people who would like to buy their own home but cannot do so because of the massive and continuing increase in house prices.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate to clarify the issues related to the launch of Eircom shares, particularly the share price. Many hundreds of thousands of people bought those shares in good faith without knowing Eircom advised that the shares were over priced. This is to me a shocking revelation and a matter for discussion here. I ask for the Minister for Public Enterprise to come here and publish all of the advice she received on this very important issue. This is a very significant matter in view of the future of all new IPOs which the Government intends to launch.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support the call for education for the deaf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senators did not think I knew how to sign. I employed a deaf man who taught me some sign language and I find it very useful when I meet people who cannot speak. I <Col N="683" /> pay tribute to the college that provides services for the deaf. I live near a family who are deaf and dumb and they want their child, who is also deaf and dumb, to be educated in the local national school. They do not want to send their child to Dublin. I support Senator Manning's call for services for deaf people in our schools. Many deaf people need that service.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland. This morning I watched a television show and I was very disappointed at some of the intolerance shown for an Orange march. The Orange Order has marched in Rossnowlagh, County Donegal, as long as I can remember. When I was younger many members of the Church of Ireland community went there for the day and their cattle and farms were looked after by their Catholic neighbours. This was normal practice. I thank God I came from an area that had a good community spirit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is. It is important that we call for tolerance in the South. If we want unity, tolerance and acceptance in Northern Ireland then we should show by example in the South. Again I appeal for tolerance and for people to listen to what the Orange Order has to say. They are part of our community. They are taxpayers and workers in this State. They vote in this State and we should be tolerant enough to listen to them. I call for a debate on the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the Ombudsman's report, particularly in relation to the area covered by local authorities and the high level of complaints against them. This could be covered under the Local Government (No. 2) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader tell me when is it proposed to take that Bill in this House? Will it be taken in this session and what is the up-to-date position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for educational facilities for the deaf. We have an inclusive educational system and now is the time to care for all of our people equally. We must show that there is a fair and reasonable provision of services to all people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the previous Senators who have raised the issue of the Ombudsman's report. In a time when we are talking about changing the services to the public it is interesting to note a few things about the report. First, there is the increase in the number of complaints received by the Ombudsman. Second, it is interesting to note the criticism levelled at some of the local authorities about their lack of public services and failure to give a good local service in a proper and reason<Col N="684" /> able manner. We have tried to improve the quality of their customer services. Third, local authorities were criticised for their failure to communicate with the Ombudsman. We should have a full debate on this report and previous reports to see how the local authority and public administration process works at local level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the question of the report of the probation section of the IMPACT trade union on building prisons has already been raised. I hope that the Leader will arrange a debate on this matter. Some of us have spoken over many years about the dangers of simply trying to address crime levels by building prisons. Numerous reports state that this is the wrong way to approach the problem, yet we are still doing it. Now a professional trade union involved in the area is complaining.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader give us some indication of when he might grant us a debate on Tibet? He has given us an undertaking in principle. This debate becomes more urgent with the American decision to give full trading recognition to China without any commitment on human rights. This is tragic. The motions tabled by us contain elements of human rights. It is important that even a small country like Ireland signals that some countries have not abandoned the human rights aspect in their dealings with China.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Kett's call for a debate on the disability allowance. Will the Leader extend that debate to include the allowance for people who look after the severely disabled and the carer's allowance? I also support the call by many other Senators for educational facilities for the deaf.</P>
      <P>I refer to Northern Ireland and the call for a further debate. I wish David Trimble well on Saturday and hope he receives as much support as possible. In obtaining that support, I hope no conditions will be laid down on this occasion and that his party will allow the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement for the next year to enable the world to see that there are decent and civilised people in Northern Ireland. I would not like further conditions imposed to stall implementation of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Farrell on the Orange march in Rossnowlagh. We have put up with this march for many years. Many of us do not like it but we accept it is part of the culture of the Orange Order. We have accepted the march over the years without causing any trouble in Rossnowlagh. I ask for the Good Friday Agreement to be given a chance on this occasion and hope that we can have a full year to see how things develop.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to make time available to discuss the Aer Rianta annual report in view of the Government's restated intention to proceed with an IPO. <Col N="685" /> This should be discussed in conjunction with the Warburg Dillon Read report as they are interrelated. Time was sought previously in this House to discuss the Warburg Dillon Read report but this has not happened. This is an ideal opportunity to discuss all the issues in tandem. I ask the leader to make time available to discuss the matter next week.</P>
      <P>Has the Leader of the House had an opportunity since yesterday to discuss with either the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the deaths of 75 haemophiliacs? Has he requested the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in particular, to arrange that an immediate investigation be carried out by the Garda Síochána? There is a case of criminal negligence to be answered. Apart from the normal tribunal procedure, action needs to be taken by the forces of law and order and this should be done sooner rather than later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views of Senator Manning and others. However, while I welcome Senator Manning's suggestion about emigrants in England, following a report over the past few days about the homeless &ndash; Senator Henry referred to the wonderful work of DÍON &ndash; I sometimes find it a little hypocritical of Members of this House and the other House that they usually ignore emigrant issues and it is only when a report appears in the media that everyone rushes to the barricades. This is not a reflection on the motives of anyone who raised the issue, which I applaud, but DÍON is operating on a budget of IR£750,000. Considering the current difference in sterling, it does not take a mathematician to work out how much money net is going to emigrant welfare from this and indeed previous Administrations. That figure has not changed in over a decade. It is a terrible scandal that emigrants and emigrant welfare organisations are treated in such a cavalier fashion by successive Administrations. This is not the first time I have raised this matter in the House and I will continue to raise the issue because it is a national scandal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach to bear with me on this because it is not often emigrant issues get an airing in this House or the other House. I am asking the Leader of the House, in the context of Senator's Manning's proposal, to encourage a debate on the wider issues of emigration, the funding of emigrant welfare organisations and the submission from the Federation of Irish Societies which has pointed out that DÍON is only able to provide upwards of 50% of the cost of welfare workers in London, Birmingham and other centres of large emigrant populations. This is totally inadequate and a national scandal. I suggest to the Leader that there should be a wider debate on emigrant issues <Col N="686" /> and on the serious underfunding of those who are working to alleviate and eventually eliminate the problem of homelessness and those with psychiatric and many other problems which we have consistently and traditionally exported from the country and swept under the carpet.</P>

      <P>I agree with my colleagues regarding the concerns of parents of deaf children. I agree also with Senator Mooney on the scandalous way in which emigrants are treated. These issues are both national scandals. However, the real national scandal is that a Government with £2 billion surplus funding has decided not to spend the money on deaf children or emigrants abroad because of ideological nonsense foisted on this country by Senator Kett's friend, the Taoiseach, and the Minister for Finance who have lost all touch with reality, as event after event has shown. Members should go to a Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting and talk about the issues to those who could make a difference overnight if they wish and not come in here&mdash;</P>

      <P>I join in Members' calls to take the necessary measures to help restore the body politic to full health, so to speak. We cannot shirk updating our bribery and corruption legislation, lobbyists legislation and other related matters. I agree with my colleagues that an all-party approach would be preferable in that regard. The Government missed an opportunity yesterday to effectively introduce its own lobbyists Bill. If the Bill was allowed to proceed to Committee Stage, the Government could have tabled the necessary raft of amendments which would have effectively made it Government legislation. However, there was no desire to do this and I fear members of the Government are classic didderers and pro<Col N="687" /> crastinators. With respect, we must be seen to deal with this matter now and not postpone it indefinitely. I support the calls for a debate on the Ombudsman's report.</P>

I will also contact the Minister concerned this morning and pass on the strong views of Members. Given our Celtic tiger economy, a small allocation of money should be made available immediately in this regard.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Dardis and others called for a debate on issues in the public arena. I offered yesterday morning to make time available last night to debate my party's amendment, and I congratulate all those who contributed to the debate. I can understand those who were not able to contribute but I do not understand how those who did not bother to contribute can speak here this morning. Serious issues need to be addressed and there was a lot of latitude in the amendment, which was a page and a quarter in length. I asked for the debate to be deferred. I said in my contribution last night that I agree with most of what is contained in the Bill. The amendment sought extra time for the party leaders to discuss the Bill with it being re-introduced in the House by 31 December. That still stands.</P>

      <P>Senators Costello, Bonner, Dardis, Farrell and Manning called for a debate on Northern Ireland. We have had no difficulty meeting requests for such a debate up to now and, if everything goes well at the weekend, we will have such a debate at the earliest possible opportunity. Senators Henry and Norris called on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House for a debate on the programme for the treatment of offenders. I will allow time for such a debate.</P>

      <Col N="688" /> Senators O'Donovan, Finneran, Quinn, Burke and Chambers called for a debate on the Ombudsman's report. As suggested by Senator Quinn and others this morning, we will ensure we have a debate on this matter every year during this Government's term of office. Senators Kett, Bonner and Ormonde called for a debate on funding a minimum disability benefit of £100 per week. Many of this morning's contributions related to matters of disability. We should invite the Minister to the House for a half day's debate on this issue. Senators can pool their ideas on this issue and do something for those in need who require our help. I will allow time for such a debate this session.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd called for a debate on the housing crisis. I will allow time for such a debate, although the matter could be discussed next Thursday in the all-day debate on the economy. I look forward to hearing contributions from all those Senators who have called for such a debate on many occasions. Senator Burke asked the timeframe for the Local Government (No. 2) Bill. The Bill is currently with the Dáil and the Senator might ask the Opposition Whip how long it will be before we get it. As soon as it becomes available it will be taken in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris called for a debate on Tibet. I will allow time for such a debate in the next few weeks. Senator Taylor-Quinn called for a debate on the Aer Rianta report. Perhaps she could raise that matter with the Minister for Finance next Thursday when he comes to the House. If not, I will allow time for such a debate at a later date.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn also called for a debate on matters before the tribunal dealing with hepatitis. This is the most important tribunal. It is in that issue the real scandal lies. I will be sympathetic to requests from Senators on all sides regarding this matter. The value of one life cannot be measured in money. There are many sad stories of the absolutely shameful loss of lives. We must do all in our power to ensure this never happens again. I will allow as much time as is requested to deal with this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), to delete lines 24 and 25 and substitute the following new definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;airport user' means all passengers arriving and departing through the airport, persons importing and exporting or transporting freight through the airport, communities using the airport to develop their region, the state, and persons responsible for the carriage of passengers, freight or mail by air to or from the airport.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason I tabled the amendment is that the definition of &ldquo;airport user&rdquo; in the interpretation section is narrow and confined. The Bill states that &ldquo;airport user&rdquo; means any person responsible for the carriage of passengers, mail or freight by air to or from any airport. The definition does not fully classify airport users, who comprise a broader range of persons or groups. I am concerned that if the definition is not amended or deleted it will be restrictive and could cause difficulties down the road. The definition of &ldquo;airport user&rdquo; should be geared towards the consumer, the ordinary passenger who travels to and from various destinations through airports. He or she should be the No. 1 priority in terms of users.</P>
      <P>The definition implies that airlines are the only airport users and it would be serious to classify airlines as the only category using airports. My amendment proposes a broader definition but I would be quite happy if the definition was removed from the legislation. A broader definition could be substituted by inference or else my proposed definition could be adopted. It is important that the consumer is recognised in the legislation because he or she must have some come back if difficulties arise.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers and businesses which import and export goods through airports also need to be recognised because they are fundamental to the success of airports. The regional implications cannot be underestimated. Many communities focus on airports as central economic cornerstones and use them as vehicles to promote their regions. Agencies charged with developing industry highlight airports as one of the key attractions in promoting regions. People involved in the tourism industry use airports as the key vehicle to promote their region.</P>
      <P>It is quite important that the definition of &ldquo;airport user&rdquo; should be broadened or deleted. The Minister is a pragmatic, matter of fact lady who will recognise the sense of this and take it on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with much of Senator Taylor-Quinn's contribution because the definition is extremely narrow and restrictive and it does not go any way near what I know the Minister wants it to mean. It precludes any public interest dimension. I endorse the catalogue of interests articulated by my colleague but there is no reference, for example, to people with disabilities. Senator Taylor-Quinn suggested the deletion of the definition but if the Minister wishes to retain it, the ordinary English dictionary meaning would allow airports to interpret the term in its broadest sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking in the same <Col N="691" /> spirit. My suggestion is that an ordinary English meaning would allow it to be interpreted in the broadest sense. I took some advice on that and I believe it to be the case. A wide variety of interested parties are not encompassed in the definition and these were mentioned by Senator Taylor-Quinn. For example, disabled passengers are important. Discrimination against people with disabilities has been raised in the House many times recently and was raised very forcefully again earlier. Previous legislation, such as the Irish Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998, and the UK Airports Act, 1986, does not define the term &ldquo;airport user&rdquo;, even though it is widely used in it. I agree forcefully with the sentiments expressed. I believe the Minister will accept that the parliamentary draftsman's definition is too restrictive and narrow and, therefore, I hope she will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the narrowness of the definition. I have no particular obsession with an alternative form of words but it should be left, as Senator Fitzgerald said, to be interpreted as normal English would imply or, alternatively, extended into the community of users well beyond those mentioned. I have had a problem with one other regulator who seems to believe quite passionately that simply by encouraging competition she guarantees good quality service for consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and even more forcefully that of my wife who was with me. It was an absolute embarrassment to believe that some people could arrive into Dublin Airport from O'Hare International Airport and experience such a contrast. For instance, there is building work going on and one must walk through shuttered corridors. It is not beyond the wit of man to paint the shuttering. That implies an indifference to the short-term concerns of one's customers. If Senator Quinn was refurbishing a supermarket, he would not funnel his customers through an undecorated, cheapskate, knocked together tunnel made from cheap timber. I walked through one in Dublin Airport. That is what I mean when I refer to the need to make sure that regulators take everybody involved into consideration, otherwise they forget the basic user.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage we get down to the nitty gritty of legislation but I get a sense that we should stick with the question of the definition of &ldquo;airport user&rdquo; and what way it should be handled. Having listened to Senators Taylor-Quinn and Fitzgerald it seems that the term is so restrictive that the best solution would be to withdraw it and rely on dictionary usage, as Senator Ryan said. On that basis the issue regarding the definition would probably be resolved. It must be so much wider. We want the Bill to last for some time and we cannot really forecast what the situation will be like in five, ten or 15 years time. It would be far too restrictive to insert such detail in the Bill. The Minister would be wise to consider accepting the deletion of the term.</P>

It is not a meaningful exercise to be engaged in, ramming things through on Committee Stage and then running to Report Stage when there is no chance to regroup, rethink or rephrase amendments. I hope the Leader of the House, who is responsible for ordering business, will order Report Stage of the Bill for next week.</P>
      <P>Three amendments have been discussed and each seems to come down in favour of deletion, although I am not sure about Senator Ryan's position. However, Senators Taylor-Quinn and Liam Fitzgerald have taken that view. As several Senators have redefined what is meant in their amendments, I suggest that the House should note the three amendments and during the coming days we will seek a composite wording for Report Stage which would embrace what the Senators have said.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following new definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Regulator' means chairperson of the Commission;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill clearly and specifically relates to regulating airports. In her speech on Second Stage, the Minister repeatedly referred to the regulator. We all know that this regulator is in waiting and is working away in the background, awaiting the passage of this legislation. Given the nature of the Bill, it is simpler, more straightforward and makes much more sense to define clearly who this person is; it is the airport regulator.</P>
      <P>While we recognise that a commission will be established with three people on it and that a chairman will be appointed, it is important that somebody should be deemed to be and identified as the regulator with responsibility for final arbitration. It is important that the chairperson of the commission should be known and referred to as the regulator. It makes common sense.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that sections of the Bill may have been lifted too readily from the Airports Act, 1986. The commission follows an almost identical path to what is contained in that Bill. Let us show our own innovativeness and let us be clear and specific. &ldquo;Regulator&rdquo; is a straightforward term and I am sure the Minister will not have any difficulty with it.</P>

One has already been appointed and the same is happening with the telecommunications regulator. There will be three people of equal standing. There will not be a person who is the chairperson of the three members, which is what the Senator proposes. Senator Taylor-Quinn's amendment states that &ldquo;&lsquo;Regulator' means chairperson of the Commission&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The commission will comprise three men or women who will be equal in status. The purpose of having three members is to do away with the position where one person takes wide-ranging decisions and has almost dictatorial abilities. It takes 15 people to make a decision in Cabinet and it takes the Dáil or Seanad to vote on Oireachtas business. However, I have always thought that it is wrong for one person to be able to decide matters. It is also unfair because on one person's shoulders may rest the whole conduct of important areas of life, areas which we are giving away with increasing frequency and without having corresponding accountability. We are settling that with a Bill in the autumn, however. The <Col N="695" /> regulator will not be the chairperson of the commission. The members will be equal and there will not be a chairperson.</P>

She is head of her Department, she makes the decisions and the buck stops with her because she has the responsibility. The Minister is transferring part of this responsibility to a commission of not more than three people, although it could be one or two. She will appoint one as chairperson. The real problem is the lack of accountability, and that can be found in all walks of life. The buck stops with the Minister but the Minister is now transferring that responsibility. It is important that one person is in a position to take the final responsibility and that should be the chairperson of the commission.</P>

      <P>It is like looking at a glass and deciding whether it is half full or half empty. I look at this issue the other way around. It is wrong to have one person take enormous responsibility for major areas of our life. The reason for having three is to allow for a vote to be taken. The only point of doing all that, which I am very keen to do, is that there would be equality among the three. It is wrong to have just one person responsible in the regulatory role.</P>

      <P>To use a simple analogy, three heads are better than one. I can see where Senator Taylor-Quinn is coming from and I empathise with the sentiment she expressed but in the final analysis we are putting responsibility on three heads. Those three people collectively must shoulder this whole gambit of responsibility that is being passed over to them from the Department. In that context, therefore, it would be much wiser and in the interests of greater accountability. I can see where the Minister is coming from also because if the power is given to one person, that person can invoke dictatorial powers. If we enshrine the word &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; in the Bill, we are legally making that person the chairperson by virtue of the regulator and, therefore, that person is legally, solely and singularly responsible but because of the nature of what the Minister is proposing to do, it would be much wiser, in the interests of good collective management, that we should not enshrine it in the Bill and legally copper-fasten the title of chairperson. Rather, let us have a legal commission with a regulator as part of a three man team.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>(2)In giving such general policy directions provided under <i>subsection (1)</i> the Minister shall have regard to the following policy objectives&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) to foster a strong and competitive Irish airline industry by providing enough airport capacity where it is needed;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) to minimise the impact of airports on the environment generally, and to ensure that land use planning and conservation policies take fully into account both the development needs arising from air<Col N="699" /> ports and the environmental consequences;</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) to make the best use of existing facilities and provide new capacity only when this economically justified;</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) to encourage the use and development of regional airports so that they meet the maximum demand they can attract;</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>) to ensure that all Irish airports continue to maintain the highest standards of safety in accordance with internationally accepted rules and standards;</P>
    <P>(<i>f</i>) to ensure that air transport facilities should not in general be subsidised by the taxpayer or the ratepayer and</P>
    <P>(<i>g</i>) to ensure that airports, whoever their owners, should normally operate as commercial undertakings.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a section that is often contained in legislation and about which I am always wary because it states: &ldquo;The Minister may give such general policy directions to the Commission as he or she considers appropriate to be followed by the Commission in the exercise of its functions&rdquo;. We are endeavouring to put some flesh on the policy areas that should be of concern to the Minister, and we list seven of them in the amendment. They contain, among others, the need to foster a strong and competitive Irish airline industry; to minimise the impact of airports on the environment; to make the best use of existing facilities; to encourage the use and development of regional airports etc. I would be dishonest if I said I intended to spend the day arguing about each of those with the Minister but there is a case to be made for more than just a general policy directive phraseology. Some statement from the Minister at a future stage as to what she believes to be the general policy areas where directives would be issued would be preferable to this somewhat vague formulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We gave consideration to that and to all the ones that were put down. Senator Ryan has listed various activities on which he believes I or some future Minister should give policy directions. The Minister of the day could become involved in giving a growing number of policy segments. Senator Ryan's amendment is intended to be far-reaching but it might turn out to be too prescriptive because it would itemise areas in which the Minister could give policy directions. Important directions which could prove vital to the running of an airport might be omitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We examined other legislation and it is clear this provision is a general one which allows us to move with the times. I do not want a Minister circumscribed in giving directions. Perhaps we could include a term such as <i>inter alia</i> or &ldquo;encompassing areas such as&rdquo; which would clar<Col N="700" /> ify that these directions are only a part of other tasks undertaken by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has provided that a commissioner may be removed from office for stated misbehaviour. I agree with this provision as yesterday we had a dispute about members of the human rights commission who could be dismissed for &ldquo;reasons stated&rdquo; which did not specify misbehaviour, which is a dangerous precedent. This was the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who do not listen and whose unwillingness to accept amend<Col N="702" /> ments I mentioned to the Minister outside the House.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the provision in section 11(10) that a commissioner shall not, for a period of 12 months following his or her resignation, hold employment or act as a consultant where he or she may be likely to use or disclose information. Is the Minister satisfied 12 months is long enough? I would have thought two years would be better. In Britain the provision for members of government is about two years.

I would be cynical about legislating for this because unless it is a person of character, honour and decency who appreciates and recognises the position he or she has left and acts accordingly, no amount of legislation will make a difference. He or she may not take up employment but could be a private consultant to a company, providing them with information. Perhaps a highly honourable person could take up employment immediately and not give information because they recognise the conflict of interest. The provision is not worth the paper it is written on, whether one extends it to two years, leaves it as it is or removes it. It comes down to the inherent honour and decency of the person concerned. One can say it is a protection but if people want to get around this they will. They may not be employed directly but may be private consultants providing information and advice. It is a bit of a nonsense.</P>

We have had terrible experiences in Dublin Corporation &ndash; it is parallel to this so it is relevant to the point &ndash; whereby we lost some of the best and the brightest.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 16, there is a distinct difference between the conditions for election for a commissioner and a person employed by the commission. I believe in equality and fair play for all across the board. Why should a commissioner be discriminated against in regard to elections and an employee of the commission not be? The section states:</P>
      <P>Where a commissioner is&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) nominated to stand as a candidate for election as a member of either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Parliament. . .</P>
      <P>. . . he or she shall thereupon cease to be a member of the Commission.</P>
      <P>However, a person employed by the commission will only cease to hold their position on being elected. Why should a commissioner's position cease on being nominated rather than on being elected? There is a discrepancy.</P>

      <P>I do. This comes up all the time. It is grossly unfair that people in senior positions are being discriminated against. This should apply across the board. Of course, Members of the Oireachtas are discriminated against in every regard. There are some wonderful Members who could serve extremely well in many organisations and boards but they are excluded because of their Oireachtas membership. In this scenario, a commissioner ceases to be a member of the commission, whereas the employee will be seconded from his or her employment. Does the Minister see my point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the combination of the disparities between those at the top and those lower down and between the nomination and the election. The person at the middle level shall be &ldquo;seconded from his or her employment. . . on such nomination or election, or when he or she is regarded as having been elected&rdquo;, whereas the commissioner shall cease to hold office when he or she is nominated. The section states that where a commissioner is nominated as a Member of Seanad Éireann, &ldquo;he or she shall thereupon cease to be a member of the Commission&rdquo;. This is double edged, in that there is a difference between being nominated and being elected and a difference between the two strands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I appreciate the commissioner is on a good salary, the reality is that the commissioner also has responsibilities. The Minister knows as well as I do that nomination means nothing &ndash;<Col N="706" /> getting elected is what it is all about. A person who is nominated but not elected is left sitting high and dry as he or she is neither a commissioner nor a public representative. That is a rather invidious position.

    <P>It is vitally important that an amendment of this nature be included in this section. I am aware of <Col N="709" /> scenarios where people were legally obliged to declare interests in a variety of areas. They did so and as the law stands everything appeared above board, yet they would have had an active interest in land and property acquisitions and would have been closely involved at certain levels. However, the focus of declarations of interest was so narrow that they were not included as they were not registered owners of the lands in question when development of those lands was being considered. There was a clear vested interest in reality, but that was not declared as there was no legal obligation to do so. This amendment relates to a person &ldquo;considering or in the process of acquiring land or property&rdquo;, which may seem to be going too far, but I have very valid reasons for tabling the amendment.</P>

      <P>This section states that &ldquo;the Commission may make regulations imposing a levy (&ldquo;levy&rdquo;), to meet but not to exceed the estimated operating costs and expenses of the Commission. . . &rdquo;. I am a little concerned about this. The Bill transfers to the commission some of the work carried out by the Minister and her Department and the commission will have to generate its income from that work. The imposition of this levy will mean, I presume, an additional expense on the airports&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope this will not cause greater financial pressure, particularly for airlines and airports which might be in slight difficulty or finding it difficult to stay in financially safe water. This cost was previously carried by the Department but it is now being transferred to the commission. The airports did not previously carry this cost. What is the estimated cost of operating the commission? What type of levies will be considered? How much money will be extracted from the airports and how will that be decided? It is important that airport managers should have an idea of the additional expenditure that will arise in their operations each year and how they will allocate that within the various structures in the airport.</P>

      <P>It would if they had more than one million passengers. If airports such as Farranfore, Donegal, Galway and Sligo have over one million passengers per year in the future, the provision will apply. At present, it applies only to the three State airports because they have a throughput of more than one million passengers annually. Of the three, Shannon Airport is of great interest to me and, indeed, the Minister. I am concerned about this provision. Dublin Airport is a money spinner but Shannon is a different matter. Cork Airport is also developing strongly. I am sure the manager of Shannon Airport would like a rough idea of the annual cost that will arise <Col N="713" /> in relation to the services provided by the commission so provision can made for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It would. This section provides that the commission may by regulation impose an annual levy on certain undertakings in order to fund the operating costs of the office. It will raise only enough money to pay its costs. It is likely that only Aer Rianta and the Irish Aviation Authority will pay the levy as the other regulated entities, for example, the air carriers and the travel trade, already pay a licence fee, under separate legislation, for the services provided. It will, however, be a matter for the commission as to how and on whom it wants to impose the levy. In Britain, there is a levy of 20p per passenger for non-designated airports and 53p for the four designated airports, Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Manchester. The regulations as made must be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The important thing is that the commission must be paid for, and it will not be paid for by the Government. It must be paid for by those who operate the airports. The Government envisages that will be Aer Rianta and the Irish Aviation Authority. It will be a matter for the commission, but it will only raise enough money to pay its way, it will not be a profit making body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We always ask for feasibility studies and reports into the viability of propositions. Surely the Minister and the Department carried out an assessment of the possibilities inherent in this transfer of responsibility from the Minister to the commission. Does the Minister have an estimate of the cost of running the commission on an annual basis? There is no point saying that the commission will decide. Nothing is done these days without preparing reports and feasibility studies first. There should be some clue what the cost will be. I appreciate that Aer Rianta and the IAA will deal with this because they are the bodies covered in the remit. As the other airports expand, however, they may also become involved. We should have some indication of future running costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a figure because part of the remit of the commission will be to take into account the economic analysis of its study of the airports. This Bill allows the commission to do that. It was the same with the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996. No one in the industry complained because it was <Col N="714" /> quite a small levy. The energy commission is the same. No one ever said to me that they did not like the way the levy was operated. The commission is not a profit making organisation but it must cover its costs. By law the regulator will be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The commission will have to appear before a statutory committee of the Houses when called and will have to give a forecast, an economic analysis, and lay out the programme for work. That ensures accountability. It is provided for in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave us the figures for England &ndash; levies of 20p and 53p. In that scenario, an airport with over one million passengers will pay a levy of £200,000. When the levy is 53p the figure will increase to £530,000. Considerable sums of money are involved for airports such as Shannon and Cork. It will not have the same economic impact on Dublin Airport because of the volume of traffic and the rate of turn-over.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Costello. It is a valid point. While I appreciate that property is an exorbitant price, particularly in Dublin, I take the Minister's point and hope that it will be located in State-owned property. There are many State Departments in leased property which cost exorbitant sums of money annually. It would be more prudent and judicious to enter a lease purchase arrangement with a non-State operation <i>versus</i> paying back a loan on the purchase of a property, in the interests of the commission. The preferred option is to get State property, not necessarily property leased by Office of Public Works&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - UN Congress on Crime Prevention.</Title>
    <P>Dr. Henry: I welcome the Minister of State to the House and hope she will take note of this important debate.</P>
    <P>The Tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders took place in Vienna in April 2000. These important conferences take place only once every five years. The key issues discussed included the fight against corruption, including the problems of money laundering on an international scale and corruption in police and judicial systems and ways to combat these activities. Transnational organised crime, particularly that involving the trafficking of women, was discussed. In the treatment of offenders part of the programme, the importance of restorative justice was discussed.</P>
    <P>It is important to discuss the treatment of offenders. In this country we are inclined to think the only treatment is the imprisonment of offenders. I was dismayed at the announcement that yet more prison places will be built with no cognisance taken of the numerous reports which suggest using other methods to deal with offenders. I recognise that the refurbishment of prisons is necessary and that facilities are required for juveniles, in particular. However, I am dismayed at the Minister's plan to build more prison places at great cost in the future. Everyone knows that once places are available they will be filled.</P>
    <P>Restorative justice is both an old and new concept. A comprehensive definition of restorative justice is that it is the process whereby all the par<Col N="721" /> ties with a stake in a particular offence come together to resolve collectively how to deal with the aftermath of the offence and its implications for the future. It has recently gained interest among lawmakers and justice practitioners here and throughout the world. Attempts are being made to bring restorative justice programmes into our prisons. Victim-offender mediation programmes are now well established in Canada, the United States of America, England, Germany, France, Austria, Norway, Finland and in other countries.</P>
    <P>Crime is primarily an offence against human relationships and a violation of a law. Restorative justice recognises the importance of the violation of persons and relationships and tries to make things as right as possible afterwards. We can never make things totally right but we can try to make things as right as possible afterwards. The situation of the crime should be used to repair the damage done to the victim and to society by the offence as soon as possible after the crime.</P>
    <P>I regret the long delays in the courts system in dealing with crime. However, if the offender is co-operative &ndash; not all offenders will be co-operative &ndash; the situation should be used to help the offender to learn a new way of behaving in the community. Following imprisonment there is an 80% recidivist rate, therefore, it is difficult to consider imprisonment as a good method of dealing with offenders. Naturally there are offenders who pose significant safety risks and these are most difficult to deal with. However, even they should be exposed to the impact their crime has had on the victim.</P>
    <P>I could say much more on the subject but, in view of the time constraints, I will refer Senators to the United Nations booklet on restorative justice, which is well worthwhile reading.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the composition of the membership of the Irish delegation which attended the congress in Vienna. This limited our participation in the conference. While I have the greatest respect for the diplomats who are based in Vienna and who attended the conference &ndash; it is my good fortune to be a personal friend of Ambassador Thelma Doran, and I am also very impressed by the officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; why were there no judges, prison officials, criminologists or others who work at the coalface of crime and its consequences there? These people were members of other delegations and were probably in the best position to contribute to the debate. Also, if we had sent judges, lawyers, prison officers and others interested in this area, they would have had a good opportunity to meet colleagues from other countries and to learn from their experiences.</P>
    <P>Canada's representatives introduced a major new paragraph to the debate document which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Canada proposes to add the following new paragraphs after paragraph 25:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> We commit ourselves to formulating restorative justice legislation, policies, procedures and programmes that are respectful of the rights, needs and interests of victims, youthful and adult, offenders, communities and all other parties and that promote a culture favourable to mediation and other restorative justice processes among law enforcement, judicial and social authorities, as well as local communities, and we also commit ourselves to providing appropriate training for those implementing such policies.</P>
    <P>We invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to formulate United Nations basic principles and standards to guide States in the fair and effective use of medication and other restorative justice processes.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's response to these proposals on restorative justice and the reasons for the limited make-up of the personnel in the Irish delegation.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace): On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to discuss the main deliberations and outcomes of the Tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, which was convened on 10 to 17 April 2000, in Vienna.</P>
    <P>The function of this and previous congresses is to provide a forum in which member states may exchange views and experiences on law and policy development, identify emerging trends and issues in crime prevention and criminal justice and provide advice and comments to the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. I assure Senator Henry that senior officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and our diplomats based in Vienna attended the congress to ensure Ireland's full involvement in these useful exchanges.</P>
    <P>The tenth congress's main theme was Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty-first Century, which involved deliberations on four substantive agenda items, namely, promoting the rule of law and strengthening the criminal justice system, international co-operation in combating transnational organised crime, keeping pace with new developments to ensure effective crime prevention and accountability and fairness in the justice process for offenders and victims.</P>
    <P>Each of these themes was the subject of vigorous debate in workshops and reports of these debates were presented to and adopted at plenary. By far the most significant outcome at the congress, however, was the adoption with the full support of Ireland of the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice. This declaration sets out the main priorities for member states in tackling crime, nationally and internationally and in par<Col N="723" /> ticular affirms a high priority to the completion of negotiations on the draft United Nations convention against transnational organised crime and related protocols.</P>
    <P>The Vienna Declaration also calls on member states to introduce, where appropriate, national, regional and international action plans in support of victims of crime such as mechanisms for mediation and restorative justice and sets the year 2002 as a target date for states to review their relevant practices. In this regard, the declaration encourages the development of restorative justice policies, procedures and programmes that are respectful of the rights, needs and interests of victims, offenders, communities and all other parties.</P>
    <P>Restorative justice has already found favour in a number of jurisdictions in recent years and has largely been applied to young offenders and less serious offences. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform also considers that the concept has real possibilities and, as a consequence, when he became Minister he ordered a thorough reappraisal of the Children Bill, 1996, with the emphasis on introducing into our law the most up to date and sophisticated measures for dealing with juvenile justice that took account of best international practice. The result can be seen in that Bill which contains some of the most comprehensive and innovative provisions on restorative justice anywhere in the world. These provisions are realised through restorative justice conferencing measures involving juvenile liaison officers or probation and welfare officers as well as restorative justice cautioning measures also involving the Garda Síochána. They represent a new way of dealing with young offenders that is not intended as an easy option but rather aims to help the offender to face up to the consequences of his or her offending. For example, mediation between offender and victim may be a feature of restorative conferencing with the offender often apologising and making reparation to the victim. Much more can be involved, however, depending on the circumstances such as restriction on movement, school attendance, counselling and participation in community activities.</P>
    <P>A pilot scheme in the Dublin region operated by the community relations section of the Garda Síochána has shown encouraging results and has vindicated the Minister's initial optimism. Following the training of juvenile liaison officers in mediation skills, approximately 30 restorative justice conferences and cautionings have occurred and the Minister is informed that victims and offenders found the process very rewarding. The Minister's commitment to restorative justice goes much further than the Children Bill. He recently approved a three-year pilot project involving a partnership between the Tallaght Mediation Service and the Probation and Welfare Service with funding of up to £280,000. A six-phase mediation model which will allow the victim to tell of his or her experiences and to hear how the offender <Col N="724" /> regards the offence has been developed. A reparation agreement may also form part of the overall process.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also funded a similar co-operative venture between the Probation and Welfare Service and the Nenagh Community Reparation Project. This venture aims to increase the involvement of the community in positive activity designed to reduce crime and minimise repeat offending by confronting the offender with the impact of the crime on others, in particular, the victim. There are clearly many advantages in exploiting restorative justice initiatives but it must also be recognised that restorative justice has its limitations &ndash; in a proportion of crimes no offender is ever identified. Moreover, full respect should always be given to the procedural rights of victims. Concern has, on occasion, been expressed that victims, some of whom would regard meeting the offender face to face as complete anathema, may feel pressurised into opting for restorative justice.</P>
    <P>While the Minister recognises and has acted upon the positive elements of restorative justice, the concept cannot be regarded as a cure-all for crime or the criminal justice system. Rather, the Minister sees it as an important alternative to traditional criminal trial and punishment for, in particular, youth crime as identified by Senator Henry. It should be implemented in tandem rather than as a replacement for the existing criminal justice process.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Henry for giving us this opportunity to discuss this very important issue.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and look forward to hearing his reply.</P>
      <P>The Caragh River in County Kerry is well known and is famous as a great salmon river. A great deal of concern was expressed about the future of this river at two large public meetings held in Killorglin and at others held by the Caragh Action Committee which made representations to Members representing their area on this issue. These concerns relate to title portions of the river, access to the river, the river bed, Seefin's intentions and maps showing ownership, the fact that a grant was rescinded and reactivated and their traditional rights.</P>
      <P>It might be best if I read into the record a letter which the Caragh Action Committee sent to the Minister and all local public representatives. It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thank you for your letter dated 12th May 2000 in which you set out a verbatim reiteration of your unyielding stand made to the delegation from this committee when they met with you in Dingle. The letter clearly does not address the issues brought before you and your department regarding title, tidal and corporate ownership of the Caragh River. It seems to sidestep the definitive response to enforce a <Col N="725" /> declarative statement which, we suppose, is meant to force the community of Caragh River to accept facts which are not verified.</P>
    <P>The vast amount of inconsistencies surrounding this issue are growing as time goes on. You stated that TAM did extensive examinations of Seefin's right to the Caragh River and yet the grant of £167,000 was rescinded. It would seem logical that, given the teams of legal and fisheries experts, that the entire grant would not have been recalled and Seefin would have been able to commence the renovation of the portion above Caragh Bridge some time ago. It is inconceivable that any business enterprise would sacrifice profits for a prolonged period of time unless other means had to be provided to secure their title or even a portion of the river.</P>
    <P>You stated in your letter &ldquo;the development scheme now approved does not involve the most contentious areas of dispute associated with the original application.&rdquo; Are we to assume that is a situation that is permanently dissolved or temporarily put on hold to appease and lull the local community into agreement or a great sense of apathy? We seem to recall that you semi-promised a written definition to all our questions and that the tidal portion of the river was not a matter for concern. To date that assurance is not in writing.</P>
    <P>Many questions were brought to the attention of the Department of the Marine and Fisheries in the person of Michael Woods and now yourself. There was a letter from Ellen Roche, EU Projects Manager (enclosed for your review) with misgivings on the motives and corporate ownership of varied companies in the business of purchasing rivers, lakes and the operation of game fisheries. Another letter, from Seán Ó hArgain, Cathaoirleach, IRD Waterville Ltd, also expresses grave concerns regarding Seefin and the ultimate use or misuse of their natural resource. We are also aware, as we are sure you are, that the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 deals with the acquisition of certain fisheries for development. Is it possible that it is within this programme that Seefin miraculously obtained title to the Caragh River. We were also given to understand that it was government policy to purchase, obtain or secure any natural resources that became available for the public domain. Why did that not apply to the Caragh River? When it was supposedly sold to Seefin, why was it not purchased and given to the local community to operate and nurture?</P>
    <P>We hope that you understand that the Caragh community is not trying to obstruct or defile your Department, but we feel that we are entitled to just and honest answers. To date that has not been the case.</P>
    <P>The document referred to in the letter and signed by Ellen Roche, the EU projects manager in the tourism angling unit of the Department of Tour<Col N="726" /> ism, Sport and Recreation, shows that they had concerns as it states:</P>
    <P>I have been advised recently by the South West Regional Fisheries Board that there may be some negative feedback in relation to this project. I appraised the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources &ndash; the Minister's press officer and the inland fisheries division.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that some of the individuals involved in Seefin Fisheries Limited have plans to acquire and/or co-operatively manage other game fisheries in Kerry and are in negotiation with fishery owners at this time. It appears to me that they wish to build a critical mass of strategic fisheries for development and exploitation for tourism angling. There appears to be some confusion in relation to the role of the TAM regarding these negotiations. There is no application under TAM to acquire and/or develop the fisheries which are currently under negotiation, i.e. Waterville Lakes. It appears that an application for BES funding in relation to these fisheries has been successful.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter on behalf of the people of Caragh and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan): I thank the Senator for giving me this opportunity to address the House on the subject of the Caragh river and the tourism angling measure or TAM of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994 to 1999.</P>
    <P>Under the TAM a total of £18 million was made available to 157 projects over the period of the National Development Plan, 1994-99. The objective of the TAM was to upgrade our game, coarse and sea angling facilities to the best international standards with a view to increasing substantially tourist angling and revenue and to the creation of sustainable jobs, particularly in more remote and disadvantaged areas where the majority of our prime fisheries are located. The improved facilities are available for the benefit of local and visiting anglers, thereby ensuring economic and social benefits accrue to local communities.</P>
    <P>The TAM represented an unprecedented opportunity to provide significant and much needed investment in the inland fisheries sector. The benefits which have accrued from TAM are to be seen in many locations around the country and there is provision under the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006 for continued investment in angling in the sum of £24 million which will be allocated through the regional operational programmes.</P>
    <P>I am aware that TAM related developments on the Caragh river have been the subject of controversy locally and that the Caragh Action Committee has been particularly active in bringing its <Col N="727" /> concerns in relation to TAM funding for the Caragh river to my attention and to the attention of my Department. In fact I met with the committee in April this year in order to listen to their concerns at first hand.</P>
    <P>The position is that TAM funding has been made available for two projects on the Caragh river. Both of the successful applicants were from the private sector. The first project was proposed by a company called Chapwell Limited and relates to the upper Caragh. This project comprised a total of £41,000 of development work and grant aid of 50% of eligible expenditure has been made available. The second project was proposed by a company called Seefin Limited and relates to the lower Caragh. This project comprised acquisition costs of £250,000 for which grant aid of 20% of eligible expenditure has been made available and development costs of £70,000 for which grant aid of 50% of eligible expenditure has been made available.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for assistance under the TAM applicants were required to demonstrate that the fisheries in question would be qualified to be Bord Fáilte branded fisheries, be capable of attracting additional foreign visiting anglers, be readily available for tourist use, generate economic benefit and additional employment and be in harmony with the environment and the aquatic habitat.</P>
    <P>Decisions in relation to funding of individual projects under the TAM are a matter for the TAM management committee which is assisted by a technical and evaluation committee comprised of recognised experts with substantial fisheries development experience. The procedures prior to awarding grant aid to an applicant involved a detailed assessment of the proposal from the technical and development perspectives. In addition to complying with the eligibility criteria for funding under the scheme, the project promoters were required to prove clear title to the fishery being developed.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Seefin project the TAM management committee approved grant aid of £167,500 for the acquisition of the lower Caragh fishery subject to Seefin proving that it had title to the fishery. This offer of grant aid was later withdrawn as Seefin was not able prove title to the fishery which was the subject of the conditional approval of the TAM committee. Subsequently, the promoters of the Seefin project submitted a revised application in respect of that part of the fishery where title was clearly held by Seefin and the revised proposal was approved by the TAM committee in June 1999 and the letter <Col N="728" /> of offer was accepted by Seefin in December 1999.</P>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board has operational responsibility for the TAM support unit which implements the decisions of the TAM management committee. The Central Fisheries Board informs me that its legal advisers have confirmed that Seefin purchased clear and marketable title from the previous owners of the fishery and that payment of the £50,000 grant aid in respect of acquisition has been made to Seefin. The central board also informs me that as a result of the support from TAM the Caragh river system will be significantly developed and be open to tourist anglers until 2010 and that the owners of both the upper and lower Caragh fisheries have indicated that local anglers will have access to the fisheries at non-peak times at special rates. I also understand that Seefin is including local groups and landowners in consultations regarding its development plan.</P>
    <P>I understand the concerns of local anglers regarding the development of fisheries which are in private ownership and the effects which they perceive this as having on other fishing rights. However, due regard must be had for the rights of the private owners of the fisheries in question and these rights must be respected. I do not propose to enter into any discussions regarding ownership of the various parts of the Caragh river. In cases of dispute or lack of clarity such issues regarding ownership are best left to legal advisers, the Land Registry records and the courts, if necessary. However, in the case of the Seefin project I understand the most contentious areas of the river have not been included in the project which has been approved by the TAM management committee. Accordingly, I hope it will prove possible for the project promoters and the local angling interests to come together to agree mutually acceptable working arrangements regarding access to the fishery which would be in harmony with the objective of attracting visiting anglers to the area.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that development of fisheries such as on the Caragh river through public and private funding can only serve to bring social and economic benefits to local communities. It is through developing and promoting the angling product that we can best achieve the virtuous circle of further development being funded from revenue. In this context private ownership of fisheries is compatible with the sustainable development of inland fisheries for the national benefit.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 2.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 30 May 2000.</P>
