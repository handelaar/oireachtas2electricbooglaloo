      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to allocate additional emergency funding towards the Mozambique flooding disaster.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In the light of the failed attempt by the EU to impose a candidate for the managing directorship of the International Monetary Fund who is clearly unacceptable to the international community, the need for the Minister for Finance to lead his colleagues towards a situation where nominations for such posts are made on merit and not on the national or regional origin of the candidate.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The proposed Order of Business is No. 1, statements on nursing in Ireland, which will be taken between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and other Senators 15 minutes. Senators may share time. There will be a sos between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. No. 3, statements on Sellafield, will be taken between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and other Senators 15 minutes. Senators may share time. As the Government Whip, Senator Fitzgerald, is always anxious to facilitate requests and be helpful, statements on a national women's day have been deferred to another day. They will be taken during Independents' Private Members' time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope statements on a national women's day will not be deferred inordinately and that the House will have an opportunity to debate this very serious matter. I wish to refer to two items on the Order Paper. Will the Deputy Leader undertake to resume No. 4, statements on Northern Ireland, shortly? An undertaking was given the last day that the debate would not conclude. There are many Senators who would like to address the issue, which is at a very fluid stage. This is the right time to express our thoughts.</P>
      <P>I wish to be helpful but I have received a large number of inquiries about the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998. People were given much hope that it would make a difference. In the absence of the Leader of the House yesterday, the Deputy Leader did not seize the day. Will he give a clear indication, either today or next week, when the Bill will be taken?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. I understand there will be statements on a national women's day on International Women's Day next week. This is very satisfactory. I support Senator Manning's call for a resumption of statements on Northern Ireland. The debate last week was useful and I hope there will be further contributions next week.</P>
      <P>I seek a debate soon on EU Commissioner David Byrne's White Paper on the proposed EU food commission, the establishment of which will be extremely important to us in Ireland. It would be worthwhile taking the time to study and debate it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Henry's request for a debate on the White Paper on the proposed EU food commission. Item 18, motion No. 7, in the name of the Labour Party reads, &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to publish a White Paper on Early Childhood Education&rdquo;. At 81%, EU figures show Ireland well down the graph in terms of EU and OECD countries which have achieved the target second level education rate of 90%. This needs to be debated. It seems that we are coasting along on the view that we are the young professionals and the educated young Europeans, despite the fact that in very large areas of the country the numbers of drop-outs and early school leavers are enormous and despite the lack of resources, a psychological service and a pre-school system of education, access to which can only be gained by those who can afford it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible for the Minister for Arts, Culture, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, to come into the House to <Col N="771" /> explain what is happening with the broadcasting Bill? I was alarmed to read in the media in the past week that RTÉ would no longer be involved with Digico, the private company formed to deal with terrestrial television. In recent years there have many discussions on this matter at the Oireachtas joint committee. Major difficulties are being experienced in County Donegal with television reception and deflectors. It was understood that following the introduction of competition a number of companies, including Digico, would be provided with licences. From my research it appears that terrestrial television would be the most appropriate option in County Donegal and we were assured by RTÉ that the cost involved would be very reasonable. It alarms me therefore to read that RTÉ will only be involved in providing a network for this private company. The Minister should come into the House to explain what is happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Bonner's call for a debate on the Broadcasting Bill, 1999. It appears that the Minister has done a U-turn and set the good work of that committee at nought. It would be important that the Minister would come before the House and give us an exposé on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Senator Manning, it is proposed that the statements on a national women's day will take place at an early date. Senator Henry is correct in that it is the Independent Senators' intention to take it during their Private Members' time on International Women's Day.</P>
      <P>It was agreed that the statements on Northern Ireland would be left open ended and that they would resume, and I would agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it would be appropriate to keep this matter under continuous review in view of the pace of events. We will try to take statements again at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>I regard the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998, as a serious matter. We all are concerned about the flooding of the River Shannon and the difficulties there. I think there would be general agreement that the best way to handle the situation would be through a single authority. As Senators will be aware, the House has completed Second Stage of the Bill and I hope we can take Committee Stage at an early date.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry asked about the EU White Paper. One possible way of dealing with this might be to ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to investigate the possibility of the Commissioner coming to the House. There are precedents for that. We have had European Commissioners here before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Senator Costello's query about item 18, motion 7, regarding the White Paper on Early Childhood Education, perhaps one way to deal <Col N="772" /> with this would be to have a wide ranging debate on education because there have been calls for other aspects of education to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator McDonagh, who yesterday raised a query regarding the White Paper on Adult Education, I understand that the document in question is at an advanced stage of preparation and should be available within the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Bill, 1999, is with the Select Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language. Obviously when it completes its passage through the Dáil, it will come to the Seanad when there will be an opportunity to raise these issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>I welcome the Minister for Health and Children to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Seanad Éireann for giving me this opportunity to make a comprehensive statement on nursing. This is the first opportunity I have had to do so following my appointment as Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The first topic I wish to address is the nursing shortage. It is generally overlooked that the number of nurses on the active register of An Bord Altranais is at an all time high at 50,544. Between 1990 and 1998, the number of whole-time equivalent nursing staff employed in the public health service increased by 8%. The end of 1998 figure of 26,695 whole-time equivalents represents over 31,000 individuals due to the very significant numbers who have opted to work in job sharing or part-time arrangements. In addition, significant resources have been invested to facilitate general practitioners in employing practice nurses in their surgeries. There are now several hundred nurses working in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the number of qualified nursing staff in employment is now at an all time high, the transition from the traditional apprenticeship model of nurse education to the diploma-based programme has impacted on the availability of nurses. The service contribution of students trained under the traditional model has been replaced by a skill mix of registered nurses and non-nursing personnel. Ultimately, the service contribution of the apprentice students will be replaced by some 1,525 staff nurses and 662 non-nursing personnel. About 1,460 replacement staff nurse posts and 630 non-nursing posts have been approved to date. While this has enhanced the quality of nursing care through the creation of additional nursing posts in hospitals, it has had the effect of absorbing the pool of surplus nurses <Col N="773" /> that existed when student nurses were part of the rostered workforce.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that in 1993-4 when the first diploma-based programme was being planned, there was increasing resistance from the nursing profession to maintaining a high student intake at a time when nurses on registration were finding it difficult to find employment. This issue was highlighted by An Bord Altranais in 1994 in a report which referred to a general contraction in nurse employment both at home and abroad. In 1990 the Department commissioned a study of nursing personnel which was presented to the Department in 1995. This report recommended a gradual reduction in the number of student nurses up to the year 2000.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that there is now a general shortage of nurses not only in Ireland but in the United States, Britain and most other European countries. Against this background, it is encouraging that there has been a net inflow of nurses to Ireland in recent years. Data maintained by An Bord Altranais show that in 1996, the inflow was 939 nurses while the outflow was 1,079 nurses. By 1998, however, the number coming in had increased to 1,400 while the number leaving had decreased to 850. Provisional inflow figures for 1999 of 3,171 represent a dramatic increase over 1998. This trend proves that Ireland continues to be competitive when it comes to recruiting nurses from abroad.</P>
    <P>My Department is in discussion with the relevant Departments and with An Bord Altranais regarding entry visas/work permits for nurses recruited from outside the European Union or European Economic Area. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that there are no unnecessary barriers to entry.</P>
    <P>The most recent survey of nursing vacancies, carried out by the Health Service Employers Agency related to the position at the end of September 1999 and found that there were 1,180 staff nurse vacancies in gross terms. This was the most comprehensive report to date and covered all agencies and nursing disciplines. The net figure when adjustments are made for the utilisation of agency nurses and overtime working was 428.16.</P>
    <P>The results confirmed again that there is not a nationwide problem regarding the availability of nurses and that difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area. While some nurses have always moved from Dublin to other parts of the country, investment in hospitals and the development of regional specialties in recent years have increased demand for nurses outside the Dublin area. Within Dublin, issues such as housing costs, traffic problems and lack of car parking facilities have been cited as disincentives to the recruitment and retention of nurses. However, these issues are not unique to nurses or to the health service.</P>
    <P>Nurse recruitment is carried out on an ongoing basis in most hospitals and the level of vacancies <Col N="774" /> fluctuates accordingly. At any given time, significant numbers of nurses would be in the process of being appointed by employers or moving from one employment to another.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that OECD health data for 1998 show that Ireland is significantly out of line with other European countries in relation to the very high ratio of nurses per hospital bed employed here. We have 1.26 nurses per bed while France has 0.42.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to initiatives aimed at attracting applicants to study nursing. My predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, increased the number of nurse training places by 153 between 1998 and 1999. This was the first increase in places since the diploma programme was introduced in 1994. Some 3,100 student nurses are in training at present. The 2000 intake will be 1,500, an increase of 300 over 1999. This increased figure was agreed with the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the recent nurses' strike. A further 20 places are available on a new direct entry midwifery programme which will be introduced on a pilot basis next June.</P>
    <P>In 1999, following a local and national recruitment campaign costing £400,000 and funded by the Department, the number of applicants increased by over 40% over 1998. This resulted in the largest number of direct entrants to nursing for several years. A total of 1,215 training places were filled in 1999, including record intakes of students to psychiatric and mental handicap nurse training.</P>
    <P>Other measures which have been taken include the annual maintenance grant for nursing students &ndash; which is not subject to a means test &ndash; which has been increased from £2,500 to £3,250, almost double that which the average student receives in third level education, and that is a factor which should be borne in mind when we compare like with like. The rate will increase again to £3,325 with effect from 1 April 2000. In addition, allowances for external clinical placements, books and uniforms are also being increased. The range of leaving certificate subjects that may be presented by an applicant for admission to the nursing diploma programme has been expanded. The requirement to have a foreign language in the leaving certificate has been removed.</P>
    <P>While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, who take their own initiatives in this regard, a range of initiatives have been taken or are being progressed with a view to stabilising the situation and, where possible, improving it. These initiatives include the following: arrangements have been agreed with the nursing unions to allow more favourable assimilation arrangements on to pay scales for nurses taking up both permanent and temporary appointments; a significantly improved regime of allowances in respect of nurses working in <Col N="775" /> specialised areas such as operating theatres and intensive care units has been introduced; discussions with the nursing unions are continuing in relation to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff; standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced following agreement with the nursing unions; health service employers have been asked to examine the possibilities in relation to the introduction of term time working as an option for staff with family commitments; and the availability of return to work courses for qualified nurses who have been out of the workforce is being reviewed with a view to maximising uptake.</P>
    <P>Another initiative is that my Department is engaged in discussions with health agencies in relation to the provision of specialist nursing courses at centres outside Dublin. As a result, ten students commenced a one year higher diploma in specialist nursing in Letterkenny General Hospital in January 2000 and six students commenced a higher diploma in nursing, critical care, in University College Hospital Galway, and a further course is planned for Waterford Regional Hospital. In addition an anti-bullying policy has been prepared and agreed with the nursing unions and was published in December 1999.</P>
    <P>The promotional structure in nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. A study of the nursing and midwifery resource by the nursing policy division of the Department of Health and Children commenced in 1998 with the primary purpose of forecasting future nursing and midwifery resource needs. Following on from this, a national study on turnover in nursing and midwifery has been commissioned by the Department through the Health Research Board and awarded to the department of nursing studies, NUI, Cork.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing recommended that the Department of Health and Children, health service providers and nursing organisations examine the development of appropriate systems to determine nursing staff levels. The need to address skill mix issues was also highlighted in the report of the Commission on Nursing. These recommendations are included in the priority action plan agreed with the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike. It has been agreed that these issues will be addressed by a joint committee representative of nursing unions and health service employers. This committee is in the process of being established.</P>
    <P>These initiatives represent a very significant effort by my Department to improve the situation. In the longer term, it is hoped that the substantial increase in the number of student places will provide enough registered nurses to fill all vacancies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> I avail of the opportunity presented by this morning's proceedings to bring Senators up to date on what has been achieved to date in relation to the implementation of the report of the Commission on Nursing since nursing issues were last debated in this House around the time of the first ever nurses' strike last October. My predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, predicted correctly at the time that the commission's report would feature in the settlement of the strike.</P>
    <P>Now that the long running nurses' pay dispute has finally been resolved, my absolute priority in the nursing area is to press ahead with the agenda for change recommended by the Commission on Nursing. This will be done in partnership with the key stakeholders involved, including the nursing unions.</P>
    <P>The commission has set out a comprehensive framework for addressing the real underlying problems in nursing and midwifery. Its wide-ranging recommendations take full account of the realities within which nursing must be sustained and developed as a key profession in the health services. The implementation of the fundamental structural reforms advocated by the commission will transform the way in which the nursing profession is regulated, educated and developed. Exciting new clinical career pathways will be introduced and nurses and midwives will be provided with enhanced opportunities for professional development.</P>
    <P>As part of the settlement of the nurses' dispute, agreement was reached between my Department and the nursing unions on an action plan setting out the objectives to be achieved over the next two years in implementing certain core recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. The Government, for its part, has provided £10 million for initiatives to be undertaken this year under the agreed action plan.</P>
    <P>Since the action plan was agreed last November considerable progress has been made to date in implementing its provisions. A monitoring committee has been established to review progress on a quarterly basis on the implementation of the Commission on Nursing report. This committee is composed of representatives of my Department, health service employers, the nursing unions and An Bord Altranais. This partnership approach, which was proposed by the commission, will facilitate constructive engagement between the key stakeholders in progressing the huge agenda for change recommended by the commission.</P>
    <P>The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery has also been established. This new independent statutory body has responsibility for the development of a new clinical career pathway for nurses and midwives, involving the creation of clinical specialist and advanced practitioner posts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> In response to the nursing shortage, the action plan, as I previously indicated, provides for an increase of 300 additional training places this year on the nursing registration-diploma programmes. The intention is that a total of 1,500 training places will be available &ndash; 1,000 in general nursing, 300 in psychiatric nursing and 200 in mental handicap nursing.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to three important new developments that form a central plank of my Department's strategy for ensuring that the additional training places are provided. A new integrated school of general and psychiatric nursing is being developed by the Western Health Board at Castlebar General Hospital - St. Mary's Hospital with an annual intake of 50 nursing students. This new school will be linked to the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>The school of general nursing at Tralee General Hospital operated by the Southern Health Board is being redesignated as a pre-registration nursing education school. It will have an annual intake of 45 students and will be linked to the Institute of Technology in Tralee. Some of the students assigned to the school in Tralee will undertake their clinical placements at Bantry General Hospital.</P>
    <P>The North Eastern Health Board regional school of psychiatric nursing is also being reactivated. This school, which will be located at St. Brigid's Hospital, Ardee and St. Davnet's Hospital, Monaghan will have an annual intake of 25 students. The third level educational partner will be Dundalk Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently engaged in negotiations with a number of existing schools of nursing with the specific objective of securing additional training places at those schools. I am confident there will be a successful outcome to these negotiations and that the target of 300 extra places will be achieved across the three pre-registration nursing disciplines.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the success of last year's recruitment drive, which resulted in the filling of the largest ever number of places on the nursing diploma programmes. In view of the success of that campaign, further funding totalling some £400,000 was made available to the various schools of nursing throughout the country late last year to enable them to undertake local marketing campaigns in their catchment areas aimed at promoting nursing as a career. I understand from the Nursing Careers Centre that it has received more than 5,000 applications for nurse training this year. This means that there are more than three applicants for every available training place. This is very encouraging, bearing in mind that the overall number of places is being increased by 25% over last year and the downward trend generally in the volume of applications for positions in the public service. It is an important point that 5,000 people are applying for 1,500 places.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> A new direct entry midwifery education programme will be introduced on a pilot basis next June. This three year programme will be operated by Trinity College in association with the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. A total of 20 training places will be available on the programme, which is open to school leavers and mature persons. Funding has been provided to the maternity hospitals to facilitate a doubling of the theoretical component of the current two year post-registration midwifery education programme from 13 to 26 weeks. Such an increase has long been sought by midwifery interest groups.</P>
    <P>A working group has been established to undertake a review of the content, duration and academic award of the current 18 month post-registration sick children's course. Ongoing funding has been allocated among the health boards for the provision of new technology and, where appropriate, clerical support for public health nurses.</P>
    <P>The important new initiatives that I have outlined illustrate how real progress can be achieved in a relatively short space of time in tackling the agenda for change recommended by the Commission on Nursing. I have no doubt that this has been possible because of the improved industrial relations climate that now exists following the settlement of the outstanding pay issues. For the first time in perhaps several years we have a unique opportunity to focus our collective energies constructively and in a spirit of true partnership on bringing about the changes that we all agree are desirable and necessary. The Commission on Nursing provided us with a secure basis on which to further develop nursing and midwifery in order to enable the profession to respond successfully to the challenges arising from changes in the organisation and delivery of our health services. Let us all grasp this opportunity and work together to achieve the objectives set for us by the commission.</P>
    <P>For my part, I am fully committed to the full implementation of the commission's recommendations. While all the recommendations are important, it is accepted that they cannot all be implemented at once. The action plan agreed with the nursing unions represents an important phase of a structured programme for the implementation of the commission's recommendations on an incremental basis over a period of time. I shall be taking a particular interest in the steps being taken to achieve all the objectives set out in the action plan between now and the end of next year. It is my firm intention that further action plans will be prepared in close consultation with the key stakeholders to provide for the implementation of the remaining recommendations over future years.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for giving me the opportunity to make a detailed and comprehensive statement on nursing matters. The nursing service is a vital <Col N="779" /> resource and I am determined to ensure it is nurtured and developed in accordance with the vision of the Commission on Nursing. I am convinced that the full implementation of the commission's recommendations will bring about the structural and other reforms necessary to facilitiate the ongoing development of the nursing profession. I assure the house that I will work assiduously during my term of office to advance this objective in close partnership with the nursing unions and the other key players.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>A report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 18 February 2000 conflicts with the points the Minister has made. The headline reads: &ldquo;Nurse shortage spreads across country&rdquo;. The newspaper article quotes the general secretary of the Irish Nurses Organisation, Mr. Liam Doran, as saying that the shortage has spread beyond Dublin. Up to now the Minister has admitted that there is a shortage of nurses in the greater Dublin area. Mr. Doran says, however, that there is an acute lack of nurses in Dublin's major hospitals, which has doubled to 1,100 since last June. The INO general secretary also refers to serious problems, including the retention of nurses, poor rates of pay, and housing and transport costs. According to Mr. Doran, a newly qualified nurse is still earning just £15,606 a year. I cannot contradict the specific facts provided by the general secretary of the Irish Nurses Organisation. The Minister mentioned the recruitment of nurses from abroad, but Mr. Doran is quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> article as saying, &ldquo;Although hospitals have engaged in intensive recruitment campaigns abroad, including the Philippines, they have not been able to entice nurses to come to Ireland in sufficient numbers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mr. Doran refers to hospitals changing their policies and offering flexible working hours. I am glad to see that job sharing, which until recently was not considered a very attractive option within hospitals, is now being offered to nurses and is being taken up readily. There is a problem, however, because it appears that job sharing links in with agency nursing. There are concerns, particularly in psychiatric hospitals, that the nurse-patient relationship might be hampered by a staggered approach to staffing. Such chopping and changing of personnel may not provide the best quality of care, particularly in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Doran referred to a survey carried out last November showing that more hospitals in Dublin are using agency nurses and care assistants to fill the gaps. Yesterday, in my contribution to the debate on hospital waiting lists, I referred to the big influx of agency nurses. I provided a statistic from the Mater Hospital which is spending £2 million on agency nursing in contrast to St. James's where they allow overtime. An integrated strategy is required to ensure a measure of <Col N="780" /> conformity. I find it extraordinary that two Dublin hospitals should have different ways of dealing with the nursing shortage &ndash; one through overtime and the other using agency nurses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing surprising about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that money is being ploughed in, but maybe there are better ways of dealing with structures. There is a need for interdisciplinary approaches. I would need a few hours to go through all the facts and figures contained in the Minister's presentation. It is very hard to digest them instantly. I can question them, however, and will come back to discuss them at a later stage. The document from the HSEA provides a figure for reported nursing vacancies of 1,180.46, which the Minister also mentioned.</P>
      <P>Last April, the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children was presented with other documents from An Bord Altranais, the HSEA and the INO. The latter group's figures do not conform with those from the HSEA. I would like to go through those figures to see if we can come up with some basic facts so that we can have a concrete understanding of the exact number of nursing vacancies. We understand the shortages in the greater Dublin area. The Minister himself referred to traffic problems and the high cost of housing as reasons for the shortage. He also said that more nurses were being taken on down the country and therefore they did not have to go to Dublin to find work. Let us tease out the situation.</P>
      <P>The INO submission in April 1999 provided the historical perspective on the current situation. Cuts in student nurses' pay in 1987 and demographic and educational changes have created the decline in numbers. Fewer school leavers have been entering the nursing profession and there is only one annual intake of student nurses.</P>
      <P>Recently I attended a graduation ceremony for 49 nursing diploma students at the University of Limerick. Of that number, only ten were staying in the nursing profession. I find that extraordinary considering they had taken up nursing after their leaving certificate as an entry to third level education. The biggest percentage of them was going to Mary Immaculate teacher training college. Others were taking well remunerated jobs as representatives for medical equipment companies. The remainder were going to work abroad, but not in nursing jobs. I find that extraordinary, because they were a very strong, healthy and lovely crop of girls. There was not a man among them, of course, which I wonder about. There is no reference anywhere in the document to that.</P>

      <P>I suppose the appropriate collective noun is a group of nurses. In all the discussions about nursing shortages, there has been no mention of getting men into the profession, even though we are always seeking gender equity. I am in favour of positive action to achieve that. It would be illegal for advertisements for nursing staff to specify female recruits, but is any effort being made by career guidance teachers in boys' schools to push nursing as a career? Why are they not coming through? It is probably because the pay rates would not be very attractive to them. I am not saying that men do not work as hard in their chosen professions &ndash; of course they do &ndash; but they certainly seem to feel that nursing is very difficult. Men would be physically well equipped for all the pulling and dragging that has to be done by nurses, but they do not seem to want jobs in that sector.</P>
      <P>Brighter prospects and better remuneration packages in the UK were also cited in the INO's submission as reasons for the nursing shortage here. Other reasons included the continuous improvement in other educational and career areas, as well as a reduction in the number of places available for student nurses each year. For instance, in 1998, of the 1,596 places available only 1,095 were taken up. All this information is known to second level students who are anxious to pursue nursing as a career. There was never as much interest in investigating careers as there is now. There are career guidance conferences everywhere and youngsters know where they are going. They will compare jobs and they realise that in teaching they will be finished work at 3 o'clock or 3.30 p.m. They hear people saying the perception of nursing is that it is extremely hard. The statistics for 1998 from the INO report confirm that for the first time none of the areas of nursing filled their available places. The reasons for nurses leaving the profession, especially in larger urban areas, include the cost of living, reduced living and travel costs in other areas, and more attractive private sector employment.</P>
      <P>More nurses are opting for part-time work and that is acceptable if that is what they want, particularly in job-sharing. According to the INO, the reasons nursing is no longer regarded as an attractive profession include the fact that it is poorly paid &ndash; this is the case, despite improvements following the nurses' strike &ndash; and is perceived as involving unsocial hours. That is a fact and it has not changed. It is also perceived as having a long working week and a low level of annual leave &ndash; that is a fact also &ndash; and it is a stressful occupation. There is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to an anti-bullying programme but apart from that nursing is a highly stressful occupation. Increased waiting lists and ward closures are taking their toll on nurses who are at the coalface. They also have to listen to patients who may not be at their best if they are sick, sore and sorry for themselves in a hospital <Col N="782" /> bed. One can understand why people in a depressed and stressed state might complain, but doctors do not tend to be on the receiving end of patients' negative comments whereas nurses do. Despite this, nurses take it very well and are extremely patient.</P>
    <P>The INO also states that there are minimal promotional opportunities in nursing which is still viewed as an old-fashioned, hierarchical and female profession compared to newer careers. We must examine all these facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clarify the reason third level fees cannot be waived. He said last night that there was a reason for this and I hope he will address it. The very active student nurses from NUIG were on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; recently and said they were not prepared to accept it. They are in third level.</P>

      <P>It has to be addressed. It is not as if there are millions of people seeking to take on a post-diploma year. Anyone who stays on for that year, given the fallout at diploma year, should be affirmed by having their fees waived. It is very costly for them and their parents.</P>
      <P>I have more interesting statistics from a study done by UCC's Department of Nursing Studies in June 1999 on student nurse characteristics, biographical information, motivation and attitudes to nursing as a career. Perhaps the Minister has read it. One learns a lot from it and I do not have time to go into all its recommendations, but the post-diploma issue must be looked at quickly. The report seeks the development of nursing education centres in all training hospitals and the creation of a clinically based career path for them, which the Minister referred to, as well as the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery, which he also addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go through the HSEA recommendations because we have this recent document, but An Bord Altranais has different figures and facts. We have three organisations here and it is not that they are not all singing from the same hymn <Col N="783" /> sheet &ndash; I would not expect them to &ndash; but their figures and suggestions are different. I do not understand this. An Bord Altranais is encouraging registered nurses to come off the inactive file and return to work. I would love to know if statistics show that is happening. It also wants an increase in the number of training places available &ndash; there has been an increase, as the Minister said &ndash; and increased promotional campaigns. Did the Minister mention a figure of £400,000 or £40,000 for the last campaign?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £400,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought. I confess I did not see much of that advertising. Was it on radio or television? Where was the advertising? If I did not see it, though I am interested in health, I wonder where it was. Was it in second level schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it should be in the national press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying promotion in the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but at the same time people read newspapers and watch television. If the advertisements were very good they would have far more impact. One takes what one is given in school with a grain of salt. Everyone knows that. Career information is hurled at students at a very stressful time while preparing for an examination and filling out a CAO form.</P>
      <P>One must ask where teenagers come together. I have seen very attractive advertising, particularly in Canada, to encourage people to take up nursing. One must have the advertisements where people are &ndash; bus stops, television or radio &ndash; and they must be shown during the programmes people watch. Attractive advertising would get far more applicants, though I am not saying that promotion in second level schools should not be done. Modern advertising would be excellent. Leaflets should be distributed to youth clubs and other areas where students gather. They could pick them up when they are together and say, &ldquo;Let's think about nursing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another recommendation from An Bord Altranais which ties in with the UCC report relates to the reasons young people choose nursing as a career. One reason is to help those in need. One is talking about a group of young people at an aspirational stage of their lives when they are full of altruism. When pupils from Laurel Hill were here, some of whom want to become politicians, I asked them about nursing, but we did not have time for them to respond. They are very idealistic at that point. Another reason given was that they wanted to deal with people rather <Col N="784" /> than things, which is very interesting, and a third reason was job mobility and a chance to travel. There is no doubt one gets that chance. How many of our young people go to Australia or America? Sadly they do not return. It is not sad for them, because obviously they have a good quality of life, but it is sad for us because we lose them.</P>
    <P>Previous experience working in health care was the most important influencing factor. I stress that because young people who attend my clinics ask if they can be exposed to the health service, which can be done through the social side of transition year. They can work for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or, in Limerick, for the Bawnmore facility for those with mental disability. We should give them more opportunities in their summer, Christmas or Easter holidays to gain that exposure, be it in nursing homes, community nursing or public health nursing. I would like an increase in the numbers of public health nurses, as that is where they are reaching out to people in need, particularly the elderly.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a shortage of nurses nationwide, but particularly in the Dublin area. The three bodies I referred to agree that education and pay are problem areas and more nurses are needed. Nurses need flexible career options, clinical based career paths, increased training places and more attractive remuneration packages. Those are recommendations from people at the coalface.</P>
    <P>I hear through the grapevine that the Minister is to prioritise the human element of the health service, which will relate to reducing waiting lists and increasing nursing training places. He did not get a chance last night to respond to the suggested link between increased waiting lists and the nurses' dispute. I would have liked the Minister to expand on that, as he said the newspapers misrepresented him. Waiting lists and attracting people to nursing are linked. I ask the Minister to address this and to elevate nursing.</P>
    <P>The jury is out as to whether the word &ldquo;vocation&rdquo; should be used about nursing. Some nurses say they are sick of the Florence Nightingale image of vocation. They do not want that any more and want to move into the new millennium as part of a respected profession. On the other hand, the basis of nursing is vocational, as it is an extraordinarily difficult profession. One meets people at their lowest ebb and one needs to be physically fit for the long hours and stress associated with nursing. There should be appropriate pay for that. I have seen advertisements inviting people of 20 or 21 from overseas to take up jobs here paying £30,000. When computer gurus are being attracted by massive salaries, people ask why they should go into nursing since their post-primary qualifications enable them to take any option from the CAO. There is massive recruitment to the hi-tech industry because of skill shortages and those who would have opted <Col N="785" /> for nursing are taking that route. We are at crisis point.</P>
    <P>Why is there such disparity between the various documents presented by An Bord Altranais, the HSEA, the INO and so on? If everyone works together, I am sure a practical figure can be arrived at.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister who I am sure will be back here again because this matter needs to be reviewed. We will be tabling a Private Members' motion or taking statements in the future on the issues raised today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Nurses are a very important part of the health service. This is probably an understatement because the most eminent doctors and consultants spend relatively little time with their patients as a result of the nature of their work, except in the case of operations which can go on for some hours. Nurses are at the coalface of delivering the health service, particularly in the hospital setting. Senator Jackman referred to the Minister's speech which would take a number of hours to go through. There is a lot in it, including a lot of good news. I will touch on this, as will other Members on the Government side.</P>
      <P>In recent years there have been difficulties which I will identify. Reference has been made to the difficulties in Dublin in recruiting nurses. These include traffic problems, the cost of housing and other related problems. There is also a difficulty in the smaller hospitals in attracting nurses, particularly small cottage hospitals in rural areas. I know of two hospitals where a list of successful candidates was compiled to go on a panel. However, as the panel was visited by the administrator or the nurse manager, the people concerned had obtained other jobs. In other words, people apply to particular hospitals but go elsewhere when the opportunity for work arises. One hospital advertised for nurses between six and seven times in two years and failed to get the required number. Each time the panel was filled but when the applicants were called they failed to take up the posts. Another small rural hospital advertised for SRNs and it received no application. Many of these difficulties are being addressed in a number of ways to which the Minister referred. Overtime is a short-term solution which I do not believe will solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a degree of success, particularly in the mental handicap services. I refer to my health board area which has been successful in attracting female nurses who got married and have come back into the service. That is to be welcomed because in most cases they are mothers, and being mothers they are caring people, although I am not saying they were not caring people before they became mothers. These people, who receive refresher courses, provide a pivotal service. In another rural area a panel of nine people was compiled. In two months, three people on the panel refused employment. There must be some <Col N="786" /> incentive to deal with this problem and I believe we have turned that corner.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman mentioned a report in a national newspaper about shortages spreading. The measures taken by the previous and current Ministers will take us out of this situation. I worked in the nursing service for a number of years. One of the reasons I did so was that I had a hero image of a local individual. This is also one of the reasons others have entered the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>The College of Nursing in Tullamore is currently training approximately 20 students, one of whom is a male. It would be incorrect to say that males are not being recruited. What is important in recruiting nurses is to employ the best people, irrespective of gender. One is talking about the best people and this is what the health agencies are trying to do. It does not matter whether these people wear a skirt or trousers, what is necessary is to attract the best people. The College of Nursing in Tullamore, which is linked to the Athlone Institute of Technology, is 20 miles away from where I live and is in the centre of the region. This is a step in the right direction, because local men and women will be employed there and leaving certificate students will identify with these people working in local hospitals and decide they would like to be a nurse just as &ldquo;Joe Bloggs&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cathy Barry&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Local training colleges are the answer to the problem because nowadays local people do not know the staff who work in their local hospitals. I do not know the staff who work in my local hospital because they are not locals. I am not saying these people should not be given jobs, but there is an identification problem on a local basis with these people. In the past it has proved an attraction to young people who can identify with local people in these jobs, and this is important. There is a College of Nursing in Castlebar which will be linked to the Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology. The training facility in Tralee has been redesignated as a pre-registration facility. This is one of the components which will attract young people to the profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a number of extremely important issues. The College of Nursing in Tullamore began with an intake of 20 students. This increased to 30 students in 1999 and this year it will have an intake of 40 students. This indicates that we have turned the corner. In the psychiatric discipline, where there was tremendous difficulty in recruiting students, last year there was an all time high intake of approximately 200 students.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that we are not winning the battle &ndash; we are. The Government is not saying there are no difficulties but it is implementing measures to tackle the problems. The measures being taken are extremely important because the numbers applying for nursing posts indicate that we are being successful. My colleague, Senator <Col N="787" /> Ormonde, is a career guidance teacher. These people have a pivotal role in directing young people into the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that settlement of the nurses' dispute was reached between the Department and the nursing unions based on an action plan setting out the objectives to be achieved over the next two years in implementing certain core recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. The Government has provided £10 million for initiatives to be undertaken this year under the agreed action plan. Since the action plan was agreed last November, considerable progress has been made in implementing it. I believe the monitoring committee was an extremely clever move because it has brought together all the strands of people involved in delivering the nursing services. The committee is composed of representatives of the Department of Health and Children, the health services employers, the nursing unions and An Bord Altranais. This partnership approach, which was proposed by the commission itself, will facilitate the constructive engagement between all the key stakeholders in progressing the huge agenda for change recommended by the commission. This could not be a better arrangement because everybody's point of view is considered. If the nursing unions were not involved, all hell would break loose. That has been avoided and this facility will deliver because this is a marvellous formula.</P>
    <P>The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery has also been established and this new independent statutory body has responsibility for the development of a new clinical career pathway for nurses and midwives involved in the creation of clinical, specialist and advanced practitioner courses. This is another step in the right direction. As the Minister said, the action plan provides for an increase of 300 additional training places this year on the nursing registration/diploma programme. This is a major step in the right direction. A total of 1,500 training places will be available &ndash; 1,000 in general nursing, 300 in psychiatric nursing and 200 in mental handicap nursing. A large number of males are involved in the latter two disciplines, psychiatric nursing and mental handicap nursing. These are the facts. There is a growing interest among male nurses in the general nursing profession and the paediatric discipline. The gender balance is being struck more evenly than is popularly known.</P>
    <P>A new integrated school of general and psychiatric nursing has, as I have already stated, been opened by the Western Health Board at Castlebar General Hospital/St. Mary's Hospital with an intake of 50 students. It is linked to the Galway Mayo Institute of Technology. The Minister has provided £400,000 to the various schools of nursing countrywide to enable them to undertake marketing campaigns. That is significant and cen<Col N="788" /> tral because the Minister is investing in recruitment and, as everybody knows, this is a world of marketing. Nurse recruitment is no different from other recruitment &ndash; it needs investment which has been provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister already commented on the improved support for nursing students and I will not repeat it. A new direct entry midwifery education programme will be introduced on a pilot basis next June. This three year programme will be operated by Trinity College in association with the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. A total of 20 training places will be available on the programme which is open to school leavers and mature persons. This takes in all sides &ndash; people who are coming through the education system and those who have been through it will have an opportunity. Funding has been provided to maternity hospitals to facilitate a doubling of the theoretical component of the current two year post-registration midwifery education programme from 13 to 26 weeks. Such an increase has been long sought by midwifery interest groups. In this instance the Department and the Minister have responded positively to the profession.</P>
    <P>A working group has been established to undertake a review of the content, duration and academic award of the current 18 month post-registration sick children's course or old RSCN course. Again, the Minister and the Department are improving the educational aspects of a discipline and making it more attractive for people to enter.</P>
    <P>Although everything is not rosy in the garden, we are making progress, but we cannot be complacent. The opening of the regional schools of psychiatric nursing in St. Brigid's Hospital in Ardee and St. Davnet's Hospital in Monaghan is another step in the right direction. I return to this point again and I do not care who likes it. If local people work in the local hospital, people who came through a local educational nursing facility, there is a fair chance that they will encourage, without saying anything, other young students from the general area, whether in the junior or leaving certificate year. When all the small schools of nursing were closed, a malaise set in. I recall attending an Association of Health Boards conference in 1983 where the then Minister &ndash; we will not be political, we will leave him anonymous but we all know who was involved &ndash; said that a number of the smaller schools of nursing would have to be closed. They were closed and we are discussing the results here today. That is why we are discussing shortages in nursing in Ireland, why the Minister is here and why Senator Jackman made her contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House as I always do. As one who is an employee of the Department of Health and Children, I have <Col N="789" /> to be very respectful when the Minister comes to the House. I am very encouraged by the Minister's speech because it is very hard, as Senator Jackman said, to get realistic figures on the current situation in nursing. I accept the figures the Minister has given us and will discuss them presently.</P>
      <P>When one looks at nursing overall, the most important thing to accept is that nursing has totally changed in one generation. It used to be a profession into which mainly young women went, apart from the men who entered the psychiatric service, as Senator Glynn said. Young women stayed in this job until they got married and in many cases they could not continue after they got married because of the marriage bar. It is now a totally different profession, where both men and women are considering it as a job for life and are considering their career prospects.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest difficulties at the moment is keeping people within the nursing profession because it is such a good training and is extremely versatile. They make extraordinarily useful employees in so many different careers after their training. As Senator Jackman pointed out, we now have to try to do all we can to retain them in the corps of nursing within the hospital service.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out the increased number of nurses employed in general practices and in the community and all this has led to a drain from the hospitals. We must deal with this terrible problem of keeping people within the hospital service. The Minister pointed out the increased numbers entering nursing and said that the problem is mainly in the Dublin area. When one looks at the figures there are nearly 12,000 staff nurse vacancies, which is horrific for anyone working within the nursing profession. Although the Minister says that with net figure adjustments made up by the utilisation of agency nurses and overtime, this comes down to about 430 vacancies, someone has to work very long hours to make up for those vacancies. This again leads to more people leaving which is one of the unfortunate roll-over effects of any shortage in any department. The work level becomes so great for those who are left that more and more people say they cannot take it any longer and will have to leave. While the employment of agency nurses may be all right on a short-term basis, it is not a satisfactory solution to the shortage of staff nurses. This is where the crux of the problem lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the disturbing things in the debate on the crisis in nursing over the past year and the dissatisfaction felt by so many nurses with their jobs is that it seems impossible to combine the terms &ldquo;vocation&rdquo; and &ldquo;profession&rdquo;. Vocation only means that one has a calling to do something and nursing is one of the most important jobs for which one should have some aptitude. It is important for patients that one has a desire to go into the profession. When the Minister was in the Department of Education and Science, I am sure <Col N="790" /> he heard the concern expressed that too many people went into medicine because they had the points to do it. This led to a fall off in those who continued to practise medicine afterwards because it was not what they thought it would be. We must ensure that the word &ldquo;vocation&rdquo; is given a status in the minds of nurses and they feel it is a worthwhile job.</P>
    <P>The profession needs to be properly paid. It was most unfortunate that a strike took place before the financial aspects of the problem were addressed. However, that is over and the issue has been addressed. I presume it will be necessary to pay more to nurses in the Dublin area to encourage them to remain in the profession, but there is no point rehashing the debates held at that time.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Commission on Nursing. The commission was chaired by Miss Justice Mella Carroll and all those who sat on the commission with her spent a tremendous amount of time addressing the problems in the nursing profession and they made good recommendations. The Minister mentioned the issues which have been addressed, including the career structure. This was one of the most important matters but it is most unfortunate that greater kudos still does not appear to be given to expertise in clinical care. The senior staff nurse grade has been introduced, which is important, but clinical care is not given enough status in the nursing profession. More importance is attached to diplomas in intensive care nursing or cardiology than competence in clinical care, which can be more important in terms of the running of the health service.</P>
    <P>As a member of the medical profession, one must be able to telephone a nurse and rely on their opinion when one asks about a patient. It is serious if one cannot rely on one's nursing colleagues to have the clinical acumen to be part of the team. However, no status appears to be given to that clinical acumen. It is one of the most important skills because, as Senator Glynn and Senator Jackman said, nurses are there most of the time with patients. One can pick up much more information in the course of bedmaking than a doctor may pick up on rounds once or twice a day.</P>
    <P>As I have told the House previously, I remember a case where I and a nursing colleague, the ward sister, could not work out what was wrong with a patient. The sister said that she would go on her own to the woman the following day and make her bed very slowly. She said that by the time she finished making the bed she would have found out what was the problem, and she found out. This type of expertise, tact and consideration for the patient does not appear to be given much consideration. High tech medicine is most important, but the clinical care of patients is at the core of the health service. I do not know what <Col N="791" /> will happen if we do not manage to restore its status.</P>
    <P>The career structure has been addressed but I have received complaints from nurses that if they transfer from one hospital to another, even within the same health board, they start at the lower level in the new hospital. This is extraordinary and must be addressed. Perhaps it is part of the Minister's plan with regard to career structures but it is most important.</P>
    <P>The involvement of nurses in the management of services is essential. They have always been involved to a certain extent, but their views on how the services should be managed are extraordinarily important. A considerable number of jobs are still done by nurses which could be done by other personnel in the health service. I am not referring to bedmaking. The making of empty beds is one matter, but making beds in which patients are lying is another. The patients could be very ill and one wants the people dealing with them to have expertise. I am not referring to such roles.</P>
    <P>Computerisation in the health service has been a splendid development but I work on Monday mornings with a nurse who spends 90% of her time getting results for me. The two of us should be working together, seeing patients, but I work most the time on my own while she is trying to get results from the computer. This is a time consuming job but I cannot expect the hospital to employ a clerk to sit with me. However, the removal of clinical nurses from their jobs to do this type of work is not the best use of their skills.</P>
    <P>I welcome the direct entry into midwifery. I am pleased it is associated with the university I represent, Trinity College, Dublin, and the hospital in which I work, the Rotunda. The changes in medical education that are taking place, where people may start off by getting a broader health science qualification, may be important but I note with some alarm the change in the entry requirements for nursing in terms of the removal of the need for a foreign language. Some fluency in a foreign language may not be too important in nursing but I do not favour the downgrading of the nursing requirements.</P>

      <P>Nursing is a complicated profession and I do not favour the downgrading of mathematics because of the amount of mathematical calculation involved. If one tells a nurse to put a patient on 24,000 units per 24 hours, he or she will have to calculate it from the dosage in a 25ml phial and work out how many drops per minute will be delivered. It is not simple mathematics.</P>

      <P>I am enjoying the interchanges but I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>This aspect is most important, particularly when nurses from outside the European Union are being recruited. We must be sure that their standards are the same as those in Ireland. Internationally, Ireland's standards are considered to be extraordinarily high and we want to ensure that is maintained.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to compare the number of nurses per bed, but the figure in Ireland is 1.26 compared to 0.42 in France. I have found French health care good and perhaps the Minister could explain how these figures are qualified.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister did not address the first recommendations of the Commission on Nursing on the regulation of the profession. Has much work been done on this aspect? A considerable number of recommendations were made regarding nurses taking ownership of the regulation of their own profession and the changes needed in the 1985 Act under which An Bord Altranais was established. These changes are major and they were recommended by the commission. They involve a total change in the membership of the board and a recommendation that it would regulate the ethical practices within the profession. The Minister did not mention this area but it is most important.</P>
      <P>The report states that the commission recommends the nursing profession take greater responsibility for the regulation and practice of the profession and for ensuring professional leadership in nursing and midwifery. It is bad if this is not being addressed. The report was issued almost three years ago and it is most important that those recommendations are given great emphasis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been done in an effort to get people to return to the profession. The nurse in my practice comes from Naas. I live in terror that con<Col N="793" /> scription will be introduced for nurses and that she will be seized off the bus in Naas or passing St. James's Hospital and will not get into town. There is a shortage of people at staff nurse grade everywhere in and around Dublin. She is an excellent nurse who trained with me in Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital. There are nurses who have not returned to work but they could be encouraged to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman's suggestion of television advertising was imaginative. It is a good idea and perhaps it would encourage more people to return, even on a part-time basis. The Mater Hospital must be in a state of despair given that it advertised for shifts of two, four, six, eight or 12 hours. It is in the worst situation and it has splendid theatres which are closed. St. Vincent's and Beaumont hospitals face similar problems because of a lack of people for training.</P>
    <P>I suggested last night, because of the grave shortage of theatre nurses, that we look at the role theatre technicians play in the United States. I worked in America for a short time and the theatre technicians there were mainly men who had trained in the US army. A great deal of work in theatres is technical work and involves the preparation of instruments and so forth. The grade of theatre technician still exists and the training, as far as I recall, took about two years. I checked this out the other day and it still happens.</P>
    <P>We could consider conversion courses because there are science graduates who are not in employment. The Minister and I have encouraged people to take up science and we have expressed our dismay at the drop off in the number of students taking physics and chemistry in the leaving certificate. I am contacted by a considerable number of young graduates from scientific disciplines who are not in employment. With a conversion course some of them may be interested in going into the more technical aspects of nursing. This would help save as many nurses as possible for the really important clinical care areas where no one else can do the job.</P>
    <P>This is the real problem. It is not a job which one can replace with other people. Those trained in computers or with a scientific background cannot provide the clinical care which nurses provide, such as mouth care, stomach care and preventing bed sores. Those are the specialised areas for which it is essential to use clinical care nurses. Any means to take the burden off them in other parts of the health service, to allow them concentrate on these important duties, must be promoted. The situation in the Dublin area is difficult, even with the large number of people being trained. Without nurses it is impossible to run the health service in a satisfactory manner.</P>

      <P>This is an engaging debate with many interesting insights coming from practitioners in the field, such as Senator Henry. I <Col N="794" /> welcome the newly appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children. This may be her first visit&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reflection on me, not on her. One way or the other the Minister of State is welcome to this debate. Disraeli once said there were three kinds of lies &ndash; lies, damn lies and statistics. I have seen many statistics about nurses and their availability in the course of my preparation for this debate. Officially, it would appear on paper that there is a sufficiency of nurses and, perhaps, a surplus. I am informed there are 48,000 qualified registered nurses paid up annually on an active file. In addition, there are 10,000 others who are not paid up annually on an inactive file. That would seem to suggest that we have a sufficiency of nurses. Yet the Mater Hospital's report of 1998 with regard to the intensive care unit refers to a very real decrease in suitably qualified nursing staff in 1998 which led to a reduction in the number of beds available and equally a reduction in the number of elective admissions to that unit. That is a worrying position. The report goes on to say that there is a real difficulty in regard to the shortage and retention of registered nurses within the service, particularly those with appropriate skills in specialised areas. That is reflected in other hospitals.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, on paper it appears there is a sufficiency of nurses but, on the other hand, they are not available for work in key areas. This is the dilemma. It is a challenge for the Minister to find out why a large number of nurses, qualified and registered, are not presenting for work. If the problem is to be tackled in an organised fashion it must be established why they are not available for work. What changes could be brought about to ensure their availability, if that is possible? We ought to have a tracking system to see whether it is possible to work out time sharing or work patterns that would make it attractive for them to become active in the service again. I am puzzled, given the number of nurses available on paper, that in overall terms in the Dublin area there is a shortage of about 800 nurses. What is the reason?</P>
      <P>We need more scientific information. People speculate that the reason is the high cost of housing in Dublin or the transport difficulty and congestion. That argument could be applied equally to teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I see no evidence of a surplus of teachers in Clare, Kerry or Galway or a shortage in Dublin. That could apply to any of the professions. That is a speculative explanation for what is happening. The matter needs to be <Col N="795" /> investigated with a view to doing something to confront the problem.</P>
      <P>The Mater Hospital's report pinpoints a lack of nurses with certain specialties and in certain areas. That raises the issue of ongoing career development and ongoing nursing education. It is a good time to address the issue given that it has been raised in the report of the Commission on Nursing, the charter for the profession in the future. There are clear guidelines in that report which, if implemented, should provide a sufficiency of ongoing career development education to enable us to have the nurses we need and in the specialties where they appear to be lacking at present.</P>
      <P>The message I give to the Minister this morning is that the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing should be implemented fully and with the minimum of delay. That is the most professional way to approach the problem of insufficient supply in specialist nursing areas.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry has drawn attention to the need to maintain the entry requirements for nursing training. Nursing now calls for high levels of capability, intelligence and skill. If nurses are to progress in their careers we must insist that the high standard which has given Irish nurses the professional status they enjoy and deserve is maintained. There must be no lowering of standards.</P>
      <P>There is no shortage of young people applying for nursing training. There were 5,000 applicants for the 1,500 training places which were filled this month, three applicants for every available place. While there is no difficulty in persuading bright young people to enter the nursing profession, the challenge is to keep them in the profession and to keep them in Ireland when their training is complete. We must offer young nurses career paths which are challenging, innovative and interesting to keep them at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must train more nurses. Our ageing population will demand a high quality of life and standard of health care and this will lead to a demand for more nursing care of the sort which can be delivered in sub-acute hospitals, nursing homes and by public health nurses in patients' homes. During last evening's discussion on hospital waiting lists, I raised the need to find ways of keeping people out of hospital. The only way to do this is by providing sufficient nursing care in the community. This is the most compassionate and caring way to deliver health care to older people. I grew up in a time when a stigma attached to being put into the county home. This came from the time of the famine when people would have died on a ditch rather than go into the county home. Folk memories die hard and old people like to be among their old, familiar things. We will serve our senior citizens well if we can keep them in their homes for as long as possible and provide home helps, carers and public health nurses in an integrated service. We can only advance this aim <Col N="796" /> if we have a sufficiency of nurses. As our population ages and we assess people's needs for acute hospital and other forms of medical care, we will need many more nurses. We must train more nurses to meet the demands of community health care as well as the needs of our hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am pleased by the Minister's proposal to upgrade midwifery education. The Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State both have a background in education. During his time as Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin paid much attention to the need to give young children a good start in schools. The Christian Brothers used to say that if they were given a lad for the first seven years of his life they would make a man of him. Although that motto may be crudely expressed, it contains much sound philosophy. What happens in the early years determines the course of a person's life and influences the way he deals with personal relationships and with the many situations he will meet in the course of his life.</P>
    <P>However, a person's future can be influenced even sooner. A midwife can play an enormous role in giving a young person the right start in life. It is a frightening experience for a young woman to be faced with a small baby without the advice and support of a midwife. Midwives teach young mothers how to bond with their children and by so doing start infants on a healthy course in life. The critically important role of widwives has not been given sufficient attention. Midwives are not given the recognition which they merit. Their role in the health service needs to be upgraded. I applaud the Minister for introducing, on a pilot basis, direct entry into midwifery education through Trinity College. This is a real advance. I hope this will be a pilot scheme only for as long as is absolutely necessary to establish patterns which can be put in place elsewhere and become the norm. I welcome the Minister's pledge to double the theoretical component of the current two-year post-registration midwifery education programme from 13 to 26 weeks. This is also a major step in the right direction and I applaud the Minister for taking it.</P>
    <P>The nursing profession faces a challenging time. Nurses have found a freedom to do other things and to work elsewhere which is not available to other professionals. Nursing is the most mobile of all forms of professional training. If one can nurse in Ballybunion one can nurse in Bahrain. We must seek to upgrade nursing education and ensure the objectives in the commission's report are met fully and within the minimum time. This carries an in-built risk. People can be educated and they may have aspirations and ambitions which might be exercised elsewhere, but not necessarily in our hospitals. We must be acutely aware that having a sufficient number of entrants to the profession, a good developmental approach to career building and career education, we must provide the necessary conditions in our <Col N="797" /> hospitals and communities for nurses to remain to give their service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, and wish her well in her new portfolio.</P>
      <P>I have listened attentively to my colleagues and some fine contributions have been made to the extent that my thinking is bogged down. I came in with a clear mind as to what I wanted to say, but I am not so sure now. However, I will speak on my feeling towards the nursing profession. I listened to and read the Minister's speech, and I note the key points relate to the nursing shortage. I asked myself why there should be a nursing shortage and it brought to mind the controversy of the nurses' dispute last October. Wearing another hat, I spoke to my colleagues as to where the nursing profession is going wrong and what is going wrong. The nub of the problem is that the jury is still out on whether there should be an academic or a hands on approach. Many people feel there is a divide between those who have done diploma courses recently and those who have gone through the hands on system. An inferiority complex is building up between the two areas, hence the problems in people getting allowances for their academic qualifications versus those with a hands on approach. This problem has existed for a long time in the teaching profession and it is now creeping into the nursing profession &ndash; I am among teachers who understand what I am saying.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced we should take the academic route immediately. Perhaps it is wrong that in order for people in the medical profession to access the CAO they need a point rating of almost 600 points. After ten years in general practice, one will find that many GPs are disillusioned, disenchanted and no longer want that particular lifestyle because they are not stretched. They are doing work which would be more suited, perhaps, to care workers rather than the nursing or medical profession. The nursing profession may go the same way. Is nursing a vocation or has it become a prestigious profession where people must have academic qualifications before they can gain hands on experience? It would be better if the reverse were the case and I would like to see that happening. I would like to say to students if they are interested in nursing, if they are dedicated and committed to a nursing way of life then perhaps they should spend two or three years working in a hospital to get a real feel of communicating with patients and be in a position to understand and interact with hospital life. Following that, they should move into the academic sphere of the culture of nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has set up a National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery to examine the transition from the diploma course to the four year degree course. I read the document carefully and I am not convinced <Col N="798" /> we are going about this in the right way. We must consider this matter in terms of the time it takes people to get their academic achievements versus general suitability. Can the council tackle this problem before it comes up with its findings? I have concerns in that regard. Before the final recommendations are made many consultations will have to take place between nurse tutors, the broad section of those involved in the health care area, teachers and, to give a plug to my previous profession, guidance counsellors who will have a big role to play in the vocation orientation of those aged between 16 and 17 who may be interested and may have a totally different approach to what they want from the nursing profession. There is the reality.</P>
    <P>I am coming down strongly on the role of public health nurses. I will make no bones about the fact that my mother won the gold medal in Ireland and England in her final nursing examination and continued her role as a public health nurse throughout her life. I have much knowledge on how public health nurses behaved in the past and how they behave today. I was nominated to the Cultural and Educational Panel of the Seanad by the Institute of Community Health Nurses. Therefore, I have a second interest in promoting the role of public health nurses in the few minutes remaining to me.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 1,350 public health nurses. The service needs a skill mix of public health nurses, registered general nurses, home care attendants and home help to meet the needs of the community. Until the 1980s, approximately 70 public health nurses were trained each year. When the course moved to diploma level, UCD accepted only 30 people. Despite UCC offering a further 20 places there is still an acute shortage of public health nurses. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area alone there are 30 public health nurse vacancies. There should be 1:3,000 public health nurses to population, but what is this population? Many public health nurses are carrying case loads of 1:6,000 or more. The complement of public health nurses has not increased despite the expansion of population, the changing social needs and increase in the workload.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the role of public health nurses. They offer a service to clients from birth to death and support and advice to parents following child birth until the child is of school going age. Mothers and infants are being discharged early from hospital, in some instances within 24 hours of delivery. This has implications for the service as many infants require metabolic screening within 48 hours. Mothers also require regular visits initially to help them establish breast feeding. Research shows that most women who stop breast feeding early do so within the first week due to lack of support. The increase in the number of different ethnic groups also puts increasing pressure on the service. Public health nurses continue to work closely and develop links with marginal <Col N="799" /> groups and have successfully recruited Travellers and refugees who now work as community mothers. This helps deliver a client friendly service to some extent. Public health nurses frequently require interpreters to help them communicate with different groups.</P>
    <P>Regarding the delivery of pre-school and school health and screening services, more input from public health nurses is required at an early stage. Under a measure known as the hospital initiative, people are being discharged from hospitals early. Many of these people require a nursing service. Ambiguity arises in the area of medical card holder versus non-medical card holder. Who supplies the dressings for non-medical card clients? These people would get this service free of charge if they were in hospital or if they returned to hospital. This area needs to be addressed urgently if we are to provide seamless care, a new phrase which means a co-ordinated approach.</P>
    <P>With regard to providing a range of nursing services to the elderly and support for carers in the home, the Eastern Health Board's district care team was established to enable people over 65 years of age to be discharged early, thereby making hospital beds available. A structured multi-disciplinary team was employed. This measure has proven to be cost-effective and beneficial in enabling older people to stay at home. People were admitted to the district care unit for a 12 week period and many of them continued to live at home afterwards with basic intervention.</P>
    <P>Carers need more support to enable them to care in the long term. Day care and step down facilities need to be developed urgently, ideally in primary care premises. Clients in nursing homes receive a subvention of approximately £175 per week. Over 75% of the Eastern Health Board's clients receive that sum. If some of this money was allocated to the community more people could be cared for at home.</P>
    <P>The public health nurse is required to have a register of people over 65 years of age. Unless the public health nurse receives a referral he or she may not be aware of these people. In order to plan services it is essential that all public health nurses carry out an area profile to determine the real needs of an area.</P>
    <P>Another role of the health service is to provide nursing services and support in the home for persons with a disability. Many people with varying degrees of disability are living at home and require care of some kind. Unfortunately, the public health nurse service is often unable to supply a quality service to this client group due to a lack of resources.</P>
    <P>Public health nurses are actively involved in the delivery of structured health promotion programmes, such as post-natal classes, breast feeding support, smoking cessation classes, cervical screening, blood pressure clinics and continence <Col N="800" /> clinics. This is all done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as clinical work takes priority. In order to give a quality service more public health nurses are required.</P>
    <P>The hospital liaison service needs to be developed as private hospitals are not visited. It is important that all people, regardless of age or means, are referred to this service. All people requiring a nursing service should be referred to the public health nurse service, regardless of income. The Commission on Nursing recommends that the Department of Health and Children issue a revised strategy statement on the role of public health nursing. The Institute of Community Health Nurses, the public health nurses' professional body, welcomes this initiative. The institute will carry out research into the public health nursing service to determine its needs and demands and to identify the different standards provided throughout the country. It will also conduct a consumer review of the service. The institute believes the service should be co-ordinated and transparent.</P>
    <P>As clients are being discharged early from hospitals it is imperative that resources are allocated to the community services in order that we have a quality, seamless service. I gave a lot of thought to my contribution and got ideas from my background, my guidance counselling role and from public health nurses. I ask the Minister to pay attention to the public health nurses because they are the core of our society. If we do not have them, the back-up support and the care staff that is necessary to facilitate the profession, then we are not at the races in terms of the nursing profession. I also ask him to examine the academic versus the hands-on approach. I am not convinced we are going about it the right way.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will be good at his job and I have confidence in him. He grasped the education portfolio very well and I have no doubt that he will do likewise with his current portfolio. I wish him well. This is a serious area and I hope he will come into the Seanad again.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his new responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I rise to restore the gender balance to this debate and to help with another perspective. I am chairman of a hospital in Belfast. I spent some of my professional life preparing manpower estimates and forecasts for health service employees, particularly nurses. Invariably my forecasts turned out to be wrong. It is a very difficult area and I am glad the Minister can avail of the report by the Commission on Nursing. It is a solid and thoughtful document and I commend Miss Justice Mella Carroll and her colleagues who prepared it. The Minister should use it as the basis for forward progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nursing problems are not confined to this jurisdiction; we have them also in Northern Ireland. I hope the Minister will be encouraged to think that there could be a constructive cross-Border <Col N="801" /> exchange of views on this area. It does not have to wait for structures. The profession North and South should get together.</P>
    <P>In the North and South we have underestimated the impact of changes in nurse training arrangements and the withdrawal of all of those staff from the wards. Some Senators have asked what will happen when the newly trained nurses return to the wards. The nursing profession is the bedrock of any health service. It is a resource that should be cherished. While I do not want to enter into the debate on money, I do not think it is all about money. We should think about the working conditions, status, promotion and resources. As Senator Jackman said, a great part of the problem is that nurses are in the front line. Nurses must deal with the patients and their families when they are in a distressed state. They will be better off the more that role is alleviated.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ormonde said, it is worthwhile to look at the broader picture and not to focus all the time on the hospitals. People can be prevented from going into hospital. If there had been people on hand during the 'flu epidemic to give old people advice, particularly on how to prevent dehydration, many of them would not have had to go into hospital. If there had been step down facilities in the community hospital beds could have been freed up. It is a wide picture at which I encourage the Minister to look laterally, as I know he will.</P>
    <P>Nursing is a vocation. The trouble is that when we talk about vocations we seem to invite people to offer themselves up as sacrifices. The true vocationalism one finds in most nurses should not be exploited. Senator Jackman referred to what sounded to me as a very interesting survey in Cork of the reasons people enter nursing. Thought should also be applied to the reasons they leave it. The drain from nursing is just as important.</P>
    <P>It is my experience that during the years there has probably been a greater loss of trained personnel from nursing than from any other profession, thereby giving a lower return on the money invested in training. There is, therefore, in the community a reservoir of people who have the required vocation and received basic training. The hospital with which I am concerned is encouraging such people to return by organising back to nursing days to let them see what nursing is like today. We have had some success with fairly trendy advertising campaigns.</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves why nurses prefer to work for agencies. I have no wish to denigrate the agencies concerned but if those are the conditions which attract nurses to work why can they not be replicated within the health service? They cover such matters as hours of work and provide for flexibility to give nurses the opportunity to do other things. There is much work to be done in that field.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> I encourage the Minister not to look at the profession as a single shop. It is a very complex and mixed profession. Increasingly medicine is becoming specialised. The Minister will have to look therefore at the possibility of providing for specialisation in the case of psychiatric, community and paediatric nursing for instance. Difficulties are being experienced in recruiting nurses into the highly specialised ends of the profession and retaining them. This presents a great problem. They are extremely highly qualified, they are working under enormous pressure and they have to be helped and sustained. Medicine has become a team operation, of which nurses are a hugely important part with the various medical practitioners and ancillaries. A means has to be found of retaining nurses as part of intensive care, neurosurgery, cardiology and paediatric nursing teams.</P>
    <P>I am glad there has been reference to maintaining the connection with clinical practice. During the years nursing shared with teaching and social work a great disadvantage. To progress in their careers nurses had to stop doing what they were good at and start doing things at which they were not always good and for which they did not have a taste. There is a real argument to be made for introducing career grade nursing. I am not aware of all the details but there is a move to introduce a consultant nurse in the United Kingdom. Something like that, which would keep highly experienced, dedicated and motivated nurses working at what they are good at, would be worth the investment.</P>
    <P>It is also important that there is a move back to the schools and education. There is a hitherto undiscovered nugget in the Patten report which relates mainly to policing. It contains a suggestion that some inner city schools should develop a stream to encourage young people to think of employment in the social and public services such as nursing, social work and policing. It may be that that is the level at which one has to start.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Ormonde, I have reservations about the over-intellectualisation of entry to medicine in particular. The academic high fliers want to do trendy and sexy things, such as heart transplants and neurosurgery, whereas we want them to look after mentally handicapped kids and babies. There is, therefore, a mismatch in terms of measuring a person's caring potential. This is something the professions should think about. Do we really want highly trained nurses to be making beds? The work of others such as ancillaries and domestics who are a hugely important part of the caring team should be enriched. We may well have to think of introducing what used to be called a State enrolled nurse to do this work.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to think of nursing as a profession in transition in a changing world and health universe and to maintain flexibility. I wish him well and strongly commend the concerns of <Col N="803" /> my fellow Senators and, in particular, the report of the Commission on Nursing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his new appointment. From what he said today and his record as Minister for Education and Science I am certain there will be many changes and much good work done in the health service, particularly on the subject under discussion. I agree with the sentiments expressed by most other speakers on the service provided by nurses. As Senator Hayes said, they expend much time doing mundane work such as making beds when they could be doing other work. They do substantial work on behalf of hospital consultants. We all realise how badly off we would be without them.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise an issue that has been placed on the agenda in the last week in the North Western Health Board. It was kept very quiet for many years but was due to hit the fan on 1 April. It relates to the ambulance service and ambulance nurses in particular. There is one large general hospital in County Donegal, located in Letterkenny, which is situated 50 to 60 miles from areas which are not even served by a district hospital. The ambulance service and ambulance nurses in particular are vitally important to such communities.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the national ambulance service a national agreement was entered into 1993 under which, by 1 April next, all ambulances are to be staffed by emergency medical technicians who need not necessarily include the driver who may possibly have paramedical skills. The second person on the ambulance need not necessarily be a nurse. This is a source of great fear in County Donegal where ambulances are staffed by a driver who has received certain medical training and a nurse. It takes up to half an hour for an ambulance to reach someone's door in Glencolumbcille and a further hour and half on some of the worst roads in the country &ndash; on which the Minister has travelled &ndash; to reach Letterkenny General Hospital. Therefore, it is vital that there is a carer in the ambulance who can deal with the patient being transported. I accept that the review could possibly be considered in large cities and even in a town in the vicinity of Letterkenny, for example, where it might only take ten or 15 minutes to get to the hospital, but it is different in outlying areas such as Glencolmcille or parts of the Gweedore Peninsula, where the ambulance service at Dungloe can take, perhaps, 15 minutes to get the ambulance on the road, a further half an hour to get to the scene at Knockfola, for example, which is at the most northerly point, and then a further hour and a bit to get to Letterkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have nothing against the ambulance drivers. They do excellent work. Indeed, in accident situations an ambulance driver might be even more <Col N="804" /> beneficial to a patient due to his physique and strength than a nurse, but my worry is that when the patient is in the ambulance and on the way to hospital, he or she is not in the care of a nurse.</P>
    <P>I understand that there has been an intervention by the nurses' trade union in the past couple of days which may stall this new arrangement due to the fact that they are probably fighting for conditions and pay terms. I plead with the Minister on behalf of people living in out-of-the-way areas, like Glencolmcille, from where it takes hours to get to the hospital. Patients need a nurse in the ambulance. Even with up to date training which some of the ambulance EMTs have undergone, many patients would rely on having a nurse. I find it difficult to understand how a person who spends maybe 16 weeks training and has 26 weeks' experience in the service can be more qualified than a nurse who has done three years' training. A nurse is trained to deal with clinical situations and my concern is about such cases.</P>
    <P>I am not here to represent the nurses as the trade unions can represent them. I am here to represent the public of south-west Donegal, which is one of the areas which will suffer most due to the number of nurses staffing ambulances there and the distance between outlying areas and the hospital.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look into the matter to see if anything can be done. I know the nurses have the option to be upgraded to EMTs by doing the advanced training course, but some of them will not be allowed to go back into the hospital service. I am plead for the making of an exception, particularly in the west, so that a nurse can be retained on ambulances rather than having two EMTs.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, and the Members of this House for the opportunity to speak on the Government's policy on Sellafield. The Sellafield facility has quite rightly been a source of grave concern to successive Governments and the public for many years. This Government remains firmly committed in its opposition to the continued operation and expansion of this objectionable facility. The Govern<Col N="805" /> ment is determined to remove any threat posed to the Irish people by Sellafield.</P>
      <P>Since assuming responsibility for the nuclear safety portfolio, I have had a number of meetings with the relevant UK Ministers during which I highlighted the continuing concerns of the Government about the Sellafield operations. My most recent meeting was yesterday when I met Energy Minister, Mrs. Helen Liddell. At that meeting I called again for the closure of Sellafield. UK Ministers are in no doubt as to the depth of feeling in Ireland about Sellafield, particularly as a result of recent events.</P>
      <P>This Government's concerns about Sellafield centre on the management of safety at the site, the storage on site in liquid form of high level radioactive waste, the continued expansion of activities at the site, including the proposed MOX plant, the continued reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at the site, the discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea, the aging Calder Hall magnox reactors at the site and the risk, however remote, of a catastrophic accident.</P>
      <P>Ireland has serious objections to nuclear reprocessing. Reprocessing generates gaseous and liquid radioactive discharges which contaminate the terrestrial and marine environment. The resulting production of plutonium creates an unnecessary risk that plutonium would be diverted for nuclear weapons production or terrorist activity.</P>
      <P>More and more countries around the world are gradually coming to reject reprocessing, as evidenced by political developments in recent years, notably in Germany. As a result, the reprocessing industry is separating more plutonium than the nuclear power industry is able to absorb. Sellafield has now a stockpile of plutonium which presents a potential risk to existing and future generations. The existence of such a large stock-pile demonstrates how ill-advised it is to persist with reprocessing.</P>
      <P>A dominant theme of the Government's campaign against Sellafield has been the genuine fear of the consequences of an accident at the site. The memory of the accident at Windscale in 1958, as it was then known, still arouses concerns that a similar accident could recur, with potential serious effects on agriculture and food production, particularly along our east coast. In my view, the multiplicity of hazardous operations at Sellafield increases the risk, however remote, of such an event happening.</P>
      <P>Concerns about Sellafield have intensified recently because of three reports published by the nuclear installations inspectorate relating to an inspection of the control and supervision of operations at the Sellafield site, the falsification of safety related data for mixed oxide fuel pellets and the storage in liquid form of high level radioactive waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspection of the control and supervision of operations at Sellafield was concentrated on <Col N="806" /> those Sellafield facilities involving reprocessing of irradiated fuel and waste treatment and storage. The inspection was requested by the NII following a series of incidents in 1999, the cause of which was considered to be a weakness in control and supervision at the Sellafield site.</P>
    <P>The subsequent inspection, which took place over a two week period in September 1999, focused on incidents, control and supervision of operations, staffing and resources. The report of the inspection makes 28 recommendations for improvement of safety management, which the NII require BNFL to undertake to ensure that the Sellafield site remains safe. The NII has given BNFL two months to put together a programme for responding to the report's recommendations. The NII has warned BNFL that it will use its enforcement powers should BNFL's response be inadequate.</P>
    <P>The second report published by the NII on 18 February deals with the falsification of safety related data for MOX fuel pellets. This issue first came to light on 10 September 1999 when BNFL notified the NII that they suspected that quality check data for MOX fuel pellets manufactured at their MOX demonstration facility at Sellafield had been falsified by BNFL employees.</P>
    <P>Among the report's findings is that seven MOX fuel assemblies delivered to BNFL's Japanese customer contained fuel pellets from lots known to contain falsified data. In total, 31 lots are known to have been affected by falsification. The NII report quite clearly puts the blame on BNFL management for this practice, saying that the level of control and supervision of fuel pellet diameter inspection had been virtually non-existent. The report also states that the events revealed by the NII's investigation could not have occurred had there been a proper safety culture within the plant.</P>
    <P>The NII report makes 15 recommendations. Among these are that BNFL should urgently consider the implications of the falsifications for the Sellafield site and provide to the NII a report on its proposed remedial actions. The MDF plant has been closed since September 1999 and the NII will not allow it to reopen until BNFL has addressed all the recommendations in the report to the NII's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>These two reports when taken together paint a picture of a company undergoing a safety management crisis. When I received these reports I immediately wrote to UK Ministers at the Departments of Trade and Industry and Environment, Transport and the Regions, and requested them to examine the closure of Sellafield operations. I also requested the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to meet with the NII to explore with the NII's chief inspector the NII's underlying thinking in allowing the reprocessing, and associated facilities, to remain in operation for two months while the deficiencies identified are being addressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> The RPII met with the NII on 22 February. At this meeting, the RPII pressed the NII chief inspector as to why he did not consider it necessary to halt any of the operations at Sellafield pending the implementation of chances to correct the serious deficiencies in safety management which had been identified by his inspectors. In response, the chief inspector insisted that current operations were safe. The chief inspector emphasised to the RPII that, if BNFL do not take the steps demanded of it, the NII will use whatever enforcement measures are necessary.</P>
    <P>These reports from the NII are of course very damaging to BNFL's reputation internationally. In recent times, BNFL has mounted a sophisticated public relations campaign to try to convince the public that they now enjoy an excellent safety record and that the public should have no fears about a serious accident. As a heavily regulated nuclear operator, it depicted itself as a modern safety conscious company which had built up large contracts for plant decommissioning and global clean up of nuclear sites. It maintained its solid defence of its reprocessing operations but presented itself as laying strong emphasis on the safety of its workforce and the public. This portrayal of a safety conscious operation rings hollow in the light of the NII reports. The release of the three reports by the NII has dealt a severe blow to this carefully nutured reputation which even the most skillful public relations offensive would find difficult to dispel.</P>
    <P>Despite the assurances given by the NII to the RPII, I do not believe the Irish public can be persuaded that the continued operation of the Sellafield site should be tolerated in current circumstances. For this reason, I met the UK Minister, Mrs. Liddell, yesterday and told her that all reprocessing operations should be stopped. I said I consider that any lingering morsel of trust in BNFL had been eliminated as a result of these reports. She expressed considerable sympathy and understanding of public perception in Ireland in the aftermath of the three reports. She assured me that a root and branch shake-up was taking place within BNFL to deal with the company's problems. While pointing out that I respected the seriousness with which the UK Government is handling the shortcomings at Sellafield, I emphasised to her that the only satisfactory outcome for the Irish public was closure.</P>
    <P>The MOX demonstration facility is a pilot MOX production plant, designed to demonstrate to BNFL's customers that it can produce MOX fuel to its customers' specification. The coming into operation of a larger MOX plant at Sellafield, which was built some years ago by BNFL at a cost of £300 million sterling, has yet to be approved by the UK Government. This proposed plant has already been the subject of a number of public consultations by the UK Environment Agency and by UK Ministers, the most recent of <Col N="808" /> which concerned the economic justification of the MOX plant, in particular the market for MOX fuel. The Irish Government made detailed submissions under each of these public consultations rejecting any justification for this plant and expressing its total opposition to its proposed establishment.</P>
    <P>The Japanese and German markets represent a very significant share of BNFL's projected market for the proposed MOX plant. The possible loss of these two markets has serious consequences for the economic justification for MOX production. I recently took up this particular issue with the UK Secretary of State, Mr. Prescott, and I will continue to exert maximum pressure on the UK to ensure that this plant does not go ahead.</P>
    <P>The third of the reports published by the NII on 18 February relates to the storage, in liquid form, of high level radioactive waste known as HLW. The NII report is an update of an earlier NII report in 1995.</P>
    <P>HLW arises from the reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel. The HLW is stored in tanks at the Sellafield site, pending a process known as vitrification, whereby the high level waste is encased in solid glass blocks. The high level waste, while it is stored in liquid form, is considered to be highly volatile and requires constant cooling to maintain its safety.</P>
    <P>The NII report provides an update of the various issues raised in the NII's 1995 report and summarises the latest NII assessment of the BNFL safety case. The report also details progress made by BNFL in regard to the key safety requirements in the 1995 report for BNFL to reduce the stocks of liquid high level waste, through vitrification, to a minimum buffer volume by 2015.</P>
    <P>The NII intends to monitor BNFL's required progress towards high level waste reduction towards a buffer stock level at about 24 month intervals and, if this falls short of what was agreed, will use its regulatory powers to require BNFL to take action to correct the situation. However, when I met the Minister, Mrs. Liddell, yesterday I repeated the Irish Government's view that the vitrification should be accelerated and that 2015 was not a satisfactory target date. A much earlier target date was necessary.</P>
    <P>I take particular pride in my efforts relating to the control of radioactive discharges from Sellafield into the Irish Sea. There have been understandable anxieties about the effect of radioactive discharges on marine livelihoods and on the enjoyment of the amenities of the Irish Sea. The perception of serious health risks from these discharges has also given rise to serious public concerns.</P>
    <P>I consider the OSPAR strategy with regard to radioactive substances adopted by the OSPAR Ministers in 1998 to be my most important achievement to date. This strategy commits the <Col N="809" /> contracting parties to the OSPAR Convention, which include the UK, to the virtual elimination by the year 2020 of discharges of radioactive substances to the marine environment. It will help to eliminate one of the strongest elements of contention relating to Sellafield &ndash; the impact of radioactive discharges on the Irish Sea and on the livelihoods of those living on the east coast of Ireland. The adoption of the strategy was a vindication of the genuine and legitimate concerns felt by Ireland about the impact of such discharges on the marine environment.</P>
    <P>The OSPAR Commission, on which all OSPAR contracting parties are represented, at its meeting in June this year will consider a draft report as to how the objectives of the strategy and the timetable for its implementation will be met. The Irish Government is determined to ensure that OSPAR participating states do not shirk in any way from their responsibilities in regard to this strategy. I will be doing everything possible to ensure that the contracting states, especially the UK and France, can demonstrate at the June meeting that they are working positively towards achieving further substantial reductions of radioactive discharges as required under the OSPAR strategy, so that the objectives of the strategy can be achieved fully between now and 2020.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the UK is preparing a national strategy for discharges of radioactive substances covering the period 2001 to 2020 to meet the objectives of the OSPAR strategy. It expects its national strategy to be published before the end of this year after a full public consultation process. Allied to this, the UK is also undertaking a full-scale review of all radioactive discharges from Sellafield. The UK's domestic processes and their outcome will be a measure of its commitment to the OSPAR strategy.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Sellafield site is also home to the first nuclear power station to be built in the UK, the Calder Hall magnox station. The magnox power stations are the oldest of the commercial nuclear installations in the UK, some were built as far back as 1956. Magnox reactors were not designed to meet modern standards and cannot be easily adapted. I expressed to UK Ministers on a number of occasions the concerns of the Irish Government about the continued safe operation of magnox reactors beyond their original design life. In particular, I raised the question of the safety and integrity of the reactor pressure vessels and the potential of the failure of those vessels to cause a large coolant leak.</P>
    <P>My Department and I have never lost an opportunity in recent years to put Ireland's views across in bilateral contacts with UK Ministers and officials and at EU and international meetings. We have been successful in raising the profile of nuclear safety issues internationally and the result is that we now have two very important international conventions, the Nuclear Safety Conven<Col N="810" /> tion and the Joint Convention on Spent Fuel and Waste Management which will allow a concerted effort worldwide to improve nuclear safety. We will continue to make strenuous efforts in the area of development of international standards and controls and the promotion of an enhanced nuclear safety culture. Most notably we have also achieved a new OSPAR strategy which will enable us between now and 2020 to achieve the virtual elimination of discharges into the Irish Sea. Recent events at Sellafield are most disturbing and we need to take the appropriate actions to protect our citizens within the scope of international law.</P>
    <P>I will not hesitate to undertake appropriate litigation against BNFL if I believe the operations are not complying with the provisions of international law. I have asked the Attorney General to reopen the examination of evidence for legal action concerning Sellafield with particular attention being given to the three reports which I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>I also intend to strengthen contacts with the Nordic countries who have recently voiced their concerns over Sellafield. We have built up a close relationship with the Nordic countries within OSPAR and I intend to bring about greater co-ordination of efforts against Sellafield between Ireland and these countries. Irish Governments have never been silent on matters relating to nuclear safety, particularly as regards the UK facilities. This Government is no different. We are fully committed to a campaign against Sellafield and the cessation of all activities there remains a priority for the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with practically everything the Minister said. Successive Irish Governments have taken the same approach on this issue. The critical point at which we converge, whether in Government or in Opposition, is in seeking a systematic examination of all the activities of British Nuclear Fuels Limited in Cumbria. No effort must be spared in our attempt to ensure that the safety of our people is protected at all costs. Having read the reports the Minister referred to I would agree that there is serious cause for concern. The issue was summed up by the Minister when he said that the falsification of records in a nuclear facility is totally unacceptable. It is not a potato crisp or cardboard box plant, it deals with some of the most dangerous toxic substances in the world. Therefore, the activities in Sellafield must be totally above board in terms of management ensuring that no effort is spared to ensure that everything is safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who was involved in falsifying the records at Sellafield? Following the first BNFL report it looked as if just two or three people were involved, but the British Nuclear Installations Inspectorate found it was possible to identify from staffing records when samples had been falsified. The analysis shows that four out of five <Col N="811" /> shifts were involved to varying extents in falsifying data. That is a damning indictment of the management and safety controls of BNFL. It is utterly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>If BNFL thinks it will satisfy public opinion by firing its chief executive, it will not. A root and branch resignation of the people involved in safety in BNFL must take place immediately. We cannot accept that a company with such an awful safety record can continue with the present management structure.</P>
    <P>While some people may say that BNFL's quality control standards were safe, it now transpires that they also were falsified and were not properly checked. The people who approved the false records are part of the falsification process. Neither the Government nor the people can accept that BNFL has any bona fides in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's recent meeting with his British counterpart and his commitment to pursue the matter legally in a thorough manner. The reality is that Ireland is not alone in being concerned at the latest developments; the Nordic countries are also concerned. We have relied on the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate of the British Health and Safety Authority to provide an independent examination of what is going on in Sellafield. We need to go one step further now, however. The Government, in tandem with the Nordic countries that are seriously concerned by this, must be part of an overall inspection team looking at Sellafield. I do not know enough about the nuts and bolts to say how one would do that, but we must insist on having an active and direct role in an independent authority, including the Nordic states, to examine Sellafield. That would provide a further level of scrutiny which people are demanding.</P>
    <P>I reject criticism of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland that I have heard in my own county. I have the greatest respect for the RPII which does a wonderful job. Its job is not to be political, but to tell us what the facts are and to pursue them. People who criticise the RPII for not taking a quasi-political role are wrong. Our job is the political one, while the RPII's job represents the scientific role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister agrees with me. I am very concerned by the way in which the RPII was targeted in County Louth as being biased or not doing its job. The RPII is doing a wonderful job and I am 100% behind it. Through the RPII we need to tease out further the idea of a new inspection regime featuring Ireland in the Nordic countries. As the Minister of State acknowledged, Britain recognises the issues. In fairness to the British Government's Minister, when he commented on the resignation of the <Col N="812" /> chief executive of BNFL he more or less said that it was not before time. It is not before time either that we should have further action in this area.</P>
      <P>Another issue that arises is the long-term storage of nuclear waste which has been proposed in the past by Nirex on a site near Sellafield. The Minister of State fought that battle, as did others, at oral hearings. I understand that matter is to come before the British Government early this year and that a further report is due out. It is timely to have this debate so that we can create as much fuss as possible about any proposals for the long-term storage of nuclear waste anywhere near the Irish Sea. There are clear indications that over time there will be leakage of radioactive material from Sellafield, given the rock structure of the Cumbrian coast. If action is not taken now, the entire Irish Sea could be contaminated for future generations. It is our job to leave a clean environment for them to inherit. Our action on the new Nirex proposal must reflect that aspiration.</P>
      <P>Some months ago BNFL wrote to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport indicating its willingness to appear before the committee. While it is not a matter for the House today, the committee, of which I am a member, must take BNFL up on its offer. We must pursue the company here and ask it to explain the seemingly inexplicable. The way forward is to continue to put extra pressure on BNFL.</P>
      <P>The summary of one of the reports by the British Nuclear Installations Inspectorate states:</P>
      <P>Having inspected all the activities in Sellafield, there are three key conclusions from this inspection. The first is that there is a lack of a high quality safety management system across the site which is compounded by an overtly complex management structure. The second is that there are insufficient resources to implement even the existing safety management system. The third is a lack of an effective independent inspection, auditing and review system within British Nuclear Fuels. Without a vigorous independent inspection, auditing and review system, the Health and Safety Executive do not see how British Nuclear Fuels can make acceptable and timely progress in delivering a high quality safety management system across the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is it in a nutshell. This company is incapable of managing its affairs properly. There are serious safety concerns but BNFL is not addressing them properly. The falsification of safety records has been going on since 1996. What other falsification of records may be going on? What other management structures are inefficient? We cannot afford to allow this company to continue to operate as it does. We must insist, as the Minister of State has done, that we will pursue BNFL and the British Government night and day at every possible <Col N="813" /> venue. Members of the Oireachtas must have the opportunity to put BNFL to the pin of its collar here in the near future. Obviously that is the route we must take.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the STAD group from County Louth which has taken a legal action against BNFL. I wish them well. I heard a radio report this morning on the matter and, having no more information than that, I am sure the Minister of State can assure us that every step is being taken to fully fund that group's action. The point was made on the radio that funding is available for scientific research but none is available for the legal case. I do not know if that is true, but if so, it must be changed. I call on the Minister of State to provide full and adequate funding for that case.</P>
    <P>I hope we revisit this issue in two or three months when the Minister of State may have further progress to report. We are all behind him on this; the whole country wants Sellafield shut down. Obviously there are thousands of people working in Sellafield, but decommissioning a nuclear station will keep those people in employment for many years to come. If it is decided to close Sellafield there will not be a massive loss of jobs, because the product will continue to provide ongoing employment. The Dounreay plant in Scotland is being decommissioned and that is what we want for Sellafield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I am heartened to find the national consensus being articulated so clearly on both sides of the House. That is in the national interest. Sellafield has been threatening the people of Ireland with environmental terrorism for decades and I mean environmental terrorism in its fullest sense. Its operation is unsafe at any and all times. It is abhorrent and an indictment of those who run BNFL that they &ndash; and the British Government, which has ultimate responsibility &ndash; have known that from the start. Yet they have continued to develop and expand the operation, rather than contracting it, which successive Irish Governments have called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well before the discovery last autumn of the falsification of data and the subsequent inspection and three reports from the Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations two weeks ago, the record of Sellafield was well known to us. We all knew of and accepted the risk of a major nuclear accident. The consequences for us of such an accident do not bear thinking about. The report of the chief inspector has proved that our worst fears are totally justified. The Minister of State and successive Governments have called for the complete shutdown of the plant and I am very encouraged that the Minister of State did so again <Col N="814" /> yesterday when he visited his counterpart in Britain and has reiterated that reasonable and justifiable call today.</P>
    <P>The chief inspector's conclusions and recommendations reflect very negatively on the standards of management, safety and supervision at the plant. These relate not just to the MOX unit where data were falsified but to the plant in its entirety. Some of the critical conclusions refer to the lack of high quality safety management systems, over-complex management structures, the lack of adequate resources for safety management and the lack of adequate independent inspection and audit systems. It seems from the report that safety was an optional extra at Sellafield; one does not need to do an in-depth analysis to see that. That is totally irresponsible and we can logically interpret the chief inspector's conclusions as referring to criminal negligence of frightening proportions. It is now established that data were being deliberately falsified over a three to five year period. Whether it was with or without management's knowledge is totally irrelevant. Management should manage, but it has not done so in this case.</P>
    <P>This further strengthens the case for complete closure. The chief inspector's recommendations might offer some slight reassurance if all were fully implemented, but they will never reassure the Irish people. The ultimate objective is complete closure and I am glad of the Minister of State's reassurance that it is the only outcome the Government will accept.</P>
    <P>The Windscale incident shows up the unenviable BNFL record, especially in light of the Chernobyl disaster. The recent damning revelations make it imperative that we step up our campaign. I fully back the calls by the Minister of State and Senator O'Dowd to close Sellafield and to support a nuclear cleanup programme, to promote and enhance international safety, public health and the environment. I am heartened by the Minister of State's commitment since taking office. He has met his British counterpart and John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, and he has taken a very strong stand in international fora. He has taken initiatives to steer strategies with OSPAR which are to be highly commended. I cannot overstate his level of commitment and I deeply resent the lampooning and attempted satirisation of his efforts to take on a world organisation. There is a world network of nuclear organisations and the Minister of State has gone out of his way at every level available to him to make the world at large aware of our Government's deep-seated objections to what Britain is doing. The Minister of State is calling for complete closure and for greater co-ordination of efforts against Sellafield between Ireland and the Nordic countries. That is the way to build a world consensus against nuclear power.</P>
    <P>I understand BNFL has the new MOX plant ready for operation. However, as the Minister of <Col N="815" /> State said, this is subject to the approval of the British Government. I fully support the Minister of State's calls on the British Government to stop BNFL from operating that MOX plant. Given the record of the small unit, the operation of a full-scale MOX plant has horrendous implications. If the fuel manufactured there is faulty it could cause an explosion. The MOX is a way of getting rid of plutonium that builds up in reprocessing and will give BNFL an excuse for continuing with reprocessing because it provides a use for the plutonium. We know that there are very few uses for plutonium but that if it fell into the hands of terrorists it would lead to mayhem. If the MOX is stopped from operating that cuts the ground from under the justification for reprocessing and would bring the running down of the whole operation much nearer. I call on the Government, with the approval of all sides of the House, to call on the British Government not to allow the MOX plant to come into operation.</P>
    <P>There is a whole range of activities going on in Sellafield, such as the vitrification process. That process must be accelerated. The inspectorate has given them until 2015 and there are two lines in operation, with a third coming in next year. I would support the Minister of State in calling for at least a fourth line to ensure acceleration. We will not settle for 2015 as a completion date for vitrification of highly dangerous liquid which requires a cooling process in operation at all times.</P>
    <P>I am glad world organisations are destroying the arrogance, secrecy and misleading public relations spins that have kept us at bay in the past despite our deep-seated opposition to what is going on in Sellafield. I also resent the discharges into the Irish Sea, which are an infringement of our national rights. I have serious concerns also about the nuclear industry imposing such a huge risk to people's health and to the environment. It will have to be compelled by way of global consensus to face up to its duties, given that the whole nuclear industry is a virtual time bomb. Evidence from Japan of chemicals being mixed in buckets and evidence from Sellafield and other areas indicate an industry in crisis. We must never be satisfied until this entire industry is terminated. While the attainment of this objective is unrealistic in the short term, it must firmly remain our ultimate objective. We must press at all levels, as the Minister of State has cogently stated, for the process towards total elimination of nuclear hazards worldwide to begin now. However, Sellafield is our immediate concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for allowing me to share his time. We are lending our support to the Minister of State's efforts which are commendable. I congratulate him on the action he is proposing to take. I am particularly impressed with the way in which he and the <Col N="816" /> Attorney General are proceeding to investigate and find ways and means to bring a European-based case against Sellafield. That is long overdue. Sometimes in ordinary life matters must get worse before they get better. Perhaps at the end of the day the falsified reports were the ammunition we needed to enable us to move more purposefully against British Nuclear Fuels than we have been able to do in the past. This is not the first Government to have tried hard to do something about Sellafield in the certain knowledge that what is happening in the Irish Sea is no longer acceptable.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State for what he is doing and I hope his efforts will proceed with great speed and vigour because this is not the type of issue we can allow anyone the luxury of delaying. It is far too serious and potentially far too dangerous. I am also impressed by the fact that he is actively seeking to enlist the support of the Nordic countries, because on our own, and against Britain and British Nuclear Fuels, we have proved to be very vulnerable and weak in the past. We can only hope to succeed in the future if we have a very strong Euro-based initiative at a legal level and very strong support from other countries at a moral and legal level. I commend the Minister of State for the action he is taking on those two fronts.</P>
      <P>The issue of falsified reports on a matter as potentially dangerous as Sellafield needs to be examined very carefully at international level. Pollution knows no bounds. It is not a respector of national territories or borders. The policing and monitoring of pollution must happen at least at a Euro-based level. Britain can never again be trusted, no matter what promises are made, on foot of the findings of these three reports. It can never again be trusted to police itself on this issue. A European-based or other international body must be put in place to oversee, monitor and police this industry. It must be absolutely independent and immune to any economic argument or any other argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall ten years ago talking about Sellafield and being told it provided so many jobs that there was no point in seeking its closure. The economic argument must not be an element in this very serious and contentious issue. A strong independent body, which will have the capacity and legal force to oversee what happens at Sellafield from now on, must be put in place. It is the wish and will of every Member of this House, and of every citizen of this country, that Sellafield and all its ancillary activities are brought to full closure and total elimination and that the residue of the operation that has been taking place there since 1956 be dealt with in accordance with the best technologies available. Sellafield has given us the strongest weapon to date by way of the scandalous and disgraceful manner in which it deliberately falsified the most serious reports on life-threatening materials. It has put itself past the point where it <Col N="817" /> will be tolerated by right-minded and right thinking people.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State and ask him to keep up the pace and urgency in seeking a complete closure of Sellafield. This great work will have been accelerated by what he has done to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and particularly the opportunity to debate this topic. I know his heart is in the right place and I watched him on British television last night. As he comes from County Wicklow and lives near the Irish Sea he is, therefore, affected by this issue. My grandfather and father came from the coast of County Down, just across the sea from Sellafield. My first business was in Dundalk and I live in Howth, on the sea, just across the road from Sellafield. The concerns of ordinary people in all these areas put this issue very high on the agenda. I believe we have not done nearly enough. The time for ritual-hand wringing about Sellafield is now surely past. The time is past for being fobbed off by lies by one government and ineffectual rhetorical gestures from another. I sense the patience of the Irish people has been finally exhausted. I gather this from the Minister of State and the speakers here today. It is up to both Governments to realise this and act accordingly.</P>
      <P>The recent report from the UK Health and Safety Executive proves conclusively what many of us thought all along, and what some people have said consistently for many years. The truth that is now incontrovertible is that the public facade so cleverly erected around Sellafield has been from start to finish a complete tissue of lies. The British Government has been lying through its teeth. What is really significant about this report is not the specific lies and falsifications, but what it tells us about the underlying persistent, deliberate nature and culture of that deception. This culture of deception was not the creation of lazy or incompetent inspectors. Nor was it something that a self-serving management put in place to defend its empire. It was a culture of deception sanctioned by, nodded at and ultimately approved of by the British Government. This report is the final piece that brings the whole house of cards crashing down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the worst of the story, nor is it the end of the guilty list, because I am going to come closer to home. The most shocking co-conspirator in this affair has not been anyone on the other side of the Irish Sea, it is the Irish Government &ndash; not this Government in particular but successive Irish Government that have fiddled with the problem dating back to the days when Sellafield was called Windscale. Let us be frank and honest about this. Despite the consistently mounting concern of ordinary Irish people &ndash; I have talked about the areas with which I have been associated &ndash; successive Governments of all colours have <Col N="818" /> pulled their punches on this issue. As a country, Ireland has never taken the Sellafield problem seriously enough. It has gone through all the ritual motions of protest, but its body language has sent a totally different message to the British. The consistent message from Irish Governments of all political complexions has been, &ldquo;Don't worry, we won't rock the boat on this&rdquo;. This is the truth of the matter and this is the reason it must stop. As far as the Irish people are concerned, the game is up. If the Government fails to recognise that fundamental sea-change, that failure will be at its peril.</P>
    <P>Why have successive Governments conspired &ndash; I use that word purposely &ndash; with successive British Governments to sweep this life and death issue under the carpet? The answer is depressingly simple, that is, Northern Ireland. The thinking is simplistic and wrong that we dare not offend the British over Sellafield because it will undermine the relationship we need to have with them over the North. A large cabal of officials in the Irish Government service, mainly in the Department of Foreign Affairs, are simply terrified of upsetting the British and offending them over Sellafield. They believe, totally wrongly, that we cannot be beastly to the British over Sellafield while being lovey-dovey to them over the North. Nothing could be further from the truth. The British themselves specialise in carrying a love-hate relationship with a whole range of international partners. Look around the world at how they handle them. They simply follow their national interests which we should learn to do. They do not trade one off against the other, they fight for their corner in every case, as do the French and the Americans.</P>
    <P>We are too nice, or else we have not learned how to do that. As a result, the timid but powerful people who are terrified of offending the British leave a dead hand over the formulation and execution of our policy on Sellafield. No matter what anybody across the Government proposes to do about it, if it is likely to offend the British it gets shot down before it crosses the Irish Sea. The person most to be sympathised with in this sorry saga &ndash; which would be farcical if it were not so serious &ndash; is the unfortunate person in each Government who becomes the Minister for Sellafield and I watched the Minister last night.</P>
    <P>Without exception, these Ministers have been sincere, intelligent, well meaning and very capable. The present Minister is one of the best of a very distinguished band over the years and is very competent. They enter the job with great resolutions and then have the frustration of meeting a brick wall, put in place by people in Ireland, not somebody on the other side of the Irish Sea. Even more frustrating, this is a brick wall that they must not admit even exists, so the pantomime they have to play becomes almost a shadow play.</P>
    <P>No matter how great their embarrassment, they have to stand up and read their lines &ndash; the lines <Col N="819" /> they know are hollow and which an increasing number of their audience realise are hollow. They stand up and read those lines as though they were part of a play. Every time the show goes out, a vast amount of energy is expended behind the scenes on creating new lines, new bits of stage business, in a vain attempt to convince an increasingly sceptical audience that this time they mean business. Now that time has changed. We have unfortunately seen over the past week or two that the lines have not changed, at least not yet, but the audience has changed. Perhaps they are changing now and I am impressed by the Minister's contribution today. Even the critics will get the message that the game is up. No matter what it says or promises, the British Government is simply no longer credible over Sellafield. The words of Senator O'Dowd, Senator Fitzgerald and the Minister confirm that.</P>
    <P>No matter what it says or promises, the Irish Government is simply no longer credible over Sellafield. We have no say over what the British Government may do, so let us concentrate on what the Irish Government can do. The time for words is over and the time for actions has come. This is what the people want and this time they will not be put off. If the Government denies them, the people will find some way of doing the job themselves. The Minister's heart is in the right place but this is the time for action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. This is the nearest thing to a matter of constituency interest for me because for a number of years, for 90 days of the year, I lived 90 miles downwind from Sellafield. It has been a sorry story of mismanagement, deceit and duplicity all that time. I commend the efforts being made by the Minister and the Government and I urge them to redouble them.</P>
      <P>There are numerous vested interests in Sellafield. It is an enormous provider of employment in a very depressed part of the north west of England. One of the Ministers dealing with the matter over the years in Whitehall was the nominee of the trade unions and sponsored by the trade unions in Sellafield, which did not unmuddy the waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember an unhappy and very strange incidence of leukaemia among young adults along the County Down coast in the mid-70s, which was much higher than one would have expected in comparable practices. Sadly the data were not collected in a way which made it easy to analyse and the numbers, while appalling for the families concerned, were overall quite small so it was quite difficult to draw conclusions. There was no doubt that the people along the coast of County Down felt exposed to enormous and unfair risk as a result of emanations from Sellafield over the years. The fishing industry areas of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie, some of the richest fishing <Col N="820" /> grounds, particularly for prawns, are right in the outfall or the area which can be contaminated by the outfall.</P>
    <P>Sellafield has shown abominably bad management over the years; in recent years, it has shown criminally bad management. It is criminal that a public body in particular should falsify the records to show that safety procedures which should have been carried out were not carried out, for which heads should roll. Bad management is endemic in Sellafield which has a culture of carelessness which has been shown up over the years by organisations such as Greenpeace and others. The time for tolerating that has long passed. It is more than an Irish or a UK matter, it is matter of European and wider significance in the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>Before we go into battle too far on that, we should clean up our own act. I am not sure we can put our hand on our heart and say that all the emissions from Irish power stations are not creating acid rain in Scotland, Norway and elsewhere. As well as committing ourselves to this programme, we should initiate an audit and a review of practices, performance and standards in this country as well. I commend the Minister on his concern and his efforts. I hope we do not have to wait until 2020 to have the plant cleaned up because one has to consider the people whose health has already suffered from contamination. There is quite a clear linkage between this form of discharge and higher incidences of quite nasty forms of cancer. The longer it goes on, the more likely it is that more people will contract that or some other disease. I commend the Government on this matter and wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on some of the actions he has taken and the remarks made by him in recent times on Sellafield. This issue is one of ongoing public concern countrywide, particularly in the eastern region, from Dublin up to Strangford. It has been raised in the House on numerous occasions by Senators on all sides, particularly by Senators directly affected due to the location of Sellafield.</P>
      <P>The most recent events are scandalous. People are shocked that there could be such mismanagement and the deliberate falsification of data in any plant. However, the fact that it took place in a plant which deals with hazardous materials and waste is, as Senator Maurice Hayes said, criminal. There is no other way to describe it. It was only by chance that the Japanese discovered the position when the MOX fuel pellets were about to be loaded into a reactor. Nobody knows what the effects might have been if they had been loaded given the falsified documentation about the mix in the pellets. It is a scandal and, undoubtedly, firm and fast action of a permanent nature must be taken this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sacking of five workers or the resignation of the chief executive officer is not sufficient. This <Col N="821" /> time Sellafield must be closed. Its days are numbered and the Government should be to the forefront of ensuring it is closed. The levels of concern about the plant to date in terms of accidents that have occurred, the release of radioactive waste into the environment and the sea, which affected our fish stocks, and the worries about the incidence of leukaemia and cancer among the population living on the Irish coastline were sufficiently high to justify the closure of Sellafield in the first instance.</P>
    <P>However, we have now discovered that Sellafield has not been run in a safe fashion. The Minister of State has grounds for taking legal action against Sellafield, which successive Governments refused to take on the basis that there was insufficient scientific information. The Minister of State should first seek allies in Europe in relation to this matter. A number of other countries fish in the seas around these islands and they must be equally concerned about the mismanagement of the Sellafield facility and the dangers posed by it. In addition, Japan is refusing to accept the fuel pellets and I am sure it would be prepared to come on board. However, Ireland must take the initiative and take a legal test case. I commend the Minister of State's decision to refer the matter to the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The response of the British press has been that Sellafield must clean up its act or face closure. However, this response is not good enough because it is incapable of cleaning up its act. It has shown this over the decades, in the past when it was known as Windscale and since it became Sellafield. Any such facility and management structure which has shown itself incapable of keeping a clean slate should not be given another chance. Sellafield has been given numerous chances and it is not a question of it cleaning up its act or facing closure. It must be closed. This view has been expressed on this side of the Irish Sea in newspaper editorials but the British media has suggested that Sellafield should be given another chance.</P>
    <P>It was outrageous of Brian Watson, the head of the Sellafield site, to suggest that nobody is saying that Sellafield is unsafe. We are saying that the plant is unsafe and that we do not believe those in charge have the credibility to make it safe in the future. Ireland has too much at stake in terms of health and the potential for another accident, given the contents of the NII reports regarding the current mismanagement. We must draw the line and say that enough is enough. All sides would support the Minister of State if he decided that he was in a position to take a case to ensure that Sellafield is closed once and for all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> There have been a number of debates on Sellafield over the past 12 months, some of which related to possible problems at the start of the millennium. I compliment the Minister of State on the initiatives he took to ensure cognisance was taken of the concerns expressed regarding Y2K difficulties that may have arisen. I also compliment the Minister of State on the promptness with which he dealt with the most recent issue at Sellafield. The views of Members generally with regard to Sellafield and the risk it poses, particularly to the north eastern part of the island, are well documented. The Minister of State moved swiftly and called for the closure of the plant.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the response of the British authorities was not commensurate with the seriousness of the situation or the Minister of State's concerns. I compliment him on arranging for representatives of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to meet their counterparts in Britain to highlight the serious threat we felt we face and to discuss how the matter was to be addressed. There have been many alarming instances in the past which, as the Minister of State pointed out, were dealt with in a good public relations manner as far as the company was concerned. However, when one considers the consequences of a serious mishap at Sellafield, the inadequacy of the response to date beggars belief.</P>
    <P>It is a little over a decade since the Chernobyl disaster which had serious consequences for people living in the vicinity. Undoubtedly, many of the cases of cancer in Ireland and other parts of Europe have their genesis in that accident. It took a week or more for the managing director of BNFL to take the only course open to him and resign because of the falsification of records, which are important to any business operation but fundamental in a nuclear power plant where an accident could have catastrophic effects. However, I am mystified as to why it is only the managing director who fell on his sword. It is obvious others in the organisation are as culpable. The director of any company carries overall responsibility. Therefore, if something goes wrong with people to whom he has delegated areas of activity or responsibility he must accept the consequences. There is no doubt there are others in BNFL who should follow his lead in resigning.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the British authorities are not pursuing people legally. Surely negligence is always a matter of legal liability. Not only negligence, but the falsification of records over a three to five year period in a plant such as this raises the most serious issues regarding the integrity of its operation. It would be totally unacceptable if the British authorities did not pursue management. Perhaps there are state agencies there, whose responsibility was to ensure that regulations and legislation were complied with and to ascertain the methodology of falsifying the <Col N="823" /> records over a prolonged period. They must also take responsibility and be dealt with accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to enlist the support of member states in the European Union to act on the nuclear industry. I have grave reservations about the operations in many of the plants but where there is proven falsification, such as this, it should be met with the stiffest legal remedies. If an accident had occurred as a result of such operation I have no doubt those involved would be called to account. Is the law implemented only when dire consequences result from illegal activity in the mismanagement of the plants, or should it be triggered when it is known to the public and the authorities, who are charged with responsibility for the operation, that it has happened?</P>
    <P>This House should support the Minister of State in his unstinting efforts. Each time he has come before the House all sides have recognised his interest and commitment in dealing with this issue which is of major concern, and rightly so, to a large section of the population here and across Europe. We must ensure where there is not application of the highest possible standards that the only alternative is closure. This should not fall short of people being held to account through the legal system for any activities they undertake which puts the health of a large section of the population at serious risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious issue which we have discussed it in the House before. I remember the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, and his predecessors telling the Seanad it was not possible to mount a case against the British Government because of the lack of a legal basis and firm scientific evidence, but it seems to me that we have advanced considerably because of the recent disclosures. I am of the view that the House will support him in taking the firmest and most vigorous action because nuclear radiation is one of the most insidious forms of the penetration of national barriers. We do not see it, smell it or taste it but it is there operating against the health of the people. We are right to be concerned.</P>
      <P>We have taken a public posture but now we must put teeth into that posture. I remind the House that the Nordic countries, the Icelanders for example, who are considerably removed from the source of the dangers, except through the currents of air and water that come up against their landmass, have been much more aggressive than us. I note the Minister of State shaking his head but that is the perception. Perhaps it is incorrect and, if so, I am glad. I seem to see a much more vigorous position taken by them.</P>
      <P>I note my colleague, Senator Quinn, suggested there might be a political dimension to this and that there is a relationship to Northern Ireland. I hope that is not true because I think the matters are unconnected and should remain so as a matter of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> I wish to refer to a couple of matters in the Minister of State's speech. The most significant matter is the reprocessing because that is where much of the danger lies. I am not sure that it will survive economically because many of the customer countries have expressed concern and appear to be on the point of withdrawing their business. It is highly dangerous because, as the Minister of State has pointed out, the reprocessing industry separates more plutonium than the nuclear power industry is able to absorb and there is a continuing accretion of this dangerous material as a result of the industrial processes there.</P>
    <P>The question of falsification is very worrying and we always knew that. We have seen spokespersons of British Nuclear Fuels put out time and again barefacedly to lie to the British and Irish public and the international community. It is no less than a thundering disgrace that these people in positions of responsibility and authority should so calmly and glibly have reassured people on the basis of material they knew to be wrong. That is a betrayal of the trust of the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the report of the inspection makes 28 recommendations for improvement in safety management which the NII require BNFL to undertake to ensure the Sellafield site &ldquo;remains safe&rdquo;. I am sure that was a slip of the pen. &ldquo;Remains safe&rdquo;&ndash; does anybody imagine that the bloody thing has ever been safe? I certainly never thought it was, not since the days it was called Windscale and it blew up. Nobody has ever regarded it as safe and this makes it perfectly clear that it is not only not safe, it is positively dangerous. The people in control, those at the top, were covering up and the workers were so bored &ndash; that was the word used &ndash; they did not carry out the requisite checks and exposed the surrounding community and this island to very considerable danger, through human boredom. Their boredom would end pretty quickly if they continue this practice because there will certainly be a disaster of the scale of Chernobyl. Now we have a warning of it and warning of human error.</P>
    <P>I remember when the Chernobyl accident occurred we were told about out-of-date reactors that were inadequately and amateurishly supervised. We assumed in our innocence and were led to believe that this cavalier quality of dealing with nuclear radiation was something attributable to the Russians, a kind of corruption of the Soviet regime, not the kind of thing that could happen in a nice tidy, neat, well-regulated scientific western community. Yet here it is. People are so bored that they neglect the most basic elements of the safety procedures. I do not accept that anything they do will make it remain safe because nobody believes it is safe. On 27 February, the chief inspector insisted it was safe. Nobody believes that. The international customers, who are a pretty hard-headed bunch, know it is not safe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> The Minister of State, who has had meetings with Mrs. Liddell, the British Minister, is a diplomatic and charming man as the House is well aware. I hope he will be able to overcome these disabilities when dealing with British Ministers because they do not understand politeness, they think it is servility. What they need is a good kick in their MOX pellets, for want of a better word. The Minister says he respects the seriousness with which the UK Government is treating this matter. The UK Government is not treating this matter seriously or, if it is, it is a very recent development.</P>
    <P>We know that the Irish Sea is the most radioactive sea in the world. What a lovely present from our big neighbour. The stories of three headed fish are probably urban myths but people are seriously concerned about the danger of eating fish from the Irish Sea. Good middle aged Dubliners like myself used to relish the prospect of a Dublin Bay prawn. Now people are afraid of them because they fear they may be dangerous to health.</P>
    <P>Some time ago this House urged the Government to support a group of women from the Dundalk area whose children had mental impairments. There was a considerable increase in the incidence of Down's syndrome in that area and this House urged the Government to give the women financial help to take a case against the British Government. That did not happen although the Minister, I believe, met the women. It is extremely difficult, scientifically, to prove causation. However, people know in their bones that the increase in certain types of cancer and in certain rates of mental retardation among children, because they follow the same geographic pattern as the spread of discharges from Sellafield, are related to the poisons emitted by the Sellafield plant.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful for the British Government to introduce the argument of employment. Of course the people who get employment in the plant or in related industries might feel the pinch if the place were closed down but that would be a small price to pay for the well being of people on both islands. It would be an outrageous example of disproportion if the British Government were to suggest that, in order to keep the employment of a couple of thousand people, it would prejudice the health of a large population on these islands and throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious debate. No one welcomes the continuing discharge of radioactive effluent, the continuing reprocessing and the creation of materials which are dangerous and cannot be properly disposed of. I hope the Minister will, as actively as possible, do battle with those who are fiddling with safety precautions and belatedly implementing ineffective safety procedures.

      <P>Senator Quinn's Northern Ireland theory is very attractive and I can see how he might have arrived at it. However, there are no trade-offs between the Northern Ireland situation and the campaign against Sellafield. There is no timidity in my approach. I promise Senator Norris and others an increasingly robust approach henceforth. The only constraint arises from the difficulty in finding an international legal avenue through which we can pursue this matter. I am endeavouring to find such an avenue with the help of the Attorney General's office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for keeping the House waiting. I was under the misapprehension that this matter was due to be discussed at 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the work the Minister has done on foreign aid and for the Third World. She has a great record in that regard in the face of obvious difficulties among her colleagues. I do not think enough has been done by this Government and the international community in light of what has been happening in Mozambique. This is a national tragedy and there is no excuse for the international community not to take the necessary measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties arise when there is civil war and civil strife and Governments could be seen to be taking one side or the other if they intervene. Mozambique is one of the fastest growing econ<Col N="827" /> omies in the world, if not the fastest, and a country which was prospering and putting its economy together. The cyclones and flooding were ignored by the international community to start with &ndash; it was left to someone else. Aid trickled in and the sight of people living and surviving in trees because they cannot get out is one which we cannot possibly accept or excuse. The Americans, the world community and this country have a great responsibility. The delay in reacting to this crisis is inexcusable and people are dead as a result.</P>
    <P>When the crisis appeared to be easing we were told there is likely to be another flood. What will be done about that? The Americans are sending, I think, 100 boats to Mozambique today. Why did they not do this two weeks ago? This crisis has been ongoing for three and a half weeks. We should be ashamed of the farcical situation where there were only half a dozen helicopters to rescue thousands of people living in the trees. Are we doing enough? We have a special relationship with Mozambique in that it has been targeted for foreign aid for a long time.</P>
    <P>We either did not make the necessary representations on the world stage &ndash; we do not have the provision of helicopters, boats or the logistical capacity to help with the crisis but our voice was not being heard among the great powers where it mattered &ndash; or it was ignored. Lives could have been saved and could still be saved. It is not enough to say we will give money or that we have given a large sum of money. We have already ordered an additional £400,000. Money alone will not cure this problem. This is an emergency and immediate action on the world stage is vital. Will the Minister outline what representations were made by this Government at the early stages of the crisis, what was done and what was the response? Undoubtedly, someone is to blame for the slow reaction. There is late reaction but the floods will probably be over by the time it comes in. We need to know what happened in the White House, Downing Street and the rich countries when they realised the result of the rains in Mozambique.</P>
    <P>What is being done to prepare for crises? It is easy to say this crisis will be over in three or four weeks but there will be a massive job of reconstruction. GOAL estimates there will be one million people homeless. While the voluntary organisations are doing a tremendous job &ndash; GOAL, Concern and Trócaire are all doing what they can &ndash; with limited resources they can do very little. Governments on the world stage can react immediately, not just in respect of money, to such crises. They have let down the people of Mozambique. It is too late to do much but let us ensure such a crisis does not happen again. We should ascertain the reasons for the delay in resolving this problem and in coming to the rescue of the people marooned in Mozambique.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government welcomes this opportunity to inform the Seanad about the current position in Mozambique. Continuing torrential rains throughout southern Africa, aggravated by cyclone Eline, have led to overflowing rivers and pressure on dams, resulting in severe flooding in southern and central parts of Mozambique.</P>
      <P>We have all seen the pictures on television of helicopters winching people to safety from roofs and tree tops. The government of Mozambique estimates that 800,000 people have been affected by the flood and 300,000 people are in urgent need of food and other types of humanitarian aid. A large part of the population has been regrouped into camps or has no place to take refuge. As Mozambique is a sparsely populated country with many scattered and isolated communities, access to much of the population is difficult and in many cases the victims can only be reached by helicopter, given the flooded roads.</P>
      <P>While the international agencies operating in Mozambique had made preparations following the forecasts of heavy rains they were taken unawares by the sheer scale of the devastation, particularly after the onset of cyclone Eline and the flood waters draining from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. The reality of the devastation turned out to exceed even the worst case scenario for which they were planning. Every effort is now being made to step up the relief operation. It was confirmed today that the United States will send 900 troops along with helicopters, transport planes and small boats to the country. This is in addition to the helicopters, planes and boats that have already been provided at an early stage by South Africa, the United Kingdom, Malawi and private companies operating in the country. The Mozambique Marine Services are also working to rescue people by boat along the Limpopo and Save rivers.</P>
      <P>Since 1996 Mozambique has been a priority country for the Irish Government. In 1999 its budget allocation was £6.2 million and this year it is £7.4 million.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been involved in the emergency response from the beginning. We operate an area development programme in Inhambane, where we are the largest single contributor of aid to the province. Last year I visited the province and we have a strong connection and relationship with the local authorities. In the days immediately following the flooding our embassy in Maputo took the initiative and organised an aerial survey of the province. It was the first survey that assessed the damage caused in the area. The provincial governor of Inhambane accompanied embassy staff while they conducted the survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has committed a total of £1.4 million in aid to assist in the emergency and rehabilitation phases of this crisis. We are co-ordinating our response with the aid flowing in from other coun<Col N="829" /> tries and concentrating on meeting the priority needs of the thousands of displaced people. Yesterday, I announced an allocation amounting to £1 million. Originally these funds were allocated to long-term development activities in the province of Inhambane, one of the areas worst affected by the current crisis. Unfortunately, these activities have had to be deferred because of the devastation caused by the floods. This money will be reallocated for emergency and rehabilitation assistance including shelter, housing, rebuilding roads, re-establishing health care, education and other services and for agriculture and livestock re-supply.</P>
    <P>As Ireland Aid has an existing involvement in Inhambane, one of the worst affected areas, we are uniquely placed to play a leading role in the planning of emergency operations. Our head of mission in Maputo is Justin Carroll and earlier this week he travelled to Inhambane as part of an emergency needs assessment mission. He is keeping my Department updated on an hourly basis. He reported that the town of Nova Mambone, where lreland Aid has an ongoing programme of support for the health sector, is particularly badly affected. He also travelled by road to Pande and I am pleased to report that work undertaken under the priority country programme there last year is proving immensely valuable to the emergency operations.</P>
    <P>An Ireland Aid rehabilitated health centre in Pande is a centre for emergency support for 17,000 displaced people. It is suitable for this purpose because it has solar energy and a supply of uncontaminated water as a result of support provided by us last year.</P>
    <P>We have staff based in Inhambane and we have a close working relationship with the authorities and people at provincial, district and village level. By drawing on this expertise and through the money provided by the country programme and emergency provisions we have great flexibility and we are playing a strong and positive role in the emergency operations.</P>
    <P>We also provide aid to the region through our emergency humanitarian budget which is separate from our long-term development budget for 2000. In the days following the initial flooding and as a response to the devastation caused by it, an initial emergency allocation of £160,000 was given to the WFP. This money went towards the cost of its air-bridge operation in the Inhambane province. Money was also given to Concern, one of the Irish agencies operating in Mozambique, for an emergency relief project in Maputo. These allocations were made following advice from our embassy in Maputo who are continuing to monitor the crisis.</P>
    <P>Following the devastation caused by cyclone Eline I announced a further package of assistance amounting to £240,000. Part of this second allocation will go to WFP to assist them in what was originally a food drop but which has now become <Col N="830" /> a rescue operation. We are also funding fuel to allow the South African Air Force to continue delivering emergency goods by helicopter to the affected areas.</P>
    <P>From this point on programme expenditure will be administered with maximum flexibility to help Mozambique deal with this emergency. As soon as the problem has stabilised priority will be given to reconstruction and recovery activities as well as to the ongoing programme of supporting Mozambique's long-term development. It is important to keep a long-term perspective of our efforts to ensure that we are addressing the fundamental problem and not just its immediate symptoms, even when they are harrowing.</P>
    <P>Ireland is also providing assistance through our membership of the European Union. On behalf of the member states the European Commission made an initial grant of 1 million in response to the crisis in Mozambique and Botswana. A further package of 2 million was approved yesterday for emergency humanitarian assistance which will be managed by the European Community Humanitarian Office. This aid will enable ECHO's NGO partners to provide immediate relief supplies to the displaced and homeless. Mr. Poul Nielson, Development Commissioner and former Development Minister, is in Mozambique with the Portuguese Secretary of State assessing the problem. A third EU funding decision will be considered in light of his visit. The EU member states are co-ordinating their responses both in Brussels and on the ground so as to ensure the most effective delivery of aid.</P>
    <P>Today President Mbeki announced a meeting will be held in Pretoria tomorrow to discuss the emergency. It will involve South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana and Swaziland.</P>
    <P>As always the Irish people have been extremely generous in their response. As expected Irish aid agencies are being generously supported by the public who are always generous in their voluntary contributions to such emergencies. I agree with Senator Ross that it is up to Governments and that it is inappropriate to leave it to the voluntary contributions and empathy and sympathy of ordinary people. It is the responsibility of governments to respond strategically, competently and quickly to emergencies. I can say with my hand on my heart that Ireland has been involved in this crisis from the beginning because we are well placed as a long-term development partner with political and bilateral relationships with Mozambique. From the first day of this crisis Ireland has assisted in the emergency operation. We have urged other countries to do likewise at European and UN levels. UNESCO and all of the UN agencies are working in consort.</P>
    <P>It is true that there was a delay in galvanising the support of the international community commensurate with the disaster. Their efforts have an increased momentum because of the horrific <Col N="831" /> scale of this disaster. Much of the development achieved by Mozambique over the past ten years has been reversed by this disaster. As Senator Ross said Mozambique achieved incredible economic growth when compared to other countries in the region. It participated in its development with Ireland Aid, our strategic developmental partner. Much of our efforts in development have been reversed. However, Ireland is in for the long haul with Mozambique and we will stay with it as it builds up its infrastructure again.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Ross for raising this issue. I will be in a position to report progress as the days go by. This crisis is only in mid-stream. There is a danger that floodwaters in neighbouring countries may flow through Mozambique and exacerbate the problem for the people of Inhambane and the other provinces which have been so badly affected.  </P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her very adequate reply and I accept what she said about the Irish effort. Can she tell me, with regard to the delay, what representations were made by the Government to other governments? Were representations made to the United States of America, the richest and most resourceful country in the world? What were the responses? </P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make any representations to the American Government. We were very much involved with the Mozambican authorities. We have a very strong long-term relationship with the Provincial Governor of Inhambane where we have local staff. We worked immediately to help draft a strategy for the local emergency relief effort. While we work in concert with our European partners as a member of the European Union which co-ordinates its own strategy, we concentrated primarily on our bilateral effort with the Government of Mozambique, NGOs and UN agencies. There was a call for EU Development Ministers to meet but in an emergency it is far more productive to concentrate on delivering emergency assistance using existing channels rather than have 15 Development Ministers sit around a table in Brussels. When there are existing channels and competent mechanisms it is far better to concentrate with NGOs and UN agencies on delivering emergency relief rather than talk about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. This motion has nothing to do with personalities, but principles. I have no interest in who becomes the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund but I am concerned about how the appointment will be made and the part Ireland will play in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> There is currently a vacancy for the top job of managing director of the IMF which was held by a Frenchman, Monsieur Camdessus, who retired recently. It is one of the most important jobs in the world and affects the economies of both rich and poor countries. As such it is not too extreme or unreasonable to ask that it be awarded on merit but in the 50 years since the formation of the IMF and its sister organisation, the World Bank, there has been a cosy little arrangement between the United States and Europe to divvy up the top jobs between them. The top job in one will be filled by an American and in the other by a European. Everyone in the Euro-American cartel has therefore decided that the next managing director of the IMF will be a European.</P>
    <P>Being part of Europe we have a small say in this but I am sorry to say that we are doing precisely the wrong thing. What we should be saying is that the day of cosy arrangements such as these is gone. Such arrangements are neo-colonistic and imperialistic in nature and have no place in the world we wish to create in the 21st century. The Americans and the Europeans have been carving up the top jobs in bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank between them. This is not on any more. So far as the IMF and the World Bank are concerned, donor and receiving countries are part of the one world. That is not to say however that the head of the IMF should not be a European or an American but he or she should only get the job on merit, not because they are a European or an American. More to the point, someone should not be disqualified from the job because they are not of a particular nationality.</P>
    <P>We can and should say this because this is a republic which does not have a colonial past. We should be leading our European partners on an issue such as this instead of rushing in to support a corrupt and outmoded principle of selection. We should be totally against the principle of jobs for the boys and totally in favour of appointing on merit alone. There is a need to appoint on merit here, in Europe and in world organisations. To collude is institutionalised corruption in which Ireland should have no hand, act or part.</P>
    <P>For his own reasons the German Chancellor decided to use this appointment as a way of flexing his muscles against the Americans. The French and the British seem to be fairly cute because they were a little cool and could see what was going on. They ranged from being cool to lukewarm, even when their arms were twisted at the ECOFIN Council earlier this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>They had their own agendas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they had but Ireland did not need to have its little arm twisted. What did we do? We supported the German candidate from the start, although it had been clear for weeks that it would not be an easy run. It was clear to the dogs in the street that the particular <Col N="833" /> candidate would not be accepted by the Americans and that there would be a row about it. No doubt we did this to curry favour with the Germans and, if so, I condemn it.</P>
      <P>This is not the way international appointments should be made. We should adopt a principled position. Our driving principle should always be &ldquo;appoint on merit&rdquo;. I have nothing against the unfortunate and, according to the newspapers this morning, doomed German candidate but Ireland's support was not based on a considered judgment that he was the best person in the world for the job, rather it was based on a narrow, unprincipled mistaken view of Ireland's self-interest.</P>
      <P>Matters of this kind are far from trivial. A good example would be the collapse of the Seattle trade talks. In the case of the WTO a row continued for four crucial months as to who the new boss should be. Eventually an agreement was reached whereby the post was twinned. This bickering among the international community caused havoc at the WTO at which I am certain there will be problems. It did not help. Quality leadership at the IMF is critically important to the world economy and especially the developing world in which we claim to be so interested.</P>
      <P>We can, should and must rise above the petty self-interested international bickering that seems to surround appointments such as these. Surely we are in a position to lead our colleagues and partners to a better way of doing things. That should be Ireland's role in matters such as this. I was impressed by a quote I read in today's edition of the <i>New York Times.</i> It reads:</P>
      <P>If there is a single lesson from the search it is that the current process whereby interested countries nominate their own citizens for crucial posts and then use their diplomatic influence to support them needs fixing.</P>
      <P>I wish it was Ireland saying this but we are not. What we have been doing is jumping in and supporting the old outmoded system of selection which is based not on selecting the best person for the job but on divvying up the jobs for the different nationalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senator that in an institution as important as the IMF it is essential that we have the best person available as managing director. There are various ways in which this can be accomplished. Where there have been traditional understandings between shareholders regarding the post of managing director, where the environment in which the institution is operating is rapidly changing, where the institution is called on to make major changes and where the post has had a single occupant for the last 14 years, there will inevitably be some uncertainty as to how the process of choosing a successor is to be managed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> Before giving some background on the current situation I wish to clarify that it is not accurate to say that there has been a failed attempt by the European Union to impose a candidate for the post of managing director of the IMF nor it is true that the candidate put forward by the European Union is unacceptable to the international community. The tradition has been that the position has been filled by a European. Since the establishment of the Bretton Woods institutions there has been an understanding that the president of the World Bank would be an American and the managing director of the IMF would come from Europe. This is not surprising when one considers that America and Europe constituted the major shareholders in the institutions, and between them they still account for about half the shareholding.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement by the previous managing director, Mr. Camdessus, of his intention to retire, Germany proposed Mr. Caio Koch-Weser to be an agreed EU candidate. At last Monday's ECOFIN meeting, Mr. Koch-Weser was endorsed as an agreed EU candidate and the next stage will be for soundings to be taken at the IMF board to determine the extent of his support. There are currently two other candidates. The US has declared its opposition to Mr. Koch-Weser, but it has indicated its readiness to support a European candidate more to its liking, should one be presented.</P>
    <P>There is a wide spectrum of views on the future role of the IMF. These vary from a very restricted role in crisis resolution, through crisis prevention, to a wider view where the IMF is increasingly sensitised to the needs of the developing world. Ireland has consistently argued that the IMF should be more responsive to these needs and that it should work more closely with the World Bank and other international financial institutions to this end.</P>
    <P>Mr. Koch-Weser has experience over a wide range of areas which are current not only in the context of the World Bank but also the IMF and the international economic and financial scene generally. He has proven ability to effectively lead and manage both national and international institutions.</P>
    <P>I suppose the question is what is the current position. This is the start of a process, and the tradition and requirement of the institution are that the successful candidate should emerge by consensus so that he or she may have the full support of the membership in the difficult and challenging task facing the institution.</P>
    <P>There is no reason Europe should disqualify itself from presenting a candidate, providing that candidate is suitably qualified. It is up to others to agree or propose alternatives. The important thing is the final result and that we get a managing director who will have the backing of all the stakeholders. That is what we will work towards and I hope we will not have to wait much longer <Col N="835" /> for the appointment of a managing director for the fund.</P>
    <P>The motion asks us to give leadership towards a situation where nominations for such posts, more generally, are made on merit and not on the national or regional origin of the candidate. As I said at the outset, I support having the best person for the job. Within that guiding principle, it is inevitable that, in the event, some regard will inevitably be had to regional or national backgrounds in the interest of a geographic spread of responsibility, particularly where the institution concerned is composed of member states and regional groupings. There will be subjective views of what is relevant experience, and it will be difficult to consider such posts in isolation from one another. This is the reality. Having said that, I welcome the emergence and increasing importance of new groupings, such as in the developing <Col N="836" /> world, whose views are increasingly heard and heeded and who are also significant stakeholders in the international institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, for his reply. I understand the point he is making. I recognise that, as he stated, these appointments are usually reached by consensus, but it does not suit a candidate to be appointed on the basis of a vote.</P>
      <P>There is a need to take a different attitude rather than assuming that this is a prize to be won by one country rather than another. If two Americans are the best people for the two top jobs, what harm is there in their being appointed? It was known for months that this man was unlikely to be acceptable and, therefore, it seemed wrong to automatically support his candidacy.</P>
