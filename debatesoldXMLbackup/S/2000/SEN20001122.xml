      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to sanction the relocation of Ballytarsna primary school, Cashel, County Tipperary, in light of the severe danger to children attending the school from the heavy traffic on the N8.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Bonner of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to expand and improve the cancer services at Letterkenny General Hospital, by approving the hospital as a centre of excellence, in line with the report of the National Cancer Forum.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to expedite approval of the stage 3 submission from the board of management of Ballyfeeney national school, County Roscommon, as the improvements involved are urgently needed.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to clarify the future of Moneypoint generating station in light of recent ministerial statements relating to compliance with international environmental agreements, and the strategy, if any, that the Government is adopting to retain Moneypoint in operation.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children under the Health Act, 1970, in so far <Col N="806" /> as the powers of health boards and their members are concerned in regard to their function and powers, to provide services for the people under the said Health Act of 1970.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Dan Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Public Enterprise to include County Kerry in the new proposed national gas lines for the country.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Meara, Bonner, Finneran, Taylor-Quinn and Burke as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator O'Meara's and Senator Bonner's matters which will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Finneran, Taylor-Quinn and Burke may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise. I regret that I have had to rule Senator Dan Kiely's matter out of order as the Minister has no official responsibility in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, motion <i>re </i>the referral of the Chief Medical Officer's report on clinical trials to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Insurance Bill, 1999 &ndash; Report and Final Stages; and No. 17, motion 29, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., with business to resume thereafter if not previously concluded.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. Will the Leader give an opportunity for statements on the deregulation of taxis?</P>
      <P>In regard to another issue concerning the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, it was brought to my attention in a recent media report that the Government intends to introduce an anti-gazumping Bill. I am shocked by this as it is two years since we tabled an anti-gazumping Bill in the Dáil and tabled a similar Bill in this House, which is still on the Order Paper. In order to ensure this is dealt with, I ask the Leader to take First Stage of the Home Purchasers (Anti-Gazumping) Bill, 1999, which is No. 13 on the Order Paper. The Bill is entitled &ldquo;an Act to prevent vendors from unreasonably increasing the sale prices of real and chattel real residential properties&rdquo;. We intend to move First Stage of that Bill tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is important for us to have a debate on the changed regulations for taxis and to address the issues, including applauding the political courage of the Minister of State and looking at this in a fair-minded way so that people get some form of compensation where appropriate. However, this issue needed to be dealt with and many parents and other people in this city, such as the people who were standing with £20 notes in their hands trying to find taxis <Col N="807" /> a couple of months ago or those who tried to get home during the millennium celebrations, will be happy about that. Many things needed to be sorted out and this action shows that can be done. I hope it works out. Decent people who are out of pocket should have their cases listened to, but the two issues should be separated.</P>
      <P>There is industrial unrest everywhere, except in the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas have recently been benchmarked in a process very similar to the one now being offered to the rest of the public sector. The outcome of that is the Buckley report on salaries, which affects every Member of the House, including you, a Chathaoirligh. The Government should implement this first report now. That would set a benchmark for those who have expectations of the benchmarking process in that they would see that it can and does work. It should have all-party support.</P>
      <P>Like other workers, Members of the House should ask when they will get their money. I encourage them to take a trade union approach. One can be responsible and demanding; the two are not mutually exclusive.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Leader on No.1, a motion to refer the report on three clinical trials in children's homes for consideration by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. It was appropriate that he allowed a debate on this last week. Given that a number of us did not get the opportunity to speak, when will he allow the debate to continue? If an important matter is to be referred to a committee, it is appropriate the House should have the opportunity to debate it.</P>
      <P>The Leader proposes that Nos. 1 and 3 be taken today. He failed to mention No. 2. Those of us dealing with the Insurance Bill were given to understand that we would deal with No. 2 today. If it is not ordered for today we will oppose the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the clarification. I again call on the Leader to arrange a debate on industrial relations, especially in the area of public transport. Air and rail transport are affected. Road transport is also in jeopardy in view of the actions by taxi drivers this morning.</P>
      <P>We have also called for a debate on the teachers' dispute, which is gathering momentum, and the provocation by the Minister in his proposal to dock the pay to teachers for the withdrawal of voluntary work. It is a contradiction in terms to dock pay for work which is done on a voluntary basis.</P>

      <P>In the last three or four weeks I have asked for a debate on this matter. Will the Leader clarify when it will be held? There will be eight days of industrial action before the Christmas recess and it would be appropriate if we had the opportunity to discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, to attend the House to debate the deregulation of taxi services? We have debated it on a number of occasions. The issue has swung from one extreme to the other, from a situation where no taxi plates were being granted to total deregulation. The Government has made an absolute dog's dinner of this issue. The end result will be that large sums of taxpayers' money will be paid in compensation when the local authorities&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Dyslexia Association of Ireland recently published a survey on the num<Col N="809" /> ber of children with learning difficulties and special needs who have not received any assessment by the age of 11 years. It was also found that there was not proper remedial provision for children with learning needs. This is a very serious issue. I am aware the Department set up a task force to examine the survey in detail and I hope it will act on it. The friendly atmosphere which dyslexic children require at exam time has not been provided. The departmental task force should issue a statement which would allay the fears of children with learning needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is nothing to debate. The Minister must deal immediately with the illegality of withholding part of teachers' pay for work which they do voluntarily. This is a legal issue and the Minister must address it urgently in an effort to resolve the dispute.</P>

      <P>I endorse the call for a comprehensive debate on industrial relations. I want to draw attention to the unspeakable hardship being inflicted on people who depend on the train service to Dublin. I am thinking, in particular, of a significant number of people who have urgent medical and surgical appointments in the city. They have had to cancel these appointments this morning and on other occasions. I wonder whether the machinery of State is responding adequately or sufficiently quickly to the ongoing industrial relations dispute. It is unspeakable in a civilised society that people cannot get a train out of Cork, Limerick or Galway to carry out business or attend medical appointments in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Yes. A four and a half year old child who is unable to speak and has been on the waiting list for speech therapy for a year and a half was recently presented to me. I urge the Minister, through the Leader, to address this problem. I am sure that, as a humane man, he will be able to do something about what is a most unjust aspect of our tiger economy.

      <P>Regarding what Senator Ormonde said, one of the most successful booksellers in Kilkenny is dyslexic. One wonders how it is possible for a person who is dyslexic to be a bookseller, but the girl one meets in Khan's bookshop is dyslexic, so it is not a terrible problem, although it does constitute a certain handicap.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to come to the House for a debate on the BSE crisis. Over the past number of days the Minister negotiated a package in Brussels, but Irish consumers are extremely worried about the real position. We need to clarify for consumers the situation in relation to BSE. We have failed to do so in the past and I ask the Leader to request the Minister to come to the House as soon as possible, given the urgency of this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader when there will be a debate in the context of which we can raise the European rapid reaction force. I call for a debate because of an article in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times </i>in which Mr. Eyal, a proponent of the scheme, made it perfectly clear that military decisions will be taken outside the parliamentary context in Europe by bureaucrats and committees and, as he put it, &ldquo;eventually after the military decisions are taken domestic parliamentarians will be permitted to rubber stamp&rdquo; them. This should worry all of us on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> In regard to industrial relations disputes, my colleague Senator O'Toole said they were everywhere except in Leinster House. May I seek to disillusion him of that? They are here in Leinster House if he cares to look at No. 28 on the Order Paper which deals with the conditions in which we are expected to work in this place. We have actually been further and seriously disadvantaged. I will not read the entire item because, a Chathaoirleach, you have asked for brevity but I will make the one point that it is not even wheelchair accessible.</P>
    <P>I understand there have been calls for a debate on the taxi situation. I support those calls strongly. If it is simply a question of statements with or without a Minister, I do not mind. Half the time Ministers are not the slightest use anyway. I think of the debate on the Middle East where we did eventually scrape up a Minister who treated the House to a recital of a ten day old speech in which the date and the words &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; had been struck out and I wondered why it was so startlingly irrelevant. We do not need that kind of thing in the House.</P>

      <P>I always appreciate your strictures and follow your instructions faithfully. This Bill is timely as there is serious concern about the continuing severe increase in house prices and the lack of effectiveness of the Government measures. Will the Leader advise the House as to how the social and affordable housing provisions of the Bill which were held to be constitutional will work in practice? There is concern and questions are being raised throughout the country. I am wondering about the evenhandedness of it and whether the Department has called in county managers. Any advice the Leader can give the House will be appreciated.</P>

We have not heard anything about it. It has not come before the House and we have not been inundated with extra legislation. I have no idea what has happened to it. This Bill was based on the international convention of 1996 and passed in the Dáil in April 2000 and we have not heard a word about it since. Can the Leader tell us what has happened to it?</P>

      <P>Will the House have a debate on one of the most fundamental principles of democracy, that is, a fair application of the principles of law and justice? There is a contrast in this society between the impunity with which there was a blue flu and no one was penalised, the impunity with which taxis are blocking Kildare Street and no one is being clamped or towed away, and the fact that teachers who decline to do what was a voluntary task will have their salaries reduced. Taxis are now blocking the streets and someone has told the clampers to let them alone while they break the law.</P>

      <P>I fully support Senator Ormonde's comments in relation to dyslexia. The previous Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, did a lot of good in respect of the appointment of special needs teachers. The big issue at the moment is assessment because children cannot get proper help if they are not properly assessed in the first instance. This is a huge issue which the Department is not tackling.</P>
      <P>There is also the issue of special help with examinations. I have a child who is dyslexic and for whom I found it very difficult to get help. In many instances I had to pay privately for help. His junior certificate results this year proved that these students have the ability if they get help.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to discuss a specific aspect of dyslexia? A number of weeks ago the Minister announced the establishment of a task force on reading. Having discussed this matter with officials in the Department I realise why so little action has been taken on this matter. Departmental officials do not fully understand the problem. The task force is to deal with reading difficulties but anyone with a knowledge of dyslexia knows the problem involves writing and arithmetic as well as reading. When I tried to point this out to departmental officials they replied that the task force was established to examine reading difficulties only. I would like this House to debate the full issue of dyslexia.  </P>

    <P>I call for a debate on consistency of sentencing in criminal matters, particularly for the serious crimes of sexual assault and rape.

There should be mandatory and minimum sentencing, particularly <Col N="816" /> for parents, teachers and others in positions of trust who commit crimes against young vulnerable people. The sentence recently handed down was surprisingly light. I am appalled by the lack of consistency in this area and I call for a debate on this issue.</P>

We should offer our congratulations to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development who worked hard over the weekend to address some of the problems.

    <P>As regards the point made by Senator John Cregan, I welcome the hard work the River Shannon committee did to bring the report before us. I look forward to having it debated in the House over the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I will pass Senator Norris's views on the Army and the European dimension on to the Minister. Senator Coghlan had a query on the social housing provisions. They are included in the Act. Senator Quinn mentioned the Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill, 1998. This Bill has passed all Stages in the Dáil. I will inquire for the Order of Business tomorrow morning when it will be taken in the Seanad. Senator Ryan mentioned the telecommunications Bill. I know he has been inquiring about this Bill for a long time. I understand the Bill has now been withdrawn. Senator O'Donovan called for a debate on the consistency of sentencing. I can allow time for such a debate.</P>
    <P>The eight Bills which will be brought before the House and processed between now and the Christmas recess are the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill, 2000, the ICC Bank Bill, 2000, the Teaching Council Bill, 2000, the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000, the National Stud (Amendment) Bill, 2000, the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Bill, 2000, the Patents (Amendment) Bill, 1999, and the National Training Fund Bill, 2000. Senator Henry made many inquiries about the Mental Health Bill, 1999. It is at Committee Stage and is not expected to be finished in the Dáil until after Christmas.</P>
    <P>Since this Government took office, 135 Bills have been passed by both Houses, of which 45 were initiated in the Seanad. I propose to give the Senators a list of those Bills and the dates they were initiated. It speaks volumes for the amount of work we have done and the new direction the Seanad has taken during the lifetime of this Government that more than 30% of all legislation has been initiated in the House.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I am not prepared for this, we all know in our hearts what we want to say about this issue. I roundly condemn the taxi drivers for denying citizens access to the Parliament. To find Kildare Street closed was unbelievable. I know people believe they make a greater impact by what we euphemistically describe as &ldquo;direct social action&rdquo;, but the opinion of the people of Dublin and the regard in which they once held taxi drivers is at an all time low after this morning's carry on.</P>
      <P>A colleague opposite spoke about one law for some people and another law for others. There is no doubt that if any citizen of this city stopped their car in Molesworth Street and attempted to block Kildare Street, their removal would be rapid and the fine would be large for actually breaking a law. Today we saw a large number of people breaking the law. This was not an official union protest but an unlawful gathering which started with a member of the Garda Síochána being assaulted and a taxi driver being brought to Pearse Street Garda station. If there was a way, I would have brought them all to Pearse Street Garda station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a long festering boil that has finally been burst. If you operate a closed shop and make <Col N="819" /> deals within that shop, I think it is actually unlawful to expect to get a tax write-off for making a huge profit, as many taxi men have over the years. They started the system of putting a price on plates and of saying &ldquo;You cannot come in, unless you get the approval of the committee&rdquo;. I heard a taxi driver on the radio some time ago agree that this was the case.</P>
    <P>I lack sympathy for taxi drivers. The case was well put on Pat Kenny's show last week when it was acknowledged that the paralympians, whom we all rushed to praise and greet, could not be transported home from the national television station. The two companies RTÉ rang could not get anyone to respond who would take people with mobility disabilities. I have almost no sympathy for them.</P>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy for somebody who claims to have bought a plate three months ago for £75,000 and believes they are going to lose their home. How could anyone have been so ill advised as to pay out that money in the middle of a long drawn out dispute on how the taxi licensing issue would be resolved and in the face of an imminent decision which anybody could have told them would do away with that system? I am very happy that system is being done away with.</P>
    <P>I am coming across as distinctly unfriendly towards taxi drivers but I think I am reflecting the feelings of the people of Dublin who have been held to ransom week in, week out by taxi men. The latest I heard was that there was a complaint about the issuing of receipts. Members and other citizens must account for every penny we receive. Why should taxi people be any different? If a certain group is given a tax write-off because the capital loss involved is great, which it would be in some cases, it may open the floodgates. Another speaker mentioned the example of the owner of a corner shop who invested his life savings in his business, but the village was bypassed and he lost out. There is no compensation for such people. If this move goes ahead, it will open a Pandora's box in this area.</P>
    <P>On the plus side, the Minister of State showed courage. However, I suspect that if an opinion poll was taken today, the recent glowing results for the Government would be dimmed because, as Members noted on the Order of Business, there are ongoing rail and air strikes, taxi drivers are refusing to behave as good and lawful citizens and many other anarchic things are going on in society. People keep saying we have never had it so good, but there is nothing good about a system where public transport has come to a standstill and the streets have been taken over by an unlawful gathering.</P>
    <P>Regarding the new proposals, I welcome the £100 charge, a relatively small amount, that will be added to the £5,000 licence fee. I hope this will put an end to the blatant and awful discrimination <Col N="820" /> carried out by taxi men and some hackney people against the disabled. I heard a woman on the radio yesterday say how she had booked a taxi three days in advance of an event she wished to attend, but on the day the company rang to tell her it was sorry it could not bring her. She could not make a simple trip to the theatre.</P>
    <P>It is time people are made accountable and responsible. I am in favour of the issuing of receipts. An allowance should be made for a person who came into the business recently and may lose out on that level. However, I heard today of people earning salaries of £800 a week for the past number of years. Why is there any need to compensate these people?</P>
    <P>Ireland has been strangled by regulation. Every time we try to do something, we are prevented. An example of this is pub licences. This is not a free society and I am delighted about deregulation if it means the public will get a better service. Our role is to ensure that is the case.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the Minister of State's courage, although he may have to pay for it because it is obvious that some of his Fianna Fáil colleagues are already backtracking to a great extent. I heard one Fianna Fáil Member on the radio yesterday and if there was ever a case of trying to save Fianna Fáil in this morass, that was it. It would be remiss of me not to remind the House of the massive backing given to certain Fianna Fáil candidates in the last general election by taxi men. Perhaps the chickens have come home to roost to some extent.</P>

      <P>We must remember that we went to the local authorities who had been given certain rights in this matter. For years the four local authorities worked very hard in Dublin.

      <P>The Minister has been complimented for his courage regarding this issue. He has shown, as the Government has shown, determination and innovation in tackling many underlying problems throughout various Departments and issues. Public transport is one of the biggest challenges facing any Government. A dearth of imagination, investment and commitment was evidenced in the past by successive Governments ensuring the Irish economy of today, which is a role model for many developing countries, should find itself with an infrastructural deficit and shortcomings in our public transport system. I applaud any initiative which tries to improve the system and ensures that the quality of life of our people will have, as a necessary component, an effective and efficient public transport system.</P>
      <P>The deregulation of taxis was on its way. Like Senator Ridge I welcome the initiative. I would welcome any initiative the Minister would take to dismantle the dinosaur that CIE has become. The appalling disregard for commuters and anyone using public transport by those who earn their living from it and are charged with the responsibility of successfully running those operations is nothing short of being indictable.</P>
      <P>This all comes about through the Dublin Transportation Office. Various targets and commitments have been made within that to tackle, particularly in Dublin, the infrastructure and shortcomings in our transport system that I have alluded to. A tremendous investment has been made. By the end of this year more than £500 million will have been invested in the Dublin transport management and infrastructure projects within the DTI framework. A further £16 billion will be committed to improving transport infrastructure. All of that should be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For anyone who might say action should have been taken earlier, the consultative approach taken by the Minister and the Government and the setting up of a forum to examine the issue was welcome. This does not take from the fact that they had specific objectives which were clearly set out in An Action Programme for the <Col N="822" /> Millennium. They said then that they would introduce measures to increase progressively the number of taxi licences in Dublin as quickly as possible in order to ensure a proper balance between supply and demand in the market.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge is no longer with us. However, I remind her and other speakers who may come later that it is interesting to note that prior to the initiatives taken by the current Government there was no increase in taxi licences in the Dublin area by the previous Government, despite the fact that there was evidence of shortages in the number of licences and taxis available.</P>
    <P>The Government increased the number of taxis by 750 between 1997 and 1999. The Minister then took an initiative to increase the number of new Dublin taxi licences to 3,100, which was the subject of the court hearing. As a consequence of the court decision, we now have complete deregulation. That will be subject only to frequent and systematic testing of the cars. The Minister has taken an initiative in that area to ensure that any delay in implementing and accelerating the testing process will be dealt with by the Garda public service vehicle inspectors. The Minister has tackled an extremely thorny and difficult issue which has been with us for many years.</P>
    <P>Taxis must be fitted by January 2002 with taxi meters which are capable of printing automatic receipts. The new regulations also validate the operation of taxi sharing from taxi stands designated by local authorities for this purpose. This was brought in on a trial basis and, as many speakers have said, has worked quite well. It is good that all these initiatives are being put in place. New licences will cost £5,000 and the Minister should be applauded for giving a discounted rate of £100 to those applying for wheelchair accessible taxi licences.</P>
    <P>I empathise to some extent with taxi owners who invested in taxi licences over the past couple of years. I know some people deride them for not being very prudent or wise. However, given the growth in the economy, they saw this as an opportunity and they played under the rules that existed at that time. Where the State has knowingly allowed a situation develop over many years where taxi licences became a very costly asset, there should be some recognition of that. The Minister is talking about compensating the people who paid £15,000 for wheelchair accessible taxi licences which will now cost £100.</P>
    <P>Many Members have spoken today about not compensating taxi owners. I will not necessarily quibble with that. However, I approach this on the basis of my experience in the haulage industry, where there was a move in the 1980s from quantitative to qualitative controls. The enforcement of those qualitative controls was not done in the way enunciated at the time the legislation was planned and passed. One of the criteria laid down was that people would need a certain financial standing. Perhaps, to ensure a level playing <Col N="823" /> field, the proposed £5,000 cost of a new licence could be considerably increased so that those entering the market would have to show they have sufficient financial standing to undertake and provide the service required of them.</P>
    <P>From 2003, the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible, which is a move in the right direction. The Minister has called on the taxi industry to respond positively. While this may be difficult for them, there is nothing to be gained in the present climate by the kind of action they took today. They will lose the support and sympathy of those who might empathise to some extent with some of the arguments they put forward. Deregulation and competition are now the order of the day in every industry and one is sailing against the wind in not accepting and moving with that. The tax allowances indicated by the Minister, whereby people will be able to write off the cost of their losses over a number of years, is probably to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The whole taxi industry, particularly in Dublin, should be looked at from the point of view of marketing and presenting an image of Ireland. Taxis in other cities, whether they are black cabs in London, yellow cabs in New York or green and white cabs in Barcelona, are distinctive vehicles. We should encourage and give an incentive to taxis in Dublin to have a single livery which would set them apart and present a better image of the taxi service.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that many taxi drivers are providing a good service. The industry has come under criticism because of the shortage of taxis at crucial times, particularly Christmas and weekends. However, it is important, with deregulation, not to let fly-by-nights enter the business as that would do nothing for the image and status of the service. There needs to be a gradual transition to ensure the quality of service is maintained. However, the community is entitled to a proper and available service.</P>

Congratulations, apparently, are due to the Minister for taking these courageous measures. Did nobody listen to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning, where the Minister said he had no option? It is nothing to do with him. He was told by the courts that the taxis had to be deregulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen in this country a constant stream of misleading of taxi drivers by Fianna Fáil, giving them a false sense of security and saying it will be all right on the night. Had the courts not <Col N="824" /> reached this decision, this would not be happening and the taxis would not be deregulated. There is a misunderstanding here. No initiative came from the Government. The initiative came, as it so often does in this country, from the courts. It did not come from the Progressive Democrats either. Let us make that absolutely clear. There is nothing more sickening&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;than seeing Fianna Fáil when it is told to desert its former friends. There is a case for examining where the money came from for the Fianna Fáil coffers in north Dublin in the last election. It is only right and proper that we know whether the taxi drivers supported Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats or anybody else. If they had a lien and leverage, we should know that they are getting support for a closed shop simply and solely because they are bankrolling the Fianna Fáil Party in those areas. That is what we need to know. That is over now. It is completely and utterly finished, which I welcome.</P>
      <P>I have no sympathy whatsoever for the taxi drivers. This should have happened many years ago. The taxi drivers did not give two hoots about their customers when they were standing in the rain for hours in Dublin, as long as they were part of a closed shop and a monopoly. That closed shop and monopoly was supported principally by the Fianna Fáil Party for reasons which are best known to the individuals concerned and nobody else.</P>
      <P>I would like to qualify that in one respect &ndash; I feel some sympathy for those who made the appalling mistake of paying £80,000 or £90,000 for these plates. Any human being must feel that. However, I do not blame them so much. I blame the politicians who misled them into believing these plates were and would always be worth that. Someone who spends that kind of money and loses it all overnight has been lulled into a false sense of security. People are vulnerable to those sorts of assurances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this is the forerunner of an end to all cartels in this country. It is easy to talk about deregulation but it is harder to implement it because of the strength of the political lobbies. This one made absolute sense as supply and demand will match here. There is no doubt there will be more taxis on the road by Christmas because that was being stymied. However, I would like to see the Government taking initiatives in regard to publicans and banks and not being forced by external sources outside the political arena &ndash; as the banks are being forced at the moment by the European Commission &ndash; to <Col N="825" /> take decisions of this sort, which are absolutely necessary and only just.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross is quite right that this came about as a result of a clear court decision. What are the further implications of this? If Ministers have no right to restrict these kinds of licences, what implications does that have for the licensed vintners? There is a complete anomaly with regard to pubs which must be urgently addressed. It is ridiculous that a pub licence in, say, Kilkenny or Limerick is bought, the pub closes down and the licence is transferred to Dublin. That is crazy. It means that people are making money in a completely unprincipled way.</P>
      <P>I have some sympathy for the taxi drivers, but not especially for those who bought plates in the past six months. That appears to have been such a spectacular folly that folly must have its own reward. It is not one individual who has hit turbulent times but a group of people who are being disadvantaged. They have been given mixed messages. I have listened to the coverage on the radio. In one case, for example, somebody said he had to mortgage his house because the banks would not advance the money on the strength of the taxi plate, which it valued at zero. Simultaneously, the Revenue Commissioners were valuing them at approximately £73,000 for the purpose of inheritance tax.</P>
      <P>Of course I have sympathy for a widow who invested the proceeds of her husband's life assurance in a taxi plate to look after her children. As a compassionate people we must look after those who find themselves in this kind of situation. We cannot be completely heartless.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the criterion Senator Walsh is seeking to introduce where people must be of such financial standing that they can afford to spend more than £5,000. I thought this was a republic. Why are we concerned with such extraordinary displays of a class system? What does financial standing have to do with it? Much more important criteria are the capacity to drive properly, to be courteous to passengers and to know one's way around the city. I would much rather see those implemented rather than the financial qualifications Senator Walsh seeks.</P>
      <P>I understood it was a serious offence to block access to the Oireachtas, yet effectively this is what has been happening. Where are the clampers? They are usually all over the place attacking private individuals. Where are the police? They had an attack of blue flu so I suppose it would be a little invidious of them to go after people who are behaving in a similar fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Ross and Norris for allowing me to share their time. I congratulate those brave members of Dublin Corporation and the Members of the two Houses of the Oireachtas for their courage, more their recklessness and foolhardiness, in actually supporting over the <Col N="826" /> years the demand that licences be restricted. I cannot believe they allowed this situation to go on for so long or that there has not been a revolution.</P>
      <P>What has happened on the streets of Dublin in recent times has been deeply insensitive to young people, adults and anybody left waiting for taxis. We have seen the photographs and the television reports on what has happened as a result of this monopoly. Anybody who supports what the taxi men have been doing for years will not retain their seat in this House or in Dublin Corporation because there appear to be far more votes from those thousands of people who have been inconvenienced, stranded and left to wait in the rain.</P>
      <P>The consumer interest must be paramount. We were told that there must not be competition on the air route between Dublin and London because it would damage jobs and lead to other negative consequences. Yet, when competition was introduced it resulted in far greater numbers travelling at far lower prices and on a far better service. Similar consequences followed when the telephone system was deregulated. We must deregulate.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Ross, kind as he was to allow me share his time, regarding the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. For the past couple of years he has been signalling his intention to do this but he has been stymied. He needed the help of the courts to achieve what he wanted. I congratulate him on his ability to outline what has to be done.</P>
      <P>I recently visited Singapore and Hong Kong which, with Ireland, are regarded as the most economically free of states. I discussed our taxi services with a person from Singapore. He knew what was involved. He told me he was part of a conference, involving 1,500 people, that was planning to visit Dublin two years ago. A delegation visited the city to plan the conference, but he said Dublin almost lost it because our taxi services let them down. They could not believe they were unable to get from the airport to their hotel by taxi. At a restaurant he booked a taxi to arrive in half an hour but was told he could be waiting three or four hours.</P>
      <P>Not only the concerns of our consumers but the long-term economic prosperity of the country depends on avoiding all these cartels and controls. They are still being implemented in other businesses. For example, the chemists recently managed to secure a regulation preventing competition. Some years ago in Holland the grocers &ndash; more power to them &ndash; did their best to have a licence system because they said it would be unfair to allow competitors enter their market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More importantly, the crimes committed on the streets of Dublin, especially those of assault and civil disobedience, have occurred because of the many hundreds of people, especially young people, who have no way of getting home due to the lack of transport. While there has been a lack <Col N="827" /> of public transport the cartel imposed by taxi men has been especially prevalent. It is time something happened, as at last I believe it will. I congratulate those who have said it is time to end this and other cartels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not surprise Senator Ross to hear that I applaud the action taken by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, in deregulating the taxi market. At its meeting this morning the Progressive Democrats parliamentary party expressed its total support for his action. Senator Ross said the initiative derived from the courts, but Senator Quinn rightly said it was the Minister of State's intention to deregulate prior to the involvement of the courts. The matter was referred to the courts and a judgment was made which has allowed the Minister of State to proceed.</P>
      <P>I cannot think of any capital city in the world where one would be required to stand at 12.30 at night and wait for one hour for a taxi. That happened to me and many others at the corner of St. Stephen's Green. When taxis arrived the queue eventually moved. It underlines the fact that we do not have enough taxis. It is implausible for some taxi men to suggest that problems only arise at weekends. Even if that is the case they should be addressed.</P>
      <P>An aspect missed in this debate is that deregulation will inevitably lead to the growth in the market to such an extent that those who have expressed the greatest fears today will have nothing to fear. There will be enough business for all of them. Let them go out and work for it.</P>
      <P>Many of the people doing the most complaining on the airwaves today are the authors of their own misfortune. Had they taken a more flexible and reasonable approach at the outset we would not have got to the point where they believe their businesses have gone. This is underlined by the fact that people paid between £70,000 and £80,000 for the right to produce. If we attach a capital value to the right to produce, as has happened in the case of pubs and in other restricted areas, it automatically means the market demand is not being met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate to apply reasonable standards to taxi cabs. I took a taxi to Dublin Airport and made the mistake of sitting beside the driver. The taxi metre fell into my lap ever time the taxi braked. While such situations may provide a source of entertainment and colour to visitors, it is reasonable to expect that standards should be imposed. On a recent trip to Washington some people took a taxi to a shopping centre outside the city. The taxi driver undertook to bring them home at 4.30 that afternoon and he did so. On the morning of the day we were to fly out a taxi man undertook to collect us at whatever time we wanted and he did so. This illustrates that compe<Col N="828" /> tition was working to the benefit of the consumer and that people were prepared to compete properly to ensure that an adequate service would be provided. Such a service is totally overdue; it should have been available to people in the capital and in other towns and cities throughout the country heretofore.</P>
    <P>I live in Newbridge and we are all aware that there has been an explosion in the use of hackneys and taxis throughout Irish towns. Young people no longer do what they did 20 years ago, namely, go out to the pub and drive a car home under the influence of alcohol. They go to pubs and discos and take taxis home afterwards. When the market is deregulated, people will compete with each other and will provide the type of service to which customers are entitled. The Minister is to be commended for serving the public good, which is the function of these Houses, and for ending the chaotic situation in Dublin once and for all.</P>
    <P>The issue of compensation has arisen and it has been indicated that compensation will be offered by way of tax write-offs. One might ask whether some of the people who were so resistant to this idea this morning have such a degree of standing and compliance with the tax man that they would welcome regular and legal write-offs. The issue of capital taxes arises in respect of some of the huge sums paid for taxi plates, which were tradeable assets, on the open market.</P>
    <P>I listened to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Marian Finucane Show&rdquo;, the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; and &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; on RTÉ today. Joe Duffy's programme was the first one on which consumers had an opportunity to air their views as only the taxi men had outlined their views throughout the morning. Do the plain people of Dublin not have something to say about this? Does RTÉ not have a responsibility, in the interests of balance, to ask members of the public for their view when they are carrying out vox pop with taxi drivers in Temple Bar? </P>
    <P>I do not have a problem with taxis blockading Leinster House and do not share the view that this is unacceptable, although I am aware it is illegal. Farmers, trade unionists and others who protest outside the gates also break the law as they are obliged, by law, to protest outside half a mile of the gates; I am open to correction on the exact distance. The law is infringed all the time. If taxi drivers wish to make a democratic protest, that is fine with me. However, it is not acceptable for them to block Dublin Airport, the city's commercial heartland. If they are going to target people, let their target be political and let them target us. It is not acceptable that ordinary people are being impeded in going about their business and I would urge the gardaí to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Members have an absolute right, under the Constitution, not to be impeded in their passage to the Houses of the Oireachtas and there are very good reasons for that. A single <Col N="829" /> vote could lead to the fall of a Government and it would be wrong to impede a Member coming to the House to cast his or her vote. However, I do not have any particular difficulty in a democracy with people making fools of themselves outside the gates of Leinster House.</P>

Members on the opposite side have asked whether we have a responsibility to subsidise people or protect their interests if the law changes and a business collapses. The fact is that the decision in regard to taxi licences is affecting a significant number of people who have made a huge investment in their future and who have seen that investment being depreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> Reference was made to tax and it was implied that if taxi drivers were paying their full taxes, they would reap the benefits of a tax write off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was implied. I have no particular reason to support taxi drivers but I am merely trying to balance the argument. I have been stuck outside Leinster House, unable to get a taxi, and have missed trains as a result. I have had to pick up my daughter at 3.30 a.m. in Eyre Square in Galway because she was unable to get a taxi, having waited an hour and a half for one. However, there are issues which we must consider in regard to taxi drivers which have not yet been discussed.</P>
      <P>We must, for example, consider the threats taxi drivers face at night. I told one taxi driver that I thought taxi drivers went into hiding at night, disappearing at midnight because they had their money made. He said I was being unfair and that while taxi drivers recognise the demand, they sometimes do not want to pick people up at ranks. People, many of whom have been drinking, accumulate at these ranks at the same time, having come out of pubs, discos or fish and chip shops. The taxi driver to whom I spoke pointed out that if a driver were to drive to the top of a queue where a girl is waiting for a taxi, three men could pull her out of the way and sit into the taxi. He said he could not turn around and throw the men out because he would feel threatened. The shortage of taxis is combining with other social forces to create this problem. Members will be aware of the case in Galway some years ago where a female taxi driver was attacked and killed. Nobody has yet been charged with her murder. This is an example of the terror taxi drivers can face.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the taxi industry was protected over the years. I am in complete agreement with the concept of more taxis. Deregulation will result in a sudden influx of people seeking licences and nobody will make a decent living for a while. Standards may drop until such time as market forces come into play. Some people will then be able to make a realistic living and others will drop out in the face of competition.</P>
      <P>There is no such thing as a &ldquo;wheelchair friendly taxi&rdquo;. A wheelchair friendly taxi is one which a disabled person, through his or her own effort, can board and sit in a safe position. Such taxis do not exist. I am aware that taxi drivers who received cheap wheelchair taxi licences &ndash; the Minister's proposal will make these licences even cheaper again &ndash; bought and modified vehicles for the purpose of making them wheelchair friendly but that purpose is not fully served. Where people invest huge amounts of money in making a taxi genuinely wheelchair friendly, the Government should subsidise them through a reduction in VTR or by some other method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> There are a number of other issues I would like to raise but, unfortunately, we are running out of time. There are two sides to every story and we should listen to both of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Coogan for sharing his time. It is unacceptable to have cartels and monopolies operating to prevent free and fair trading in a booming economy. It is a sad day when decisions are made in the courts, not in this House. There was a lack of courage on the one hand and, on the other hand, the creation of obstacles in the way of policies made by legislators and local authorities which would have ensured such a situation did not arise.</P>
      <P>The problem largely arose when in 1995 the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, quite rightly handed over responsibility for the regulation of the number of taxis from the Department to local authorities. In Dublin the four local authorities came together and quickly devised a mechanism for the rolling introduction of new taxi plates for the entire metropolitan area and decided to begin with 800 taxis over a two to three year period. That was fought tooth and nail by the taxi federation, led by the spin doctor extraordinaire, Frank Dunlop, who was on a retainer from the federation. The main spokesperson was Deputy Ivor Callely.</P>
      <P>We introduced the system and it was up and running, but in the general election of 1997 taxi federation members on the north side of the city carried Fianna Fáil advertising all over their cars with the names of Fianna Fáil Deputies. The local authority tried to increase the number of taxis available but we were once again stymied when the Taoiseach decided to set up his own committee, in opposition to the regulatory powers granted to local authorities, making it almost impossible for us to increase the number of taxi plates. The four local authorities in Dublin requested the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to allow hackney drivers use bus lanes, but the Minister refused and continues to refuse.</P>
      <P>It must be stated that there is political cronyism and vested interest in this area. People in this House on the Fianna Fáil benches who own taxi licences have spoken on behalf of taxis and have not declared those interests.</P>

      <P>I wish to put on record that the situation should not have arisen and that it is a very sad day for democracy that it is the courts rather than we who are now directing policy. This has happened because there has been direct political interference in the matter.</P>
      <P>There are serious questions to be dealt with, including the new standards which will exist and wheelchair accessible taxis, which have gone by the board. The local authorities had determined that in future taxi plates would only be granted to taxis which were wheelchair accessible, but the Minister has thrown that by the wayside and has said it will be dealt with at some future date. We do not know whether that issue will be addressed.</P>
      <P>Quite clearly people will lose considerable capital assets, having bought taxi plates for up to £90,000. In the 1970s and 1980s many people invested their redundancy money in a taxi plate. Many people expected the value of their taxi plate would contribute to their pension. These are serious matters as families and earnings are affected.</P>
      <P>I am not in favour of deregulation but rather of regulation, which is the way forward. Opting out of regulation results in total deregulation&mdash;</P>

      <P>This debate has so far centred entirely on taxis. We should place it in the context of overall public transport in the city and the entire country. Iarnród Éireann has basically come to a standstill and there are serious industrial relations difficulties in Aer Lingus. I join my colleagues in congratulating the Minister on taking steps to deal with the matter. They might not be to the satisfaction or liking of the other side of the House, but he has dealt with them and given an indication of the major steps forward being taken. If he had not taken these steps, or if they had no impact, taxi drivers would not have taken to the streets. We will be thankful to the Minister for the steps he has taken. The war has not been won, but hopefully this battle has been won and will be a forerunner of a number of other battles across public transport.</P>
      <P>The people are in need of re-education in terms of public transport. In order to re-educate them as to the value of public transport we must put in place a viable public transport system. This is a major step forward in that regard. People were re-educated in terms of drink driving, which was an unacceptable norm in society. Dramatic changes were brought about seven or eight years ago in the run up to Christmas. There were no changes to the law, but the law was rigorously implemented. It changed for all time the attitude of society to drink driving and its attendant problems. This was one of the major contributors to the boom in the taxi industry which took place over the past seven or eight years, and it has contributed inadvertently to the major difficulties a small minority of taxi drivers and their families are experiencing today in relation to recent investments in taxi plates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxi business is like others in that it must be subject to legislation, a tax code and market forces. Deregulation is essential and is to be welcomed. We must also remember that taxis are a public service which exist to serve the public. Historically, the taxi industry, particularly in Dublin city, has singularly failed to do this. Now at last standards that are acceptable to the public can be set. I look forward to a quality service being provided by the Dublin taxi industry. I look forward to a clean vehicle, a near immediate service and a receipt for each fare. I suggest also that a worthwhile test that may be introduced by the Minister when considering his qualitative options <Col N="834" /> is an Irish version of the famous London taxi test of knowledge. We have had too many disaster stories of the scenic route being taken by taxi drivers particularly in the city and in my own part of the city in the region of the airport. I am of the view that a knowledge test should apply on an annual basis in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>In this instance I am disappointed to find I am in agreement with some of the points made by Senator Coogan. I understand the process as it occurred and the situation in which we now find ourselves but we are solving a Dublin problem to the detriment of the rest of the country. In Galway there is no doubt that we need a number of additional taxi licences but we cannot sustain a totally deregulated market in a city the size of Galway. People may say they are foolish, and they have been foolish but in recent years many people invested in taxi plates, remortgaged their houses, put their pension into one particular occupation, served the public for the past two or three years and are now facing wipe out. This country has never taken away the livelihood of any man or woman. That is where I have a difficulty.</P>
      <P>While I accept what the Minister is doing and agree with his key objective which is to provide more taxis and a better service to the public, I disagree with the manner in which these regulations have been implemented. At this point I am in disagreement with the fact that the mechanism for dealing with the issues raised in relation to compensation and the money invested by many has not been published. The regulations and these mechanisms should have been dealt with together. Even when the Minister for Finance identifies exactly what he intends to do to take care of taxi drivers, their families, their widows and pensioners they will have suffered for a number of weeks between now and budget day without knowing what is in store for them. I have great sympathy for those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Minister had decided as and from now, not because of the Dublin taxi situation, as a gesture to the disabled, who have an equal right of access to all public services, that if taxi plates are to be introduced, taxis which have better access for the disabled would also be introduced. That is vital. That line should have been drawn in the sand today and not in two or three years' time. I am disappointed that has not happened. This matter could have been handled a little better. I am slightly critical of the Minister. We should have had a proper notification period in relation to deregulation and a clear mandate as to what would happen to those who may have invested recently to give them a sense of security and a little comfort. We are not in the business of making people bankrupt or taking away their livelihood. There are people outside the greater Dublin area who have mortgaged and remortgaged their houses, have payments on an asset <Col N="835" /> which has no value, who may have been foolish to invest in it, went out on their entrepreneurial spirit, provided a living for their families, provided a service for consumers on the ground and are now facing a complete wipe out. I have great sympathy for those people. As a Government we have a responsibility to ensure nobody loses out to that extent from deregulation.</P>
    <P>It is important to have more taxis, a better standard of taxi and disabled accessible taxis. We have to be mindful that Dublin is not Ireland and the solutions proposed to address the needs of the capital city do not always work outside the Pale. I asked the Minister for Finance earlier today to look at this matter when considering the mechanisms to be delivered on budget day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>In this new taxi era which lies ahead I hope the greatest possible attention will be paid to the character of those who drive the taxis. I am sure I am not the only Member who was horrified a couple of years ago to find that the man who was convicted of the sexual assault and impregnation of the child in the X case was driving a taxi. This was discovered because a young girl who had lived near that family took the taxi home one night. To her horror she found it was the man who had been convicted of a very serious sexual offence. I do not think people who have been convicted of serious sexual offences, or any sexual offence, or violent offences are suitable to drive taxis. I wonder what investigation takes place about their general character before licences are issued.</P>
      <P>The financial situation is serious. The taxi should be in a roadworthy condition. On a recent radio programme &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; people phoned in to say their young daughters were offered cheaper or no fares for sexual favours. It is right that taxi owners should say these people should be reported to the relevant authorities. I think taxi owners have to police their own people carefully. The last thing a girl trying to get out of a car and into her house will be looking for is a pencil and a piece of paper to write down the name of the taxi. We must make a serious effort to ensure those who are driving taxis are of the highest social calibre. I am sure these people are unusual but the taxi drivers themselves will have to take note of those who are taking young people around the city at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt if the taxi drivers will be reading the deliberations of the Seanad but if so there is no point in 'phoning me or my family to let me know their views on the taxi situation. As my husband and I have explained to them I can do nothing for them. They think I am Mary Harney. Indeed, we have told them we doubt if Mary Harney can do anything for them either. There is no point in 'phoning me. I have suggested other TDs who speak out on their behalf that it would be better <Col N="836" /> if they 'phoned them. I would be grateful if they desisted from getting on to me.</P>

      <P>I will be brief. I wish to add my tuppence halfpenny worth to the debate. I wholeheartedly welcome deregulation in this area. Listening to some of the contributions from the other side of the House, it is imperative to put the record straight. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and my party, the Progressive Democrats, have always been in favour of deregulation of this area because everyone is aware of the problems people have had to find taxis in recent years. As a compromise, about 12 months ago, the proposal to issue a new licence to those who already held a licence was put forward. The hackneys, as is their constitutional right, challenged that point in the courts. When the courts issued their findings last week they said the issuing of licences had to be deregulated. I welcome that move and the Minister's speedy action on that court finding which will lead to a situation where hundreds of thousands of people will now have access to taxis. We will have more taxis and supply and demand will regulate itself in due course. It is important to allow supply and demand work in this area.</P>
      <P>Another issue was brought to mind on Monday when I called to a garage to get bulbs changed in my car. There was a taxi driver in the garage who was having work done to the brakes in his car. This emphasises how important it is for taxi drivers and others to have cars in a roadworthy condition. The regulations lay down that cars must be tested regularly and I compliment the Minister of State in this regard.</P>
      <P>Quality of service is an important issue. Senator Henry made a point about the quality of drivers and how they are vetted. I would not like it to go out from this House that, because of the actions of one particular man, all taxi men should be painted with the same brush. The vast majority of taxi drivers do a good job and will continue to do so. When this issue has settled down, the demand for taxis will grow and everyone will be able to earn a living from the business.</P>

      <P>Taxi drivers paid what they did because they knew the business was worthwhile. These people were not forced to buy a taxi licence. Taxi licences did not originally cost that type of money. At one time it cost approximately £1,000 to obtain a taxi licence. Because of the value, taxi drivers themselves put up the price, not the Government or anyone else. This is similar to the situation in relation to house prices. House prices in Dublin are increasing because of the demand. Taxi licences are expensive because of the demand for such licences. Why are taxi drivers afraid of deregulation? People who seek a taxi licence have the market well tested and know they can make money. This is why others will try to obtain licences.</P>
      <P>I spent a weekend in Austria two weeks ago and was amazed at the quality of the taxi service. The taxi drivers were well dressed and wearing ties. I am not asking taxi drivers in Dublin to wear ties but they would need to improve their dress code. I like to get into a clean taxi if I am paying big money, which is what we are paying. Sometimes when I get a taxi to the railway station or Dublin Airport, every time the car goes over a pothole I can feel the sensation going right up my back because the car is a banger. However, this is not always the case.</P>
      <P>Much needs to be done in relation to this issue. I have no sympathy for taxi drivers. I totally oppose compensation for these people and I wholeheartedly support the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, in his efforts.</P>

      <P>As a result of this dispute, taxis in Dublin will not be displaying Fianna Fáil logos during the next election.</P>
      <P>Deregulation of the taxi service is a knee-jerk reaction by the Government to a crisis in the city. Like the housing crisis, while the Government is trying to solve a crisis in Dublin it is creating a problem down the country. Whatever relevance deregulation may have in Dublin, it has no such relevance in rural Ireland. I come from a small town of approximately 10,000 or 12,000 people and, as a member of the local authority, I issued approximately 45 taxi licences in recent months. The general consensus among the taxi industry is that 45 licences is more than adequate for a town with a population of approximately 10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of deregulation, people who work during the day will moonlight at night. These people will cream off the lucrative taxi business during the week-end from Friday night to Mon<Col N="838" /> day morning. Many taxi drivers say they may stay at home during the week because there is no business. The Minister of State's reaction is ill-conceived and badly thought out. It is a knee-jerk reaction to a particular crisis in Dublin where taxis are in short supply. One of the reasons for the problem is that there is not a proper public transport system. If one travels to any country in Europe one will find a proper public transport system. There is no problem getting a taxi in London because there is an underground system and a proper bus service in the city. There is nothing in Dublin. When I came up the quays today at approximately 11 a.m. I passed a procession of approximately 20 articulated trucks travelling in a line to Dublin port. This does not happen in any other city in Europe. This is exacerbating the traffic problem in Dublin and the crisis the Minister of State tried to solve by way of deregulation. Deregulation will not solve the problem. There will be total anarchy in the lead up to Christmas because the Carriage Office will not be able to deal with the number of applicants. That office can only deal with approximately 150 applications a week. I believe the public will have a nightmare experience in Dublin this Christmas as a result of this action so close to the festive season.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald on many points. However, I do not agree with him on the issue of compensation. One person remortgaged his home and invested £75,000 or £100,000 in his business in anticipation that the business would be passed down to future generations in the family. He now discovers that as a result of a ministerial order his livelihood has disappeared overnight and he will receive no compensation. If the taxi industry was forewarned four years ago, the market would have started to regulate itself and this would have reduced the cost of taxi licences over a period of four to five years. We live in a free market economy and if this action had been anticipated, the market would have regulated itself and people would not be in this dire position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 26 and 27, insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;43DD.&ndash;Regulations under section 43D shall prohibit an insurer from seeking, obtaining, using or retaining information relating to genetic testing of an insured or proposed insured.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I went into this matter in great detail on Committee Stage. It is causing great concern within the medical profession and I thank the Minister of State's officials for conversations I have had with them on the subject. However, the problem has not been resolved.</P>
      <P>While environmental factors are extremely important in the development of disease, we are realising more and more that a genetic predisposition can be important in some cases. Problems can arise if an insurance company tries to make people disclose their genetic information, as has happened in England. Some states in the United States have outlawed this, as have some countries in the European Union. It may be worthwhile for a particular person to have genetic screening to see if he has a predisposition to a certain condition. That person may be able to take action which would ameliorate the effects of the predisposition or do something about environmental factors which would be important in the development of the condition. Such a person may be able to undergo frequent screening which would help him to detect the condition early. If such a person is fearful that because he has had screening his chances of getting life cover would be diminished, he would not be encouraged to undertake the screening. This possibility is giving serious concern.</P>
      <P>The last time I spoke on this matter the Minister of State said he had noted the letters in <i>The Irish Times </i>from Dr. David McConnell and co-workers in the Trinity College department of genetics and from Professor Andrew Greene and his co-workers in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin. There are concerns in other departments of molecular medicine about genetic screening being used by insurance companies in a way which would not be beneficial to people for whom genetic screening might be a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has since been another letter in <i>The Irish Times </i>in which members of the Huntington's Association of Ireland express their anxiety that young people in a family with a predisposition to this genetic condition may feel themselves forced into being tested and would face 20 years of misery before they develop the condition. Hunt<Col N="840" /> ington's disease is a serious condition for which there is no treatment.</P>
    <P>We may also find children being screened. This would be very serious because they cannot give informed consent. The ethics of this situation are very doubtful because there may be something in a child's medical records which he or she may not wish to know about.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider accepting this amendment. I know his heart is in the right place on this matter but I am sure he will go on to higher things and when he is in charge of the Department of Finance I will still be here, grappling with the Insurance Bill. I am quite sure the Minister of State would take immediate action if he saw something amiss but others may be slower about doing so. We have all expressed our confidence in the Minister of State but we must look to the future.</P>
    <P>I ask him to consider accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this amendment. This is the most important Report Stage amendment. The case for it was put strongly on Committee Stage. Insurance is important for people's lives. If a mechanism can be used by the insurance industry to deter or prevent people from having a policy or to limit the application of a policy, I am sure it will be used fully and widely.</P>
      <P>It would be a shame if genetic testing was required for an applicant to get insurance cover. There has been an outcry in the letters pages of newspapers, particularly of <i>The Irish Times</i>, from professionals in this area in universities and hospitals. It is feared that genetic testing might be abused and exploited against people looking for insurance.</P>
      <P>Constant progress is being made in science and medicine. It may be possible in the future to deal with diseases transmitted through a defective gene for many generations. It has been possible in the past to deal with genes. The best example of this is cancer. Cancer was a fatal disease but the majority of cancers can now be treated and people can live full lives as a result of the treatment they receive. Tuberculosis is another example. It was a killer in the past but it has now been eradicated. Many other diseases have also been eradicated by penicillin. Huge advances have been made in medicine and constant progress is being made. It would be unfair if genetic testing was regarded as a prohibition or a deterrent for insurance purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw a fascinating programme last week on Iceland where many people have a limited genetic background because of the way the country developed and its small population. It highlighted the fact that a faulty gene, which came from a common ancestor a number of centuries ago, had given rise to certain cancers, particularly among female descendants. Because the gene was traced back to its origin, it is now possible to deal with it and to prevent the cancer being transmitted to <Col N="841" /> future generations. By focusing on this, huge progress will be made in improving genetic defects.  </P>
    <P>As Senator Henry said, our genes depend on our diet and on the environment. Our state of health is part of our total experience. Our diet and environmental conditions have more impact on our health than our genes. People might not go for medical testing or they might delay it if this is the perception. There are many reasons we should be careful not to create a genetic underclass by identifying genetic testing as something that could be used by the insurance industry against a person seeking insurance. I urge the Minister of State to consider this amendment which is appropriate to this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their positive contributions and the sincerity and commitment they have displayed in their contribution on this important amendment. This amendment provides that insurers be inhibited from &ldquo;seeking, obtaining, using or retaining information relating to genetic testing of an insured or proposed insured&rdquo;. This proposal was discussed on Committee Stage in the Seanad and it was debated here on Adjournment debates and in the other House on at least two, if not three, occasions. I also answered questions on the issue in the other House an hour ago. I fully understand the concerns which have prompted the Senators to table this amendment. I have considered the matter further since our last discussion in this House. However, it would be premature to legislate on this matter until a more thorough examination of the issue has been completed.</P>
      <P>Senators are probably aware that the Irish Insurance Federation is finalising a code of conduct for its members. I expect the code will be observed by any insurers active in the Irish market. The code, as drafted, would forbid insurers to require clients to undergo genetic testing. It would also prevent them from offering rates lower than the norm to clients who are willing to undergo genetic testing. The ethos and principle of insurance is based on pooling the risks. We do not want and will not allow a situation to prevail whereby disadvantage would be imposed on some and advantage created for others. This is an important safeguard which prevents the introduction of genetic testing by the back door. Thanks to this code, we now have time to consider all the issues in relation to insurance and genetic testing and come to a well researched position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My officials have begun a process of consultation initially with public bodies so that we may consider all the relevant matters, including contributions from the scientific and health communities. I am conscious of the importance of funding health and of voluntary genetic testing in certain circumstances. I note the point that in the majority of cases environmental factors are of <Col N="842" /> more significance than genetic inheritance for the purposes of longevity.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what Senator Henry said about the field in which she is a professional and what Senator Costello said about our many friends in Iceland. There is a great similarity and bond between the Icelanders and the Irelanders. I understand some European countries have already legislated on this matter and I would be interested to see what they have done and what effect their legislation has had so far.</P>
    <P>As regards the code of practice being pursued by the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation has set up a special group on genetic testing. We have asked the federation to consult with this group and our officials. Those consultations are in progress and when they are concluded, a final draft code will be available. It will then become operable and public.</P>
    <P>Senators will understand that this week we have published the report of the interdepartmental group on modern biotechnology. I have organised for copies to be made available to the various spokespersons and people with a keen interest in it and any other body which wants a copy. Senators will also understand that within the national development plan we have allocated, on the basis of the technology foresight report, £560 million for ICT and biotechnology.</P>
    <P>While I have sympathy with the amendment, I will oppose it for the purposes of this legislation. My advice is that this is not a good time to make conclusive determination on where we stand on biotechnology and genetic testing as it is an evolving process. My priority as Minister of State is to ensure that the consumers and citizens have access to competitive insurance cover from a cadre of insurance underwriters. My second priority is to ensure that such cover is a transparent and positive instrument which is available to the consumer and that they know what is being offered to them. As regards genetic testing and biotechnology, my advice to the House is that it would be foolish and short-sighted to make a determination until we have all the information and the reports and until Europe has taken an initiative in this area.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their thought provoking contributions. I will bear them in mind when I consider the matter in the light of the outcome of the consultation process. I regret I am not able to accept this amendment as of now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a profession which is self-regulated, I understand the enthusiasm among insurance companies to regulate themselves and to have their own code of conduct. We, in the medical profession, have to work within the law as do the insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State and his officials have given very good explanations as to why they cannot accept this amendment at the moment, that <Col N="843" /> is, that they have to look at other European legislation to see how well it is working. I have a terror of a very facile approach being taken by the insurance companies to this issue. As the Minister of State knows, because he has taken a great interest in the biotechnology area, it is a very complicated area which, as Senator Costello said, is changing almost by the hour. It is not just one gene that causes the thing, it is the interplay between various genes that causes a problem. It really is a very complicated area.</P>
    <P>I have such a concern about the insurance companies which very much like to set their own rules. Some years ago I supported the previous Insurance Ombudsman when I felt she was being pressed to take actions which were not in the best interest of insured people. That office is run by the insurance companies and it is important to emphasise that again. Whatever independence the office of the Insurance Ombudsman has, it is not financial. The office is beholden to the insurance companies for its existence.</P>
    <P>If it were not for this Minister of State, I would press this amendment. I hope he is not transferred to higher places too fast before he gets the chance to really get after&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister of State and his officials deal with this as quickly as possible because I do not think we can leave this to the insurance companies. I know we will hear about codes of conduct but I do not think that will do. We really have to include this in legislation. I am relying on the Minister of State to act immediately if he sees moves to introduce some type of testing. I will certainly act if I see anything. It is one of the most serious issues, as the Minister of State will know from the contacts he has had with the scientific community and the medical profession. They are extremely anxious that people might even refuse to go to Breast Check or something like that because it could be a bad thing to go for a test. We could find ourselves in such a situation and I do not want to see that happening. We put such an effort into getting Breast Check up and running and if people think something has to do with their genes, they may not attend.</P>
      <P>I am relying on the Minister of State and he will hear from me if I do not hear from him first. I hope he can manage to find enough information within the next six months. We do not have to solve the whole situation for the world. All we have to do is make sure we do not leave people in Ireland in a vulnerable situation before very powerful financial interests.</P>

      <P>During the Committee Stage debate, Senators commented that the drafting of this section could be read as sanctioning rating in accordance with the factors which had been identified, including sex and place of residence. Although this was not the intention, I agree that the drafting could have been read in that way. Accordingly, I tabled amendment No. 3 which achieves the objective of providing the consumer with relevant information without conferring any particular legitimacy on one rating factor over another. I thank Senators sincerely for bringing this matter to my attention. The proposed amendment No. 3 is a significant improvement and I trust that on that basis we will be able to agree to it. I am sure the House will co-operate in ensuring that it will not be necessary to have further discussion now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for responding to our concerns in amendment No. 3, which obviates the need for my amendments Nos. 4 and 5. I have always thought it inappropriate to specify areas where additional amounts are payable by reason of sex, age and medical status and that it was much better to present it in a generic form. That is what the Minister of State is doing here.</P>
      <P>I was worried that &ldquo;medical status&rdquo; would open the door to genetic testing and, of course, that is still the concern in regard to any rating factor applicable. The insurance industry will largely determine what is and what is not applicable. As Senator Henry said, with self-regulation and a code of conduct devised by the body itself without outside supervision, it is always difficult to ensure it deals with the matter in a substantial fashion. We would want to keep a close eye on how this operates. I know that, in practice, areas such as sex and medical status operate. There are other areas, such as sexual orientation and place of residence, where there is serious concern about the manner in which loading and discrimination can take place very easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister of State has offered is a reasonable compromise on what we are looking <Col N="845" /> for, but I am concerned that there is still plenty of room for the industry to be discriminatory. Eliminating the specific reference to specific factors would seem to indicate that these are appropriate factors for extra loading. That is a very valuable point and we will have to keep an eye on the industry to see that it adheres to its own code of practice in a substantial medical fashion.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6</P>
      <P>In page 25, line 36, after &ldquo;appeal to&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;a nominee appointed by the Minister and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and myself had a great discussion about this point on Committee Stage and we had to respectfully disagree. This is not a permanent office but would come into play as cases arise. It would bring the legislation into line with the Insurance Intermediaries Act, 1995. I know the Minister of State said that concerned a different Department. I heard him say loud and clear on a recent broadcast how seriously this Government, and please God all Governments, take their collective Cabinet responsibility and that legislation should be in line and so on.</P>
      <P>We agreed that there is common sense, not to mention the cost factor, in having it this way. I remind the Minister of State not only of my own contribution but of the very eloquent contribution on Committee Stage of his colleague, Senator Mooney, and of Senator Quinn on this point. For those reasons, I strongly believe that a broker who feels aggrieved should have the opportunity, rather than going to the High Court, of having the Minister appoint a nominee as an arbitrator to rule. This would be efficient and practical. The court should be a last resort and as a similar provision is contained in other legislation, I do not understand why, in the interests of good sense, it cannot be included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. This matter was discussed on Committee Stage and the amendment makes a great deal of sense. The point behind it is to try to avoid the outrageous costs that occasionally arise as a result of the rules and conditions of the courts. The amendment would ensure simplification of the system through an appointee of the Minister considering issues.</P>
      <P>The case was solidly made on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister is willing to accept the amendment. However, if he is not willing to accept it, I am interested to know the reason. There may be valid reasons if that is the case, but it appears logical that rows should not have to end up in the courts on every occasion. The courts should be a last resort and I urge the Minister to consider accepting the amendment.</P>

    <Col N="846" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide intermediaries with an avenue of appeal as an alternative to the court against conditions or requirements imposed by the supervisory authority. Section 17 of the Bill provides for a transitional period in respect of insurance intermediaries. Thus, they are deemed authorised under the 1995 Act pending the granting of an authorisation by the supervisory authority. In other words, once they apply, they are deemed to be authorised and if they fulfil the criteria, they get full authorisation. Section 17 also provides that the disciplines that apply to fully authorised intermediaries should also apply to those intermediaries benefiting from the transitional period. The law is soft in terms of access so they are given equal opportunities to those who are authorised. In parallel with that, we expect them to meet the requirements of the supervisory authority.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these disciplines is to protect clients and bona fide intermediaries. The genuine intermediary must be protected as must the citizen &ndash; the client. Thus, the Central Bank may impose conditions necessary to protect the clients and issue certain directions. As is normal, section 17 provides the safeguard that an intermediary that is the subject of an imposition or direction always has the right of appeal to the High Court. This provision applies equally to fully authorised intermediaries.</P>
      <P>It is not intended to introduce an additional avenue of appeal. The High Court is deemed sufficient to protect the interests of intermediaries. The overriding concern of the supervisory authority is to be able to act as quickly as possible to protect the client, the investment and the liquidity when it becomes aware that an intermediary is no longer complying with the law so that the losses suffered by clients may be minimised.</P>
      <P>This involves a minority of cases. The vast majority of people in the insurance industry are genuine. As in every profession, 99.9% of the people are perfect but the other 0.1% makes life difficult. This ratio is reflected in all professions and activities. The position with regard to the supervisory authority is that there would be engagement, interaction, communication, dialogue and response opportunities and that time &ndash; up to three months or more &ndash; would be allowed. During that period, unless a major scam is involved, it should be possible to resolve most of the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a supervisory authority to deal with these professional people is to be established, it would be foolish to also create another layer in terms of an appeals officer or similar structure. The court will only come into play as a last resort. It would be unfair to impose this extra burden on the Exchequer and to create another bureaucratic layer of pressure on intermediaries. There must be transparency involving the regulatory authority, the industry, which includes underwriters and intermediaries, and consumers. On that basis, <Col N="847" /> there is no point creating any other structure or appeals mechanism. Therefore, I regret I cannot accept the amendment. I thought deeply about the matter and there were consultations yesterday evening. We thought about it overnight and there were further meetings this morning. However, we decided it would be unwise and I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the Minister's logic, given that there is a similar provision in the Investment Intermediaries Act. The amendment would not create a separate office although the Minister suggested otherwise. As he stated, this involves a body of professional people and it is anticipated that there will be few cases. However, where they arise, it makes sense to provide for arbitration where the Minister may, from time to time, provide a nominee. This would be on a casual basis as required. This is why I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>My wonderful officials come to my aid when I am on the rack. Senator Coghlan almost had me on the ropes. He is a wily Kerryman and he put me into a spin. I hit the ropes but I have come back with powerful information from the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995. Section 60 states that a professional body on whom a notice has been served under section 56(3) of the Act or an approved professional body on whom a notice has been served under section 59 of the Act may within 21 days of receipt of the notice appeal to the Minister and the Minister shall consider any such appeal and may uphold or reject it.</P>
      <P>This is the only ground of appeal in the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995. It does not deal with individual intermediaries. It only deals with a professional body. I have similar powers pertaining to other professional organisations. Regrettably, these do not only involve national bodies but international bodies which want to be recognised in Ireland. I must deal with those and it is not an easy decision to make. Decisions made in the past were not popular but we must live with that.</P>
      <P>The only right of appeal under that Act is where a professional body is refused recognition. It has the right to appeal to the Minister for Finance and make a case if it is refused recognition. This does not apply to individuals. The Bill is consistent in that it relates only to a collective group and not to an individual. I stand over my recent utterances about collective responsibility in good legislation.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage, Senator Quinn tabled amendments which provided that registers maintained by the supervisory authority and the product producers would be held in electronic form. My officials examined the proposals and there was consultation as a result of that examination. We have decided that, as we are rapidly moving into an electronic era, Senator Quinn's proposals should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 provides that the supervisory authority shall maintain the register or registers in electronic form or in another form if it considers it appropriate. I understand the supervisory authority intends to publish the registers on the Central Bank's website. Amendment No. 10 provides that the product producer shall arrange for its lists of appointed intermediaries to be held in electronic form or other form as it considers appropriate. Product producers must furnish the information to the supervisory authority and it may maintain the registers in electronic form. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) is an amendment which was introduced at Committee Stage in the Dáil. For the sake of consistency it is repeated here. It is based on the recommendations that were made by Senator Quinn and supported by other Members. Accordingly, I commend amend<Col N="849" /> ments Nos. 7 and 10 and I hope this is to the satisfaction of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his speedy and accurate response to my proposal. I have a couple of queries about it. I am not quite sure I understand the need for the proposed subsection 2(<i>b</i>) in amendment No. 7 which refers to &ldquo;the publication, in electronic form or such other form as it considers appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am very impressed that the Minister has moved the register to the Central Bank website which seems to be a perfect situation. It is easy to obtain it there. Why do we need the phrase &ldquo;or such other form as it considers appropriate&rdquo;? I am slightly concerned that at some future stage the phrase might not be interpreted in the way intended. Is it not possible to leave it as &ldquo;the publication, in electronic form&rdquo;? The same phrase crops up in amendment No. 10 in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>). Perhaps there is a sensible reason for using this phrase.</P>
      <P>I know the intention here, and from what the Minister has said it is exactly what I sought. I appreciate what he has done. Is it dangerous to use the phrase &ldquo;such other form as it considers appropriate&rdquo;? I am concerned that in the future someone may consider this to mean in paper form rather than electronic form. I hope this legislation is strong enough to maintain what was intended.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 refers in paragraph (f2&gt;b) to &ldquo;the insertion, after &lsquo;product producers', of &lsquo;and such a register may be in electronic form or such other form . . .'&rdquo;. I am not happy with the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. I would prefer if the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was used instead. I am not thinking of the Minister's intention here. According to what he told me, it will be achieved immediately. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;as it considers appropriate&rdquo; may be interpreted differently by someone in the future. Perhaps the Minister could explain this legislation.</P>

      <P>The points made by Senator Quinn are very good. The phrase &ldquo;in electronic form, or such other form&rdquo; seems to leave it open for electronic form not to be used. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position.</P>
      <P>I am sure by now the Minister will have realised that Senator Quinn and I are at the forefront of information technology. Could he tell Departments that we will keep asking for things to put in electronic form? We have raised this issue on numerous Bills. Senator Quinn was the first to bring it to my attention. It is a pity that it must be raised on every Bill. Perhaps the Departments could be informed that they are likely to receive these amendments unless that happens.</P>

The Minister has given an option by providing that it may be either in electronic form or such other form as is <Col N="850" /> considered appropriate. That was not the intention of the discussion that resulted from Senator Quinn's amendment on Committee Stage. This gives rise to confusion. Perhaps the wording could be improved somewhat. The phrase &ldquo;the publication in electronic form&rdquo; should cover all immediate eventualities. The Minister could introduce an amendment in the future when science has progressed further. The language gives rise to confusion.   </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these proposed amendments is to make sure there is balance, fairness and equity in the system. We are putting an onus on the regulatory authority to publish in electronic form. An insurance intermediary, a citizen, a client or a consumer might look for information, and if the electronic system broke down, we would have protected the supervisory authority from being mandated to provide information in a particular form. To ensure there is no escape clause in providing information I have stated that they must do so in all forms as appropriate. In other words, it is appropriate to have a paper based system and an electronic paperless system. As time evolves there may be other forms of communication available.</P>
      <P>We must take account of consumers or citizens who do not have access to electronic systems, either e-mail or the worldwide web. They could be disadvantaged if we only used an electronic form. We must ensure that there can be no latent inherent barriers or disadvantages placed in the way of making information available to them.</P>
      <P>We could not impose the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in relation to product producers mentioned in my second amendment because some of them, initially, would be very small players in the market. If we told them that they had to do this and they could only do that, we would be placing an impediment on their entering the market. Obviously they will test the market with their product. If it begins to grow they will spend money on promoting and distributing it and getting information. We want to give the maximum incentive to product producers to enter the marketplace. It would be unfair to tell them they can only communicate electronically when it is vital for them to avail of every mechanism to promote their products to the maximum advantage through their intermediary to the wider consumer across the web and the system. It is also vital to them to communicate by paper.</P>

      <P>In page 26, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)A life insurance broker may act in a free and independent manner in providing the level of service which is expected of him/her in impartially responding to any consultation with his/her client.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment allows these people, and the Minister agrees that they are a fine body of people, to carry on as they have done hitherto in providing an impartial and best advice service to their clients. This is what is expected of them. It would be ridiculous to place restrictions on them and ensure that they cannot continue to conduct their business in that fashion.</P>
      <P>We have talked a lot about providing a level playing pitch. We all agree that it is vital to have it, yet this Bill will favour the big player in the marketplace. It is vitally important that we make such a provision and that we do nothing to infringe the independence of the independent broker.</P>
      <P>It would be a negation to do what the Minister proposes in the Bill. These people maintain the highest standards in their professional conduct. No other profession, accountants, solicitors or anyone else would accept such a provision. They are not facing such a proposal and there is no one calling on them to do so. There are fewer defaulters in the insurance business than in other professions and by saying that I do not want to slight accountants or solicitors.</P>
      <P>An important right is being restricted. Why does the Minister want to limit such an excellent body of professionals? They have done a good job over the years. I cannot understand why this restriction is being imposed. This a traditional right. No Government would impose such a restriction on anybody else. These are serious minded people doing an excellent job who are bonded and indemnified. Everything is in place to cover their clients. I cannot understand this proposal. I accept the Minister of State is a fair minded man, which I have always said, but I am at a loss to understand this.</P>

Perhaps I am mistaken and the Minister of State may correct me, but it appears that under the Bill an insurance broker could not give that sort of advice unless he was an agent for the post office. That seems out of kilter with everything the Minister of State is trying to achieve in this Bill. I have difficulty understand<Col N="852" /> ing how we could impose that. If that is the implication of this, the Minister of State must rethink it and accept this amendment. I gather that as the Bill stands at the moment without this amendment, a broker would be unable to give that sort of advice to a client unless he was the agent for the post office, for example. Perhaps I am mistaken and have misunderstood this.</P>
    <P>However, the amendment would be a solution to this. It states:</P>
    <P>A life insurance broker may act in a free and independent manner in providing the level of service which is expected of him/her in impartially responding to any consultation with his/her client.</P>
    <P>I think that would give a life insurance broker the freedom to give impartial advice in responding to a request from a client, even if he is not an agent.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn has put it very well. We were all very concerned on Committee Stage that this was protecting larger brokers and that those who were just starting off and had only a few agencies would be greatly disadvantaged. I know the aim is to protect the people who go to a broker. However, their freedom of action will be severely curtailed if this amendment is not accepted.</P>

      <P>I support this important amendment. We are talking here about the traditional advice that has been given by life insurance brokers. This is now being limited by restrictions on the type of general financial advice that might be given. I am not sure how that protects the consumer, unless there are some statistics to show the consumer is disadvantaged by the traditional concept and that this new principle of restrictive advice by the life insurance broker should be introduced.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister of State intend to police this? How will the insurance police operate if a client asks during a consultation for general financial advice and for the broker's general opinion on the Irish Permanent, AIB, the post office and so on? How will this restriction be policed in brokers' offices or over the telephone?</P>

      <P>I understand why Senator Coghlan tabled this amendment. The Minister of State and his officials have undertaken many detailed discussions with people in this area to try to ensure the thrust of the Bill, which is to ensure people are better served under this legislation than before, is complied with. The Government amendment No. 9<i>a</i> will address that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has taken on board that when a person goes into an insurance broker's office and says he or she has a policy with a particular company, such as Ark Life, Irish Life or any of the other insurance companies, it is important for the broker to be in a position to ensure he does not ignore that fact and advise the <Col N="853" /> person to turn over a policy and perhaps even create a churning effect. The legislation will ensure the person is given full information on the product he or she has and the cost of changing it.</P>
    <P>We are trying to ensure the consumer has full information and that brokers will not be restricted in giving the advice required at that time. The Government amendment will go a long way down that route. I would have liked the amendment go a little further but I accept the advice of the officials in the Minister of State's Department.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that a life insurance broker may act in a free and independent manner in providing the level of service which is expected of him or her in responding to any consultation with his or her client.</P>
      <P>The extent to which an intermediary gives advice is determined by their status. Investment product intermediaries authorised under section 10 of the 1985 Act have to fulfil three conditions &ndash; they must demonstrate they are competent to offer wide ranging advice, that they have adequate capital to run their business and they must submit to a strict supervisory regime involving quarterly reporting. The purpose of this is to ensure such intermediaries are solvent and in a position to meet their obligations to their clients. This regime permits the consumer to seek wide-ranging advice, confident that their investment is secure. Any intermediary who can fulfil these conditions may seek this status and is then free to offer wide ranging advice.</P>
      <P>Restricted activity intermediaries, by contrast, do not have to fulfil these conditions. Nevertheless, they may offer advice on the products of the product producers from whom they hold appointments and, having secured a sale, they may handle cash to the extent that the payment is guaranteed by the product producer.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily. As a result of a meeting I had last night with the Insurance Brokers Association and subsequent discussions with my officials &ndash; another early morning meeting and a later one today &ndash; we have decided to table amendment No. 9<i>a</i>, which reads:</P>
      <P>In page 30, to delete lines 33 to 37 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;by the substitution of the following for subsection (3):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this section shall prevent a Restricted Activity Investment Product Intermediary from complying with the requirements of regulations made under section 43D to implement subsections 43E(1)(f2&gt;a)(iii) and (iv) of the Insurance Act 1989.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> I have also considered the arguments made in this House on the issue of advice. This amendment seeks to make clear that when an intermediary has had a discussion with a client in the context of the anti-churning provisions of the Insurance Act and involving any existing life policies of any type held by that client, the Investment Intermediaries Act does not prevent that discussion from proceeding.</P>
    <P>Although the amendment may not address every point raised on this issue, it will ameliorate the position by allowing restrictive activity investment product intermediaries to hold discussions in the context of the disclosure regulations without fear of being in breach of the 1995 Act. Clients can discuss their policies in the context of who has produced them, proposals can be made and, as a result of this amendment, advice can now be freely given without breaking the law. We have introduced this following due consultation to ensure that, under the law, independent advice will be constantly available. I thank the House for raising this issue. I hope this amendment will clarify the position and allay the concerns of independent brokers on the island of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The independence of the broker is basic and I do not want to do anything to limit that. The Minister of State is untying the broker's hands. He is not doing it as fully as I would wish, but in view of the pertinent point raised by Senator Costello regarding policing, I should be satisfied. I do not believe there would ever be intended infringement and I accept the Minister of State's word that in line with our views, he does not wish to limit the independence of the advice provided. On balance, I am happy with his proposal and I thank him for introducing this amendment.</P>

I have difficulty in understanding the detail of the second part of the amendment, but I take the Minister of State at his word. He has attempted to alleviate our concerns. I was concerned that the initial provision was over-restrictive. While the amendment means it continues to be restrictive it will be less severe.

      <P>My reference to policing was not a slur on the insurance industry. I suggested it needed to be policed, but I found it difficult to envisage how it would apply to consultations between a broker and client and what kind of <Col N="857" /> supervisory body or mechanisms would be in place. Given the involvement of the Central Bank, I do not believe the insurance industry has anything to worry about in terms of intrusive monitoring. Is the Minister of State proposing that in connection with life assurance there will be no restrictions on consultation and advice, but where information may be sought on other policies or financial categories of insurance, a life assurance broker is not entitled under law to become involved?</P>

      <P>To meet the intention of amendment No. 9<i>a</i> we had to take into account the status of the individual broker. This entailed a consideration of the Investment Intermediaries Act, including the definitions involved and the parameters laid down, and the effect of disclosure regulations. We also had to try to achieve a solution to a perceived problem, whereby the restricted activity intermediary, or others, could be in breach of the law for giving advice outside the status they hold. Taking everything into account, we have framed this amendment in such a way that it allows the individual broker, agent or RAIPI to give advice in an independent manner, based on the fact that they can ask questions of the client as to what they currently hold in terms of products and investments. They can now give that advice in the free knowledge that they will not be breaking the law.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 29, to delete the text inserted by Government amendment No. 35 at Committee Stage and substitute the following:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 9, which refers to the issue of cash handling by certain insurance intermediaries, has been the subject of much discussion and debate. On Committee Stage in the Seanad, I introduced an amendment which would permit non-life insurance intermediaries to handle cash without being subject to any restriction. The supervisory authority was concerned that, as drafted, the amendment permitted non-life intermediaries to handle cash without any limitation. This would afford no protection to non-life intermediary consumers. Having reflected on the matter, I am now proposing an amendment which will provide that both life assurance intermediaries and non-life insurance intermediaries will be permitted to handle cash, <Col N="858" /> provided the circumstances in section 25G of the Bill apply.</P>
      <P>Section 25G provides that a premium paid to an intermediary shall be treated as having been paid to an undertaking when it is in respect of a renewal invited by the undertaking or a new proposal accepted by the undertaking. Thus, when an intermediary handles cash in these circumstances, the insurer is taking responsibility for handling it. The provision, as it will now be drafted, will permit intermediaries to handle cash without having to demonstrate capital adequacy while safeguarding the interests of consumers.</P>
      <P>In the case of tied agents, the consumer is safeguarded because the insurer is responsible for any act or omission of its tied insurance agent in respect of any matter relating to a contract of insurance offered or issued by the undertaking to which the tied agency agreement relates. I trust this will be to Members' satisfaction.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 33, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;29.&ndash;Section 31 of the Act of 1995 is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (6)(<i>b</i>) (inserted by section 61 of the Investor Compensation Act, 1998) of the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(<i>c</i>) Notwithstanding paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of this subsection, the supervisory authority may dispense with the requirement to ensure the publication of a notice of discontinuance where the investment product intermediary satisfies it that such publication may be detrimental to the orderly and good conduct of its business or may undermine the confidence of clients in the investment product intermediary or for any other reason.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the discontinuance notice. I feel the provision in regard to notices in national newspapers will be misconstrued by our constituents. Thankfully, such notices have been few in number to date.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in some rural areas, the publication of one's name in a newspaper can take on a certain importance. However, when insurance brokers begin to be affected by this legislation, notices could appear on a weekly basis where a broker drops an agency, decides to concentrate on a particular aspect of his or her business or decides to retire, as may well happen if this Bill impacts on his or her livelihood. The notice will be misconstrued in rural Ireland as relating to wrongdoing or inefficiency and will lose its impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> This is a flawed provision. In the case of wrongdoing, where the Central Bank closes down a business, such notices are very important and we should not reduce their importance by putting notices in newspapers in regard to every discontinuance of an agency for genuine reasons. Therefore, I ask the Minister to provide a waiver to the Central Bank or regulator where there is no wrongdoing involved. I propose that notices should only be published in cases where brokers are suspended due to non-compliance with the supervisory authority's regulations.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to dispense, at the agreement of the supervisory authority, with the need to publish discontinuance notices. Following Committee Stage discussions, I have re-examined and reconsidered this issue and have, indeed, given it very extended consideration over the past 24 hours.</P>
      <P>I understand the motive behind the amendment. Discontinuance of appointments may occur for perfectly ordinary reasons, yet notices may convey an incorrect impression of the intermediary. However, the 1995 Act requires the intermediary to publish the notice and only when he or she fails to do so is the product producer required to do so. Accordingly, the intermediaries themselves have control over the notice's content.</P>
      <P>A further purpose of this requirement to publish is to inform consumers. The provision of such information is of overriding importance. I have considered the various opportunities which non-publication might create and it is my judgment that non-publication would expose many innocent people to scams perpetrated by people associated with the industry, although not members of the industry. I do not intend to elaborate on that as somebody might read my comments and put the ideas into operation. It would be very foolish to allow vulnerable people to become the victims of simple scams. I regret, therefore, that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

We have unfinished business with the Minister; we must examine the issue of genetic testing about which Adjournment motions will be tabled within six months. I hope he will be in a position to introduce legislation in this area at that stage. Within six months there will be motions tabled on the Adjournment.

      <P>I wish to be associated with the compliments paid to the Minister and his staff. It is very good to have a Minister with the confidence to take on the points raised on all sides of the House, and in doing so I notice he reached a very good balance. He came up with an amendment to address the issues raised by Senators Coghlan and Quinn and he also addressed some of my concerns. Everybody on this side got some response from the Minister, even if we did not get the response we would have liked to all the amendments. We like to see the Minister responding and introducing his amendments in response to ours. I also thank him for the courtesy he has shown us in the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank all the Senators for their interesting, positive and warm contributions on <Col N="862" /> this very important Bill. As Members are aware, it will bring about major changes in the area of regulation of insurance intermediaries. When I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for commerce in October 1997 I signalled I wanted to achieve this in partnership with the public, the Parliament and the industry and its component parts. The fact that we published the Bill just one year ago and that it is now passing Seanad Éireann and will return to the Dáil for final passage shows that within 12 months we had much detailed dialogue and discussion.</P>
      <P>I believe there is now recognition in all quarters that the provisions of the Bill will benefit consumers, the industry and the nation. It will enhance consumer confidence by providing adequate and comprehensible information through the disclosure regime. Through disclosure and the new regime of authorisation and supervision for intermediaries, it will also improve the standing of the industry. Insurance consumers will be provided with sufficient information to enable them to make rational and informed choices about their insurance requirements and the resulting competition in the marketplace will encourage the promotion of better products at a lower cost. The provisions concerning reinsurance companies will enable us to protect Ireland's reputation as a well regulated centre for financial services.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Senators have raised some very important issues which I have not been in a position to accept for one reason or another. In particular I would like to reiterate my interest in the issue of genetic testing. I will not forget the contributions made in the House today when I come to consider the matter in the light of the results of the examination we are currently conducting.</P>
      <P>I am happy that, during consideration of this Bill in this House and in the Dáil, I have heard many useful arguments and suggestions, resulting in many improvements to the Bill. I am indebted to the Members of this House and the Members of Dáil Éireann for their valuable contributions. I have a very strong personal commitment to the primacy of Parliament. As I have said before, nobody has a monopoly of wisdom. Everybody has a contribution to make and collectively we share a responsibility to frame the best legislation possible. That is why I never like to rush legislation and wish to ensure we take on board the tremendous personal experience of Members of the Seanad and the Dáil, who represent the citizens and consumers of our country every day, as well as the concerns of the industry, and collectively produce the most appropriate legislation for a modern nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to express my appreciation to the insurance industry for the constructive and co-operative manner in which they have approached the development of this Bill. As a group they have recognised the need for an improved regulatory regime as well as the various other short<Col N="863" /> comings of their industry in so far as consumer information and protection is concerned. As a result of this co-ordinated approach, I am convinced that the legislation will enhance the standing of the industry in the eyes of the public and help to repair a reputation that has been tarnished by a small number of dubious operators in recent years. I am confident the standards and obligations imposed under the legislation will not constitute any hardship either for insurance undertakings or for intermediaries who are committed to the future success of their business and of the insurance industry in general.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Cathaoirleach, the Leader, the Opposition spokespersons, the many Senators who contributed to the Bill, the Clerk of the House and the staff. I also wish to thank the outstanding staff in my own office and the Department, particularly those in the insurance division, who have worked assiduously and in a dedicated and professional manner over the past three years to ensure the legislation gets the best possible consideration. I also thank the Attorney General, the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, the Chief State Solicitor and all of their staff for their personal and professional input. Mo mhíle bhuíochas díobh go léir.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann recognises the need to cherish all the children of the nation equally, the need to provide adequate child care facilities appropriate to the requirements of a modern prosperous society and supports an increase in child benefit as the best and fairest way to address this issue.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Minister of State I acknowledge what she has done for the advancement of child care since her appointment. It is refreshing to discuss this fundamental issue this evening. It seemed for part of the day as if the &ldquo;T and T&rdquo; agenda, taxis and trains, would take hold of all our energies. It is good to discuss an issue that is of such fundamental importance to society and one that will have to be confronted long after those other issues have been put to bed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of the critical state of child care and the issue of child poverty haunt us. It is almost unthinkable that in the 21st century we have such a high incidence of child poverty. Independent research confirms that about a quarter of all children in society experience some level of poverty and that 17% experience chronic poverty. They are the children who have poor school attend<Col N="864" /> ance, poor educational attainment, poor qualifications, if any, low participation in cultural or sporting activities and whose prospects for the future are poor. If that poverty is not tackled and arrested the danger is that it will continue into the next generation and will become cyclical in nature. It is critically important to seek to address and arrest the poverty.</P>
    <P>The issue of child care was debated fully in the House last January. One may ask why we are coming back to the issue again so soon. We are doing so for two reasons. First, even though efforts had been made, much remains to be done and, second, because we are on the threshold of a budget. The budget gives us the opportunity to address the financial elements of child care and to make financial provision for families with children. That said, I acknowledge that money on its own does not solve the problem, but unless it is there the problem will never be solved. The Progressive Democrats ask that the level of child benefit be increased substantially to the level of £100 for all children. That is a bold objective but we have the money to enable us to do that. We may not have the mechanisms in place to tackle all the requirements of child care or all the detail of child poverty but, at least, we have money to enable us to pay level of child benefit. That needs to be done now. Such an increase would be an effective way to deal with the growing cost of child care.</P>
    <P>This Government has had an objective of increasing old age pensions to £100. I believe that objective will be met in the forthcoming budget. That is the decent and good thing to do. A civilised society has to look at its primary care and how it looks after the old and the young. I believe the £100 for the elderly will be attained in the budget. I put to the Minister an objective that the £100 level be reached very soon for child benefit. There should be no argument from any quarter against a large increase in the rate of child benefit. It currently stands at £42.50 a month per child and £56 for the third child. A ground-breaking increase to £100 a month would be of huge benefit for hundreds of thousands of Irish families. Progress towards the target of £100 should start in the forthcoming budget. The Government should deliver a real and substantial increase in child benefit so that this target can be reached as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Child benefit is the fairest way to deliver health to all families with children rather than special child care tax breaks. This is because child benefit is paid to all families in equal value. A tax break is of no benefit to families on social welfare or to those working families whose incomes are too low to be taxable and is of only limited value to families on low incomes who have low thresholds. This must be made available to all families. Following last year's budget, the issue that haunted us of making provision for families whose mothers go out to work as opposed to families <Col N="865" /> whose mothers stay at home must be addressed. We must put a value on the work done by women who choose to remain at home to raise their children.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise that in the public service in particular an increasing number of women opt to take career breaks and forgo their income for three or five years to give their children a start, and many women now opt for job-sharing. That is a very healthy development. Women who take a career break for three or five years ought to be encouraged, not penalised. Equally women who choose to take up job-sharing ought to be encouraged, not penalised. If we do not seek to give mothers in that position the same benefits as mothers who go out to work, we are perpetuating an injustice which should not be allowed to happen. We should provide child benefit to all the children of the nation right across the board.</P>
    <P>We must improve on the supply side, which is very complex. When the Childcare Act came into force, which was timely, the immediate effect was a reduction in the number of child care places. This was the inevitable result of putting in place standards. These standards are valid and must be upheld but we must consider ways and means of adding to the supply. I am particularly pleased with the provision of the after school initiative, which is important. Due to the demography which is developing, there is and will be spare classroom capacity in a number of primary schools. We should seek to use this to the ultimate by making provision for child care. In addition, we should enlist the support of local authorities. From now on the housing of people should not just relate to the builders' agenda or the putting up of bricks and mortar, housing estates should be designed to be neighbourhoods. That ought to involve in the construction phase a little space where crèche and child care facilities can be delivered. However, without the support of the local authorities and the health boards, no matter how well intentioned the Government is, it will not be able to meet the demands of child care on the supply side.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that there has not been a greater take-up on the child care tax incentives to employers. There is probably a cultural lag in the mindset of employers in this regard. Employers do not seem to recognise the value of making provision for the child care needs of their employees as a worthwhile investment in their enterprise. Multinationals are much better in this regard because it is part of the culture they bring from their countries of origin. They are much better at making crèche and child care facilities available for their workforce. It is about time our employers decided that this is the correct course of action to take.</P>
    <P>There is enormous scope for the proper education and training of child care workers. If child care is to make a difference to children and society in the next generation, it must be deliv<Col N="866" /> ered to the highest attainable standards. There is great scope for improvement in relation to this aspect. No Government, no matter what money it has at its disposal, can make proper provision for child care if it cannot enlist the support of parents for whom child care and child rearing is a priority. We must look to other European countries because, for example, the time honoured institution of bedtime seems to have died in Irish society. That is fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <P>Child poverty is not just lack of money, it is young people who are not exposed to music and art, who do not have access to libraries and are not exposed to education of all their senses and faculties in the formation years. Child care is a very broad aspect and we must work hard not just to provide the money, but to change the culture to ensure it becomes a priority in the 21st century.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&ndash;condemns the Government for the high levels of child poverty in this country;</P>
      <P>&ndash;calls on the Government to take decisive action to create new child care places and replace those lost since this Government came to office;</P>
      <P>&ndash;asks the Government to take action to put National Planning Guidelines in place immediately in relation to the development of child care facilities; and to initiate an after school service and to set effective targets to eliminate child poverty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate her on being active and caring. Equally, it is always a pleasure to listen to Senator Quill who outlines her points in such an erudite manner.</P>
      <P>The motion is a response to the concerns that exist and not a criticism of anyone in particular. We all agree that the changes which came about as a result of the provision of fire safety regulations means the closure of many informal child care facilities which were providing a good service. I appreciate that health and safety is a major issue in relation to the provision of child care. However, I believe we threw the baby out with the bath water in relation to some home play groups which were safe. The loss of so many neighbourhood places is a major problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year there was a general fumbling around the child care issue which did not receive priority. It is possibly only people who are currently involved with children who believe the need is so great. A major crisis in relation to child care has been building up and eventually there will be an eruption. I do not know what the fallout will be if Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats <Col N="867" /> wish to go back into Government because when candidates knock on doors, particularly in urban areas and in new estates, they will be asked what are they doing about child care.</P>
    <P>I recall proposing the £100 allowance a month in this Chamber last year when it was voted down. This should be allowed by way of child benefit to support women who opt to care for their children at home. These women should not be discriminated against. In relation to national planning guidelines, no one anticipated the escalation in house prices which led to the requirement for two people to work without having a choice in the matter.</P>
    <P>Some child care facilities have been closed down because they did not comply with health and safety standards. We do not have an adequate number of trained child care workers. In some cases crèche owners exploited parents by taking too many children and exploited their workforce by paying them a pittance. However, these problems are capable of being tackled if we have a sense of urgency.</P>
    <P>I live in an area which is variously described as marginalised or deprived &ndash; both descriptions sound insulting. A large number of parents in my area do not have the skills to cope that many of the rest of us have inherited and, consequently, we see many children exposed to poverty at various levels. Some parents do not have the sense to realise that a seven year old should not be out until eleven o'clock at night. Bedtime for some children happens when they fall asleep, often outside on the roadside. Many parents have a lack of knowledge.</P>
    <P>One still sees the children of some of our immigrants, mainly Roma gypsies, being carried at major traffic intersections in bitterly cold weather. It is said that this is part of the Roma culture. However, when one moves to a new society, while one should retain one's ethnicity one must also adapt to the culture in which one is living, earning one's livelihood or receiving social welfare payments. There is no excuse for putting a child's life at risk, as happens daily in our society. The law should be more rigorously enforced in this regard.</P>
    <P>For many years responsibility for child care was left to voluntary groups. Crèches were established, principally for widows who had young children and who had to go to work. A crèche in Meath Street in Dublin was established in 1893. I was the national chairperson of the Irish Pre-school Playgroups Association, a completely voluntary association which was started in 1969 and did not get funding until 1982. The facilities for children's development provided by voluntary organisations in the past were excellent but the need has changed since then. It is now almost impossible for a parent to stay at home to look after children full-time but the cost of some crèches is prohibitive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> We are denying large numbers of children a rewarding and enjoyable experience and causing great grief. It is not pleasant to put a child into the back of a car at 6 o'clock on a winter's morning and travel up to ten miles to a crèche. When builders build large housing estates they should be obliged to provide a community building where a crèche could be located.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to bring the following matter to the attention of the Ministers of Health and Children and Education and Science. The waiting list for speech therapy at a health centre in my area is very long. A mother came to me two weeks ago to tell me that her little boy, who is aged four and has a hearing difficulty, has been waiting for a year and a half for an appointment to learn how to speak. This is the best illustration I can give of child poverty which needs to be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The proposers of the amendment will be calling for a vote on this matter because any Government which can do something to alleviate child poverty has a duty to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I congratulate the Progressive Democrats and Senator Quill on proposing the motion. However, it lacks a sense of urgency and that is why I am seconding the amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator Quill pointed out that large numbers of women are returning to the public service. They are needed more and more and it is important that we cater for them. Senator Quill also pointed out how much better multinational companies are at dealing with the child care needs of their employees because they have had experience of the matter in other countries.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister of State tell us what has happened to the Civil Service crèche in Mount Street? How can we ask other institutions to make child care facilities available when we have this disaster on our hands? The Civil Service crèche seemed to be an extremely good one. I visited it with the Minster of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, some years ago. The crèche was in existence for almost ten years, the rates were reasonable and it was so popular that children's names had to be put down, almost at conception. I am not sure why the crèche has closed because I have had to rely on the press for information. It appears that those who were running the crèche could not charge sufficiently high fees to pay the required number of staff and the manager had to close it down. Health officials agreed that the number of workers was not sufficient. There is now an appalling hiatus. The crèche has been closed for several months. How does this look to other organisations? It looks as though we are not taking the situation seriously at all. Urgent action should have been taken to ensure that the crèche stayed open. I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell us what has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> Child care workers are not well paid. The regulations which we have introduced stipulate a very low number of children to each worker. The ratio is, I think, three to one for babies, rising to perhaps eight to one for six year olds. The status of child care workers could be raised considerably if the issue of tax relief for child care was addressed. It seems extraordinary that one can employ someone as a driver, for example, and claim the cost against income tax while one can not claim for the cost of employing someone to look after one's child, the dearest asset in one's life. It has been argued that this would discriminate against mothers working in the home but they do not pay PRSI to stay at home and mind their children.</P>
    <P>Nothing is of such great value to children as a mother who can look after them in the home. It is a great financial sacrifice for some women to stay at home to look after their children in the early years. When these women go back into the workforce, one would like to think that better consideration with regard to pensions could be given for the years when they were doing such an important job for society and for which they were not paid. I hope that is taken into consideration because it is one of the most important discriminations against women who remain at home for a certain number of years to look after their children. They are discriminated against when it comes to drawing pensions. People who contributed nothing but who get non-contributory pensions get more money than those women who contributed for years but who took time out to raise their children, which is to our benefit and that of their children. I ask the Minister of State to bring that to the attention of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I agree with child benefit. There is nothing better to help child poverty than to ensure that money goes into the household. It is given to the mother and this means that in the majority of cases it will be spent on her children. I know few women in poverty who do not put their children ahead of themselves. When we talk about child poverty, I worry about the poverty of their mothers as well. They are frequently at the bottom of the list in terms of the goods or services that are needed. They will usually go without.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and I have talked in the past about the definition of homeless children and children out of home and I know we agree on it. It is a serious issue. She and Senator Fitzpatrick may have seen the results of a recent survey which showed that these children are seriously unhealthy. They are also at the lower limit of our vaccination rates. They have a low rate of immunisation against the various childhood diseases with which they come in contact. We must address this issue. I do not care if these children are called homeless children or children out of home, but they must be looked after. Senator Ridge said that it is not acceptable for some people to treat their children in the way they do. <Col N="870" /> We have a responsibility to ensure they do not beg on the streets &ndash; I frequently see this happening on Molesworth Street.</P>
    <P>I compliment the voluntary organisations, particularly the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which tries to teach parenting, coping and budgetary skills. It is sad that the Rotunda Hospital and probably other maternity hospitals must have a Samaritan and infant clothing guild which raises thousands of pounds every year to aid those in this affluent society who still must rely on charity for the most vulnerable children who, as Senator Quill said, we say we cherish in the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh, agus táim buíoch de na Seanadóirí as an t-ábhar seo a ardú agus as gach rud a dúirt siad go dtí seo.</P>
      <P>This is an important opportunity to respond to the motion as only last week we launched our national children's strategy, Our Children &ndash; Their Lives. Copies of the strategy have been sent to Senators and I know they will take the opportunity to study it. It represents the strongest possible demonstration to date by any Government of its commitment to Ireland's children. It is a clear statement of support to parents, local communities and to everyone who works with and for children. It is a major initiative in progressing Ireland's implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The strategy maps out a future plan which will provide a better way for us all to work together for and with children so they benefit from our economic success and enjoy a good quality of childhood experience. The strategy does this by drawing together all the different initiatives for children into a single plan of action and it gives leadership at national level for responding to the needs of children.</P>
      <P>The motion talks about cherishing all the children of the nation equally. That is also a quote in our 1916 Proclamation. The national children's strategy goes substantially further by setting out a clear and unifying vision for all children up to the age of 18. That vision is an Ireland where children are respected as young citizens with a valued contribution to make and a voice of their own, where they are cherished and supported by family and the wider society and where they enjoy a fulfilling childhood and realise their potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This vision is only one part of a new co-ordinating framework for action outlined in the strategy, the purpose of which is to guide all our future efforts in relation to how we plan and manage the delivery of services to children. I do not propose to go into detail but I would like to briefly outline to the House some of the key aspects of the rest of that framework. The strategy identifies six operational principles to guide all future actions for children. It proposes a modern understanding of children's lives which we call the &ldquo;whole child&rdquo;<Col N="871" /> perspective. There are three national goals for children which will be achieved over the ten years of the strategy. These involve listening to children, understanding their needs better and, most relevant to today's motion, ensuring that children will receive quality supports and services to promote all aspects of their development.</P>
    <P>I said at the launch of the strategy that it is not just aims and hopes, but a real plan which will be delivered. Our commitment to delivery will be seen in the new structures we are putting in place to make it happen, but in a way that involves everyone, from the children to the Taoiseach, who needs to be involved in implementing such a wide-ranging plan of action. The Taoiseach will chair a Cabinet committee for children and, as Minister of State with responsibility for children, I will be a voice for all children. I am determined to drive the strategy to ensure the best possible outcome for them and to ensure that the strategy and children's policy development maintains a high profile at Government level. In addition, all future Government initiatives and legislation will be child-proofed so that children's interests will also be represented.</P>
    <P>Children, children's organisations, researchers and the social partners will be members of a national children's advisory council. Our intention is to ensure that our success in developing the strategy will be matched by our success in implementing it. Some of the key elements involved in giving children a voice include establishing Dáil na n-Óg and the office of a children's ombudsman. Perhaps after my experiences here today I should also think about establishing Seanad na n-Óg. There will also be a dedicated national children's office to provide a major boost to managing cross-departmental issues. Departments will still carry the main responsibility for implementing the strategy in their own areas of responsibility. However, the national children's office will be the engine to drive it forward and I, as Minister of State with responsibility for children, will be the driver. A sum of £2 million has already been announced to support the establishment of the new structures I have just described and to commence the research proposals contained in the strategy.</P>
    <P>The elimination of child homelessness is one of the first issues to be tackled. The elimination of child poverty is one of the main aims of the strategy. The most recent data from the ESRI shows that the level of consistent poverty among children is down to 12%. Our intention is to eradicate it completely.</P>
    <P>Another key objective is that children's early education and developmental needs will be met through quality child care services and family friendly employment measures. In many ways, when compared to our European neighbours, Ireland is some way behind in terms of child care provision. However, it should be noted that the <Col N="872" /> child care infrastructures developed in many European states were developed during their periods of economic growth and regeneration.</P>
    <P>Child care provision was badly neglected in the past, with little or no investment by past Governments. In taking office, the Government recognised the urgent need to develop quality child care service provision and prioritised child care as a central issue on the social agenda. Economic success, along with the obvious benefits, presented new challenges and increased labour force participation by women, particularly mothers of young children, and a diminishing supply of child care places were recognised by the Government as issues requiring immediate action.</P>
    <P>Lack of child care facilities is seen as a major impediment to parents who wish to participate in training, education or employment. Quality child care is not just an issue for parents who wish to participate in training, work or education. Central to any developments are the needs and rights of the child. The basic principle underlying the rights of children is that society has an obligation to meet the fundamental needs of children and to provide assistance to aid the development of the child's personality, talents and abilities. Research informs us that quality child care provides social and developmental opportunities which lead to lifelong benefits for children in relation to their participation in society both socially and economically.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the complexity of the issue, shortly after taking office in July 1997, the Government established a expert working group on child care under the Partnership 2000 agreement to devise a national child care framework. The group was chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and membership compromised about 80 member representatives of the statutory sector, social partners, non-governmental organisations, providers, parents and individuals with expertise and interest in the development of child care.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the expert working group facilitated wide consultation with all the interested parties. It deliberated for 18 months, undertook research projects and presented its report in February 1999. That report outlines a national child care strategy comprising recommendations in relation to regulations and standards, employment, training and qualifications in the child care sector, supports for child care providers, supports for parents in relation to child care costs and planning and co-ordination.</P>
    <P>Many of the recommendations of the expert working group are effected in the programmes recently announced by the Government, particularly in relation to the increased investment in the development of child care service provision and the establishment of co-ordinating structures at national and local levels. The structures are designed to ensure a more effective, inclusive and <Col N="873" /> co-ordinated approach to investment, finance and resources to develop quality child care which meets the needs of children nationwide.</P>
    <P>The national development plan provides £250 million to the equal opportunities child care programme of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which operates from social inclusion and equal opportunities perspectives. The funding is being invested in capital and staffing grants for community groups and not for profit organisations, for the establishment and development of community based child care facilities and capital grants for self-employed child care services caring for no more than 20 children at any one time.</P>
    <P>To date, 371 applications have been received for capital and staffing grants and 166 have been approved to the value of £14.1 million. The grants will support almost 5,300 child care places in these facilities, including the establishment of over 2,200 new child care places. The funding also covers grants to assist quality improvement, including training initiatives, the development of local child care networks and funding for the enhancement of the national voluntary child care organisations which provide vital supports to child care service providers.</P>
    <P>On Friday, 17 November last, funding of £7.62 million was approved by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, for seven organisations in recognition of the important role they have in assisting the development of quality child care service provision which meets the needs of children. The Government also recognises that the level of training and qualifications of child care workers impacts on the quality levels in child care service delivery. Funding is being provided to the OMNA early years project of the Centre for Social and Educational Research under the equal opportunities child care programme for the development of a national training and qualifications framework for the child care sector. This framework will contribute to the consolidation of the child care profession. The initiatives are designed to encourage development of child care service provision with the objectives of maintaining existing child care places leading to the creation of additional child care places and child care facilities and improving the quality of child care service provision which meets the needs of the child.</P>
    <P>Further State funding and support are available to the child care sector under additional initiatives &ndash; £5 million to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to develop community based out of school hours projects, £5 million to the Department of Education and Science for grants to school managements to develop after school services and £1.4 million to the Department of Health and Children for the development of a child care advisory service by the health boards to enable them to assist others in the implementation of the regulations to <Col N="874" /> ensure not just the provision places, but the quality of places as well.</P>
    <P>The child care sector can also benefit from capital allowances introduced initially in budget 1999, providing tax relief, and again in budget 2000. Members will know that on 19 July last, the Taoiseach launched an information booklet entitled, Child Care Funding in Ireland, to advise child care providers and prospective child care providers of the range of supports available from various Departments and State agencies.</P>
    <P>Most recently, the Government provided an additional £40 million for child care measures and this funding is being shared between four Departments. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been allocated £26.5 million which will provide £9 million for capital grants, £5 million for community based child care facilities which do not qualify under other schemes, £1 million for improved staffing grants for community based projects and £6.5 million for the national child minders initiative which is the first national initiative targeted specifically at child minders and will involve start up grants, information campaigns and other supports. In addition, £5 million is provided for improving quality through training and research.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has been allocated £7.5 million of which £2.5 million is for the use of spare classrooms for child care. Over 100 schools have already signalled a willingness to allow their spare classrooms to be used for child care. This funding will provide them with financial support towards this. Also £5 million is provided for a national after school initiative.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been allocated £1 million for child care employment grants and the Department of the Environment and Local Government has been allocated £5 million for the provision of child care in local authority developments.</P>
    <P>The Government has assigned responsibility for leading the co-ordination of child care services to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The role involves the establishment of structures at national and local levels, an interdepartmental committee, a national co-ordinating child care committee and, most importantly, county child care committees which will ensure representation from the statutory sector, the traditional social partners, parents and representatives of child care providers and the national voluntary child care organisations.</P>
    <P>We believe child care must be strategically developed. A holistic approach is necessary and the needs of the children and parents must be fully met in any strategy development. We believe the only way to achieve this is to have the involvement of all of the parties concerned with child care working together in a spirit of partnership. The operation and establishment of the structures will have a vital role in the future development of quality child care. Never before <Col N="875" /> has so much funding been made available to invest in child care but it must be wisely invested for greatest effect. Child care policy must provide for equality of access and participation in quality child care services by the children of the nation. The structures provide fora for discussion and exchange of information. I believe they will impact on our national child care strategy over the course of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, recently published draft guidelines for planning authorities on child care facilities for consultation in May of this year. They will assist planning authorities in their efforts to make suitable provision for child care in their development plans and will be of interest to developers, builders and child care service providers and will assist the fulfilling of the requirement that the provision of services for the community, including crèches and other child care facilities, must be included as an objective in development plans.</P>
    <P>Child benefit is a major concern of the motion being discussed tonight. It is a hugely important part of our income supports for families. While some income supports are selective, like the family income supplement for low paid workers or the child dependant allowances paid with social welfare payments, child benefit is not. It is paid to all families regardless of the parents income or labour force status. It, therefore, represents the commitment which we as a society make towards all of our children. It is normally paid to the mother and recognises the importance of the unpaid work done by the primary carer.</P>
    <P>The value placed on the child benefit scheme by this Government is reflected in the level of resources invested in the scheme over the past number of years. The 1999 budget provided for a full year investment of over £40 million while last December's budget provided for a full year investment of £106 million bringing total investment in the scheme to £575 million annually. Some 491,000 families with a total of 967,000 children benefited from these increases. To illustrate the priority given by the Government to child benefit, the increases in the last budget represented in terms of cost 25% of the whole package of social welfare improvements.</P>
    <P>Within the system, the importance of child benefit has been increasing. Since the mid-1990s it has been recognised that selective payments to children can cause severe poverty traps as such allowances are withdrawn on taking up work. Child benefit, however, is a universal scheme and, therefore, does not have undesirable effects. In view of this, it has been recent policy to increase child benefit substantially and, therefore, reduce the relative importance of child dependant allowances. At the same time, the combined incomes from both payments has exceeded inflation. It has increased by more than double the rate of <Col N="876" /> inflation since 1994 and the proportion of this represented by child benefit has increased from 29% to 47%. The potential poverty trap represented by selective payments to children has reduced considerably.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes argued that child benefit is not sufficiently targeted because it goes to all families and not just to the poorest. The Government does not accept this argument. All our families and all our children are deserving of support from the State. Anyone with children knows that regardless of how high the family's income may be, child benefit is a useful addition to the family budget. It is also interesting to note that research on the incidence of child benefit has shown that expenditure on the scheme is spread relatively evenly across all income levels, but with slightly less of the expenditure going to those households with highest incomes. It is the fairest way of getting resources to all families who need it.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that the child benefit scheme will continue to be strengthened as a key instrument in tackling child poverty and targeting resources at those families most in financial need. To this end, the Government has made a commitment to substantially increase the payment over the period of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for third and subsequent children. In line with this commitment, from September last, the basic child benefit monthly rates were increased to £42.50 a month in respect of each of the first two children and £56 a month in respect of the third and subsequent children. I assure the House that in framing next month's budget, the value of child benefit to families will be fully taken into account.</P>
    <P>Regarding the link between child benefit and child care costs, Senators will be aware that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness contains the commitment that, recognising the progress made in the negotiations in relation to child care and following a completion process with the social partners, the Government would adopt a strategy to support parents in meeting their child care needs. As part of this completion process, relevant proposals have been put forward by the social partners. These include a proposal from the community and voluntary pillar that child care costs should be addressed by means of a parental child care payment which would be paid in respect of all families with a child under the age of 14, regardless of whether the parent or parents were in paid employment. The payment would depend on the age of the child, with higher payments for children under the age of five.</P>
    <P>A similar proposal has been made in a number of pre-budget submissions, including those from the National Women's Council of Ireland and the Childcare 2000 Campaign. On the other hand, the trade union movement has argued in favour of tax relief for child care with supplementary payments for parents outside the tax net.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> All the options put forward by the social partners in relation to child care are being studied by the Government in the run-up to the budget. Obviously, I cannot pre-empt decisions by commenting on what role, if any, child benefit might play in that regard. However, regardless of what may be agreed in relation to the child care issue, the merits of child benefit in its own right are clear. We have shown our commitment to children by increasing the payment substantially and by targeting larger increases at larger families whose needs obviously are greater. We will continue in future budgets to increase this most valuable payment.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues in relation to children that we could discuss at length, but I wanted to address the specific points that were raised. I thank the Senators for their comments and interest.</P>

      <P>I have great respect for Senator Quill and the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, who will make further strides in relation to child care. She has done much and given that I am in Opposition, that is a compliment. I would have preferred if the motion dealt specifically with child care. The Fine Gael Party tabled an amendment because, in terms of our consideration of the Cherishing all the Children of the Nation Equally document, the issue of child poverty is so large that it requires a separate debate. The level of child poverty is one of the most catastrophic aspects of modern society, despite the fact that the country is doing so well.</P>
      <P>I understand Senator Quill's point of view and the motion is based on her personal conviction. However, I query whether the Progressive Democrats Party shares the Senator's commitment to the less well off. She has always heralded the issue in the House and her motion is sincere. I hope she will bring her sentiments to her party and ensure that it follows through on her desire for adequate child care facilities appropriate to the requirements of the Celtic tiger economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all support an increase in child benefit as the best and fairest way to address this issue. However, there are other financial ways in which it can be addressed. There are many facets to the motion. For example, well over 600,000 women are in paid employment and, of those, it is estimated that 46% have children under the age of four. This is an enormous number of children. The number of women working is expected to grow by 37% by 2011, and my view is that it will grow at a faster rate because these figures are 12 months old. However, women are not being drawn into the workforce for equality reasons but <Col N="878" /> because they are needed. However, that is an issue for another day.</P>
    <P>It is expected that at least 218,000 women will join or rejoin the labour force. It is obvious that the demand for child care will increase because of the number of women at work, but it will also increase because women who choose to care for their children at home will also want to avail of these services. They are often forgotten. If one decides to care for one's children at home, it is as if one does not need a break or that one should not look for child care places in crèches or in Montessori schools for one's children.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that 25% of full-time mothers use child care facilities because they also combine parenting with other responsibilities. It is often forgotten that many of them wish to participate in further education and training or voluntary work, an area in which women have always been to the fore. Women working in the home should receive further support, including the option of child care to assist their wider participation in their families and their communities.</P>
    <P>My party believes there is an urgent need for a national child care plan. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, outlined the issues and where the responsibility for progress lies. However, our belief is that direct financial benefits to families with children is one of the most effective ways to support families, to respect their right to make choices and to address child poverty. As has been repeatedly stated, child benefit should be doubled for all children under the age of five. This would be a simple and effective way of enhancing child income support and supporting the cost of child care in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have been told by people in crèches and by Montessori teachers that they find it heartbreaking when they have to refuse places to parents who are not in a financial position to pay for child care. These parents are not poor; they are middle income earners. If one is running a crèche or a Montessori school, one must pay high rates if one wants quality child care workers and teachers. This cost is problematic because it must be passed on to the parents. Such parents need a State sponsored, supported and funded child care system. They are victims because they do not have proper financial means and I want their situation redressed in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Jackman for sharing her time. I wish to concentrate on the issue of crèches and child care facilities. The position in the Lucan-Leixlip area may be an example of what is happening around the country. Some years ago new regulations were introduced. These were worthwhile and they related to hygiene, toilets, ventilation and staff ratios. Since that happened crèches in that area have been closing down; they are disappearing. Four of them closed down for various reasons, although perhaps they had valid reasons to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> Let me give a particular example, a crèche called Rainbow's End which is threatened with closure. In that area many parents who go to work are faced with a crisis because they have nowhere to leave their children. This problem arose very quickly. Local residents are objecting to these facilities because they are located in residential areas and too many cars are being parked around the crèches. I do not know how to handle this problem. Once objections are tendered a crèche has only a fortnight to cease business and this leaves parents stranded.</P>
    <P>Problems started to arise when the Government introduced new regulations and restrictions two years ago. Prior to their introduction an individual could convert part of their residence into a crèche without prior planning permission. All they had to do was seek approval from the Eastern Health Board, or the Eastern Regional Health Authority as it is now called, which would advise application for retention permission from the authorities in order to continue maintaining their premises.</P>
    <P>The child care problem may be addressed in the next budget and I know the Minister has talked about it. Unfortunately, that may be too late for the Rainbow's End crèche. The Minister must sort out the problem of registered child carers and their facilities because the situation is quite desperate. Women who wish to work may not be able to do so if this problem is not solved.</P>
    <P>I say this although I cannot offer an immediate solution to this problem. My company Superquinn started playhouses about 25 years ago. We were looking after up to 15,000 children per week but when the new restrictions were introduced we reduced the figure to about 10,000 children per week. That is a very big number but we provide a great free service. I mention it because it is of great benefit to parents because their children will have benefited from this type of experience when they go to school. Customers were very willing to adjust to the new restrictions because they realised why only a certain number of children were allowed into each playhouse.</P>
    <P>These restrictions do not create a crisis for commercial companies like Superquinn but for those crèches that were started up and are attempting to relieve the child care problem. I take the Rainbow's End crèche as an example of what has been occurring ever since the new restrictions were introduced. The level of planning applications and objections has been much higher. I gather a reasonably large number of planning objections have been sustained. I can understand why people living near a crèche would be unhappy with cars parking in a residential area.</P>
    <P>This crisis is happening now. The Government must address it and do something about it. I am not sure what the solution is but I know it is in the hands of the Government. I welcome the <Col N="880" /> Minister of State's words tonight and the efforts that are being made. I welcome what I believe we will hear as good news in the budget which is coming up very shortly. I hope that it is not too late for crèches like Rainbow's End which plays such a valuable role in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I also welcome the national children's strategy. For the first time the Government of the day is attempting to give children and children's needs their rightful place in the sun.</P>
      <P>When the President addressed the Houses of the Oireachtas she said, <i>inter alia,</i> that children are not born bad but that adults made them bad. She focused on parenthood, the needs of parents and how to make parenting beneficial for parents and children. We need a change in culture in the adult population in how we view children and their needs and that will take time.</P>
      <P>In the early 1990s I chaired the committee which dealt with Committee Stage of the first Child Care Bill that came through these Houses. That Bill lay on the Dáil schedule for eight years on Second Stage because the Dáil and its Members could not agree on the basic tenets on how to approach children's needs. It went to Committee Stage and it passed in about 18 months. That was a very sharp learning experience for me and every member of that committee. This happened before the great institutional scandals broke. These scandals happened here, in England and across Europe. Sometime in the 1990s European societies started to lift stones and examine their institutions. They did not like what they saw but this problem will not go away.</P>
      <P>I watched a programme on BBC 2 last night which dealt with a particularly horrific child abuse case. In the discussion afterwards the frightening point was made that child abuse is not the preserve of institutional care. The majority of child abuse occurs within families. We were brought up to praise and revere the family. I had a very happy childhood and a good upbringing, as I am sure most Members did, to the point that I could not conceive as an adult that there could be another way of life or that a more horrific upbringing was quite common. Unfortunately, it is still very common today. It behoves us as people in positions of influence to put children first and to see to their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad this commission will be chaired by the Taoiseach. I presume that means the Taoiseach of the day, not just the present Taoiseach. I hope that in succeeding Governments the Taoiseach of the day will chair a Cabinet committee for children. I would have gone further than that. When I chaired the Oireachtas committee it occurred to me that we needed a senior Minister responsible for children. It may not sound bright or intelligent, but I would have gone so far as to abolish the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Edu<Col N="881" /> cation and Science and substituted them with departments of children, adults and senior citizens.</P>
    <P>Most of us here who have dealt with Departments and health boards will realise that the focus of all the committees, boards or Departments are systems driven and focused. They are not customer, child, adult or senior citizen focused. Anyone who has been a member of these boards will be well aware of the mountain of paper that arrives on the desk on a weekly basis but makes no mention of customers. These papers refer to the systems by which the service will be brought to the customer. We are told these bodies focus on the customer's needs. They are not, rather they are focusing on the system's needs. We must think about this problem. I am not saying something that we all do not know; this is what is happening but we must get back to the point. Perhaps a Department of children or a committee chaired by the Taoiseach of the day which will focus on the needs of children might get something done. We should not expect miracles. First, we must educate the adult population and parents that there is a different and better way to treat children.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry spoke about the generation of women who stayed at home in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. During those years women had to retire on marriage no matter how good their position in the public service. I am talking about teachers, nurses and doctors. That generation of women, to whom I pay tribute, raised the generation who are reaping the benefits today of their sacrifice.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am getting paranoid in my old age, but I feel the glossy media, such as the Saturday magazines of the <i>Irish Times</i> and <i>Irish Independent</i>, downgrade parenthood and regard it as an optional extra. It is not &ndash; it is full-time and the most demanding job any couple can take up. I do not have to tell that to this House. The committee on children should look at the way the media in our society can place an emphasis that is to the detriment of the greater good of society, although I do not say it does that deliberately.</P>
    <P>I am glad children will have a voice and be given new opportunities at national level. I hope it will not be just the children who are vocal and good communicators who are given this voice. The children at the back of the class, the ones who are bullied and cannot fight their corner, should also be given a voice.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that children's lives will be better understood. Should she not have said that families' lives will be better understood? The focus should be on the family. I am talking here about the wider family, not just the nuclear family of a father, mother and a few children. The dynamics of how families function should be studied and time should be invested in looking at them. That would be for the greater good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. When I discovered I was to speak in this debate I decided to look for some information. I tried several Departments, which were all running around in circles trying to find out which was taking responsibility for this debate. That is not good enough. We are talking here about young lives, children who are not being cared for and lack adequate child care facilities, and how best to improve that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's speech which gave me new ideas on this. She spoke about a strategy for the child care of the future and the need to have a vision of where we are going. This strategy would take the whole child into perspective. It would be a listening concept and would understand the child's needs. It would promote aspects of all their development and try to introduce a better quality of life.</P>
      <P>We must start from that point because the whole concept of life has changed. The model family we all grew up in has changed, which has created problems for the very young generation which is trying to cope with the ills in society today, through no fault of theirs. We must take up the pieces in that regard, but I wonder how well we are doing that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's statement that she is setting up a national children's office which will co-ordinate the various Departments. That would be a start in the right direction. I did not know to which office I should go to get information for this debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the money being provided for extra child care facilities. Due to my knowledge of the educational world, I welcome the allocation of money for the provision of facilities in schools, such as extra lighting and heating, which will allow young people who cannot go home to remain in school until later in the afternoon. That must be encouraged and all our educationalists must play their part in it. There is still a lot of apprehension about allowing schools to stay open to provide that facility to the young children of the area. I am adamant that should be the future policy, and not just for the chosen few who have an interest in this area. I welcome the start in that direction.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has provided planning guidelines, under which any new development will have to incorporate child care facilities. That must be done in all areas. Past experience has shown that people who decide to set up a crèche are met with such objections that no facilities are provided in the area. We are being visionary now, in a way we were not in the past when infrastructure for our children was provided in a willy nilly fashion. I welcome the co-ordinated plan, where all the Departments will come together to develop a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on early childhood addresses how best we can facilitate the very young, in <Col N="883" /> terms of the early start school programmes, which give parents a chance to develop parenting skills. We often find that parents do not know how to rear their children and are looking for support. Teachers have a much bigger role to play in this regard and should be given that opportunity. Perhaps one of the reasons we have unrest in the teaching profession is that teachers are asked to do things they are not paid for. This is an opportunity for a co-ordinated plan to facilitate parenting skills by co-operating with young parents on how best they can break this cycle in their area.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of visionary thinking in the budget and the speech by the Minister of State. The Government is committed to ensuring the future quality of life of our young children. As matters stand, these issues are all over the place, which was clear from the Minister of State's statement that she is trying to bring it all together.</P>
    <P>This is a welcome debate, which is getting better as it goes on. Members have highlighted many issues that can be brought together. We must protect the young. They will be the future society and they are where we were many moons ago. We must give them the chances we have had. We should do whatever we can, as parliamentarians, to give young people a better quality of life and a start. That commitment was given in the speech this evening by the Minister of State. We have a vision for the future and a commitment in the budget. I expect the forthcoming budget will have more to say in regard to child care facilities and courses to standardise the training of child carers. Child benefits will also be provided from which all parents will benefit, enabling them help their children grow up into healthy young adults.</P>

      <P>I welcome this important debate on this very significant issue. The issue of child care has been on the political agenda for the past two decades. Various Governments have spoken a lot of palaver about it. However, the current Government is the first really to tackle this issue. It has grasped the nettle and put in place a system, including financial support, for the betterment of child care in the future. It is important to note that before this Government came into office, very little was done about this issue other than to talk about it.</P>
      <P>The Government has committed serious funding to this area under the national development plan. The Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Social, Community and Family Affairs have together laid the foundation for the future of child care. Much more needs to be done, but a start has been made. The Government has taken the first steps in dealing with the future of child care and of young people, who are the future of this country. It has made a huge commitment to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's designation of a Minister of State with special responsibility for children has <Col N="884" /> been an important factor. Child care grants totalling approximately £14.1 million have been approved. Some will be provided under capital funding. These grants will support approximately 5,300 places in community based child care facilities, including the establishment of over 2,200 new child care places. This is significant progress.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism among the Opposition and the media that not enough has been done. However, we are moving in the right direction. I am confident that under the national development plan and the programme and funding available for child care and related matters, the dreams and desires of those involved in child care will be put in place. In this regard, a number of grants have been approved to date &ndash; 30 relate to capital projects for community based child care services, 81 relate to staffing grants for such services and the remaining 55 grants are for self-employed child care providers.</P>
    <P>As a result of a Government initiative, supported by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Ministers concerned, the National Voluntary Child Care Organisation was launched. I today received a copy of the national children's strategy document, Our Children &ndash; Their Lives. I have not fully perused it, but it is a most important document. It deals with a number of important issues, including the establishment of a Cabinet sub-committee, chaired by the Taoiseach. That indicates the seriousness with which the Taoiseach and the Government view the issue. The sub-committee will involve all Ministers concerned, including the Ministers for Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Social, Community and Family Affairs. They will oversee the co-ordination of Government policy for children and the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>It is also important to recognise that the strategy envisages that a national children's advisory council will bring together all the key sectors working with children to advise the Ministers and to oversee the implementation of strategy. A full review will take place of all Departments' responsibilities and a national play and recreational plan will be developed. A dedicated fund will be established to implement it.</P>
    <P>The essence of the national children's strategy is to ensure that children will have a voice. They will no longer be the forgotten aspect of family and community structures. The establishment of Dáil na n-Óg is a revolutionary new concept. I welcome it and praise the endeavours of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the relevant Ministers.</P>
    <P>Last week the House debated the establishment of a press Ombudsman to monitor and self-regulate the press and journalists in view of recent developments in that area. Following support from the Minister of State at the Department <Col N="885" /> of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, an office of ombudsman for children is to be established. I welcome that.</P>
    <P>These are some of the new initiatives that have been put together under this strategy. I welcome them and I am confident that much more will be achieved over the next 18 months, during the remainder of the lifetime of this Government, whose term of office I have no doubt will be completed. I hope that when the national development plan will be implemented in the period 2001-06 there will be in place a solid structure of child care co-ordinated by different Departments on a nationwide basis and covering all aspects, with back-up funding and follow-up programmes in place.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, and the Minster of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, for attending this debate. The Government has made a huge start. Bíonn gach tosach lag. The Government's commitment to child care and related services is one of which we can be proud. It has grasped the nettle and has moved forward from the talking shops that existed over the past 20 years. I am pleased we are moving in a positive direction and I encourage all those involved to see matters through over the coming years to ensure that the most vulnerable sector of our society will get the support and care they need in their vulnerable years.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;equally&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and determines to put in place a free national system of pre-school education.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome this debate on the need to cherish all the children of the nation equally. I agree with the first clause of the motion, which states: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann recognises the need to cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo;. However, I am not pleased with the next clause, which states: &ldquo;the need to provide adequate child care facilities appropriate to the requirements of a modern, prosperous society&rdquo;. Surely we need to provide child care facilities and give children the best chance in life without the limitation of the words &ldquo;appropriate to the requirements of a modern, prosperous society&rdquo;, as if to suggest that now is the time to look at child care needs and that we could disregard them when the society was not prosperous. There is a greater need to put better facilities in place at present, but I do not like the nuance of the second clause of the motion. Cherishing all the children of the nation is an end in itself without being tempered by considerations of whether we are a modern or prosperous society. We still have a long way to go and the Fine Gael amendment goes some way towards outlining what needs to be done.</P>

      <Col N="886" /> Barnardos made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Family, Social and Community Affairs yesterday. They were also speaking on behalf of Pavee Point, Focus Ireland and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. The facts they outlined to the committee are very stark: Ireland has one of the worst rates of child poverty in the EU; one in six children lives in a family considered to be consistently poor, namely low income families which lack certain basic necessities; one in four children lives in a family with less than half of average income; and children of lone parents and children in larger families are more likely to experience poverty.</P>
    <P>In the area of education the following statistics were outlined. Approximately 5,000 young people leave school early each year and a further 1,000 do not transfer from primary to second level; the majority of disadvantaged pupils &ndash; 60% &ndash; live in rural areas, followed by Dublin at 25.5%, although we might have expected it to be the other way around; one in ten children leaves primary school with significant literacy problems; many children in Ireland lack appropriate or adequate play provision &ndash; golf courses are twice as numerous as playgrounds &ndash; and 46% of local authorities do not provide any playgrounds. Local authorities which are empowered and have a responsibility to provide playgrounds are actually closing down existing ones for insurance reasons and the possibility of compensation claims; the participation rate of Traveller children in the education system is very low, particularly at second level, and infant mortality in the Traveller population is twice that of the settled community; and the vast majority of schools are inaccessible physically, socially and educationally to children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>There were 160 homeless, unattached children in the Dublin area in one week in March 1999. In 1999, the Cork Simon Community received 100 contacts from young homeless people with drug and alcohol abuse problems. It is ironic that the motion states adequate child care should be provided in a prosperous society. We should provide such care in any event but we do not have any excuse for not providing it at present.</P>
    <P>I tabled an amendment to the motion because I am quite alarmed by the direction in which child care is going at present. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently announced a £250 million capital investment in child care and the Taoiseach announced a further investment of £40 million to be directed at local communities rather than at the private sector. This funding is essentially directed towards the acquisition of suitable premises for crèches and other child care facilities. It is further directed at the business sector in order to enable parents to go out to work. The huge issue of current expenditure remains. It is all very well to have a premises but how are people to run these expensive facilities? Child care staff are very poorly paid and nobody has <Col N="887" /> yet addressed the fact that, by and large, their wage rates are below the national minimum wage level.</P>
    <P>We should look at the provision of child care from an educational rather than a business point of view. The issue of child development should be tackled in a holistic way. We have forgotten about education in this debate. We should be operating a system of child care which derives not only from the need to care for a child when its parents are at work but which also considers the child's development needs. Those needs are being ignored in this booming society because of the need to attract increasing numbers of parents into the workforce.</P>
    <P>A free national pre-school education system should be put in place for the two to four year old age group, particularly the three to four year old cohort. A primary education system is not sufficient. Child benefit goes towards feeding and clothing children but how does one deal with the children's educational and development needs? There seems to be a suggestion that this could be done by providing an additional taxed benefit from the State. I am not sure that is the way to proceed because it will only be directed at working parents.</P>
    <P>We have been putting the cart before the horse in regard to this issue. The State provides free primary, second level and third level education and must now provide a system of free pre-school education. That would do a great deal to lighten the burden of child care for parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach. I support the motion and share the widely held view that child benefit represents a key instrument for tackling child poverty and targeting child income support. Child benefit is a universal payment which is not taxable and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits. Therefore, it does not contribute to disincentives to taking up employment or to improving wages.</P>
      <P>I welcome the role played by this Government since it took up office in making the child benefit scheme the cornerstone of income support for families with children. Recognising that the loss of child dependant allowances can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities, the Government has focused on the provision of substantial increases in child benefit, while maintaining child dependant allowance rates at existing levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strides made by this Government in strengthening the child benefit scheme are evident from the increasing value of child income support payments since the policy commenced in 1994. Since 1994, the combined child benefit/child dependant allowance payment has increased by more than double the rate of inflation and the proportion represented by child benefit has increased from 29% to 47%. Moreover, the lower <Col N="888" /> rate of child benefit has increased from £30 to £42.50 per month, and the higher rate from £39 to £56 per month since the Government took office. These policies have resulted in real gains for all families with children.</P>
    <P>The Government has also made a commitment to increase the payment substantially over the period of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for third and subsequent children. I hope the Government can advance moves towards achieving this target in the forthcoming budget because larger families tend to be at greater risk of poverty.</P>
    <P>Because of the universal nature of the child benefit scheme, resources directed through it can directly benefit all children, regardless of the parents' income or labour force status. The fact that payment is normally vested in the mother has a number of advantages. First, it is a way of recognising the important value of the unpaid work done by the primary carer, who is usually the mother and, second, research shows that the payment is more likely to be used for the benefit of the child if paid to the primary carer. It is clear, therefore, that child benefit has a key role in assisting all parents with the financial burden of raising children. In view of this, I would broadly welcome any proposals made by the Government to further enhance the child benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to child care costs and a potential role for child benefit, I note the Government has made a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, following a consultation process with the social partners, to adopt a strategy to support parents in meeting their child care needs. The resolution of this issue is by no means straightforward. Anyone who has child care costs will say that costs for younger children can be higher than for school-going children, because younger children require care on a full-time basis. An age related payment designed to pay higher amounts to younger children could be one option. On the other hand, some people may find that their child care costs are higher because they live in a certain area or there is a limited choice of suitable child care. For these people, a form of tax relief which relates to the level of their expenditure may be an option.</P>
    <P>Some people may take the view that a child care payment directed at all parents, whether they are looking after the children within the home or outside, is the moot equitable solution. Indeed, advancing the process of increasing child benefit would be a way of ensuring that benefits accrue to all families across the board, whether the care of children is being provided within or outside the home.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Government will carefully consider to what extent child benefit should feature in any proposals to assist parents with child care costs. I wish it well in its efforts to find <Col N="889" /> a solution to this complex matter and look forward to the outcome.</P>
    <P>The issue of responsibility was touched upon by Senator Costello. I remind the Senator and everybody else that the primary responsibility for the education of children lies with the parents. I have also raised in the House and with my local authority the number of juvenile children, aged eight, nine or ten years, on the streets of our towns, villages and cities in the early hours of the morning. This begs the question as to where are their parents. Those who have read <i>Oliver Twist</i>, that great novel by Dickens, know there are still Fagins in society who are ready to take on those children.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, and commend her for being here. However, I particularly commend the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin. I welcome the speech she made here this evening and acknowledge the coherence she has brought to the issue of child care since she took up her position as Minister. There has certainly been a great tying up of loose ends and fragmentation and a new coherence is beginning to emerge, which is welcome. There is also a determination on the part of the Minister to drive the agenda forward, which gives me grounds for optimism.</P>
      <P>I particularly like the primacy she has placed on child care in its own right in the context of her strategy document, not child care with the aim of freeing up more women to enable them join the work force and underpin a rapidly growing economy, which is only of secondary importance. I am also pleased with the manner in which she has put this committee in place, to be headed by the Taoiseach, and the promise that every Department will be child proofed. We can look forward to some improvements resulting from this. The document is highly aspirational and it will take enormous courage and determination to realise its objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly thank the Senators who engaged in the debate. I thank Senator Ridge for the common sense and grounded approach she brings to this issue. It is obvious she has a real, living understanding of what is involved rather than a textbook understanding. Her comments are always interesting. Senator Jackman complimented me personally but said I was speaking on my own behalf and was not in anyway giving <Col N="890" /> voice to party policy. However, that is not correct. She invited me to speak to the Tánaiste and to ask her to embrace what I said. In fact I was quoting from what the Tánaiste said at our national conference, namely, that &ldquo;the Progressive Democrats are committed to a policy principle of getting rid of and once and for all eliminating child poverty&rdquo;. Senator Jackman has either intentionally or otherwise misread our position on this issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry welcomed my motion but said she detected a lack of urgency. I am afraid that again she misrepresented the position. There is extreme urgency on this matter. The Progressive Democrats are asking for an increase in child benefit to £100 in the same spirit and sense of urgency as when we had included in the joint programme for Government the objective of raising old age pensions to £100 per week.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello said he would come to the House to hear what I had to say. I was intrigued to see his amendment to the motion relating to the provision of a national system of nursery care. I clearly and distinctly remember &ndash; it is on record &ndash; when I was a Deputy and when the Minister and Senator Costello's party abolished third level fees for everybody irrespective of family income. At that time I put it to the Minister that she had the option of investing the money in the lowest rung of the education ladder, namely, pre-school education. However, she put the resources into the abolition of third level fees for every family in the land irrespective of income. That was the priority of the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The abolition of third level fees cost hardly any money as the system was being abused by investment.</P>

      <P>That was the priority of the Labour Party Minister, something which is on the record of the House. If we were having a debate on education I would be very strong in asking for funding for pre-school education, but that is not the specific topic of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly I wish to refer to the point made by Senator Fitzpatrick who said there must be a cultural change in the country if we are to deal with the issue of child neglect. He is correct; there has to be a cultural change as there is evidence, perhaps not of deliberate neglect, but of child carelessness when there should be child care. Because of that we have teenage drinking, with teenagers on the streets unsupervised and uncared for. Unless we have the full support of families and the community to work in parallel with what the Government is now proposing we will not have a culture of child care and the country will not be <Col N="891" /> a good or healthy place for all our children to grow up in and become responsible adults.</P>
    <P>I very much thank those who support the motion. The objective of raising child benefit to <Col N="892" /> £100 is very worthy and must be pursued and acknowledged in the next budget. I am very sorry that the House must divide on an issue as basic as child care.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Senator Tom Hayes. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to hear this matter.</P>
      <P>Ballytarsna national school is situated on the N8 between Horse and Jockey and Cashel, a very dangerous stretch of road which came to national attention because of a dreadful car accident which occurred there last week. My colleague, Senator Hayes, is familiar with the area. It is in the unusual position of being in the south Tipperary county council area and the constituency of Tipperary North.</P>
      <P>I was in Ballytarsna school yesterday. It is a small primary school in a building which is very pleasant, were it not for the dreadful noise outside. It is a small school of only 50 pupils and has been successful in winning several tidy schools contests. The school is situated right on the N8 and despite the fact that the county council has put up double white lines, flashing lights on either side of the school, warning signs and road markings, it is still subject to speeding traffic. Yesterday, as I drove to the school from Horse and Jockey I had to drive a considerable distance past the building in order to find a safe place to turn across the oncoming traffic.</P>
      <P>At three o'clock in the afternoon, parents pull in to collect pupils. Only last April a potentially serious incident occurred when an articulated truck veered across the road at about three o'clock in the afternoon. It was only by the grace of God that the truck was not carrying a heavy load and a massacre was avoided.</P>
      <P>The parents and teachers in the school are very anxious about this situation. They have been told by a departmental inspector that the school will be relocated but they have not been informed of this officially and in writing. The relocation is unlikely to happen for approximately two years. The file on this matter in the Department needs to be marked urgent and sent up the line as quickly as possible. A safe environment must be created for the 50 pupils of Ballytarsna national school, their families and teachers. I look forward to hearing a positive response from the Minister of State.</P>

      <Col N="893" />
      <Col N="894" /> To understand the urgency of this situation it is necessary to visit Ballytarsna. It is situated a few miles from Cashel on the main road. Last Friday night three people were killed in a road accident almost beside the school. I attended the funerals in Cahir and I know some of the emergency personnel who attended the scene of the accident. Such was the severity of the accident that some of the emergency personnel needed counselling afterwards. Only three months ago the principal, Chris Hayes, asked me to come out to see where a lorry driver had a miraculous escape and, were it not for his good driving skills, would have crashed into the school yard where children were playing.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara outlined the urgency of the case and she did not overstate it. I urge the Department and the Minister to address this issue. This school must be dealt with as a matter of urgency. I know land is available because several people in the locality have offered it. If a new school is built, the existing school could be sold so there would not be a huge cost factor. It would not cost much to build a new school. The Minister should put pressure on the Department to speed up this process because this is an emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Senators for raising this important issue. I assure them the points they have raised will be drawn to the attention of the relevant people in the Department of Education and Science. I have been asked on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science to outline to both Senators and to the House the Department's position on the accommodation needs of Ballytarsna national school in County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>Discussions have been ongoing for some time. These began originally when the board of management of the school submitted an application to the Department of Education and Science for grant aid for the provision of additional accommodation at the existing location. Subsequently, the board changed its request and applied for a new school building on an alternative site, following a road traffic accident adjacent to the entrance. It was pointed out that the school is located at a dangerous bend on the N8, the main Dublin to Cork road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It arose in the discussions that another small school in the same parish as Ballytarsna national school had sought capital funding from the Department of Education and Science. The local schools inspector raised the question of amalgamation and this was discussed for some time. The Minister and the Department understand that neither school supports this approach at this time. In the circumstances the Department is satisfied that the safety issues affecting Ballytarsna national school must be dealt with on its own merits. Accordingly, the Department will shortly contact the school authorities to determine how <Col N="895" /> the safety of its pupils can best be addressed in the immediate and long term.</P>
    <P>I will draw to the attention of the relevant officials the points raised by both Senators because the safety of children is important for all of us. I hope a satisfactory solution will be found when the Department of Education and Science contacts the school authorities shortly to determine how best to address the safety issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, to the House. I know he is aware of this matter because he is a frequent visitor to Letterkenny.</P>
      <P>A report was carried out for the Department of Health and Children on the development of treatment for systematic breast diseases by the National Cancer Forum, which has been charged with modernising cancer treatment. I agree with some of the issues raised. Alarming statistics were quoted in the report, such as the fact that 700 women die annually from breast cancer. It also highlighted the necessity for proper surgeons to attend patients so they had a greater chance of surviving for a longer period after the cancer had been diagnosed. The more experience a person gets, the better equipped he or she is in the field. According to the report, those who attend surgeons on a full-time basis are better looked after.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has appointed a new group to consider the implementation of the recommendations. While I agree with some of its recommendations, I do not agree with others. It highlighted the fact that women have to travel long distances to treatment centres and that this was a big issue and that all women should be entitled to a quality transport service to bring them to the clinics more quickly than is the case in some areas. It also recommended that the 20 hospitals providing treatment should be reduced to 13 and that the best expertise should be concentrated in a number of hospitals which would improve the treatment and prognosis of women with cancer. It also referred to providing specialist units with a full team of breast surgeons, radiologists and pathologists.</P>
      <P>The report states that the location of the centres of excellence should be decided on the basis of population. It also recommends that there should be up to 300,000 people in the catchment area where this service is provided and that the centre should treat up to 100 cases per annum. I do not accept that. Certain parts of the country have been forgotten in terms of roads and other issues. Peripheral rural areas are entitled to this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I raise this issue this evening is that the report recommends the closure of the service <Col N="896" /> at Letterkenny General Hospital on the basis of the distance some people must travel. It recommends that a formal link should be established with Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry. At the same time it recommends that Sligo General Hospital should service patients in surrounding counties, including south Donegal, Cavan, Leitrim and parts of Mayo. However, it seems to have forgotten that Sligo General Hospital does not have a proper service because it was later into the field than Letterkenny General Hospital. The north-west is unique in terms of its geographic position. That is why I raised this issue.</P>
    <P>A great service is provided in Letterkenny General Hospital. There are difficulties in terms of waiting lists but it has been developed into a fine hospital with a good team of surgeons, doctors and nurses. The north-west has a population of 210,000. Breast cancer services were established in the Letterkenny service centre in 1993. The report states it does not have a large volume of patients. However, it fails to state how many people have attended the services and have had the comfort of knowing there was nothing positive in their tests. It homes in on the number treated for breast cancer surgery. More than 1,000 patients are examined annually in Letterkenny General Hospital and 50 are treated as a result of positive tests. That is 50% of the recommendation. It should consider the fact that Donegal is thinly populated in some areas and that people have long distances to travel.</P>
    <P>Letterkenny General Hospital has provided an efficient service. Many people who have attended there and the population in general have great confidence in the service. If a lot of the cases where there is a suspicion had to go to Derry, particularly those from the Glencolumbkille, Killybegs and Kilcar areas, many of the women may shy away from going, whereas at the moment, they are happy to go to Letterkenny. Letterkenny provides surgery and chemotherapy and when stronger chemotherapy is needed, the patients can go to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The service has been provided by the urological surgeon, Mr. Moran, on a very professional basis and patients are treated with sensitivity, particularly the women involved. What is needed in Letterkenny is not a closure of the service but a top class service. I am asking the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Martin, to provide a full-time breast cancer surgeon, a radiologist and a pathologist to Letterkenny. Much of the equipment is already in place and there would not need to be a huge investment in that regard. Many women, who have been treated in Letterkenny, have contacted me over the last weeks since the issue became public and they are very annoyed that the service is being taken away, particularly those who may need the service in the future.</P>
    <P>The report refers to the long distances people must travel. It may be a short distance for the <Col N="897" /> people in the Inishowen area to travel to Derry and it may be convenient for those in the Ballyshannon and Bundoran area to travel to Sligo but what about the people in the west of Donegal from Glencolumbkille to the Downings and Milford? They are entitled to the same service as everyone else. The fact the area is not heavily populated like the cities should not prevent it from having that service.</P>
    <P>Anyone who travels on the road network in Donegal will know how long it will take to upgrade them. The distance to Letterkenny from places like Dungloe, Gweedore and Falcarragh is maybe three quarters of an hour, but it is a bit longer from Glencolumbkille. I believe Letterkenny should remain open on that basis alone. The North Western Health Board has been complimented by the Department for many years for the efficient service. Indeed, funding at the end of the year is provided on the basis of efficiency and both those hospitals in the north western region continually receive additional funding.</P>
    <P>Mr. Moran, the urologist in Letterkenny, described the report as ambiguous at best and probably disingenuous. It is his belief that the service should remain in Letterkenny. The service in Letterkenny has a multidimensional approach comparable to that anywhere else in the country. Official statistics from the public health department of the heath board show that mortality rates for breast cancer in the north west region are lower than those in the rest of the country. This should prove that the service has been operating efficiently in Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>The group which carried out the report visited Letterkenny and acknowledged that it had a quality service, yet when it recently became public, it compared Letterkenny with many of the other smaller hospitals in the country. There is no need to move the breast cancer service from Letterkenny. Indeed, Mr. Moran has stated that Letterkenny should show Derry how to run a proper service.</P>
    <P>Letterkenny has as good a service as any elsewhere in the country. We would like it to be improved and to be appointed as one of the centres of excellence. I am totally against using statistics of population as a basis for making decisions. Letterkenny and Donegal have proved on many occasions that they will always come up with private funding, as was the case with the CAT scan through the Friends of Letterkenny Hospital. The Donegal hospice unit building has just commenced.</P>
    <P>We have always played second fiddle to Sligo in many things, including orthodontic treatment for school children, hip operations and other operations, in that Sligo has had the service first, In this case, we had the breast cancer service first and we want to retain that service. There is deep concern in Donegal and we want the service to continue there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> The hospice building has commenced. Nearly £1.5 million has been provided &ndash; nearly £1 million by the local community in Donegal through different fund raising activities. At present there is a shortfall of £650,000 and we are looking for funding from the Minister of State's Department from the lottery. We lost out last year but the building has now started. The Minister, Deputy McDaid, one of the Minister of State's colleagues, is the chairman of the Donegal hospice and has done great work over the years. I hope some of the shortfall can be made up from lottery funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity afforded to me this evening by Senator Bonner to address the House on the issue of cancer services at Letterkenny General Hospital on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable development in the care and treatment of patients with cancer over the last number of years. Since the launch of the National Cancer Strategy in November 1996 and the announcement of the action plan for the implementation of the strategy in March 1997 considerable improvements have taken place in this area.</P>
      <P>The two underlying principles of the National Cancer Strategy are to take all measures possible to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer in line with the targets established in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment and that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>Underlying these objectives is the need for a high quality patient-focused service. One of the specific objectives of the strategy is to ensure that all patients have access to an equitable, effective service with a uniformly high quality of care, wherever they live.</P>
      <P>Since the strategy was launched, regional directors of cancer services were appointed in each health board area. One regional director was appointed in the North Western Health Board area for a three year term to be based at Letterkenny General Hospital with a regional remit. The regional director has recently been re-appointed for a further term.</P>
      <P>The National Cancer Forum and Professor James Fennelly, special advisor on cancer services to the Department, advised on appropriate developments in each area. On a national basis, £41 million of dedicated funding has been allocated since 1997 for the development of cancer services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past four years £2.9 million of dedicated cancer funding for the development of cancer services has been allocated to the North Western Health Board. This funding has enabled the board to make considerable progress in terms of enhancing the cancer services in the region. A <Col N="899" /> candidate for the post of medical oncologist has been recommended by the LAC and interviews have been held for the post of consultant haematologist. These posts will be based at Letterkenny general hospital.</P>
    <P>The board is also in the process of recruiting additional specialist nursing and paramedical staff. These posts will be processed in tandem with the consultant posts. The extension to the day services unit, Letterkenny general hospital, is complete. Included in this development are facilities for oncology services. This development comprises of a new eight bay oncology area. This unit forms an integral part of the board's strategy together with the staff appointments outlined previously and will enable more patients to remain in the region to avail of the board's cancer services.</P>
    <P>The Minister has received the report of the subgroup of the National Cancer Forum on the development of symptomatic breast disease services. The Minister has not taken any final decisions on its implementation, but accepts the broad thrust of the report while considering that some further refinements are needed in relation to implementation arrangements at local level. In this context, an advisory group was established under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins to liaise with and assist health boards in formulating their plans for the development of the services. This group has met the chief executive <Col N="900" /> officer of the North Western Health Board. The board is currently considering this development.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children is continuing to work with the National Cancer Forum and the regional directors of cancer services in identifying priorities for the further development of cancer services in all regions, building on the major progress made to date. I take on board the Senator's comments regarding the developments at Letterkenny hospital to date and also the excellent developments regarding the hospice. In view of the excellent progress that has been made and also the special commitment of the community to that service, there is no reason the Department should not be in a position to assist it further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his positive remarks in relation to the hospice. I welcome his statement that the broad thrust of the report is accepted by the Minister but that further refinements are needed in relation to the implementation arrangements at local level. We do not want the position reviewed on the basis of statistical evidence of population alone. It is a vast area of land and we want to be treated properly, particularly as the service has been well developed to date. I will leave the matter in the hands of the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, and the Minister, Deputy Martin, and I look forward to a positive response in the future.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 November 2000.</P>
