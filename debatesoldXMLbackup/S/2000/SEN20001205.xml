      <P>I have notice from Senator Ridge that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science immediately to provide a replacement psychologist for St. Mary's junior school, Rowlagh, Clondalkin, in view of the current situation where children of this school have been deprived of a psychological service for more than two year.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, motion re referral of draft code of standards and behaviour of civil servants to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, to be taken without debate, and No. 2, statements on the interim report of flooding on the Shannon river, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes and on which Senators may share time.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader provide time for a discussion in the House today on the ASTI strike, the fact that thousands of teachers are currently outside Leinster House, the huge disruption this is causing to parents and pupils, particularly examination candidates, and the unsatisfactory way the teachers are being dealt with by the Department of Education and Science?</P>
      <P>What is the position in regard to the Registration of Lobbyists Bill, which it was promised would be taken at the beginning of December. The Leader did not mention it today. Will he give us some indication of when he intends to take it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader provide time this week for a <Col N="1234" /> discussion on food quality, particularly the position of the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, who has a financial interest in a farm which does not follow the feeding procedures used by 90% of piggeries? Given that the Minister of State spends a lot of time abroad promoting Irish food quality, I question his credibility on this issue, in light of the recent revelations.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader also provide time today to afford Senator O'Toole an opportunity to give the full details of the 2000 budget to this House in light of the unprecedented motion tabled on the Order Paper?</P>

      <P>I would be very pleased to give my budget speech here tomorrow afternoon as an alternative budget strategy, if that is what is required. I look forward to speaking on the motion later and I hope its contents will be shown to be true. I expect to propose that motion tomorrow and I look forward to a full discussion of it, particularly the Senator's contribution, which I think will be very helpful.</P>
      <P>It has been urged on a number of recent occasions that the general issue of industrial relations should be discussed in the House. Given that the agreement between the social partners which emerged from Government Buildings last night has effectively shown the PPF has the flexibility to deal with difficulties and to move on, this is something that could be discussed and&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business last week I pointed out there was an indication by the Government that it would increase maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks, arising from the review of the PPF. I asked the Leader to inquire when the necessary amendment would be made to the legislation. I understand it can be done by ministerial order. Will the Leader indicate as soon as possible when it will be done as many people are depending on it?</P>
      <P>I understand we will debate the BSE issue later in the week. While I do not want to make a political point about the Minster of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, the controversy surrounding him needs to be explained. The beef industry is the most vital industry in the country and we need to have trust and confidence in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>That a debate on the teachers' dispute be taken before item 1.</P>
      <P>I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House for this debate, which will give us the opportunity to put on record our views on the matter. We have not had a debate on this issue since the dispute started a number of weeks ago and it is of enormous importance to parents and school children. As legislators it is very important we ensure the matter is dealt with properly. I ask the Leader to facilitate the House on this issue to ensure that the amendment will not be put to a vote and that all Members be given the opportunity now to tease out the many issues involved and make suggestions regarding a resolution of this very serious matter.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn that it would be good if we got a preview of the budget from Senator O'Toole. He knows a lot about it. I wonder if the Minister for Finance knows what is involved in as much detail as the Senator or the teachers involved in the benchmarking proposals. I am not sure if the ASTI would welcome all aspects of the motion the Senator has put down for this week's Private Members' business.</P>

      <P>We only get some detail on the budget after it has been presented to the other House. We have a unique opportunity to get a preview of it before then.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday the House had to pass all Stages of the ICC Bank Bill without the opportunity to table amendments and give the Bill proper parliamentary scrutiny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to the procedures operating in the House. Last Thursday we protested that we would not take all Stages of a Bill and we put that to a division. We perceived that an extraordinary general meeting was taking place that had presumed the outcome of our discussions.We now read in the newspapers that not only has it taken place but that the ICC has been sold for £220 million to the Bank of Scotland, which is outrageous. It has been sold for a song.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time we called a halt to it and emphasised the importance of ensuring that each Stage of a Bill is dealt with separately so that it can be properly examined. This House should not be seen as rubber stamping legislation or being part of a charade in dealing with legislation which ensures that we do not have hand, act or part in its format. We must ensure that pro<Col N="1237" /> per mechanisms are in place and that we do not go down that road again.</P>

      <P>We should all welcome last night's agreement on the PPF. It shows that social partnership can solve problems which arise from time to time. We should bear in mind that it does work.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to accommodate an urgent debate on the beef industry and food safety. The magnitude of the difficulties in relation to BSE must be discussed as a matter of urgency. I ask the Leader to accommodate that request as soon as he can.</P>
      <P>Last week I sought a debate on climate change and on the outcome of the negotiations in the Hague. I ask the Leader to accommodate that in the near future.</P>

      <P>I second Senator Costello's amendment to the Order of Business. I have raised the teachers' issue on a number of occasions recently. Thousands of teachers are outside the gates today. Deputy Kenny showed initiative in the other House by asking that a commission on teaching be set up which would deal with all the problems affecting teachers. I am sure Senator O'Toole would agree with that. The Minister cannot ignore the teachers. We would be remiss in our duty&mdash;</P>

      <P>A recent report on disabled people makes for worrying reading. While it applies to only one county, there is a possibility that the statistics in it could apply to any part of Ireland. For example, of the 80% of disabled people who wished to get employment, only 23% were successful. The reasons given are lack of qualifications, low pay and attitudes of employers. However, the same problems apply in education, accommodation and transport. Will the Leader arrange for a debate on this issue? The last time the issue of disability was debated in this House it was confined to a very controversial issue. I would prefer to debate the issue on its own merits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise an issue which arises from a life sentence imposed by the High Court today on an accused person who committed one of the most horrendous murders in a long time. The accused person, who was already serving a life sentence in Castlerea Prison, committed the murder while on temporary release. This raises a serious question as to why a person serving a sentence for such a serious offence should be on unsupervised temporary release. The outcome of that release on St. Valentine's Day last year was this murder.</P>
      <P>Last week we had a long debate on prison policy. Some of us who raised the matter of the inadequacies in the prison system in relation to unsupervised releases, rehabilitation and so on got no better answer from the Minister than outbursts of emotion and anger. Will the Leader request the Minister to come back to this House to give an outline of his policy in this area and his proposals for the establishment of a parole board? That is very relevant in light of what has taken place in the courts today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn raised the matter of food safety. I refer to the testing procedures in regard to food safety in view of the fact that a small firm, Irish Analytic Services of <Col N="1239" /> Bagnalstown, County Carlow, is being closed down because certain changes have taken place in the business environment. The industry analyses water, beet, soil and so on and did 47% of its work with Greencore, which has now withdrawn from the company. This affects 20 jobs at a time when we are all seeking greater food safety. This small firm has never had a problem with its analyses, whether for Greencore, Glan Bia, farmers, private individuals and so on. I ask the Leader to see what can be done to save these jobs in view of the fact that there is such a demand for greater food safety.</P>
      <P>The BSE crisis has been raised and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is in Egypt today trying to get back the Egyptian beef market. We should acknowledge that the Egyptian Ambassador has been working extremely hard on behalf of the Irish beef industry to try to re-open this trade. We must remember also when we talk about trade that it is two way traffic and we must buy a certain amount from these countries. We must look at this issue.</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues on all sides of the House in calling for a debate on BSE. I would like to ask the Leader if the Government proposes to introduce an ethics in farming Bill in light of the feeding of spinal cerebral tissue to animals and injecting them with their own excrement. I would like to know from the Ministers of the relevant Departments how they would feel if they were injected with their own dung and then forced to eat their granny's brain and spinal cord tissue. The way in which we treat animals is abominable and there is no excuse for it.  </P>
      <P>I join also with those Senators who referred to recent court cases. What is the Government's intention with regard to the issue of the insanity defence and the establishment of a parole board? These are important issues. Will the Leader draw to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs the document on torture circulated to members by Amnesty International which calls for an initiative in the foreign affairs area on the elimination of torture which currently takes place in more than 50 jurisdictions?  </P>

This is a serious problem and it is causing damage to the reputation of the agriculture industry. I call for a debate on the beef industry and I am sure that, <Col N="1240" /> given the Leader's usual willingness, it will be held in the near future.</P>

      <P>In light of the fact that the Minister for Education and Science has discovered that industrial action is taking place, I request that he come before us to listen to the constructive ideas that would be put forward by Members on this side of the House. We must break the ongoing stalemate in this dispute and a debate would be useful in that regard.</P>
      <P>Last week a young woman who was abused wished to have the identity of her abuser made known but the judge in the case, acting well within his rights, decided that it would not be appropriate to do so. He imposed a blanket ban on the reporting of anything that would indicate the identity of the perpetrator. What course of action is open to this young woman? If a victim wishes to have his or her rights vindicated, what avenues can they explore to allow them to do so?</P>

The public should be informed about the basis on which people are being released.

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for affording me <Col N="1245" /> the opportunity to acknowledge the achievement of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport in producing an interim report on flooding on the River Shannon within such a short time span. Members will be aware that I referred the issues of the management of the River Shannon to the joint committee for investigation in response to a motion from Deputy Connaughton requesting the establishment of a River Shannon statutory authority and I congratulate the committee on the production of this interim report.</P>
      <P>The issues relating to the River Shannon, whether flooding, water quality, navigation or the overall management of the river, have been the subject of debate and discussion in this House and in Dáil Éireann for many years without anybody finding the perfect solution to all the problems. This interim report confirms what we have all believed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>They should be here; they will be made available. I apologise.</P>
      <P>The problems of the River Shannon are very complex, involving many bodies with varying responsibilities, each supported by various aspects of Irish and EU legislation. Before looking at the report let us remind ourselves again of the history of the river about which we speak.</P>
      <P>The Shannon is the largest and longest river in Great Britain and Ireland. The main stem of the river is 210 miles long. The total length of the river and its tributaries is 1,130 miles. The drainage area of the system is about 6,400 square miles or the equivalent of 20% of the whole island. The Shannon system has many and sometimes conflicting facets &ndash; tourism, recreation, fishing and water based sports, water resources for industrial development and agriculture, for tours and for regional and group water supplies, effluent and waste disposal, electricity generation, flooding, drainage and water level control. Consequently there are a number of bodies both public and private involved in the development and use of the river. </P>
      <P>While many problems have been identified and associated with the River Shannon over the years, the one which constantly comes to the fore is flooding. The flooding of last winter in the Shannon catchment is the principal reason we are reviewing the interim report of the joint committee today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Flooding of the Shannon is not a recent phenomenon. History shows that it has been the subject of complaints and appeals by local inhabitants and of concern to successive Governments and responsible authorities. This is shown in reports, surveys and investigations relating to the problem extending over the last two centuries. <Col N="1246" /> These reports concerned the major works on the Shannon undertaken in the 1840s. The works were primarily for the purposes of navigation but also had the effect of improving drainage conditions. The John F. Bateman report of 1863, following the great flood of 1861, recommended the use of storage, which was Lough Allen, channel improvements and provision of services in fixed weirs. The report of the Allport Commission of 1887 recommended a 92 foot reduction in navigation depth between Killaloe and Athlone. The report of the Drainage Commission, 1938-40, reviewed the problems along the Shannon and recommended certain limited works in conjunction with its &ldquo;comprehensive scheme of arterial drainage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All these earlier investigations had a common characteristic in that they recommended only partial solutions and concluded that any overall solution would require large and costly engineering works outside the bounds of physical and economic feasibility. Such a comprehensive approach had to await the report of Mr. Rydell in 1956 which was again commissioned after a major flood event in the Shannon in 1954. Its conclusions and those of subsequent reports are dealt with in the interim report before us this evening.</P>
    <P>During that debate I also referred to the Water Framework Directive and water quality in the River Shannon in particular. Progress in that area has moved forward substantially and I would like to update the House as to the present position.</P>
    <P>The proposed Water Framework Directive was agreed by the European Parliament and Council in September 2000 and is now undergoing final drafting. It will be formally adopted shortly and will enter into force on its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The WFD will require member states to identify river basin districts, RBDs, for the purposes of water management, and to ensure the co-ordination of measures by all relevant authorities in relation to the whole RBD. The directive does not require the establishment on a new statutory authority to co-ordinate measures in an RBD. It is a matter for each member state to determine the appropriate co-ordination arrangements.</P>
    <P>The current Lough Derg and Lough Ree catchment project will conclude at end December 2000. Publication of a final report of the project is expected in February 2001. The project aims to establish a water quality monitoring and management system in relation to rivers and lakes in the Lough Derg and Lough Ree catchments. Proposals are being developed by local authorities for river basin management projects in relation to, for example, the whole Shannon catchment, the western lakes and the south east region, for example, the Barrow, Nore, Suir and Slaney catchments. Discussions are ongoing with authorities in Northern Ireland in the context of the North-South Ministerial Council, regarding the <Col N="1247" /> identification of RBDs in relation to cross-Border waters.</P>
    <P>Water quality in Loughs Derg and Ree has generally been improving. The lakes were classified in the early 1990s as strongly eutrophic. Monitoring in 1999 indicated that the water quality in both lakes is now classified as mesotrophic indicating compliance with the improvement requirements of the phosphorus regulations. Lough Derg was oligotrophic in 1998 and mesotrophic in 1999.</P>
    <P>Other lakes in the Shannon system were classified in 1999 as either mesotrophic or oligotrophic. For example, Loughs Allen, Boderg, Bofin, Drumharlow, Forbes and Oakport were classified in 1999 as oligotrophic. Lough Key was classified as mesotrophic in 1999.</P>
    <P>Facilities for the pumping out of sewage from boats have been provided by local authorities at 11 locations on the Shannon system with the primary objective of protecting water quality. The Department of the Environment and Local Government provided 100% grant assistance towards capital expenditure by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The locations of the pumping out facilities were selected and in some cases the sites were provided by the Office of Public Works in the context of its responsibilities, at the time, in relation to inland waterways. All such facilities can be operated by smartcard which facilitates weekend and after hours use.</P>
    <P>A major programme of expenditure on the provision and improvement of waste water treatment facilities is underway in the Shannon catchment under the water and sewerage services investment programme of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Waste water treatment plants are under construction or planned at 43 locations at an estimated cost of £275 million.</P>
    <P>When I referred the question of the River Shannon to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport for examination and report in April I expressed my concern about a range of issues which had been raised in the course of the debate. I stated that my desire was to find a mechanism and a way to move forward. I also expressed a desire that the matter would be expedited by the committee and I am delighted to say that this has happened. The committee did a splendid job given the complexity of the subject.</P>
    <P>The report, even though it is an interim document, has dealt comprehensively with the various and diverse bodies involved in the Shannon River catchment. The Government welcomes the conclusions and recommendations contained in this document and looks forward to receiving the final document when some of these will be expanded further.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to some of the sections of the interim report. Section 7.1 is a statement of fact <Col N="1248" /> and agreed. In section 7.2 the summer relief scheme is suggested as the best practicable. Section 7.3 refers to the option of a reasonable alleviation of the worst flooding on the Shannon and its tributaries which has been suggested on many occasions before. The problems associated with this scheme are very well chronicled where you say a more detailed stage of surveys and investigations would be essential, particularly in light of the lengthy intervening period, the changed circumstances within the catchment and the current climate of critical environmental appraisal of such a major drainage scheme. The updated cost of such a scheme would most likely make it economically unacceptable given the changes in agriculture and agricultural land use and value over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>With regard to sections 7.4 and 7.5, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will announce the allocation of funding for non-national roads at the end of January 2001. These allocations will be made in the context of the existing ten year restoration programme. The aim of the programme is to bring the network of regional and local roads in county council areas to a reasonable standard and is on target for completion by 2005. The recommendations in the report will be considered in determining these allocations.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 7.6, the Government has introduced a humanitarian aid package to alleviate hardship whenever necessary. This is being implemented through the Irish Red Cross Society. It is difficult to see how a once-off compensation package could be implemented fairly and equitably.</P>
    <P>With regard to sections 7.7 and 7.8, it is my intention to reconvene the interdepartmental committee set up originally in 1996 to review the effects of bad weather. One of the items I will ask it to look at, apart from reviewing the recent flooding, is the question of flood risk mapping. I am satisfied that this course of action is essential and the information will be invaluable, particularly for local authorities in dealing with planning applications and the preparation of development plans.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 7.9, this question has been dealt with in many previous reports. In view of the time lapse since the last examination perhaps it is due a review again and the Government will take this on board.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 7.10, this recommendation will be passed to Waterways Ireland to discuss directly with the ESB and provide details of the outcome. The recommendation in section 7.11 needs to be revisited again in the final report having regard to the various interests involved in the Shannon, to which I have already referred. No scheme of works has been undertaken on the Shannon under the Arterial Drainage Acts and there is no standard to which the river must be <Col N="1249" /> maintained. Any suggested or proposed works would certainly be subject to an environmental impact assessment and also probably planning permission. The consequential impacts of any maintenance works, particularly downstream, would also need to be determined and there are other factors which would also need to be considered. For these reasons I ask the committee to revisit this recommendation and perhaps to elaborate on what it intended together with outlining how it might be achieved.</P>
    <P>I have given a fair summary of the interim report at present but I look forward to seeing a more detailed final report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this report. I compliment the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport on submitting this interim report at such an early date. I appreciate that they were somewhat restricted, their powers were limited and that they were under a certain amount of pressure to produce a report quickly.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the report. The Shannon River Council Bill was before this House and the Government agreed to take it. We spent over 12 hours of Seanad time debating it. After a lot of manoeuvring behind the scenes the Government decided that it was impractical to accept the Bill and voted it down on Second Stage having wasted 12 hours of debating time in this House. The Government, in order to cover its political back, so to speak, decided to refer the matter to a committee. In view of the circumstances the committee has done the best it could.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response to a variety of the recommendations made in this report when the committee concluded its business. One stark fact has emerged clearly from the report. In subsection 8, on page 4 of the report, the committee concludes:</P>
      <P>We have been struck by the fragmented situation regarding responsibility for maintenance and control of the Shannon. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that we can do no more than recommend that Government nominate an agency for the immediate task. We will return to this issue of fragmented responsibility and any legislative implications in our final report.</P>
      <P>Fundamental to the concept of a Shannon river council, which is central to the Shannon River Council Bill and a matter we attempted to address in that Bill, was the issue of fragmentation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>By proposing a council we sought to introduce a body that would unify and take overall control of the fragmented elements. This report &ndash; I appreciate it is an interim one &ndash; does not address that fundamental issue. It makes <Col N="1250" /> a number of recommendations and addresses a number of substantial issues.</P>
      <P>Page 43 of the report outlines very specific recommendations. It recommends that budgetary provision be made by the Minister for Finance. The Minister of State did not satisfactorily respond to that recommendation in his response; he did not deal with it at all. He addressed it in a negative manner, saying:</P>
      <P>The updated cost of such a scheme would most likely make it economically unacceptable given the changes in agriculture and agricultural land use and value over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>His response is most disappointing. I am sure the people who suffer very serious effects on an annual basis will find his response most unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The report also recognises that a number of local authorities along the Shannon river from counties Leitrim to Clare, Kerry and Limerick have submitted costings in relation to essential works that need to be done within their areas. The aggregate of those costings is £8,132,882. That is a conservative estimate. The report states the committee recommends that the Minister for Finance should make budgetary provision for this expenditure. Unfortunately, the Minister of State did not deal specifically with that recommendation in his speech, other than to say that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will announce the allocation of funding for non-national roads at the end of January 2001 and that this allocation will be made in the context of the existing ten year restoration programme.</P>
      <P>I would have liked the Minister of State to say that, in view of the specific recommendations in this report and the submissions made by the local authorities, this funding will be provided over and above any other allocations. I hope the Minister of State will find himself in a position to give that sort of clear and positive response to the recommendations in his reply.</P>
      <P>The report suggests that comprehensive information is not available on the extent of past flooding, which means the committee is not in a position to deem who should be compensated and the level of equitable compensation that should be provided to people who have recently been flooded and those who have been continually flooded since time immemorial.</P>
      <P>The report recommends that the Government nominate an appropriate body to obtain this information in co-operation with the relevant local authorities. I had hoped the Minister of State would have suggested which appropriate body the Government has in mind to perform the task of collecting and collating that information, but he did not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report contains a very specific recommendation in relation to the data on flooding which needs to be gathered. The committee sug<Col N="1251" /> gests this task should be specifically assigned to the local authorities in the Shannon catchment area. That should be done, but local authorities will need additional personnel to collate that information. I hope the Government will provide the local authorities with the necessary resources to undertake that task.</P>
    <P>A very important issue which arose during the committee's hearings and discussions was that of siltation, particularly the contribution of Bord na Móna to peat siltation along Lough Ree and Lough Derg. The report recommends that an agency should be established to undertake an immediate survey of the extent of the siltation problem along the River Shannon. It suggests Bord na Móna should bear some of the cost of that. It also recommends that the EPA should continue to survey the sedimentation ponds for siltation within the Bord na Móna properties, and that this should be done on a much more frequent and regular basis. I understand it is done only twice a year and that Bord na Móna has quite a lot of control over that. The committee specifically recommended that there should be far more regular examination and surveying of this by the EPA.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not address the report's very specific recommendations or show an openness to put in place the framework to carry out the recommendations. I know he had to come to the House at short notice and that he might not have had time to examine this report, which was recently published. However, the recommendations in it are fairly basic and are not very dramatic or unexpected. I hope he will respond positively to them.</P>
    <P>The very fundamental issue of fragmentation has also not been addressed. We look forward to the final report of the committee which will provide details of its recommendations in regard to fragmentation. I have no doubt they will include bringing legislation before this House to put in place a framework to deal specifically with that issue.</P>
    <P>I compliment the committee's members, who heard quite a number of bodies with an interest in the Shannon which they questioned in fine detail. They have chronicled in detail, as the Minister of State has today, what has occurred in relation to the River Shannon since almost the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>However, the bottom line is that quite a number of people continue to suffer their properties being flooded. Certain people have had their properties flooded for years, but they have been joined by many more people in recent years. Senator Connor, who comes from Roscommon, knows the full extent of that and how it has impacted on constituents of his. The river goes as far as Clare and the tributaries of the River Fergus. Lands around Ennis, Corofin and Dysart <Col N="1252" /> have been flooded as a result of difficulties on the Shannon.</P>
    <P>This is an interim report and the Minister of State has a responsibility to make a positive response to it. Stating what we already know about what is happening in Government is not adequate. I would have expected the Minister of State to come forward with specific and positive responses to the concrete recommendations in the report. There are a number of observations and conclusions in the report, but only five recommendations.</P>
    <P>The five recommendations relate to budgetary provision, nominating an appropriate body to gather data on previous flooding, the allocation of that task to the local authorities, appointing an agency to survey siltation and more frequent and assiduous monitoring by the EPA of sedimentation around Bord na Móna plants. I invite the Minister of State to give specific responses to these recommendations in his reply. The people who are being damaged, harmed and inconvenienced by this and who are suffering great hardship every year are looking for a specific response.</P>
    <P>The Government chose in this House last April to dismiss the Bill which had been proposed and covered its back by referring the matter to a committee. That committee has now reported and made specific recommendations. If the Government were serious about this &ndash; although, unfortunately, I do not believe it is &ndash; it would respond positively to the very straightforward recommendations in the report. I am disappointed that has not happened. I hope that when the committee publishes its final report it will recommend the enactment of legislation to deal with the issue of fragmentation.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, many farmers and other people will suffer much hardship, which is unacceptable. The Government stands accused of a failure to react positively to these people. It is unfortunate that I have to put that on record, but I hope to be able to respond more positively to the Minister of State's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, who has come to the House at very short notice. As a member of the sub-committee which dealt with this matter, I am fairly familiar with what has occurred over the past months. In a very short period, the sub-committee met with many individuals and groups, both statutory and private, with interests along the Shannon. We went to the Shannon region where flooding has been very apparent, over the past couple of years in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than looking back and criticising the fact that legislation did not get through this or the other House, we should collectively look forward. If we are sympathetic towards and feel pity for the people involved in the flooded regions we <Col N="1253" /> should look forward collectively and make a serious and genuine attempt to address these problems in the hope that the Government will produce the necessary funding.</P>
    <P>Fragmentation is the most fundamental issue. It was never the intention of the sub-committee to deal with it in this interim report. We had a twofold mission: first, to introduce an interim report as speedily as possible with the resources available to us, limited though they may have been in some instances, and we have succeeded in doing that; second, to examine the overall picture with a view to putting a framework, statutory body or other such facility in place to take total responsibility for the various different interests and groups along the river. The Minister of State has taken a positive approach to most of the conclusions and recommendations in the interim report, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>In the course of our deliberations we met with many groups and took into account the many previous reports and submissions that were made to our committee and to previous ones. We examined the final report on the River Shannon flood problem by Mr. Rydell, which has been referred to by the Minister of State. We also considered the IFA report on technical aspects of the Shannon flooding problem, prepared by Delap &amp; Waller, the report of the Office of Public Works in April 1998 on an investigation of flooding problems, especially in the County Galway area, and submissions to meetings of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport by Dúchas, the Heritage Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the ESB and the Office of Public Works. More recently in the course of our deliberations, both at the site of the problem in the River Shannon area and in committee, we met with many other groups, including the Heritage Council, Roscommon County Council, An Taisce, Birdwatch Ireland, Bord na Móna and, on numerous occasions, the IFA, both here and in the Shannon region. From our meetings we concluded that while everybody had limited responsibility, nobody either had or wished to have overall responsibility for the River Shannon. That is the kernel of this problem.</P>
    <P>The Shannon is a majestic river. It is the longest and largest in the British Isles and, at a time when we are trying to increase tourism numbers, it has huge tourism potential. By concentrating our minds to address this issue we can attract more tourists to the River Shannon region, where there are many opportunities for them to enjoy their holidays in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The provision of access, especially to property and to basic needs, is essential when dealing with the consequences of flooding. We tried to encourage the local authorities in the counties in question to provide funding for access to all the areas in question. A further difficulty arose in trying <Col N="1254" /> to identify the number of farms and families that would be isolated at any one time. Various vested interest groups submitted figures to us. The cost of paying compensation or removing people from their farms on a once-off basis could not be considered until we have statistics on the numbers involved and how often their properties are flooded.</P>
    <P>We arrived at a figure of between £8.1 and £8.2 million, which is modest by today's standards, to ensure that access can be provided in the following counties that have acknowledged they have a problem, taken time to examine the situation and put a figure on the amount they required: Athlone UDC &ndash; £780,000; Clare County Council &ndash; £636,000; Galway County Council &ndash; £172,000; Leitrim County Council &ndash; £1.9 million; Longford County Council &ndash; £1.5 million; Offaly County Council &ndash; £290,000; Roscommon County Council &ndash; £2.5 million; Tipperary North Riding &ndash; £190,000; and Westmeath County Council &ndash; £193, 000. I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn that the figure is modest and will probably have to increase. On three occasions we asked the local authorities in question to ensure that as well as raising the roads to give access to the places concerned, other ancillary works would be taken into account. We have been assured this will happen, but it means that in most cases if and when this work is tackled there will be a slight upward adjustment of the money involved.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn that the conclusions and recommendations of the sub-committee are basic in many ways. They are couched in layman's language to ensure they will be addressed. Given the resources at our disposal and the short period of time, we have produced a high quality report. It has less than 50 pages, but it spells out clearly and precisely what we were asked to do, how we approached our task and how we prepared the report and placed it before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This report will give much greater solace to the people directly affected by flooding than any legislation passed by this House, including legislation passed with cross party support. The Government was wise to ask the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport to examine this matter in detail. Our mission was twofold: first, to examine how flooding along the River Shannon and flood relief could be addressed, and, second, to consider the fragmentation of responsibility. We look forward to the submission of a full report to the House some time next year. In my short time as a Member of this House this very important issue has been raised on many occasions. I hope those Members who have done so will contribute to this debate.</P>
    <P>According to the report, flooding along the River Shannon occurs ever winter and, on average, in one of every two summers. It is primarily due to natural causes, the extremely flat basin of <Col N="1255" /> the River Shannon, its inadequate depths and widths in critical areas, apparent increases in rainfall amounts and the possible effects of siltation of the river's channels. All this results in great hardship and considerable financial loss to those affected. When we visited the families involved we saw the tremendous hardship they must endure at times of flooding, including financial loss.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn criticised some of the Minister of State's responses to the report's recommendations. I welcome them, especially with regard to sections 7.7 and 7.8 where the Minister of State indicated his intention to reconvene the inter-departmental committee established originally in 1996 to review the effects of bad weather. Apart from reviewing the recent flooding, he will ask the committee to look at flood risk mapping. He indicated that this course of action is essential and that the information will be invaluable, especially for local authorities in dealing with planning applications and their development plans. I agree with that, because whatever about trying to remove people from impossible situations, we should not place them there. If we can map the flood risk areas nobody will be foolish enough to suggest that people be granted planning permission to build there. When the mapping is complete we can perhaps look at lands that are continually under water with a view to making once-off compensation payments.</P>
    <P>Given the short time available for the completion of his report, Mr. Rydell did not conduct site investigations, carry out detailed surveys or collect extensive field data. His proposals were of a preliminary nature, especially with regard to his estimated cost of £15 million. He recommended that further site research was necessary before the summer relief scheme could be advanced. If this scheme were to be implemented now, this detailed stage of surveys and investigations would be essential, particularly in light of the lengthy intervening period, the changed circumstances within the catchment and the current climate of critical environmental appraisal of such major drainage schemes. An essential element of the summer relief scheme investigations would be an assessment of its updated estimate of cost and the availability of funding for the proposal.</P>
    <P>All the preparatory work and investigations would be likely to extend over a number of years before being completed. Such a protracted period of time before initiation of any flood relief scheme would be unlikely to be acceptable to the population of those flooded areas who suffer regular hardship, inconvenience and financial loss. An earlier solution to their difficulties would result in the raising of regularly flooded roads above flood level, possible resiting of flooded farms and payment of compensation to property owners on a once-off basis for financial loss, provided it is possible to determine the number of farms continually under water.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> It has been confirmed by local authorities, which have prepared estimates of cost, that the elevation of roads would cost £8.1 million. The committee strongly recommends that the Minister for Finance should make budgetary provision for this expenditure. I do not mind which Minister makes such provision. I am sure it is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and I hope he is sympathetic to the cause. When announcing further allocations for multi-annual road plans, I hope he takes cognisance of the fact that this finance is badly needed to provide access to people's property in times of flooding.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive information is not available on the extent of past flooding, particularly its geographical limits, numbers of houses, buildings and farm holdings affected and details of roads submerged, together with information on depth and duration of submersion. This information would be essential in the determination of any equitable scales of monetary compensation to property owners. The committee recommends that the Government should nominate an appropriate body to obtain this information in co-operation with the relevant local authorities. The Government should then determine criteria for a once-off compensation scheme based on data obtained after consultation with the insurance industry. An independent body should administer the scheme. It is important to involve local authorities because they know where flooding occurs in their areas on an annual basis and the duration of such flooding.</P>
    <P>If it is known that land is prone to flooding or susceptible to extreme weather conditions, the planning authorities must take cognisance of that when making development plans. It is important that more people are not put in the same situation. Although people would like to build houses along the River Shannon or the Shannon basin, we must ensure that people's properties are not prone to flooding when considering planning applications.</P>
    <P>Claims that appreciable siltation has occurred over stretches of the river and that repair work is required on some hydraulic controls should be examined and appropriate corrective action taken, if warranted. As regards siltation, the Government should appoint one agency to undertake an immediate survey of the extent of the problem and take early action. Bord na Móna should be invited to assist with this work. The report also recommends that more frequent and assiduous monitoring of the operation of the sedimentation ponds should be undertaken, using currently acceptable best practice procedures, to ensure that the siltation problem on the Shannon is controlled.</P>
    <P>Discussions should be initiated with the ESB to maximise storage on Lough Allen and Lough Ree with a view to providing a greater buffer against autumn and winter flooding. There appeared to be constant contradictions in deliberations, particularly with the IFA and the ESB. Many <Col N="1257" /> people living in that region were of the opinion that the ESB had a certain amount of flexibility in controlling flood waters and that it had not handled them properly at times. The ESB is obliged to maintain certain levels, which were agreed many years ago. Perhaps it is time to re-examine those levels to help alleviate the flooding.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommended that a dedicated annual budget, which should be augmented, if necessary, with a Supplementary Estimate, should be provided to ensure that regular and necessary maintenance work is carried out on an ongoing basis on the channel of the main stream, the tributaries of the river and on all associated hydraulic control structures and installations. It has been brought home to us on many occasions that lack of maintenance work is a contributory factor. Professional bodies may say it is not a major contributory factor but people who live along the river know it causes a considerable problem.</P>
    <P>It is a crying shame to see parts of such a majestic river closing in. One does not need to be a rocket scientist to realise that if more room is made in the river by removing siltation or small obstacles along the channel, it will help to alleviate flooding. This would not require legislation or large-scale funding. An annual budgetary sum will be required to provide necessary maintenance on the River Shannon. This will benefit the people living along the river by alleviating flooding and it will help tourism. When Bord Fáilte made a submission to the committee it stated there was a potential to increase the tourism figures for the River Shannon if we had overall responsibility.</P>
    <P>I hope the House adopts the report. We should encourage the Government in whatever way we can to ensure the recommendations which can be implemented immediately are done so and that the others will be implemented at the earliest possible date. I look forward to working on the sub-committee with my colleagues from the other House to ensure that we publish a substantial report some time in 2001.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I live in a part of the country where agriculture, etc., are affected by the behaviour of the River Shannon. Some months ago we had a debate on the Shannon River Council Bill. I call again for the reintroduction of that Bill in this House. I congratulate the people who drew up this comprehensive interim report which outlines the behaviour and history of flooding on the River Shannon. It broadly recommends that an inter-agency body should be established to control the river and to ensure that all interests are represented, whether in navigation, power generation, agriculture or tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the conclusions of the Rydell report of 1955 was that an inter-agency body should be set up. The Office of Public Works and the ESB conducted another survey which commenced in 1957 <Col N="1258" /> and was completed and published in 1961. One of its conclusions was that an inter-agency committee should be established to represent all the people with an interest in the River Shannon. The Delap &amp; Waller report which was commissioned privately by the Irish Farmers' Association and was published in 1988 came to the same conclusion. Those three major reports reached the same conclusion on the problems of flooding on the River Shannon over a period of 40 years or more.</P>
    <P>All these reports recognised the difficulties of draining the River Shannon because of the poor gradient. It has one of the worst gradients of any major river in the world and that gives rise to problems. That issue is dealt with in the interim report. There was a common recommendation that there should be a summer relief scheme on the river in areas where the channel of the river is deficient and could be deepened, which would help greatly. There are indications as to the degree by which water levels could be reduced by summer relief schemes, such as channel improvement and making the channel more efficient in areas where that may be done reasonably economically. This was recommended in the reports of 1955 and 1961 and also in the Delap &amp; Waller report. It is also reflected in this interim report, yet steps have never been taken in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is an great amount of local flooding in the River Shannon basin which is related to a deficient channel in the main stem and in the main tributaries. I have seen the benefits of an arterial drainage scheme in the case of the River Boyle scheme. The River Boyle is a major tributary of the Shannon flowing into the upper Shannon and eventually into Lough Ree. There were great local improvements as a result of this scheme. However, it may be approaching the problem at the wrong end. That particular catchment lets its flood water into the River Shannon at a much more rapid rate than used to be the case, which can cause greater flooding in the major stem or down stream.</P>
    <P>I have lived by a tributary of the River Shannon for a long time and have seen this happen. I live alongside the Boyle river and its catchment area or within its basin. While the scheme was very welcome and brought many improvements to agricultural land in that it lowered the water level in areas that had been bedeviled by local flooding, nevertheless, there is the great difficulty that it has all discharged into the main system which is inadequate to deal with it.</P>
    <P>All great rivers in the world &ndash; the Shannon is one of the bigger rivers in Europe &ndash; have interventions. The Danube is one of the greatest rivers in Europe and most countries through which the river flows take certain measures to build embankments, do dredging work and so on. These countries work in co-operation with each other. The war in the former Yugoslavia has given rise to great difficulties in the operation of the Danube forum, nevertheless, this national and international body controls this great river. <Col N="1259" /> The same is true of the River Rhine in how it affects Germany and some of the Benelux countries. These countries co-operate at an international level and there is also national intervention.</P>
    <P>The Missouri-Mississippi system in the United States of America has had its channel developed over 200 years. A great flood in the River Mississippi system a few years ago washed away many of the embankments and other interventions put in place to control the flood plain of the river.</P>
    <P>The River Shannon has a huge flood plain and very little has been done to control it. Most farmers who live on it have always been subject to flooding and there has been very little intervention to control the flood plain.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that the evidence, which is both anecdotal and scientifically arrived at, clearly shows that there is an increased level of flooding on the Shannon. In the past perhaps there was a very bad flood every ten years. Now there is very bad flooding every second year. At this stage of the winter levels are critically high on the Shannon, to which high rainfall is a major contributory factor. If there is high rainfall in December and January there may be another major Shannon flood.</P>
    <P>There was a huge Shannon flood last year which led to a great deal of local anger and angst. Senator Moylan and I were at a meeting in Athlone which was attended by in excess of 1,000 people. The problem was that everyone mistrusted each other. Everyone who had a role to play in the Shannon did not seem to know what the others were doing &ndash; I refer to the statutory bodies such as the Office of Public Works, the ESB, Dúchas and so on. They never seemed to consult with each other in relation to intervention on the river. The ESB which generates electricity from the River Shannon makes a major intervention in the way it operates locks. The Office of Public Works has control over certain locks, yet it does not seem to consult with the ESB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no responsibility for locks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State now wishes to pass on the responsibility to Waterways Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is a statement of fact. I agree with what the Senator is saying but the Office of Public Works is not one of the bodies involved in the Shannon. That may well be part of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that it is not only the ESB which operates locks on the River Shannon. There is also a perception that the operation of the locks is not satisfactory. Floods may take place in September which do not follow heavy rainfall. The flood plain of the river spreads because of the operation of the locks. That hap<Col N="1260" /> pens in the southern part of County Roscommon which is within the basin of the river where the gradient is at its most inefficient. However, people have great difficulty comprehending huge economic losses as a result of the spread of the river outside the winter months. This relates to the operation of the locks on the river.</P>
      <P>The official bodies who have statutory functions in the area never explain satisfactorily why this is happening and that is not fair. This is why it was recommended and supported on all sides of the House &ndash; it was a Government decision to stymie the proposal &ndash; that we should have a statutory Shannon river council on which all those with financial and economic interests could be involved. If one does not get all of one's way, at least one is part of the decision-making in relation to the most efficient use of the river.</P>
      <P>If one suffers financial loss as a result of the interventions on a river, whether for navigational or electricity generating purposes, or if a farmer's home is flooded, there should be a statutory right to compensation. In the past there was compensation for flooding. However, no compensation was paid last year, even though there were huge fodder losses, damage to land and so on. The same thing happened a few years earlier. Compensation was granted in 1996 but there was no compensation in 1999-2000. People see this as grossly unfair, given that when some people are in office they accept that people are entitled to compensation for hardship and loss, and last year was a good example of this at a time when the country can afford it. Compensation packages were put in place for people who suffered as a result of flooding in times when the country could less well afford it.</P>
      <P>We must accept that there will be further flooding. I hope this debate and the final report which will be published soon will give rise to legislation to establish a statutory right to compensation for those adversely affected financially or economically as a result of major flooding and man-made interventions for economic reasons. I look forward to this outcome. However, one must look at these issues with little confidence.</P>
      <P>I grew up listening to political debates about draining the River Shannon. This issue has been a major political football in my county, in that of Senator Moylan and in all counties adjacent to the River Shannon for many years. Some people are much more guilty than others in terms of broken promises, etc. on this matter, which has proven to be a major influence on many people's political psyches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After 60 or 70 years of promises, there has been little or no intervention. The intervention which has taken place has had a deleterious effect on the people who live beside the river. More people are suffering damage and loss from flooding on the River Shannon than at any previous time. The greatest recorded flood on the Shannon took place in 1915 and there was another serious flood in 1925. Both of these floods occurred prior <Col N="1261" /> to the implementation of the Ardnacrusha scheme.</P>
    <P>In so far as records show, floods on the Shannon were far less frequent in the past than they are at present. It is clear that climate change is a factor. There is speculation that we are undergoing the part of our climate cycle during which there are periods of dry and wet weather. However, if one considers the situation which has obtained during the past 20 years, it is obvious that we are experiencing an ever-increasing level of flooding, as a result of which huge tracts of land and many houses are being inundated on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The problem with regard to flooding is the patchy response to it. After a flood some people will be compensated while after another, which may be worse than its predecessor, they will receive no compensation. There are no guarantees on whether people will receive compensation, regardless of the degree of damage caused to their property or the hardship they have endured. That is simply not fair. Decisions on compensation depend on the prevailing political climate and the level of pressure which can be exerted on the Government of the day. I want to see an end to this and I ask the Minister of State to give serious consideration to bringing that about.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to Bord na Móna and the problem of siltation in the River Shannon. There should be a summer relief scheme for the river. This has been recommended by three major reports carried out over a period of 40 years. However, not a shovelful of silt has been removed from the river. Samples taken from the Shannon show that the silt is, by and large, of a peaty nature. This is clearly a result of the operations of Bord na Móna. I accept that these operations have been beneficial to the midlands in terms of employment and economic growth, but they have given rise to certain consequences for which the company, in conjunction with the Government, must bear responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I thank him for the work he has done in this area. The interim report on flooding on the Shannon river is an important document and I wish to express my thanks to those involved in its production. I refer particularly to Deputy Doherty, chairman of the sub-committee, and Senator John Cregan who have done a great deal of work on this report. I live near the Shannon and I am aware of the amount of work done by Deputy <Col N="1262" /> Doherty and Senator Cregan during the summer. When others might have been off enjoying themselves, they met representatives from many groups which have been affected by flooding on the Shannon for many years.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor outlined the history of this matter and stated the draining of the Shannon was an issue in every election campaign. I visited a former member of Offaly County Council, a Mr. Kerin, when he was seriously ill in hospital, who stood for election on behalf of the Leas-Cathaoirleach's party on a number of occasions and who fought for many years to have the Shannon drained. Two weeks previously a number of houses in our area had been flooded and I had raised the matter at a meeting of the local authority. Mr. Kerin said that he had raised the same issue in the late 1940s and he stated that the only way the Shannon would be drained was if the water turned to whiskey. That was an apt and sincere statement on the part of a man who had fought for many years to have the Shannon drained but who had failed in his endeavours.</P>
      <P>Many sections of the report highlight the numbers of farmers who have been severely affected by flooding on the Shannon. Those people are hoping that a structure will be put in place under which responsibility will be given to a group or organisation to take action about this matter. The Shannon will never be drained, but some of the problems that exist can be alleviated. I live near the Shannon and I am aware of the problems people face. I have met farmers who lost substantial amounts of fodder as a result of flash floods in the summer, farmers whose land is flooded for long periods and farmers who have been forced to sell livestock as a result of flooding at a time when it was not advantageous to do so because they lacked the necessary feed or had no land on which to place their stock. Action must be taken to address these problems. Many of the farmers to whom I refer live in areas where the problem of flooding is accepted. However, they want to continue to have access to their holdings and dwellings.</P>
      <P>The report highlights the costs incurred by local authorities in raising and resurfacing roads. The state of the roads in my area is a major problem, but at national level it is not viewed in that way. In my opinion the costs outlined in the report in respect of raising these roads are quite small. The roads leading to these farmers' villages or houses may only be one or two miles long and only 100 metres or 200 metres of the roadway may need to be raised and resurfaced in order to allow the farmers access to their properties. It is sad to see farmers having to go across country on tractors to take children to school, do shopping or go to Mass or church services on Sunday because roads are flooded. This problem has been highlighted by the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have costed the solution to the problem at £8 million. It can be addressed within a short number of years if the necessary finance is made available. I hope the Depart<Col N="1263" /> ments of Finance and the Environment and Local Government will provide the finance so that local authorities can ensure farmers at least have access to their property.</P>
    <P>Many people who live along the Shannon will say it used to take two or three days rain before the level of the river would begin to rise. However, increased drainage into the river upstream and the removal of hedgerows and banks to enlarge fields mean that flooding affects streams and rivers more quickly, the problem of flooding is felt sooner and we do not have time to deal with it. We often blame those who control the water levels on the Shannon but when flooding occurs suddenly there is very little they can do about it. Local authorities must ensure that drainage and the enlargement of fields by the removal of hedgerows and banks is controlled. Planning permission should be required for such works. Those who live on the banks of the Shannon know this is a major problem.</P>
    <P>In 1955, the Rydell report estimated the cost of flood relief at £15 million. Nothing has been done in the meantime but, because of drainage upstream and silting in the river, the channel has been reduced substantially. Some blame Bord na Móna for the increased siltation of the river. Undoubtedly it is partially responsible but it is not wholly to blame. The company has attempted, through the use of silt ponds, to reduce silting. In the midlands we recognise the contribution of the board to midland counties and we are prepared to accept a small amount of silting in the Shannon as the price for that contribution. Nevertheless, something must be done about the problem, which is particularly severe between Athlone and Meelick. Flooding is particularly severe in Roscommon, Offaly, Westmeath and east Galway.</P>
    <P>The problem could be alleviated by the reduction of the water levels in the lakes. Water levels in the Shannon lakes are rarely reduced until it is too late and the Meelick weirs are unable to cope with the level of flooding. The problem has been examined on many occasions. The falls from Banagher to Meelick and from Athlone to Banagher have been looked at. This stretch of river cannot take the level of water which comes downstream and it is forced out on to the callows. People who live in the area believe that officials in some Departments are more interested in flooding the callows than providing a living for the farmers on the river bank. Certain vested interests are prepared to accept the flooding of the Shannon callows so long as the corncrake and wild life habitats are protected. Because the Shannon basin is one of the most important wildlife habitats in Europe, land is being flooded unnecessarily and farmers are suffering.</P>
    <P>Boating interests require the river level to be maintained at too high a level. The level at which the River Shannon is kept between October and March is unnecessarily high. The water level <Col N="1264" /> could be much lower at that time of year when there is very little pleasure boat activity on the river. If this were done, the river and lakes would be better able to cope with winter floods.</P>
    <P>Waterways Ireland is responsible for bridges over the river. Because of persistent flooding it may be necessary to spend large amounts of money on many Shannon bridges in the not too distant future. The bases and abutments of many old arched stone bridges are showing signs of wear and their repair may entail substantial costs.</P>
    <P>I hope this report will be acted upon and will not gather dust in the Department alongside many previous reports. One authority which would have complete control of what happens on the River Shannon is what is required. There are many vested interests in terms of fishing, boating, etc.  </P>
    <P>There was a huge furore recently about a few days flooding in the east. Much noise was made about it and compensation was sought. That is fine, but my concern is for the people who suffer from the effects of flooding year after year. They continually suffer because of flooding and we must ensure that some form of compensation is given to them. One of the ways this could be done is to consider the areas most affected. The report mentions the affected areas. Local authorities know where they are because they are well mapped. We must ensure the people affected by flooding are compensated.</P>
    <P>I compliment those who drew up the report. I have spoken to many organisations who met them and found them most courteous. The people affected by flooding for many years are looking forward not only to the publication of the report but to some action being taken on it in the near future. As they said, if they could access their houses, it would be a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>This matter has been raised on the Order of Business every few weeks over the past number of years. Members have bemoaned the fact that flooding continues unabated on lands in the west, the midlands and parts of Munster. The problem affects the four provinces of Connacht, Ulster, Leinster and Munster, but it is not new. As the report states, it existed in the 1840s and throughout the 19th century. There were reports in 1863, 1887 and 1938 before the famous Rydell report in 1956. However, despite all these reports, no action has been taken to reduce the incidence of flooding on the River Shannon. Those of us with long memories remember what it was like between the 1930s and the 1960s. During every general election campaign, there was talk in the west about draining the River Shannon.</P>

      <P>It was one of the great unfulfilled promises during her time. Now that matters have progressed in different directions and the economy is more stable, there is probably less of a tendency to use it as a means to rally the troops. However, the need is even greater now. Every year we hear about flooding and there are calls for compensation for the loss of thousands of acres of agricultural land and animals that were stranded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side of the coin, effluent, slurry and other agricultural waste have found their way into the River Shannon. In addition, problems have been created by effluent from peat production for ESB stations and through energy pro<Col N="1266" /> duction by the midlands station. These difficulties have given rise to a greater need to drain the River Shannon and also to ensure that its water is clean. The river has become a major tourism attraction. It is the greatest inland waterway on the island and, therefore, it is important to ensure that it is attractive from its source to its mouth.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that 20% of the island has been affected in terms of tributaries in the River Shannon basin. This huge area comprises 6,400 square miles. The threat of global warming has been added to the issues of continuing flooding, the increase in effluent and the need to be extra vigilant of resources in terms of tourism in addition to greater environmental awareness as a result of European Union directives. We can expect flooding to take on greater intensity in terms of the quantity of water that will be released into areas surrounding the River Shannon and the number of occasions on which flooding will occur.</P>
    <P>This debate is timely because it gives Members an opportunity to consider the measures that could be taken that are outlined in the joint committee's interim report. The committee relied heavily on the Rydell report. Given its substantial nature, it is difficult to improve on the recommendations contained in that 1956 report. It considered all the tributaries and lakes involved, the river as a whole and the surrounding lands. It made a series of recommendations and I was impressed by their extensive nature.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is any advantage in carrying out another report in 2000 or 2001 although it is almost 50 years since the Rydell report was published. Action rather than a further report is needed now. Reports were prepared in this and the last century and it is now time for action. There have been calls for a statutory authority for the River Shannon. There is the National Roads Authority and there is a need for an authority to deal with our telecommunications infrastructure. The Leader is aware of how often that matter has been raised in terms of having an infrastructure Bill passed by the House. Otherwise things will be done randomly and a proper network and streamlined process will not be established.</P>
    <P>It seems something along the lines of a Shannon river authority needs to be put in place. We need to co-ordinate the activities of the local authorities and national Government. Perhaps a single, dedicated body is the way to go about it. Others may have a different view on the matter, but that is probably the most effective way to go about it. There has to be a commitment to put considerable financial resources into dealing with it. Unless it is done this time, we will find it very difficult to deal with flooding when it becomes more regular and intensive in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I wanted to add my voice as somebody who has heard about flooding from the River Shannon all my life and has not yet seen any action to deal with it. Now that we have the interim report, let us come up with a firm recommendation and put <Col N="1267" /> together one effective means to do so. Rather than leave it lie while people become frustrated and make calls, claims, counterclaims and allegations of inactivity, let the Government make a firm commitment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has not been slow to make commitments in relation to funding for the future. We have just discussed the pensions Bill which provides that money will be put in trust for 25 years and will come on stream between 2025 and 2055 to ensure there is a proper nest egg. That is admirable planning for the future. We need to plan for the future in relation to the River Shannon. It is a part of our heritage which we should treasure enormously. It behoves us to spend some money now to ensure the River Shannon remains a clean river which does not interfere with the livelihood of people who live on its banks.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to speak today on a matter which has been brought to my attention many times on the Order of Business. I recall the efforts Fianna Fáil made in Opposition. I refer to the efforts made in the last Seanad by the then Members, Deputy Daly and Deputy O'Kennedy. I am pleased to see the report before us for our consideration and deliberation.</P>
      <P>I know the importance of the Shannon at first hand. As we all know, the River Shannon directly touches ten counties &ndash; counties Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Tipperary north and south, Galway, Limerick, Clare and Longford &ndash; and 12 local authorities. It causes a lot of problems at certain times of the year while at other times it is a great national resource. It has to be treated seriously, we have to address the problems and funding has to be made available. The country is awash with money in the Celtic tiger economy.</P>

      <P>There has never been a more appropriate time to allocate funds under the new body proposed by the Doherty commission and to put a proper plan in place so funds can be spent wisely and the work can be completed. Governments in the past, including Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, have not addressed the problem because of a lack of available funds. I am not criticising or denigrating them &ndash; they did the best they could in very bad times. Emigration was rampant. I remember a time not too long ago, since I became a Member of this House, when VAT on certain products was 35%.</P>
      <P>Look at the great opportunity we have today because of sound planning. As I said on the Order of Business today, the national agreement, the national understanding and the new agreement reached yesterday will allow us, as Members of the Seanad, Members of Dáil Éireann and the Government to address the long-standing problem of the River Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> I listened attentively to Members of the House who are members of local authorities. The Cathaoirleach is from Roscommon and Senator Moylan is from Offaly. The only Senator on the sub-committee, young Senator John Cregan, made an excellent contribution on behalf of the Government side. They all gave us their opinions, based on their vast experience, on what should happen with this great national resource.</P>
    <P>We cannot underestimate the effects of flooding on the thousands of farming people along the Shannon and on the people living adjacent to the Shannon who are not involved in farming but whose houses were built where they should not have been built. I have been reliably told by local people living in the Roscommon, Offaly, Westmeath and Longford area of the Shannon that if £50 million was to be spent &ndash; £10 million per year &ndash; over the next five years, it would free up thousands of acres of land for hundreds of farmers. It would allow them to farm their land for at least ten months of the year.</P>
    <P>I handed the presentation from those people, which had been done by engineers of long standing with local authorities, to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, the last time we debated this topic. I would like the officials to make that presentation available to the committee and to consider the practical experience of ordinary engineering staff in those counties who consider they would be able to alleviate the flooding problem.</P>
    <P>From time to time we see the damage flooding can do. We have seen what it has done in the UK in recent months and in the town of Fermoy on two occasions in the past ten days. The Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, is from Cork city. He is a man of the people. Anyone who has been an elected Member of the Dáil or Seanad for as long as the Minister of State is a person who has served the electorate well, is honourable and is in tune with what is happening. No matter how good or dedicated a politician one is, one cannot do anything about an act of God such as the change in the climate and the increased flooding with which people must contend, whether they live along the Shannon or in the beautiful town of Fermoy.</P>
    <P>We have to address the problem. It is not for the want of money, which is available. Over the years our predecessors in the Dáil and Seanad would have liked to do something but they could do precious little because no funds were available. I remember in Westmeath in 1985 we were sent home after an estimates meeting having been told that two out of three lights in the county would have to be turned out because the country was near bankruptcy. Look at the wonderful improvement in the economy since. How wonderful it is to be a Member of Seanad Éireann today and to look forward to such a buoyant economy and budget which will be announced tomorrow in the other House.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that there is no Member on the Opposition benches.</P>

I accept the Chair's ruling but he will understand my disappointment.</P>
      <P>We are impressed by the Doherty report and grateful to the commission for bringing it before us. The members of the commission have shown their interest and concern that something be done. The implementation of the recommendations in this report will be of far greater significance to the people concerned in the 12 counties in question than any legislation passed by the House over the past number of years. The Government has taken the correct approach by asking the sub-committee to bring this report before this House for its consideration. I look forward to receiving the final report. I hope tomorrow's budget will contribute to having this problem addressed.</P>
      <P>I note that County Westmeath needs £200,000 to raise road levels. I hope that will be forthcoming from the Department of the Environment and Local Government so that people in the county can access their houses and holdings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank the Chair and the Leader of the House for affording me an opportunity to contribute on this very important matter. In my 11 years in the House I have spoken regularly on behalf of affected householders and landowners who live on the banks of the River Shannon and its tributaries, particularly the River Suck.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to be from the Shannon basin area to fully appreciate the hardship and difficulties experienced by the people who live there. It is not until a serious flood occurs that television cameras and national politicians avail of the opportunity to go and see the problems at first hand. However, these are not problems that are experienced just once; they are experienced day in and day out, sometimes up to four and five times a year for periods of up to five weeks.</P>
      <P>The people living in that area have been the forgotten people of this island over the many years since the foundation of the State. I am very pleased, therefore, that in recent times there has been greater focus on understanding the problems and a new determination by the Houses of the Oireachtas to deal with the plight of people who, through no fault of their own, live in an area that is subject to flooding on an annual basis, sometimes four times a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the interim report from the joint committee. The committee has done excellent work. It has re-established and reiterated much <Col N="1270" /> of the local knowledge that has existed for many years. In particular, it identifies what I have said on behalf of the people of that area for many years, that is, that the main channel of the River Shannon has been used as an outfall and a dumping ground for all areas of activity in the 250,000 acres of the Shannon basin, whether industry, farming, tourism or any other ancillary development of the local authority. All have used the main channel of the River Shannon as an outfall for their overflows and residues. Over the period of the existence of this State not a shovelful of residue has been removed from the main channel. How could it operate in any reasonable way when no maintenance has ever taken place? As I have said before, eventually the chickens came home to roost. The problem is now so serious that it is affecting areas and towns outside the Shannon basin. Flooding on the River Shannon is now a national issue, and I am very pleased about that. Now the attention and the necessary funding will be provided. I ask the Minister of State to bring back the message to the Government, to the relevant Ministers, that funding is needed.</P>
    <P>The first thing that is needed is a maintenance programme of drainage to be carried out on the main channel of the Shannon to remove the large deposits of silt and residue that have accumulated over the past 50 years so that that channel, which is one of the finest rivers in Europe, can flow and operate in the way God intended, taking into consideration the navigation restrictions necessary in the interests of tourism and of the production of electricity at Ardnacrusha. There is no longer an excuse for not carrying out normal maintenance on the main channel of the river. There are two pieces of legislation that cover that, the arterial drainage legislation of the 1940s and a recent amendment to that legislation in 1994 or 1995, that afford the opportunity of carrying out maintenance on the River Shannon by interested and involved parties. These would include the Office of Public Works, the local authorities adjacent to the area, the commercial bodies, such as the ESB and Bord na Móna, and any other interested groups that have an involvement there. If that were set down as the foundation and the basis for attention to the Shannon, we would be getting somewhere. There are many other aspects of the maintenance of the River Shannon, for example, the co-ordination of the activities of the numerous bodies that exist. I am glad that has also been identified in this major report.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, for his response in recent months to me and the people of County Roscommon, in allocating £400,000 to raise roads in areas adjacent to the Shannon, the Clonoun area, areas in mid-Roscommon and right up into Castlerea. For a sum of £450,000, £400,000 from the Department and over £50,000 from the council, we already see the <Col N="1271" /> benefits of raising the roads. One wonders why this work was not carried out before.</P>
    <P>I hope this is a further indication that while there will be flooding on the River Shannon, there are measures we can take that will allow the Shannon to flow in the way God intended by carrying out annual maintenance, but we can also take remedial action such as raising roads to allow people to come and go to their farms and homes by road so houses and stock are not marooned as has happened up to now. These are very practical measures that can be implemented at this time.</P>
    <P>I ask the committee to continue its work and to come forward with a final report. If necessary it should apportion responsibility, not blame, to individual groups, organisations and Departments, whether State or semi-State, for this channel. The channel should not be taken for granted nor should it be used just as an outfall for which nobody takes responsibility. It is not there to be taken for granted; it is not there to be used just as an outfall with no one taking responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry has a part to play, in co-operation with the local authority, regarding the main Shannon waterway. There has been a major increase in boating activities on the River Shannon. Very few of those hundreds of boats have a holding tank or use the pump out stations along the Shannon. This is one of the most important issues. I ask the Departments or the local authorities responsible for pump out stations immediately to enact legislation or introduce by-laws, if they do not already exist, insisting that every boat with a capacity for more than six people should have a holding tank and that these boats be taken to a pump out station provided by local authorities at appropriate locations along the Shannon.</P>
    <P>We need to do this in the interest of public safety and for people who want to use the Shannon for leisure pursuits such as swimming. We also need to do this to protect the quality of water and fish life in the Shannon. This responsibility should no longer be ignored by local authorities or the Government.</P>
    <P>I hope that the final report will call for these measures and that the necessary legislation will be enacted by these Houses and that we can work towards improving the water quality of the River Shannon. Above all I hope that the main issue in the report will be dealt with, that is, that the responsibility for flooding and the management of the Shannon will be clearly identified and that people will have a responsibility as a result of the final report.</P>
    <P>I hope this Government, or whatever Government is in office, will provide the necessary finance to carry out a maintenance programme on the River Shannon. I also hope that affected <Col N="1272" /> farmers and householders will no longer be marooned due to flooding and that the money needed by the local authorities will be provided to raise the roads to these houses and farms.</P>
    <P>Over the years much has been spoken and written about the flooding of the River Shannon. Some people viewed this problem as a joke and thought that it was a suitable subject for bar room gossip and corridor comment. That is no longer the case. This is now a serious issue. The Government has decided to tackle this problem and I compliment them on that.</P>
    <P>I ask the committee, particularly our representative on it, my colleague, Senator John Cregan, to see to it that the final report is brought to fruition and that responsibility is placed on the different Departments and agencies. I also hope that the finances necessary to implement their final recommendations will be provided by Government.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government who is present is aware of the response of the Minister for Education and Science to this matter and that it is positive. Please excuse me as I am a little breathless; I am possibly breathless at the hope of getting what I am looking for.</P>
      <P>I represent the Clondalkin area. What has happened in St. Mary's junior school is untenable. The area is listed as disadvantaged and this school is supposed to receive special attention. Instead it has not been provided with a psychological service for more than two years. The psychologist provided has been on sick leave for more than two years. I have no doubt that anyone on sick leave for that length of time is quite ill. In the interim period the school has raised money to employ a part-time psychologist.</P>
      <P>The shame of this is that a special class for children who have been assessed by a psychologist has been provided to help them achieve their educational and personal goals. Unfortunately, we have the ludicrous situation where this special class is empty because there is no psychologist to test the children. This school is getting special attention in name only. In reality what has happened in the school is a scandal and it is ludicrous. This is untenable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past while there has been a very great desire to acknowledge that some areas in Dublin and in rural areas need special attention. We are <Col N="1273" /> all aware of some of the social problems that emanate from areas of urban deprivation. To put it in a nutshell, something will have to be done, something will have to be seen to be done and something, I presume, will be done. My message is direct and I hope the answer will be as well.   </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter. I apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, who is involved in business in the other House.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Senator for raising this matter. It affords me the opportunity to outline to this House the progress that has been made to date with the establishment and development of the national educational psychological service and to clarify the situation regarding the psychological service to St. Mary's junior national school, Rowlagh, Clondalkin.</P>
      <P>There was a clear commitment in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to developing psychological services for children and young people. A planning group established to review provision in this area reported in mid-September 1998. The central recommendation in the report was the establishment of a NEPS agency under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science with a dedicated role in the development and provision of an educational psychological service and with a new organisational structure.</P>
      <P>Following a Government decision that approved the findings of the planning group, the NEPS agency came into being on 1 September 1999. On that date 43 Department psychologists, one of whom became acting director, began working in NEPS. The funding for the service is provided through the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The NEPS agency has been established initially on an administrative basis as a dedicated executive agency of the Department of Education and Science. It is envisaged that, sometime within the five year development period, a decision will be taken on the establishment of NEPS on a statutory basis under the powers conferred on the Minister for Education and Science by the Education Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>NEPS has delegated authority to develop and provide an educational psychological service to all students who need it in primary and post-primary schools and in certain other centres support by the Department. The target staffing level to be achieved by the end of 2004 is 200 psychologists. There is also provision for administrative and support staff. NEPS staff will be located throughout the country in ten regions corresponding to health board regions. A regional director will lead the NEPS team in each region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> At present, NEPS provides a psychological service to all schools, including all primary schools designated as disadvantaged in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Eventually, when NEPS is at full strength, its psychologists will be able to provide a full educational psychological service to all primary and post-primary schools. However, it will not be possible to expand this service to all schools at once. It is of equal importance that the development of the new agency will be made in an equitable and orderly manner and, at the same time, that school children should not be left without essential assessment services.</P>
    <P>The development of NEPS is overseen by a national policy advisory board and by a management committee. A draft detailed five year expansion plan, including proposals, region by region, for the allocation of additional psychologists and for the location of NEPS offices, was recently approved by the policy board and the Minister. One of the first issues raised by the national policy advisory board was the urgent need for some children to have psychological assessments carried out before NEPS reaches full capacity. On the advice of the board, NEPS is carrying out a pilot project aimed at developing a strategy for responding to requests for urgent psychological assessments. This project will be completed early in the new year, and it is hoped that its findings will help NEPS to meet urgent demands in an appropriate way.</P>
    <P>The management committee of NEPS consists of representatives of the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children and meets at approximately monthly intervals. The committee has established a working group, consisting of representatives of NEPS and the health boards. The working group is to examine procedures for making and responding to referrals and will make every effort to arrive at a joint strategy to ensure that schools in every area will have some access to psychological assessment services.</P>
    <P>In relation to St. Mary's national school, Rowlagh, I am happy to clarify that the following is the position. This school was one of those selected in 1990 to participate in the Department's pilot project for a psychological service to primary schools. This service was provided to the school between 1990 and 1998, when it had, unfortunately, to be reduced due to the fact that the psychologist assigned to the school took a career break. It was not possible to provide a substitute psychologist until the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission concluded the recruitment competition for NEPS. This process has taken longer than anticipated.</P>
    <P>However, the Civil Service Commission has now selected a panel of additional psychologists for appointment to the agency. Some 26 additional psychologists have already started work with NEPS. It is hoped that by early 2001 <Col N="1275" /> nearly 100 psychologists will be in posts. This is half the eventual target of 200 psychologists and should lead to a marked improvement in the level of service being offered by NEPS.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the expansion of NEPS should proceed in a phased and orderly way to allow time for newly appointed psychologists to have an adequate induction period before being assigned to their areas. As soon as the 26 psychologists that have taken up posts since the beginning of September have completed their induction training, the first priority will be to fill vacancies caused by resignations and career <Col N="1276" /> breaks, including the vacancy in the post servicing St. Mary's school, Rowlagh.</P>
    <P>In fact, I understand from the NEPS authorities that a replacement psychologist has now been assigned to the school. I also understand that NEPS has recently had discussions with the school principal and clarified to him that the new psychologist will be in a position to provide a service to the school in the very near future.</P>
