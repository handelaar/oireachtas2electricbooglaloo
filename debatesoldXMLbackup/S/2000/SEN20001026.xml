      <P>I have notice from Senator Glynn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that all the recommendations of the project team for completion of phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, Mullingar, proceed as agreed by the Midland Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the situation in Mohober national school, County Tipperary, which urgently needs the building of an extension, and to outline the progress of the application and confirm when the work will be undertaken.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Chambers of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the Government's position with regard to retaining the breast cancer screening services at Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator John Cregan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to grant an extension of time to personal assistants of people with physical and sensory disabilities, who are at present employed on community employment schemes.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Glynn's and Senator Hayes's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Chambers and Cregan may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1 and 2. No. 1 is the Insurance Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage, contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes. No. 2 which shall be taken at 2 p.m. is statements on the Middle East and contributions of all Senators shall not exceed 15 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. There was a time when Irish people were proud of Aer Lingus and took a great pride in the success of the airline, its high standards, its good industrial relations and the fact that Irish people could run such a complicated industry so well. Today Aer Lingus has become a byword for choas and ungovernability. It is an airline which is inflicting enormous damage upon itself and causing massive inconvenience to the increased number of persons who prefer to fly the national airline and who depend on it. It would be simplistic to blame &ndash; I will not do so &ndash; the Minister responsible but she has not done much to help. The problems are wider and deeper. I would welcome a fairly early debate, but not in the middle of the industrial dispute as that would not be helpful, when the Minister would come into the House to outline the Government's plans for the future of Aer Lingus and its proposals as to how a repetition of what is now happening will never happen again.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange with the Minister for a debate at a fairly early date on the rationalisation of agricultural education to address the serious issues facing agricultural colleges in a number of parts of the country, such as Multyfarnham, Rockwell College and other areas? On a purely technical matter, when will the natural light be restored to the Chamber and when will the blinds be lifted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader will recall that in the last session I raised the importance of getting the Minister into this House to deal with the future of transport, including Aer Lingus, and to outline her views in that whole area. I agree with Senator Manning that the debate should not take place while there are problems at the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise the issue of education disadvantage. The Government, the previous Minister for Education and Science and the current Minister for Education and Science gave certain commitments about Government policy in the area of education disadvantage. The Minister is about to announce additional new jobs in that area. If that announcement were made in the House it could be made clear that disadvantage is not just an urban phenomenon, rural disadvantage must also <Col N="355" /> be considered. It is important that the views of those around the country are brought to the Minister. A discussion on that area of education disadvantage and how it impacts on rural and urban areas is important in planning further policy. Under the Education Act the Minister is required to have an education disadvantage national policy committee, but that committee has not been established. I ask that the Minister move on that issue quickly.</P>
    <P>During the past couple of weeks there has been much discussion about the Minister's argument and row with the Turf Club. The Minister seems to have won that turf war and we all support him on it. It was inappropriate that an undemocratic body, which incidentally bans politicians from membership, should have such power as had the Turf Club.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to outline this issue. We had two successful debates in this area previously and we could deal with this again. How are the interests of the ordinary racegoer or punter represented? In the outline of the agreement which I have seen, there does not seem to be a representative of the punter or racegoer, whose taxes will be used correctly to fund the industry, on the new authority. It is important that this point is made and we should insist that all interests, including that of the racegoer, are represented on the new overarching authority. I call for a debate on the implementation of the next stage of policy in this area with the appropriate Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister for Finance will come into the House to discuss a subject dear to his heart. I asked the Leader yesterday when the proposed landlord and tenant legislation would be ready given the current crisis in rented accommodation with wholesale evictions being carried out. Does he have information on that?</P>
      <P>Almost every day since the House resumed I have called for a debate on Northern Ireland. Given the moves which have been made in the past 24 hours by the IRA in regard to arms dumps inspections and reopening talks with General de Chastelain and the meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council tomorrow, it would be appropriate to have a debate next week. Perhaps the Leader could arrange such a debate.</P>
      <P>An international conference on waste management is opening in Dublin Castle today. I read in the newspapers that Louth County Council is the latest local authority to reject a waste management plan. Waste management policy seems to be a shambles. It has been delegated to local authorities and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has not given leadership. Will the Leader invite him to the House so that he will be accountable and answerable for breaching EU directives? The deadline for the implementation of waste management plans has passed and very few are in place.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's comments on the racing industry. I am pleased a compromise has been reached between the Irish Horseracing Authority and the Turf Club, and the Minister is to be congratulated. The integrity of services is at stake and a degree of independence should be associated with those services. We also must applaud the fact that significant extra funding will be made available to the industry, which is necessary. Legislation has been published to permit the National Stud to carry on its good work and to increase its borrowing powers. When that legislation comes before the House, we will be able to analyse the racing industry in detail and the Minister will be present to listen to our views.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning that agriculture education should be debated. There is a major problem regarding the fall in numbers taking up farming and seeking agriculture education but valuable facilities are available which should be used. There is a great deal of expertise in the colleges which is also of value and it is a question of finding new ways of doing the jobs. It would be useful to examine the future of agriculture education in the near future.</P>

      <P>Before I call the next speaker on the Order of Business, I wish to make it clear to Senators that the latitude extended to them yesterday will not become the norm on the Order of Business, nor do I intend to allow the Order of Business to become a rehash of &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; or &ldquo;What It Says In The Papers&rdquo;. I ask Senators who have indicated that they wish to be called to confine themselves to matters relevant to the Order of Business and to put their question or request to the Leader as briefly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people have welcomed the agreement in the racing industry. However, a large number of elderly people cannot go racing and they are disappointed with the lack of coverage of big races by RTÉ. I call on RTÉ to relay more of these races because it is important that elderly people who have an interest can view these races.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on agricultural colleges. There is widespread concern about the future of agricultural colleges, particularly those at Rockwell and Gurteen in Tipperary. At a time&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, you can make that point when the debate takes place. I ask the Senator not to pre-empt the debate which has been requested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on men's rights. Many men are victimised, abused and battered. They have no recourse. Nobody, including the Garda, listens to them and it is time we had a debate because this is becoming a serious problem.</P>
      <P>I call for a debate on road traffic. I recently read a report where it was conceded that alcohol abuse, speeding, road conditions and weather conditions are not the major causes of accidents. Driver error is the major cause and I have been saying this for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of all the speed cameras and radar guns which torture and persecute people who drive at 45 miles per hour in a 40 miles per hour zone, there should be more&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but there will not be a debate before the weekend. It is a bank holiday weekend and motorists should be careful. I appeal to the Garda to put more motorbike patrols on the road&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the last point, I have consulted my medical adviser who is sitting next to me and she informs me that from a medical point of view drivers are more likely to be guilty of error when they are blind drunk.</P>
      <P>I refer to an issue which has not been raised on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; or in the newspapers. Will the Leader give us information on Government plans to introduce legislation on abortion because the Oireachtas has been chastised by the Judiciary for not doing so? There are widespread reports that the Taoiseach has concluded some arrangement with the Independent Members in the other House to have a referendum on this matter, pre-empting the report of the all-party committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Leader for the expeditious way in which both of you responded to a request I made on the Order of Business last week regarding the non-relocation of library facilities in the Oireachtas. I am pleased that the Library staff were moved back to their original premises on Tuesday and they have asked me to thank the Cathaoirleach and the Leader. They believe that without that intervention they would still be operating in the warren that is the basement of Kildare House. They believe that without the intervention they would still be operating in the warren that is the basement of Kildare House.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Leader's decision yesterday to provide time for a debate on the media in November, will he ensure that the relevant Minister puts forward a specific proposal rather than having statements? There have been innumerable debates on the responsibility of the media and the issue of a press council. I ask the Leader to ensure there is a specific proposal in the context of the debate.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to pre-empt the debate on the Middle East later, but I intended to ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs &ndash; I am not sure if he will be present for the debate today &ndash; the widespread concern about the anti-Semitic attacks that have been perpetrated on people across Europe. In the context of the Middle Eastern problem&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is not related to the Middle East. It is a specific request in the context of a debate on foreign policy to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to co-sponsor or consult with his European colleagues about sponsoring a motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader to request the Minister to co-sponsor or initiate a motion condemning anti-Semitic attacks on people who have nothing to do with what is going on in the Middle East. They have been attacked just because of their religion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I did not hear &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; or &ldquo;What It Says In The Papers&rdquo;. I assure the Cathaoirleach and the House that the Insurance Bill will have my undivided attention all morning, and I was up early.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> Regarding the Bill, will the Leader indicate when it is intended to take the Committee and Final Stages? What are the Government's intentions regarding the local government Bill? We have all received numerous queries over the past few months from local public representatives about this legislation. I ask the Leader to outline the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rarely beg the Cathaoirleach's indulgence. The last time I did so, the days were longer and the mornings were brighter so I hope he will bear with me. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the general laws of libel having regard to the current Fine Gael position that there is a need for reformation of the law. The House should debate the issue of libel and the need to appoint a media or press ombudsman. Such an appointment is much needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader gave a commitment yesterday that there would be an all day debate on 7 November on matters relating to the media. I am sure all these points in relation to libel can be made during that debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I was attending a sub-committee meeting yesterday and I missed the Order of Business. I am glad there will be such a debate because it is required.</P>
      <P>I travel most mornings from a remote part of rural Ireland and I ask the Leader to use his influence with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to ensure that the problem of many young people and the elderly not wearing arm bands on winter mornings or dark evenings is addressed. A pilot scheme in this area should be introduced involving old age pensioners and young people.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions at 8.30 a.m. I have encountered groups of young people waiting for buses in remote areas who are not wearing any form of reflective clothing. This issue should be addressed if it could save one life or avoid one serious accident. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should consider the matter and, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, introduce a pilot scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's and Senator Tom Hayes's call in relation to a debate on agricultural colleges. This debate should <Col N="360" /> include the issue of the funding of such colleges because the money available to them is totally inadequate.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the BMW region? Such a debate would be timely. I would like a progress report to ensure that each area is getting its fair share of the funds. This is most important.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Coghlan's call in relation to the Local Government Bill. Estimates meetings will take place in each local authority over the next six weeks and it is important, prior to the introduction of the Bill, that the Minister comes to the House to discuss the funding of local authorities. There will be financial obligations on local authorities in relation to waste management. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House for this urgent debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on smoking by young people and other drug abuse issues? Many parents are particularly concerned about the increase among young people of habitual smoking. While there are controls on the sale of cigarettes over the counter, vending machines are readily accessible. Despite the health warnings and the anti-smoking campaign, young people are still being targeted through the glamorisation of cigarettes. We owe it to young people to give them a fair start in life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate the point raised by Senator O'Toole in relation to a debate on educational disadvantage. Perhaps the debate could be broadened to include the White Paper on Adult Education. This is linked to educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>There was a call for a debate on men's rights. I would worry about such a debate given that there are only two or three women Senators present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to make that point in the context of any debate in the Chamber about men's rights. I am anxious to ensure the debate is widened to include Senators' rights, in all walks of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Burke's call for a debate on the BMW region. At a seminar recently in Ennis, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, outlined the commitment in the national development plan to the BMW region. It would be worthwhile to discuss those details because the seminar was most informative for the people who attended it. The Senator's request is worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> I also support Senator Costello's call to ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House to discuss the waste management plan. There is a need for a clear indication in relation to the direction that will be taken. Some county councils have accepted the principle of waste management but others have succumbed to the pressure of the &ldquo;not in my backyard&rdquo; syndrome. It has created a position where there is no definitive direction in terms of how our responsibilities will be managed in relation to waste. In the interests of Members' and others' responsibilities, such a debate with the Minister would be worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on asylum seekers and refugees. There have been many emotive debates in the past 12 or 14 months on this issue. We should have reached the stage where we can talk rationally about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been discussed rationally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>People have been in Ireland for months or years and we should now discuss the issue. In view of the recent UNHCR report which suggested that things were not as bad as might have been portrayed, we should have a debate to see where these people are going and how we, as a society, are dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning expressed his concern about Aer Lingus and called for a debate on the future of the company. There are major difficulties among the staff, particularly concerning pay and rewards for endeavour. I wish everyone well in the coming weeks in attempting to resolve the dispute. Aer Lingus is the national carrier and has flown the Irish flag with pride, honour and distinction for many years. The sooner all these difficulties in the company can be successfully resolved the better for passengers, the company and the country generally. I will certainly allow time for a debate, with the Minister present, to discuss the Government's plans for this important company.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Hayes and Burke called for a debate on the future of our agricultural training colleges, including Multyfarnham, which is in my own area, following the proposals by Teagasc, which are alarming to say the least. When the country is awash with money what plans have these organisations got for the future confidence of agriculture? It is a shame and it is regrettable. They have been extremely selective as regards the proposals they will discuss on 1 November. Are they proposing to leave the entire midlands region without an agricultural training college? No Government worth its salt could preside over such a decision and as far as I am concerned, it is a general election issue.</P>

      <P>Senators O'Toole and Ormonde called for a debate on educational disadvantage and I can have time left aside for this. As regards Senator Manning's other question, I understand that the lighting and other works next door will be completed within a month, as the Cathaoirleach has said.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and Dardis called for a debate on the Racing Board and horse racing in general. I understand that legislation will be before the House in the coming weeks to increase allocations to that body, and this would be an opportune time to discuss the future of racing.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello and Chambers called for a debate on Northern Ireland. As I told Senator Manning yesterday, I will allow time for such a debate.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello and Chambers also called on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to attend a debate in the House on waste management. Senator Costello was selective in mentioning Louth County Council's deferral of a decision on this matter last night. He did not state that Meath, Cavan and Monaghan County Councils have agreed to and passed the proposals before them. In the midland counties we have deferred the decision to obtain information on health reasons, but I understand that this will progress favourably in the coming months. Waste management is the single greatest challenge that will face all local authorities over the next ten years. Everybody must be cautious because the health of our population is vital. Everyone wants to do the right thing and local authorities are correct in seeking further health information on this matter. The attitude of councils would be favourable if the health issue could be clarified.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell called for a debate, and Senator Ormonde expressed her own views, on men's rights. I will pass their views on to the Minister. Senator Farrell called for a debate on road traffic and I will arrange time for that.</P>

    <P>I note Senator Mooney's contribution about the media and the all-day debate which will take place here on 7 November. Senators Coghlan and Burke inquired about the Local Government Bill which, I understand, will go to Government on the third week in November. With the budget coming before the Dáil in early December, I anticipate this Bill will be with us in mid-February. Opposition Senators can assure all their local authority colleagues that the Bill will receive the full support of the House and will be dealt with as speedily as possible. When the Bill is presented to us, I will be affording all the debating time <Col N="363" /> necessary for Senators to express their concerns. Many local authority members are anxious about the Bill. It is important that we get it right for the long-term future of local government. The Bill was published last May and my understanding is that all relevant sections will be from last May.</P>
    <P>Senators Burke and Chambers sought a debate on the fair allocation of funding in BMW areas. I am only too pleased to arrange time for such a debate because I understand that the Border and western areas are getting their fair share, but the midlands are lagging a long way behind.</P>

      <P>Is onóir mór dom bheith ar ais arís i Seanad Éireann chun freastal ar an mBille an-tábhachtach seo. Is é seo an Bille Árachais, 1999, agus tá mé chun eolas faoi bhreis a chur do mhuintir na tíre ins na heachtraí agus an gnó a bheidh sibh á dheanamh le daoine a bhfuil ag obair le árachais ar fúd na tíre.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to bring this Bill before Seanad Éireann. The purpose of the legislation is to update the regulation of certain aspects of the insurance industry. The objectives of the Bill are to allocate regulatory responsibility for insurance intermediaries to the Central Bank of Ireland and to utilise the regulatory powers available to the Central Bank, under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, to enable the Minister to make disclosure regulations to require insurance undertakings and intermediaries to make relevant information of a specified nature available to insurance consumers, to strengthen the existing system of notification by reinsurance undertakings and to enable the Minister to make regulations for the authorisation and supervision of reinsurance undertakings, to update existing provisions for offences and penalties and to enhance the powers of authorised officers for the purposes of the Insurance Acts and regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure it would be of assistance to the House if I were to summarise briefly the general background to the proposals contained in the Bill. Later I will explain in more detail for the benefit of the House the content of some of the more <Col N="364" /> complex provisions. Where relevant, I will draw the attention of Members to the important amendments introduced to this Bill during the various Stages of debate and subsequent passage through the other House over the past few months.</P>
    <P>Insurance undertakings employ almost 11,300 people in Ireland today. In addition, there are approximately 6,500 insurance brokers, agents and tied insurance agents, many of whom are employers of staff. Gross insurance premium income for 1998 amounted to £10.6 billion, of which 70% related to life assurance and the remaining 30% to non-life. Gross premium income increased in 1998 by 41% on the previous year's figure. It is interesting to note that 31% of this business is written in other European economic area countries.</P>
    <P>In round figures, there are 1,900 insurance brokers, 1,500 insurance agents and 3,200 tied agents, as well as the sales forces of the undertakings themselves, involved in the sale of insurance products. Of life assurance business, 50% of annual premium is transacted by brokers, 1% by agents, 22% by tied agents, 25% by company sales forces and 1% is effected directly with the insurance undertaking. Where single premium is concerned, brokers transact 75% of insurance business, agents 1%, tied agents 15% and 9% of the business goes directly to the undertakings.</P>
    <P>On the non-life side, the insurance industry has advised me that approximately 70% of this business is transacted by intermediaries. Some 55% of non-life business is accounted for by motor insurance, of which approximately one third is transacted directly with the insurers by telephone, fax or over the Internet. The Internet is a mechanism for doing business in this area. The amount of business covered is growing constantly. There has been a major increase in the number of people using the Internet, through e-business and e-commerce, to get their business done. The percentage of direct insurance has been increasing significantly in recent years, with several new companies specialising in this format of business.</P>
    <P>The regulation of insurance intermediaries was first provided for in law by Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989. This provided for a relatively simple system of self-regulation by the insurance industry itself under the overall responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The 1989 Act defined three separate categories of insurance intermediary. First is the insurance broker, who acts primarily as an agent of the client and must hold appointments from at least five life companies to transact life assurance business and-or from at least five non-life companies to transact non-life business. Second is the insurance agent, who acts as an agent of the insurance company and who may not hold more than four appointments from life companies to transact life business and-or no more than four non-life companies to transact non-life business. Third is the tied insurance agent, who enters into an arrangement with a par<Col N="365" /> ticular insurance undertaking, whereby he or she undertakes to refer all proposals of insurance of a particular form, that is, life or non-life, to that undertaking. The insurance undertaking concerned is responsible for any act or omission of its tied insurance agent in respect of any matter pertaining to a contract of insurance offered or issued by that undertaking, as if the tied agent were an employee of that undertaking.</P>
    <P>A notable feature of the retail insurance industry is the overlap between brokers and agents, with many individuals or firms acting as brokers for one form of insurance business and as agents or tied agents for the other form. The Irish Brokers Association, as a body recognised by the Minister for the purposes of the Insurance Act, undertook supervision of its members' compliance with the Insurance Act. In addition, the Insurance Intermediaries Compliance Bureau was established by the Irish Insurance Federation as a central compliance checking facility for all other insurance intermediaries. A major regulatory function fell to the insurance undertakings themselves in that they may not appoint a person to market their products or pay commission other than to an intermediary who is either a member of a representative body of insurance brokers recognised by the Minister whose rules require compliance with the Insurance Act, or a person who otherwise complies with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, introduced detailed procedures for the regulation of investment intermediaries, with regulatory responsibility allocated to the Central Bank and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Under the Central Bank Act, 1997, the supervisory role allocated to the Minister in respect of certain categories of investment intermediaries was transferred to the Central Bank, with effect from April 1997. In recent times, there has been considerable blurring at the margins of investment and insurance products and a significant number of intermediaries are engaging in both investment and insurance business.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank is well equipped with a robust regime of regulatory and enforcement powers under the 1995 Act to supervise investment intermediaries and has acquired valuable experience in carrying out this function effectively since 1995. The impact of the Bill, when enacted, will be to bring insurance intermediaries within the same regulatory regime as investment intermediaries under the remit of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that I want to outline the reasons I believe it is necessary to restructure the system of regulating insurance intermediaries and to allocate responsibility for this function to the Central Bank. The system of self-regulation is no longer appropriate to an area of such fundamental importance to the consumer. The existing regulatory provisions under the Insurance Act, 1989, are inadequate to regulate the activities of insurance intermediaries. The <Col N="366" /> powers available to the Central Bank under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, are more comprehensive and robust than those available to the insurance regulators under the Insurance Act, 1989. The considerable overlap between the activities of insurance intermediaries and investment intermediaries requires that the same regulator should cover both activities.</P>
    <P>There is a need to minimise the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, that is, an intermediary using the existence of different regulators to place itself under the least onerous regulatory regime. There is also a need for a level playing field of regulation for insurance intermediaries and investment intermediaries who are now facing into direct competition, particularly in the area of single premium life insurance. Insurance and investment intermediaries are now equally bound by the provisions of the Investor Compensation Act, 1998, which is working very well. The proposed establishment by the Government of a single regulatory authority for all financial service providers will, in any event, bring insurance and investment intermediaries together under the one single regulator. This Bill will launch the initial stage of this process.</P>
    <P>On the question of a single financial regulator, discussions have taken place between officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and of the Department of Finance and the matter is being considered by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. When outstanding issues have been settled, the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste will bring proposals to Government for detailed consideration and final decision. Following the Government's decision, it is expected that the legislation required for the establishment of the new authority would be promoted by the Minister for Finance in due course.</P>
    <P>I would now like to proceed to the provisions in the Bill to facilitate making disclosure regulations. The prime objective in introducing these measures is to provide information to consumers to allow them to make rational and informed choices when purchasing insurance. This should lead to greater competition on the market, thus reducing the price of insurance. The proposed legislation provides for measures to strengthen and enhance existing consumer disclosure measures made under European legislation. The proposals will lead to a simplification in the future presentation of products. The new regulations will make any attempt at the mis-selling and churning of life assurance policies more obvious to the consumer and, therefore, more difficult to achieve. Thus the regulations will clarify the implications and costs involved in taking up life assurance products, including the payment received by the intermediary selling the product before the consumer signs along the dotted line.</P>
    <P>In light of the changes proposed for the taxation system as it applies to life assurance which will come into effect from the beginning of next year, the disclosure regulations will remove any temptation to use the tax changes to churn exist<Col N="367" /> ing products or to mis-sell new insurance products to unsuspecting consumers. Experience has shown that many purchasers of non-life insurance are equally at sea when it comes to understanding the precise nature of the product, its constituent elements and the price being charged. Enabling provisions relating to non-life insurance will provide for regulations to be introduced detailing elements such as policy loadings, restrictions, discounts, excesses, commission payments and any other amounts payable.</P>
    <P>Some of these elements can have a significant effect on the cost of insurance cover and, in particular, the cost of compulsory motor insurance cover. The introduction of such transparency measures will assist consumers in controlling costs themselves and alleviate the unnecessary cost burdens that result from a lack of information at point of sale and-or renewal. As was the case with the drafting of the life assurance disclosure regulations, it is my intention to consult widely with both industry and consumer interests before finalising similar non-life disclosure regulations.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide a statutory framework for the introduction of regulations requiring the provision of information to insurance consumers, both before the conclusion of insurance contracts and on an ongoing basis thereafter.</P>
    <P>Consumers will be entitled under the regulations to comprehensive information from the insurer or insurance intermediary on the terms and conditions of the proposed insurance policy, which will include the type of policy, benefits and options, &ldquo;cooling off&rdquo; provisions, purpose and intention of policy, the costs of the policy, the means and duration of the payment of premiums and the consequences of early surrender, which often had detrimental effects on consumers in the past.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that in 1998 I abolished the cap on the commission paid to intermediaries. This was done for a number of reasons. First, there was a danger that other forms of payment might be devised to circumvent the maximum commission levels. Second, it was brought to my attention that other EU insurers might be deterred from entering the Irish market because of the cap on commissions. Since it is clearly in the interests of consumers to have as many insurers as possible active on the Irish market, in order that the best possible choice of product and price is available to them, I considered it important to abolish the cap.</P>
    <P>However, although the removal of the cap has these advantages, it gives rise to the risk of an increase in commissions in the absence of other controls. In my opinion, the best control, in the context of a more competitive market, is disclosure and transparency for all consumers. Consequently, as part of this overall comprehensive disclosure package, I am proposing to introduce disclosure of insurance intermediary and sales<Col N="368" /> persons' remuneration as a separate item of disclosure.</P>
    <P>I will move on now to the reinsurance provisions contained in this Bill. Due to the absence of any direct consumer interest in reinsurance, the supervisory authority has imposed a light regulatory regime on this branch of the industry until now. At present, an informal system of authorisation of reinsurance companies operates in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is based on a simple statutory notification requirement and an administrative arrangement, whereby such companies will not be registered by the Companies Registration Office if the information in the statutory notification gives rise to concern. While the current informal system has worked satisfactorily to date, it is considered necessary to expand the requirements and to make provision for a more formal regime that could be introduced, if necessary, at short notice.</P>
    <P>The position regarding reinsurance companies in Ireland has changed significantly in recent times, with the development, in particular, of the Irish Financial Services Centre. I intend to impose more stringent obligations on reinsurance companies to ensure the continuation of the excellent international reputation of the IFSC and the Irish financial services sector in general.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the making of regulations that will require reinsurance companies registered in Ireland to provide detailed information to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment at the time of their establishment, and to notify any changes in their situation on an annual basis. It also makes provision for the possible future extension to reinsurance companies of some or all of the provisions in national legislation governing the authorisation and supervision of insurance undertakings.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the new provisions is to prevent the registration or establishment in Ireland of reinsurance companies of dubious standing. We are also anticipating the introduction, in the medium term, of EU legislation on the regulation and supervision of the reinsurance industry.</P>
    <P>For the same general reasons outlined above, this Bill removes the exemption of reinsurance contracts or insurance intermediaries solely engaged in reinsurance contracts from Part IV of that Act. Reinsurance contracts and reinsurance intermediaries will in the future be subject to all insurance legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to authorised officers, the revised provisions of the Bill in this area will apply to the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1989, and, subsequently, to the proposed disclosure regulations to be made under the Bill. The provisions in the 1989 Act governing the appointment of authorised officers gave rise to concern when the Minister sought to use these provisions in the past. Questions were raised in regard to the appointment of authorised officers and the restricted manner within which they were required to carry out their tasks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> I have decided to update the provisions to address the concerns referred to previously and to bring them into line with the analogous provisions for authorised officers contained in the more recent Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, and the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>The more notable changes contained in the provisions are as follows: first, the Minister may appoint a person who is not an officer of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as an authorised officer; second, there is specific reference to persons in respect of whom powers may be exercised by an authorised officer; third, there are several new categories of information which will be open to the authorised officer to inspect; fourth, duties may be imposed on specified persons, for example, an examiner, liquidator, receiver etc., to provide information to the authorised officer; and, fifth, an authorised officer may be empowered by a court warrant to enter a private dwelling.</P>
    <P>The various provisions covering offences and penalties of the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1989, have been reviewed and updated on the basis of experience and other relevant factors. Some of these provisions date from as far back as the Insurance Act, 1936. The most significant changes are as follows: first, prosecutions for summary offences may be taken by the Minister; second, there is an extension of the timescale within which prosecutions can be commenced from six months to two years and beyond this period in specific circumstances; and, third, the Second Schedule to the 1989 Act, which sets out the amount of penalties that can be imposed by the courts, is being replaced by a new Schedule containing significant increases in penalties, which takes into account current money values and the financial situation of the country.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the Bill itself. In Part II, section 4 amends section 3 of the Insurance Act, 1989, by updating and increasing existing offences and penalties, respectively. Under current insurance legislation, the prosecution of offences is hampered by the six month prosecution deadline from the date of the offence. The section enables the Minister to bring summary proceedings for any offence under the Insurance Acts and insurance regulations at any time within two years from the date on which the offence was committed, or at any time within six months from the date on which sufficient evidence is available to justify proceedings, subject to a limitation period of five years from the date on which the offence was committed. This section also empowers the court to order persons convicted of an offence to pay the costs and expenses incurred by the Minister in relation to the investigation, detection and prosecution of the offence.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 deal specifically with reinsurance. They expand the obligations on reinsurance undertakings contained in section 22 of the Insurance Act, 1989, and set out the various headings under which notification to the Depart<Col N="370" /> ment of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is required.</P>
    <P>Substantial amendments were made to this section on both Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil. The main change on Committee Stage sought to ensure that the provisions giving the Minister power to introduce full authorisation and supervision of reinsurance companies are constitutionally secure. The main change on Report Stage makes it clear that the requirement to provide notifications applies to existing companies writing reinsurance business. An amendment was also agreed which empowers the Minister to issue a direction to a company to cease reinsurance activities if the notification which it provides is deficient. The overall intent of the provisions regarding reinsurance is to prevent the establishment of reinsurance companies of doubtful reputation in Ireland. If, in spite of these provisions, companies of doubtful repute are established, the Minister may take administrative steps to deal with them. This is necessary to protect Irish and international consumers and to protect Ireland's outstanding reputation as a well regulated financial services centre.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides a firm legal base to introduce regulations on the provision of information to insurance consumers before, during and after the conclusion of insurance contracts. It covers disclosure, which is mandatory under EU law, and it sets out in precise terms the nature of the obligations that may be imposed by regulation on insurance undertakings and intermediaries, in so far as the mandatory provision of information to their clients is concerned. For added clarity, EU information requirements about the insurance undertaking and the commitment of clients are set out in a separate Schedule &ndash; Schedule II &ndash; to this Bill.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, in light of representations made to me from various sources, I introduced an amendment which empowers me to require insurance companies to give annual information to consumers about investment policies, irrespective of when these policies were initiated. It is my intention, at least initially, to require this information in respect of policies initiated on or after 1 January 2001. However, should consumers experience difficulty in getting information about existing policies, I will consider extending annual disclosure to existing policies.</P>
    <P>The members of the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business argued convincingly on Committee Stage that equivalence of disclosure as between commission payments to insurance intermediaries and sales remuneration to sales employees should be enshrined in this Bill. Accordingly, I brought forward an amendment on Report Stage in response to those arguments. Similarly, in response to good arguments on Committee Stage, I brought forward an amendment on Report Stage to provide for the monitoring of the disclosure provisions. It is my intention that the transparency regulations will <Col N="371" /> come into operation with effect from 1 January 2001.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the repeal of Part IV of the Act of 1989. The essential elements of this Part will be replaced by the authorisation and supervision provisions in the amended Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995. Thus, insurance and investment intermediaries will be subject to a single regulatory regime, overseen by the Central Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 deal with all the appointment and powers of authorised officers under the insurance Acts. Section 59 of the Act of 1989 is amended to provide for the appointment of authorised officers by the Minister, which appointments will not be restricted to officers of our Department. This will permit the appointment of authorised officers with the specific skills and qualifications necessary to carry out the particular task in question.</P>
    <P>Section 10 expands the scope and powers of authorised officers. Experience has shown that the powers currently available to authorised officers were such as to hinder investigations into unauthorised insurance business and breaches of the Insurance Acts. Section 10 clarifies which entities are subject to the powers of an authorised officer and the actions that an authorised officer is empowered to carry out. Specific obligations on persons to whom this section applies to co-operate with an authorised officer are set out. A person who obstructs, misleads or fails to co-operate with an authorised officer in the exercise of his or her powers shall be guilty of an offence in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 13 repeals section 110 of the Insurance Act, 1936. The provisions of this section, concerning time limits for the prosecution of offences, are revised and expanded in section 4 of this Bill. Section 14 provides for transitional provisions to apply to life assurance proposals and policies entered into before the commencement of section 6 &ndash; provision of information &ndash; of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part III brings me to the amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, an Act that is already administered and enforced by the Central Bank of Ireland. Section 16 amends section 2 of the 1995 Act to include definitions that are relevant to insurance. A number of amendments were agreed on Committee Stage, the purpose of which was to ensure that the Investment Intermediaries Act applied as intended and did not capture the activities of companies based in the International Financial Services Centre who are doing business in other countries whose domestic legislation will cover these activities. On Report Stage, I brought forward an amendment which amends the definition of credit institution. The previous definition was ambiguous in that it was not clear whether credit institutions would be required to seek authorisation as an investment business firm when acting as insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>Section 17 inserts a new section 13A after section 13. Section 13A outlines transitional <Col N="372" /> arrangements in relation to insurance intermediaries existing on the day before this section comes into effect. Provided that they apply to the supervisory authority, the Central Bank, for authorisation within a period of three months, these will &ldquo;stand authorised&rdquo; pending a decision from the supervisory authority. During the period in which the supervisory authority is considering an application for authorisation, it has the power to impose conditions and issue directions to the intermediary. An intermediary may appeal any such directions or conditions to the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 18 amends section 16 of the Act of 1995 to provide that where the supervisory authority is not satisfied as to the probity and competence of a director or manager or as to the suitability of a qualifying shareholder of the investment business firm, it may apply to the court for an order revoking the authorisation of the investment business firm. Section 19 amends section 17 by removing the necessity for the supervisory authority to keep separately a register of investment business firms who are deemed authorised and those authorised by the supervisory authority.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides that where an investment business firm fails to give information sought by the supervisory authority within a reasonable period as specified, the supervisory authority may, by direction, impose punitive measures. This amendment was inserted on Committee Stage as the supervisory authority had recently, in some cases, experienced difficulties getting responses from some intermediaries.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 define investment product intermediaries and the various types of insurance intermediaries. Section 21 presents section 25 of the 1995 Act in a more simple format. In addition, it includes insurance policies and tracker bonds in the list of products in respect of which a restricted activity investment product intermediary, RAIPI, may provide services. Section 22 amends section 25 of the 1995 Act by the insertion of new subsections outlining specific requirements for insurance intermediaries. Section 25A provides that an intermediary shall not place or attempt to place insurance otherwise than with an undertaking.</P>
    <P>Sections 25B, 25C and 25D define the activities of a broker, agent and a tied agent. Section 25E defines the scope of agency in relation to insurance agents. It also governs the acceptance by an intermediary of insurance proposals. Where a premium is paid to an insurance intermediary in respect of a renewal of a policy invited by an insurer or is paid in respect of an accepted proposal of insurance, it is deemed to have been paid to the undertaking. Furthermore, it also provides that where a premium is paid to an insurance intermediary in respect of a renewal of a policy invited by an insurance undertaking or in respect of an accepted proposal of insurance, it is deemed to have been paid to the insurance undertaking.</P>
    <P>On Report Stage I brought forward an amendment to section 26 which allows the supervisory authority to specify the type of information that <Col N="373" /> should be given by intermediaries when first entering a business relationship with the client or on their stationery or advertisements. This will allow the supervisory authority to take account of the sometimes complex status of intermediaries while ensuring that the information to clients is absolutely clear and unambiguous.</P>
    <P>Section 23 amends section 26(1) as amended by the Investor Compensation Act, 1998, by outlining the specific services that a restricted activity investment product intermediary may provide and by the addition of receiving and transmitting orders in tracker bonds and insurance policies to this list. Insurance undertakings are added to the list of bodies to which a RAIPI may transmit orders. Subsection (2)(a) provides that a person who is an insurance intermediary on the day prior to the coming into effect of section 15(c) and who remains within the definition of a RAIPI shall be deemed to be an authorised investment firm. Other than where acting as a deposit agent or a tied insurance agent, a RAIPI is not permitted to handle customers' cash.</P>
    <P>An amendment was included on Committee State to provide a requirement that insurance intermediaries, who in accordance with the terms of the Act will be deemed authorised, will furnish information to the Central Bank within three months of the coming into force of the provisions of this Bill. The reason for the amendment was that the bank had experienced difficulties in getting information from a limited number of intermediaries who were &ldquo;deemed authorised&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The issue of whether restricted activity investment product intermediaries should be permitted to handle cash in particular circumstances was raised on Committee and Report Stages by Members of the Opposition. I gave an undertaking on Report Stage in the Dáil that I would bring forward an amendment which would permit cash handling in closely defined circumstances. I wish to confirm my intention to table such an amendment on Committee Stage in this House.</P>
    <P>Section 24 removes the provision in section 27 whereby a representative body approved by the supervisory authority would regulate its members. This section requires investment product intermediaries who are acting as insurance intermediaries to comply with the provisions of the insurance Acts. Allowance is also made for the supervisory authority to exempt certain classes of intermediary from the requirement to hold professional indemnity insurance where it considers that the clients of the intermediaries are otherwise adequately protected.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for the substitution of the existing section 28(1) of the 1995 Act by a new text. This text simplifies the amendment of section 28(1) made under the Central Bank Act, 1997, and extends the obligations on product producers to insurance matters. The provision in section 28(1) whereby a product producer was permitted to appoint an investment product intermediary to act on its behalf, on the basis that the intermediary was a member of a representative <Col N="374" /> body approved by the supervisory authority, is removed since the supervisory authority will be engaged in direct regulation itself and will no longer issue such approvals to representative bodies.</P>
    <P>This section also amends section 28(2) by permitting a product producer to assume, for the purposes of section 28(1), that any investment product intermediary who has been authorised by the supervisory authority complies with the provisions of the Insurance Acts.</P>
    <P>On Report Stage I brought forward an amendment to section 29 in place of previous provisions in the 1995 Act. The effect of the new provisions is to provide that the supervisory authority may decide the type of information to be provided by intermediaries to clients on their stationery, in advertisements, or on first contact. This is to take account of the sometimes complex status of intermediaries, while ensuring that the information to the client is absolutely clear and unambiguous. It will also permit the supervisory authority to adapt quickly to innovations on the market, notably those which may flow from e-commerce.</P>
    <P>Section 27 amends section 30 to provide for the form of receipt to be issued by the intermediary to the client, the manner in which this form may be altered by the supervisory authority from time to time and the time period for which an intermediary must retain a record of the receipt. The requirements set out in this section may be augmented from time to time by codes of practice issued or approved by the supervisory authority under section 37 of the 1995 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 28 as it now stands was inserted on Committee Stage. It provides that discontinuance notices are published where they can be expected to be seen by all clients of the intermediary. There have been cases where discontinuance notices have been published in newspapers where they would be unlikely to be seen by most of the clients affected.</P>
    <P>Section 29 inserts a new section 31A exempting travel agents and tour operators from Part IV of the Investment Intermediaries Act. This is a similar provision to that which was included in Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989. I have undertaken to examine this matter further and will revert to the matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 30 excludes insurance intermediaries from the requirement in the 1995 Act to disclose commissions since they will have to disclose commission payments under this Act.</P>
    <P>Section 31 repeals section 51(5)(<i>e</i>) of the 1995 Act, which provided that a single bond may cover the bonding obligations of an investment business firm that is also an insurance intermediary. Since insurance intermediaries are now included within the definition of investment intermediaries, and in any event the requirement to hold a bond under the Insurance Act, 1989, was repealed by the Investor Compensation Act, 1998, this subsection is no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> Section 32 amends section 2(<i>g</i>) by the insertion after the word &ldquo;by&rdquo; of the word &ldquo;whom&rdquo;. This was a technical amendment necessitated by the omission of &ldquo;whom&rdquo; in the original text of this Act.</P>
    <P>Section 33 amends section 74(2) by expanding the section to include certain information provision requirements for persons acting as insurance intermediaries or insurance agents, the format of which information may be modified by the supervisory authority, within the remit of section 74(1). In other words account is being taken of changes in society, commerce, business and the economy, allowing the supervisory authority to react at any time by making the necessary, sensible, practical changes in the interests of the consumer and of sustainable business.</P>
    <P>Section 34 was introduced on Committee Stage. It will enable the Central Bank to make inquires of accountancy bodies about the investment business activities of any of their members. The current position restricts inquiries to &ldquo;certified&rdquo;, that is authorised, persons. The amendments permit the Central Bank to discuss the activities of accountants who are engaging in business activities without the necessary authorisation. It also allows the supervisory authority to seek from a product producer information about an investment business firm with whom they have a business relationship and disclose that information to the Garda, notwithstanding normal confidentiality rules.</P>
    <P>That is a summary of the Insurance Bill, 1999. In the course of preparation of the Bill over the past two years, our excellent officials and I have met with a broad range of interest groups who have represented the interests of the industry bodies concerned and insurance consumers.</P>
    <P>These have included the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Brokers Association, the Professional Insurance Brokers Association, the Insurance Intermediaries Compliance Board, the Society of Actuaries, the Consumers Association of Ireland, the Pensions Board, the Director of Consumer Affairs and, of course, the Central Bank of Ireland, which will be taking over responsibility for the regulation of insurance intermediaries. Altogether, we have had a number of separate meetings with representative groups from the insurance industry. Our officials also provided a presentation in November 1999 on the broad outline of the Bill to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. I have been signalling these changes since October 1997, so they do not come as a surprise to anybody.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank the various interest groups which have furnished their opinions to me and our officials during the consultation process and, in doing so, contributed to the final outcome of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the cost of insurance, especially motor insurance, is a topic which generates much debate and concern. Premiums for motor insurance arise directly from the <Col N="376" /> high incidence of claims, especially among certain age groups, and the high cost of claims settlements. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has initiated a campaign to improve road safety this coming bank holiday weekend. The National Safety Council is inviting motorists to switch on their headlights during daylight hours over the weekend, as a gesture of solidarity in favour of road safety. Senators will recall that the &ldquo;fly the flag&rdquo; campaign during the same weekend last year resulted in a significant improvement in road safety in November. I commend the campaign of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to this House and I hope the motoring public will take this opportunity to be proactive in support of road safety in Ireland. A significant lessening in the number of accidents over the already better record of last November would be the best possible result for the people.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank the Seanad for its co-operation in arranging this Second Stage debate. I look forward to hearing the contributions of all Senators. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to participating in the subsequent Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for this comprehensive overview of the Bill. I welcome the campaign to improve road safety over the bank holiday weekend, to which he referred in his concluding remarks.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the important matters which this Bill proposes to deal with, namely, the allocation of responsibility for the authorisation and supervision of insurance intermediaries, which I am glad is being placed in the care of the Central Bank, and the consequent requisite amendment of the Insurance Act, 1989, and the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995. I take it from what the Minister said that the Minister for Finance will be dealing with this, which led to some furore in the other House. I thank the Minister for his confirmation in this regard and look forward to an early resolution at Government level. I have always felt the Central Bank was the correct institution in this regard. It has the expertise, staff, knowledge and know-how. I take it we will continue to have a Central Bank, so while there may have been issues of overlap or conflict in terms of prevention and its supervisory role in the past, there is no reason, with a clear directive from Government and necessary law, this cannot be put right.</P>
      <P>The Bill will enable the Minister to make disclosure regulations requiring insurance companies and intermediaries to make relevant information available to insurance consumers. The Bill will strengthen the existing system of notification by reinsurance undertakings and enable the Minister to make regulations for their authorisation and supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will also update existing provisions for offences and penalties and enhance the powers of <Col N="377" /> authorised officers for the purposes of the Insurance Acts and regulations.</P>
    <P>The history of regulation is very recent having been first introduced in 1989 and improved upon in 1995 with the Investment Intermediaries Act. Then, in accordance with the terms of the Central Bank Act, 1997, the supervisory role of the Minister was transferred to the Central Bank. There is no doubt that self-regulation of insurance intermediaries has in the past proved inadequate and because of the importance to consumer welfare some more extensive regulatory powers were needed. There is no doubt that in this age of openness, transparency and accountability, the lack of transparency and the information deficit associated with the sale of insurance products had to be tackled and this is done in the Bill, but in some instances with too much of a heavy hand. It empowers the Minister to make up for deficiencies. There are some matters which are unnecessary and where the Minister unnecessarily goes beyond European requirements, something I will return to later. I agree with the provisions dealing with reinsurance and in particular the need to protect the reputation of the Irish financial services sector and the provision for a more formal regime which could be introduced at short notice, if necessary, following the enactment of the Bill. I note that the Bill gives enhanced powers to authorised officers.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister intends to use the powers available under the existing Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, so that both investment intermediaries and insurance intermediaries will come under the same regulatory regime. It seems that insurance intermediaries will not readily fit into this regulatory regime and the Minister has much work to do to convince me that this &ldquo;easy option&rdquo; will work. The Insurance Bill, 1999, should be amended to ensure that insurance intermediaries are exempted from the onerous obligations of the 1995 Act which are better suited to the large investment firms, for which the Act was originally intended. There is common ground between the two types of intermediary on, for example, sales of tracker bonds but over-regulation is not the answer.</P>
    <P>Much has changed in the industry in the past few years. All independent insurance brokers subscribe to the Investor Compensation Authority. I am reliably informed that the vast majority have professional indemnity cover and both of these give the consumer comfort should an issue of misappropriation of client moneys, incorrect advice or inappropriate selling arise. I understand that insurance intermediaries will be divided into two categories &ndash; restricted activity product intermediaries and investment product intermediaries. This is not appropriate as all insurance brokers provide services in these categories.</P>
    <P>Insurance brokers play an important role in selling life protection and pensions to the consumer. Surely we do not want the Bill to put these people out of business and leave the consumer <Col N="378" /> without product choice and independent advice and at the mercy of the larger institutions. We have already witnessed through the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry how large institutions can manipulate the consumer. I would be opposed to any attempt to give advantage to such institutions and do not want this Bill to lead to job losses in the industry. As the Minister stated, a level playing pitch is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Insurance intermediaries provide a valuable service to society and relieve the burden on the State by ensuring that consumers have money when they are critically ill, retire or die. Is the House aware that 40% of males and 48% of females have no life cover and average life cover is at the totally inadequate figure of £50,000 per person? Only 52% of employees, 27% of the self-employed and 12% of the agri-sector have pensions. We need to support the efforts of insurance brokers to increase coverage.</P>
    <P>The Insurance Bill, 1999, should not be allowed to disadvantage insurance brokers. Unless the Minister makes some changes to the Bill he will discourage insurance brokers from selling insurance and confuse the consumer with incomprehensible facts and figures and extra paperwork. I ask the Minister to consider a correction before damage is caused and to ensure the independent broker can give independent advice to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Bill provides for equivalence between the remuneration of sales employees of insurers and insurance brokers. To create a level playing field between the direct sellers and the insurance intermediary, the Minister must ensure that the broker distribution channel is fairly compared to the institutions. How does the Minister intend to achieve this? Will he consider setting up a system to monitor this or an arbitrator to whom complaints can be made? I look forward to his views on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends that brokers cannot accept cash once the Bill becomes law. This is gross interference in the way the industry operates and is handing the advantage to the large players. Brokers must be allowed accept cash in the practice of their normal business activities. There is already a system of section 48 accounts in place which is monitored annually and has worked well in the industry. There must be a way, with necessary safeguards, to allow brokers accept cash. I note that the Minister said he intends to introduce a restricted amendment on Committee Stage. I look forward to that amendment and hope it will deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>In Part 3 it is intended that insurance brokers who give advice should register under section 10 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995. This is nonsense as an independent broker who has more than five agencies and has adequate professional qualifications and ability must be allowed to give advice. This is what his business is about. This is what the consumer expects of him. The Minister intends to restrict insurance brokers to give information only &ndash; unless they <Col N="379" /> register under section 10. How can one distinguish adequately between information and advice? It will not work in practice. I do not like the word RAIPI. It is a most unfortunate acronym. Brokers in their independent capacity must be allowed to give advice.</P>
    <P>We must ensure the consumer has the availability of independent advice and choice of products at an affordable price. In the past the commission structure provided for this by enabling insurance brokers to give valuable advice to all consumers. This cost is built into the product sale and if the Minister attempts to drive down this cost or &ldquo;commission&rdquo; he will put the independent insurance broker out of business because this money provides his income out of which he pays his overheads, staff, his own salary, car costs and pension costs. If he cannot do this he cannot survive in the business and the advantage is being given to the large market players. This is not acceptable and it will lead to job losses in the industry, particularly in rural Ireland. We have to think of Ireland beyond the Pale as well as within the Pale. As I said here last week in a debate on rural development and rural regeneration, rural Ireland needs all the breaks it can get.</P>
    <P>RAIPI is a terrible word. Can it be changed? I strongly disapprove of the term and I ask the Minister to examine this whole area of restriction. Independent brokers cannot do business and be restricted. It is nonsense. How would one like to go out and sell a policy and before starting tell the consumer one is restricted in what one can say? One would not sell many policies under those restrictions. Like me the Minister should know as he may have engaged in this type of business in the past. The independent insurance broker should be allowed to operate his business independently, within the normal criteria for operating this business, and he should not be subject to this type of interference by the State.</P>
    <P>The requirement for capital adequacy does not make sense. It goes much further than the proposed EU directive which offers four options to satisfy this area, that is, whereby moneys paid by the consumer to the intermediaries are treated as having been paid to the undertaking; a requirement of 8% of annual net revenue with a minimum of £15,000; the existence of segregated accounts &ndash; we have a good system with section 48 accounts and a guarantee fund &ndash; and we now have the Investment Compensation Authority. The Minister is trying to get all four of these protections, although the proposed EU directive would be happy with one, into the Insurance Bill, which is totally unnecessary since the first three are generally fulfilled. As well as this the Bill is trying to restrict what an independent broker says to his client. The Bill goes too far and creates too many burdens for insurance brokers when we should be supporting their good work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> On Committee Stage in the other House the Minister said he was leaving out disclosure on travel insurance and tour operators who sell travel insurance because they are protection products. Is that not producing one law for travel insurance and another for life protection insurance? I understand travel agents get a higher commission on these products than non-life brokers. There is no advantage to the consumer in having disclosure on pure protection products. These policies are price driven and considering that the Minister is attempting to exclude travel agents I ask him to exclude disclosure on all term and pure protection products, otherwise he will confuse the consumer with unnecessary information. It is vital to encourage people to take out protection insurance to secure their future. I welcome the concept of disclosure but surely this should be given to the consumer with the cooling off notice. While a quotation can be given, up-front figures will change due to underwriting and the proposed paperwork which amounts to approximately ten pages is too burdensome for both the consumer and the broker in trying to close a sale. It will result in the sale of fewer policies.</P>
    <P>I have examined the proposed disclosure table and note that commissions are not included in the costs and charges table, but in an isolated table some pages later. This is not acceptable. Commission is the insurance company's cost for selling policies and it should be included in the cost and charges table as part of the total cost of the policy to give the full costs to the consumer. The Minister is setting out to provide for disclosure but this table does not achieve that because it does not give the consumer the full cost of taking out a policy. The Minister would be able to exempt pure protection products as the total cost and charges would be visible to the consumer if there is an accurate table.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to re-examine this area and we will table an amendment on Committee Stage. One is confusing the consumer and disadvantaging the broker. If the disclosure table is re-arranged to include a column for the total cost of the policy, including commission, then pure protection products could be exempted from disclosure. The insurance intermediary's commission has no material effect on these guaranteed products. They are price driven and never carry any value. The consumer will not lose out. On death or on the occurrence of a critical illness the full payout is guaranteed to the consumer regardless of how much the independent broker has been paid in commission. PIBA, the IBA and the Consumers' Association of Ireland agree on this point. I will also table an amendment on this issue. Perhaps the Minister of State will save me the need to do so and I plead with him to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. The Minister of State is always helpful and I would be happy to do business with him again.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and his officials have relied heavily on the Society of Actuaries in drafting the disclosure guidelines. I am not convinced that a level playing field is achieved in relation to disclosure of costs, overheads and sales remuneration. Too much discretion seems to be left to the individual actuary in the institution allowing him to present his disclosure information in the best light. This facility is not provided for the insurance intermediary. His commission on each sale is outlined in a separate column. The car salesman or the mobile telephone salesman does not have to reveal his commission to anybody. Why is the Minister of State demanding that the insurance intermediary declare his commission as an isolated charge? It is only relevant on policies with surrender values.</P>
      <P>The Bill imposes considerable extra time on the independent insurance broker in making additional visits to the consumer, especially in the present traffic congested environment, to verify his requirements and acceptance of policy conditions. This is not workable in practice as time costs money. In this era of the Internet and telesales what provision has been made to accommodate these forms of selling?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State intends that a discontinuance notice should be printed in the national press if a broker ceases to operate part of his business or one of his agencies is cancelled for non-production. This is also unacceptable. The Minister of State knows this will be misinterpreted in his constituency and others and in people's minds because they will perceive there is wrongdoing involved and the reputation of the broker will be damaged. I will consider tabling an amendment on this to ensure such a notice is only printed where wrongdoing is discovered.</P>
      <P>We will not oppose the Bill as we agree with the principle underlining it but I am unhappy with certain aspects. I am grateful for the Minister of State's kind offer and perhaps together we will make further amendments to make this legislation more equitable and practicable. If it is enacted in its present form there will be job losses in the industry, which should not be allowed to happen.</P>

      <P>All of us have come to expect transparency in the financial services industry as it is vital for commercial and political business. The legislation aims to introduce greater transparency <Col N="382" /> in the insurance industry. It is important that the consumer understands how the system works. It is only when he is armed with this knowledge that he can make an informed purchasing decision. The ability to make such decisions leads to better value and customer service and a greater contribution to the business and the consumer.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Coghlan that the insurance industry has made a great contribution to society. It has often provided good financial advice which has given peace of mind to many people in difficult situations. At the end of the day insurance companies have often provided money in times of great pain and sorrow to consumers and that has made a difference to them in terms of dealing, for example, with the devastation of losing a loved one. Life insurance should not be underestimated.</P>
      <P>In many of the consultations I have had with people in the insurance industry they pointed out how nice it was to go to the house of a bereaved person a short time after the funeral and tell them that the insurance would be sorted out when the death certificate had been organised. We should be tremendously proud of the peace of mind that generates for people. The insurance industry can also be proud of the contribution it makes.</P>
      <P>Many years ago I recall my late father telling me there were two types of salesman who preyed on people, the encyclopaedia salesman and the insurance salesman. My father tried to sell encyclopaedias but gave it up quickly because he felt it was wrong to sell products to people who did not need them. Sometimes insurance salesmen say they are selling products to people who do not need them but it is not until something bad happens that we realise how life changes and that the peace of mind that insurance gives is worthwhile. Life insurance has made a significant difference to people following sudden deaths in the family.</P>
      <P>While the insurance industry was initially fearful of the changes required under the original draft of this legislation, most of its fears have been allayed. There will be change and everybody accepts that. As business progresses there is change. Change is often frightening and difficult to take on board and understand. Business people wonder whether they will be able to operate following change, whether they will be able to conduct their businesses differently, whether change will improve or worsen their businesses or whether it will lead to job losses, to which Senator Coghlan referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe there will be job losses in the insurance industry but it will change. Overall when it looks back on the legislation in a few years the industry will be happy. There have been long and detailed discussions on the legislation. When it was published many people in the industry had grave fears. The Minister of State consulted many organisations, including the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Brokers Association, the Professional Insurance Brokers Association, insurance intermediaries, the Society of <Col N="383" /> Actuaries, the Consumers' Association of Ireland Limited, the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Central Bank, the Pensions Board and others.</P>
    <P>Such detailed discussion and consultation is important and it is because of that process and the efforts of those involved that the legislation satisfies many of the needs of the Department in terms of what it wants to achieve and satisfies the fears of the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>Many of these fears have been allayed. However, I am still not happy about a couple of issues and I have spoken privately to the Minister of State about them. I also intend to raise them during the debate. It is important to review legislation as time passes. In terms of the legislation introduced by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, there has always been an openness and a willingness to review whether its key objectives are being achieved.</P>
    <P>The two reasons for this legislation are that we want to protect the public, the people who buy insurance products, and we want to protect the industry. We need to protect the public because much money is invested in insurance. There are huge benefits involved in buying in advance and this is necessary. We need to insure ourselves against some of the bad things that can happen to ensure that our loved ones and families are protected. If we are involved in a car accident and we or others are hurt, we want to ensure that our costs are covered and that, if necessary, compensation can be paid.</P>
    <P>The public relies on the advice of the insurance industry. Senator Coghlan mentioned rural areas and there is a huge reliance on the advice of small agents and brokers in many small towns and villages. It is only during home visits late in the evening when the milking is done and the work is finished for the day that people sit down and consider whether the advice they are receiving is good for them and if they should take it. The guidance given to small investors and customers is most important and we cannot afford any degradation of this service in terms of what the public expects from the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>Regarding the protection of the industry, there is a major problem nowadays in terms of generalisation. If one organisation or industry does something wrong, all those involved in the area are blamed. There is a perception that the entire insurance industry and the banks are bad. For example, Irish Life is bad because it was involved in churning. Insurance brokers and agents are involved in overselling and they do not tell people everything. There are no proper explanations about what products are available or what they involve. This creates the opportunity for exploitation by cowboy operators. While there are cowboys in every area, in general, the people who work in the insurance industry are hard working, committed and honest individuals. The industry needs the protection of this legislation to ensure the cowboys do not become the norm and remain the exception.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> When I was preparing my notes for this debate, I realised that the list of benefits for the industry was longer than the list for the public. Ultimately, this is why the legislation will work. I disagree with Senator Coghlan, I believe the legislation will work. The people in the industry are hard working and honest but, above all, they are professional. Their contribution, in association with the legislation and the framework for regulation that is being put in place, will ensure that the industry will continue to grow and develop. Senator Coghlan and the Minister of State mentioned percentages in relation to the insurance held by people and the room for growth in this area.</P>
    <P>There are unacceptable activities, but it is not fair to tar everybody with the same brush. There is a need to recognise the dangers and ensure they do not happen again. This regulatory framework and the change in terms of the powers that will be given to the Central Bank are part of that process.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the Bill are simple. They are to enhance and strengthen the consumer disclosure measures and to make the presentation of products simpler and easier to understand. There is an aim to increase competition and to force greater value for money. There is also an aim to maintain a high level of consumer protection. All these objectives must be met and we must work together to ensure that they are achieved.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains three parts with two central elements &ndash; stricter regulation of insurance intermediaries and the protection of people who buy insurance in all its forms. For too long consumers were not protected. Much of the protection in place today was inspired by the EU and I am grateful for that. However, as a country, we must take responsibility. We cannot be led and inspired all the time by the EU. We need to take the high road ourselves and introduce legislation and frameworks that other countries in the EU can copy. Many other countries are looking at the economy and asking what Ireland is doing right and how they can replicate our success.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the other House, Deputy Fleming recounted his experience in the 1980s of buying a house. At the time, endowment mortgages were the rage and he explained how many people took out such mortgages. The basis of the product was anticipated growth of up to 10%, but that did not happen and many people who took out such mortgages had to cash them in or revert to conventional mortgage arrangements with banks and building societies. These products were not a deliberate ploy on the part of insurance agencies to fleece consumers, but that is what happened. People were severely disadvantaged by the type of product they purchased.</P>
    <P>However, consumers also have a responsibility. People say that those selling products must ensure that consumers are informed of various aspects, but consumers must ask questions and realise on what they are spending their money. They must look after themselves. It is too easy <Col N="385" /> not to read the small print, although the insurance industry could make the print larger and less legalistic and complex. Perhaps this area could be considered in the context of making products easier to understand and less complicated for the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to ensure that even if the print is small, it is not too complex and people understand what they are buying. However, it is important that consumers ask questions. They should ask what terms mean and what they can expect. They should ask about potential flaws and pitfalls associated with products and what guarantees they can expect and how they are measured. They should ask if they are measured on past performances and about indications for future performances.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State said, the insurance industry in Ireland is huge. More than 10,500 people are directly employed in it and 6,500 people act as agents. It was not until I started to have discussions with people in the industry that I understood the meaning of the term &ldquo;tied agent&rdquo;. I saw advertisements stating that particular bodies were tied agents for Lifetime or Ark Life but I did not understand what it meant. It was great to get an explanation.</P>
    <P>Some 64% of insurance business is involved in life insurance while 34% is involved in non-life insurance. In life insurance, 50% of business is done by brokers while 24% is done by agents. The remainder is done through direct sales. Some 50% of the non-life insurance business relates to car insurance. This is vital insurance and it is the only area where insurance is mandatory. However, there are real problems in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a huge tendency to take legal action and there are large litigation bills as a result. This has to stop. I have witnessed cases where a car was bumped slightly by the vehicle behind it at traffic lights. Within two seconds, the person driving the car emerged, holding their neck and saying that it was painful. This happens a lot and we should not stand for it. However, part of the reason people get away with it is the tendency of insurance companies to settle claims before they go to court. They do not even ask the person to say, under oath, that there is still something wrong with them. They tend to feel they should accept it for what it is.</P>
    <P>This situation will continue until the insurance industry realises that consumers can go to court if they have a legitimate claim. Perhaps there are cost issues that could be sorted out, including all the money that solicitors and barristers make from such cases. One way of stopping spurious claims and making it easier for those with genuine ones, is to make somebody face up to the fact that they are telling lies about an injury. It is no longer acceptable for people to obtain money for old rope in this way.</P>
    <P>The importance of adequate house and contents insurance became obvious to me about a year ago when I had to make a claim following a small fire. People who do not have a large <Col N="386" /> amount of disposable income and who, perhaps, have not bothered to arrange home insurance in the past, are often those who are most in need of such insurance when things go wrong. Senator Coghlan spoke earlier in the context of life insurance and we must do whatever we can to encourage people to increase their insurance cover through increased brokerage activity and Government support. If more people were insured it could bring the cost of policies down.</P>
    <P>I renewed the policy on my own house recently and it cost nearly £300, but that is a lot of money for people on the minimum wage. The challenge facing the Government and the insurance industry is to try to lower those costs, thus bringing more people into the net and ensuring they have adequate cover when things go wrong. Senator Coghlan will recollect all the hard work done by the Minister and the Department to make sure nothing went wrong on the Y2K issue. When nothing went wrong because of all the preparations we had put in place everybody said it was a waste of money. If we had not invested that money and things had gone wrong, however, it would have been a completely different story and we would all have been in the boiling pot.</P>
    <P>The problem with insurance is that if one does not have it and does not need it, one thinks it is a waste of time. If one has it and requires it, one is very grateful for it. Also, if one needs it but does not have cover, one will certainly lose out.</P>
    <P>It is funny to contemplate how invasive the insurance industry is and how it affects us in our daily lives through household and mortgage protection, life insurance, health insurance, including critical illness cover, and motor insurance. It affects everybody. Life insurance is particularly important yet only 52% of females in this country have life cover &ndash; that means 48% of them are not covered. As Senator Coghlan said, the average amount of life cover is £50,000. That is frightening because in this day and age £50,000 is inadequate, particularly if it concerns a mother who is looking after children and doing part-time work as well as household jobs. A sum of £50,000 would not compensate for such work, even for one year. A breadwinner, whether it is the mother or father in a household, certainly cannot be replaced by £50,000. In the olden days it may have written off an average mortgage, but that is not the case today. The Department has a responsibility to make people more aware of the need for and the value of insurance. Regulation in this area will ensure there will be a greater respect for insurance sales persons who come to the door to sell their products.</P>
    <P>I remember joining a company when I was 18 years of age and they talked about the pension fund. I was told, however, that I did not have to worry about it until later because I could not join the fund until I was 26. At the age of 26, I thought I would never need a pension. It is only when one hits the mid-30s that one begins to wonder what will happen when one can no longer work. What will replace a person's income then? We need a <Col N="387" /> sustained information campaign and a good tax regime so that we can continue to provide for our own pensions and not be dependent on State pensions.</P>
    <P>The Celtic tiger exists because of the amount of young people working at present. These young people will grow older, but the shrinking labour force will not be able to support everyone's pension needs. The challenge is for each of us to come up with some way of preparing our own pensions.</P>

      <P>Various points were made, in particular by the Professional Insurance Brokers' Association. I read through them after the Dáil debate last Wednesday and again today. Most of the issues have been dealt with. The Minister of State should re-examine the name issue. As Senator Coghlan said, the term &ldquo;RAIPI&rdquo; seems to cause offence. I understand it is from a different Bill but perhaps we can look at it. The insurance industry should come up with something that we can propose to the Minister of State who, I believe, is very open to it. He said he would address a couple of other issues on Committee Stage and I look forward to that. Given what he has done to date, I am sure the insurance industry and the Professional Insurance Brokers' Association in particular, will be happy with what he will have to say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome yet another innovative Bill. I gives me pleasure to record publicly that individual Ministers of State &ndash; who have been given a brief under the new dispensation of recent years, and who have much more power and influence in their Departments than heretofore &ndash; have demonstrated their grasp of the complexities of those Departments. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, who has been on top of his brief, especially in the area of insurance regulation which, as was pointed out by my colleagues, is an extremely complex area for the public. While the insurance industry itself seems to have no difficulty in working out the jargon and terminology, ordinary consumers have always had great difficulty in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the Bill, I could not help but reflect whether one of Ireland's best known broadcasters, Gay Byrne &ndash; who had his own personal financial problems with his late accountant, losing a considerable amount of money &ndash; would have been protected if this Bill had been enacted at the time. He was perhaps the most high-profile person to have had such an experience. Yet, hidden behind the one Gay Byrne are many hundreds of others, especially older people who may have invested their life savings with dubious <Col N="388" /> undertakings and &ldquo;silver-tongued devils&rdquo;, to quote a Kris Kristofferson song of many years ago, in the insurance industry. While not wishing to tar all of them with the same brush, it is a highly competitive environment and it is all about selling. At one time or another, all of us have been subjected &ndash; whether personally or through the media &ndash; to the hard sell of financial investments.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister of State's decision to abolish the cap on commissions, which was anti-competitive. It will introduce a new competitive era into the selling of insurance, pensions and other financial products. Some 18 months ago he was quoted in the financial pages of <i>The Irish Times</i> as having decided not to proceed along the route of openness, transparency and accountability. At the time, I was somewhat taken aback and I remember very well, although he may not, cornering him in a corridor of Leinster House to inquire what had brought on this change of mind. In fairness, he said that the spin that had been put on the story was somewhat inaccurate in that he had not decided unilaterally to take this decision but was certainly exploring the possibility of agreeing to approaches from the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>It brings to mind that wonderful quote made in a court 40 years ago about the insurance industry seeking this type of regulation: &ldquo;They would, wouldn't they&rdquo;. This has been a problem which has faced many of us who have had reservations about credibility when it comes to the selling of pensions and insurance and financial products. I am pleased the Minister of State has not so much reversed his original decision as come down on the side of the consumer.</P>
    <P>Accountability and openness are extremely important. If I caught the drift of what Senator Coghlan said, he seemed to be defending the insurance industry's record. I stand corrected if I misinterpreted his contribution. I know insurance companies have not been enthusiastic about, nor have they wildly embraced, this new dispensation proposed by the Minister of State in the area of detailing to the last degree exactly what is involved in terms of commission, growth rates and the plethora of complexities that surround any financial product, especially in the insurance and life assurance industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative the Minister has taken and that, when the Bill becomes law, there will be a legal obligation on those involved in the selling of life and financial products and insurance generally, especially intermediaries, to be open and transparent. In other words, I hope the public will no longer buy a pig in a poke and be subjected to the small print Senator Cox referred to which is in most financial product literature. It is not surprising one's eyes glaze over when one is confronted with reams of sections, subsections, amendments and references to various legislation. If nothing else is to come from the Bill, I hope it places an obligation on those selling products to be clear and unambiguous. Those are the <Col N="389" /> words the Minister used throughout his contribution. I do not understand why people selling a service should obfuscate to the extent that the financial and insurance industry has done to date, and they have done so because they have been allowed to get away with it.</P>
    <P>I will give an example which I am not sure is covered directly by the Bill. We are all familiar with travel insurance. All of us who have travelled abroad have been obliged at some stage to take out travel insurance. I did so in good faith several years ago when I travelled to Seville in Spain for a football match with my wife. We stopped at a tourist office, both of us got out of the car and we were not inside the building a minute when my wife had to go back to the car to retrieve a document. She discovered that it had been broken into and that the case had been taken. She confronted the people involved and tried to get it from them but they overpowered her and left with it. I claimed under the existing contract that had been provided by the travel agency through a London broker. All the sections on one side of the page indicated that I was entitled to claim under the various sections. However, when I turned over to the other side of the page, I discovered that there was a huge volume of sections and exclusions. As they specifically applied to our predicament, the insurance company would have been happy to pay out what was, to it, a small amount of money but for us was a large amount, about £1,000 &ndash; we had lost cash as well as clothing &ndash; had either I or my wife been physically holding the bag when it was taken from us by the thieves. In that case the company would have been able to prove that we had made very effort to care for our belongings. I fought with the company and, as a result of tedious and interminable correspondence which lasted six months, it eventually paid me half the amount I sought without prejudice.</P>
    <P>That is scandalous. I remember going through the rigmarole of contacting the Consumers Association of Ireland and the Minister of State's Department &ndash; he was not the Minister of State at the time, it was the early 1990s &ndash; and they all said there was nothing they could do. I am not aware that the position has changed to any great extent since. I understand it is still the case that those who give out insurance products get away with lists of exclusions. In other words, they give with one hand and take away with the other. I do not suggest that all intermediaries are like that but that is an example. As a result of that experience, I am severely prejudiced and jaundiced in my approach to any insurance company or those selling financial products. I hope this legislation will go some way to making me and others aware of what exactly we are getting into when we purchase and pay our money.</P>
    <P>Section 22 amends section 25 of the existing legislation and sections 25B, 25C and 25D define the activities of a broker agent and tied agent. Where a premium is paid to an insurance intermediary in respect of a renewal of a policy, this <Col N="390" /> is deemed to have been paid to the insurance undertaking. Am I right in assuming in the scenario I outlined at the beginning of my contribution regarding Mr. Byrne that, once the cheque was paid by his accountant, under the new law the insurance company or the financial products company selling the service must legally accept that a contract has been entered into?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <P>As regards the receipt, I know that UK based financial services companies give a cooling off period. When they send a person his or her contract of purchase, they also send another document stating that, under the law as it exists in the UK, that person has a period in which to reflect on whether they wish to proceed with the purchase. Will that obligation be included in Irish law or will it mean that, once a person has paid money, he or she must take what is given and that there is no cooling off period in which he or she might wish to change his or her mind or, having entered into the contract, he or she discovers that it is not exactly what he or she wants? Is there a possibility or has the Minister of State considered the possibility of a cooling off period, or is it in existing legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I agree with Senator Cox about the terminology RAIPI. We used to blame those wonderfully gifted people in that section of Government who devised the Irish equivalent of English worded legislation. We all marvelled at their ability to devise the most wonderful names and terminology for new boards and agencies. We cannot blame them in this case. I presume it is short for restricted activity investment product intermediary but it is a bit of a mouthful. I agree with Senator Cox in what she said about usage. There is also the issue of them not being able to handle customers' cash but the Minister of State said he is examining this and that he may change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 26 relates to advertisements. This has long been a bone of contention. The Minister of State said that the supervisory authority may decide the type of information to be provided. I hope the Minister of State will take a firm hand and that he will be the iron hand in the velvet glove in this case. If there is one area of contention which causes pain and anguish, it is the manner in which those selling financial services promote their wares. Naturally they want to put the right spin on it and they will bend the statistics to prove their case, but there are many instances where a spin is put on existing statistics which, in the cold light of day, would leave open to question whether that company's performance is as good as it says it is. It is interesting that, in all the advertisements for financial services one sees, the largest print states that one should buy the product because it has increased by 100% over the <Col N="391" /> past 12 months and the smallest print, which is usually at the bottom of the advertisement with a little asterisk, says the financial service, product, unit trust or insurance policy may go down as well as up. People do not always remember that. They all want to think that what they are buying will make them millionaires.</P>
    <P>There is a certain greed factor involved, apart from those who are taking out pensions and life assurance for very laudable reasons to ensure they and their families will have sufficient to live on when they reach retirement age. However, those who are buying financial services for purely speculative purposes should also be protected. Why should somebody who wants to put their hard earned money into an investment, such as a life assurance policy, unit linked policy or endowment policy, not get the very best and be told in clear and unambiguous terms that what they are buying might decrease as well as increase in value?</P>
    <P>The number of financial products on the market now makes it difficult for ordinary consumers. I hope the Minister of State will continue along the path he has hewn over the past two years and will continue to represent, not only the people of Galway East and, as a Minister, the people of Ireland, but also the consumers' best interests. He is dealing with very powerful forces, where money is king and where billions of pounds are involved.</P>
    <P>A statistic which brought this home to me last week was the report that the amount of money invested in the Dublin financial services centre has now reached £175 billion, which has made Ireland one of the leading financial services centres in the world. That is the sort of money we are dealing with &ndash; it is Monopoly money. For example, the £40 billion Exchequer funding to be spent on the national development plan over the next six years is put in perspective when one considers that £175 billion is being transacted in a square mile in the docklands.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State on his innovative legislation. I hope it works, but I have no doubt he will return to the House if it does not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill. Much of what has been said is very pertinent to what we are dealing with today, essentially the question of the relationship between big business in the form of a financial institution and the consumer and how we regulate that relationship. Too often in the past there was inadequate regulation in terms of supervision, accountability and transparency. The result has been that we have found ourselves in the past decade with a crisis of confidence in many of our financial institutions, in more ways than one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The banks had to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. They came out of that inquiry very poorly and had to pay back approximately £150 million which had been, to put it mildly, misappropriated through mechanisms which were <Col N="392" /> inappropriate for good financial activities. The insurance industry has had its own problems, particularly in relation to the Taylor affair. We hear every day from the tribunals the problems with offshore accounts held by some of our major public figures in politics and industry. There have been allegations of our financial services centre being used as an offshore centre for other countries which were attempting to launder money.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of whether financial institutions which avail of people's money, hold it in trust in a certain sense and use it for a particular purpose have social obligations. Is the service they provide customer oriented or purely profit oriented?</P>
    <P>This question arises regularly in relation to the banks and post offices. The only reason there has not been a massive reduction in the number of post offices is that successive Governments could not face that politically. The powers that be would love to get rid of them and take away that social bond for communities, particularly in rural areas, but they have been unable to do it. However, the Bank of Ireland, for example, has declared that it is closing 60 of its 300 branches countrywide, despite the fact that only a few years ago all the financial institutions were competing with each other to set up branches.</P>
    <P>For example, in Stoneybatter, one of the oldest communities in Dublin, the Irish Permanent, EBS and AIB have closed and the Bank of Ireland will close before the end of the month. There will not be a single financial institution left. This area is developing rapidly, with integrated area plans from the local authority and tax incentives from Government, yet all the financial institutions, in their wisdom, decided to deprive that community of their services.</P>
    <P>There is a moral and ethical question which must be looked at, in terms of the customer service that is provided and whether everything is to be done at a distance, by the Internet, telephone or &ldquo;hole-in-the-wall&rdquo; machines. These matters must also be addressed in the broader sense of transparency, accountability and regulation. The Bill does not address those issues, but I want to bring to the Minister of State's attention that financial institutions should have to provide an accessible service to consumers.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State outlined clearly the purpose of the Bill, which I welcome. Its purpose is to allocate regulatory responsibility to the Central Bank and to beef up the powers from the last century under the intermediaries Act, which is very welcome and desirable. Its purpose is also to enable the Minister make disclosure regulations for the provision of relevant information and to strengthen the system of notification by reinsurance undertakings and to update the penalties.</P>
    <P>The insurance industry has operated in a self regulatory fashion for the past 100 years or more. The Minister is right to say it is no longer appropriate that self-regulation should be the norm, when we consider the huge sums of money involved. He said that £10.6 billion was dealt with <Col N="393" /> in premia last year alone, which was an increase of 41% over the previous year. Quite clearly, that whole market is expanding at an enormous rate and employs in excess of 10,000 people. It involves a huge amount of money and a huge number of consumers are at risk if proper practices are not in place.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, although self-regulation has operated reasonably well, it cannot be the only way to regulate an industry of this size. I welcome the fact that the regulation will be done by an independent or outside body.</P>
    <P>I have always had my doubts about the Central Bank. Its public statements on its supervisory and regulatory role in relation to the banks leave quite a lot to be desired. Its regulation seems to be quite slipshod, at arm's length and not very intrusive in nature. I hope that when the powers conferred by this legislation are in place there will be authorised persons with specific responsibility to regulate in an effective fashion. There should be regular reports to the Oireachtas on how the regulation is operating so we can see how effective it is. This is the first time the insurance industry will have an outside body regulating it.</P>
    <P>This begs another question. There has been a row in the Dáil over the last couple of days with regard to the independent regulator for the financial sector. Are we putting the cart before the horse with this legislation? It is necessary, but I understood there was to be a regulator for the financial sector in place by now. The committee was set up in the spring of this year under the Attorney General and various reports and recommendations have come before us but there is still no sign of the legislation. The row in the other House is about whether the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will have responsibility for the legislation. As far as I can gather&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that he has. He said, &ldquo;On the question of a single financial regulator, discussions have taken place between officials of our Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and of the Department of Finance and the matter is currently being considered by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance&rdquo;. That does not sound like clearing the air.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification on this. I am not deterred by the fact that Senator Coghlan raised the issue. The Minister of State continued, &ldquo;When outstanding issues have been settled, the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste will bring proposals to Government for detailed consideration and final decision&rdquo;. That indicates that it is as much in the air as it ever was. His next statement brings the matter further: &ldquo;Following this Government's decision, it is expected that the <Col N="394" /> legislation required for the establishment of the authority would be promoted by the Minister for Finance in due course&rdquo;. What does promote the legislation mean? Will the Minister introduce it? It appears the discussions have not been resolved and we do not know who will be responsible for the authority. Perhaps that is the reason for the delay. The Minister of State might clarify the matter in his concluding remarks.</P>
      <P>It appears that this legislation will only shortly be in place when it will be superseded by an umbrella regulatory mechanism in the form of the single independent regulator who will be responsible for the financial sector. What is the <i>raison d'être</i> of that approach to legislation?</P>
      <P>The question of accountability and transparency in terms of how the insurance industry conducts its business is moot from the point of view of the consumer. Senators Mooney, Coghlan and Cox referred to the problems caused for the consumer by the small print. It is everywhere in the industry. It would be hard to find a Seán or Mary citizen who could declare they understand the finer print of their insurance policies. Whether it is travel or life insurance, the details are difficult to understand. There is an inability in this and many other professional areas to provide clear, intelligible English. I do not know why this is so.</P>
      <P>We have addressed the problem to some extent with regard to legislation brought before the House. Legislation appears to get more complicated by the day whereas legislation brought before Parliament in the last century was clear, simple and intelligible. It was equally effective. How is it that the parliamentary counsel cannot frame legislation in a clear, intelligible fashion? I give the Attorney General full marks for his decision to take on the responsibility, with all legislation that comes before the House, for producing a summary of its substantive elements. The provisions of the Bills will be in legislative form but the summary he will produce will be in clear intelligible English &ndash; and Irish, I hope &ndash; and will be acceptable in a court as the interpretation and intention of the legislation. It will come before the Houses to be nodded through.</P>
      <P>I do not see why the Minister of State cannot ensure that every premium sold and every contract entered into, in the insurance and other areas of the financial services and other professional sectors, is accompanied by clear intelligible expositions of what the fine print involves. I am interested in the fine print because that is what catches people out. It is also what much of the industry falls back on.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to the points made by the Professional Insurance Brokers' Association. The Minister of State will have a copy of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have many copies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he will indicate what elements he is prepared to incorporate or to reject. One point refers to pure protection prod<Col N="395" /> ucts and having to disclose them. Does he feel there is an advantage to the consumer in continuing to do that? There is no surrender value with these products. They are not of a financial value where people gain from the investment capacity in the product. They are simply protection policies.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister of State agreed to the point in relation to the collection of insurance premia in cash? Many people in rural areas deal in cash. Approximately 30% of the rural population do not have a bank account and it will be harder for them to maintain bank accounts given the number of bank branches due to be closed throughout the country. That is all the more reason that it should be possible to make the premia transactions in cash.</P>
      <P>How will the point in relation to independent advice and information be dealt with? Will any broker be able to give advice and information without substantial legislative imposition? There is also the question of whether the cap on commissions will continue, whether the Minister considers it reasonable for a broker to sell commissions and whether he believes brokers will be able to survive in the business with the reduced price. About 75% of premia are dealt with through brokerage both in the life and non-life sectors. Finally, there is the RAIPI, the strange term for the restricted activity investment product intermediary. Will the insurance broker suffice to cover the general use that is required there? Perhaps the Minister of State could dispense with that title.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome and I will be pleased to see it in operation. I will be interested to see how the Central Bank will exercise its responsibilities. I would like to know who will deal with the single regulatory mechanisms and how and when they will be dealt with. I would like the Minister to look further down the road to future legislation and to have a fresh look at the role of the consumer in relation to other financial institutions to ensure the consumer is getting a good deal. When we license financial activities and financial bodies, what are the conditions under which we allow them to operate? Will we allow them to operate in a strictly investment and financial sense where they have the required amount of capital to ensure the consumer of their product will not be short changed if something happens and that they are bonded? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, will we ensure the required amount of service? Service is the area in which I believe we have the most difficulty and about which we get the most complaints. The financial institutions do not provide a service that is acceptable to the consumer. They provide a service that is in keeping with their financial and profit making requirements. Very often the consumer is short changed in terms of the quality and location of the service provided and in the manner in which it is provided. That is another area which requires a huge <Col N="396" /> amount of examination and it can be regulated as well because financial services have responsibilities and it is our function as legislators to ensure those responsibilities are fulfilled.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the contributions of Senators to this debate and I thank them sincerely for raising issues they consider may give cause for concern. Several of the proposals made are such that I will need to reflect further on their implications before coming to a final decision regarding their inclusion in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Since its publication, I am pleased that there has been a broad welcome for this Bill from all quarters, including the industry, this House and Dáil Éireann. As might be expected, however, not all the provisions have been received with universal acclaim. In particular, reservations have been expressed by some sections of the insurance industry in relation to aspects of our proposals to introduce disclosure requirements and the manner in which disclosure will be made.</P>
      <P>I recall for Senators that these proposals have come about as a result of a lack of adequate comprehensible information being available on a continual, clear and transparent basis to the consumer. This unsatisfactory situation left many vulnerable people at the mercy of unscrupulous individuals &ndash; not the industry but unscrupulous individuals within the industry &ndash; who engaged in the mis-selling and churning scandals that have come to light in recent years. As Minister for commerce with responsibility for the insurance industry, I have a two-fold responsibility. I must ensure there is a viable, sustainable and solidly resourced insurance industry available to consumers and to give a choice to consumers on product, on opportunity for investment and cover and protection for them. Along with that, I have a fundamental responsibility to ensure that these companies have the necessary liquidity to be able to pay the cover and premium and to underwrite the different claims made against them as well as ensuring the consumer has absolute information available to them so that they can make an informed choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for commerce, and during my time in office of a little over three years now, I have had to go out and defend decisions or, indeed, answer for decisions on situations which were distasteful to say the least and which did not arise during my time in office. Some of these cases went back five, ten, 15 or 20 years. They came to notice and we had to deal with them. My overriding commitment at all times was the integrity of the industry, protecting and sustaining the industry, sustaining financial services and ensuring con<Col N="397" /> sumers had the choice, the protection and the cover and that the resources were available to both companies and the industry as required.</P>
    <P>I am determined to ensure that insurance consumers will be provided with sufficient information to enable them to make rational and informed choices about their insurance requirements and that the resulting competition in the marketplace will encourage the promotion of better products at lower cost &ndash; more products, greater competition and lower cost of investment in the premia. In this regard, I am indebted to the Society of Actuaries in Ireland for its assistance in the presentation of the relevant facts and figures for insurance consumers in a simple and understandable manner that will form an integral part of the regulations to be made under this legislation.</P>
    <P>We also have a professional in-house actuary in our Department. He is an outstanding man who has worked with the team of outstanding people in our insurance division. They have worked assiduously on this to ensure that the fairest, clearest, sensible, practical and simplest system of disclosure possible is available in the future.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged to note that a number of undertakings have already taken the initiative themselves to improve the level and quality of information which they provide for their customers, no doubt as a result of the publicity surrounding the preparation of this Bill. I very much welcome this trend. The insurance industry, which is a large employer in this State and an essential element of Ireland's social fabric, can only benefit from such developments. I, as a legislator and citizen of this country, am very proud of the industry which has done an outstanding job about which there is no doubt.</P>
    <P>I turn to a number of the points raised by Senators. Senator Coghlan referred to various parts of the legislation and talked about the threat of job losses as a result of disclosure, that is, that our legislation may be heavy handed. The effect of this Bill is to ensure that insurance intermediaries are to be authorised and supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland instead of the present situation where they are subject to a regime of self-regulation. Unfortunately, that situation has proved totally inadequate from the consumers point of view. Every effort has been made to ensure the supervisory regime matches the exposure of the consumer.</P>
    <P>An effective regime will allow consumers to invest with confidence thus increasing business for brokers and insurers across the board. I think Senator Costello put his finger on it when he talked about the figures and the huge growth, and Senator Cox said the same earlier. There has been huge growth in the industry. As we grow the economy, there are greater resources to be invested and reinvested and there is greater opportunity and, consequently, financial services, particularly the insurance industry, will grow commensurate with the way the economy grows. <Col N="398" /> We are very optimistic about the next 25 years of growth in this country and I am confident the insurance industry will continue to grow along with our economy.</P>
    <P>Senators Coghlan, Cox, Mooney and Costello all referred to the title RAIPI. It was originally introduced by the Department of Finance in an Act and was carried on in the Investment Intermediaries Act and the Insurance (Investor Compensation) Act. Our attention has been drawn to the sensitivities about this issue and, indeed, I would like to resolve it. We are not wedded to this title, even though it has been in operation for almost six years since the Investment Intermediaries Act was passed. There is no objection on our side to consulting with the industry to find a different title. Our only concern would be that in any alternative title, the message would be clearly conveyed to the consumer that its activities are restricted. There is a difference; they have a different responsibility and the parameters are much tighter. We have to make sure that the unsuspecting consumer walking in to deal with these people knows exactly the parameters within which they must operate.</P>
    <P>Given the time scale I suggest consideration of a change of title should be given more time. It can be addressed in legislation brought forward by the Minister for Finance at any time in the future, including the SFR, the forthcoming Finance Bill after we pass this budget and the Finance Bill after we pass the budget of 2002.</P>
    <P>I assure the Members of the House, for whom I have the utmost regard, and the public that the Government has no intention of worrying them about the future of this initiative. The Government will continue in office doing a good job and will only ask for a verdict from the electorate when it is constitutionally necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan and other Senators referred to discontinuance notices. I understand their concerns. Discontinuance of appointments may occur for ordinary reasons. Notices can give the wrong impression of the intermediary, but that is like politics. The perception is often not the reality, whether it concerns legislation, the individual or the misrepresentation of a statement made by a Member of either House or by a politician at any level.</P>
    <P>However, intermediaries may themselves publish notices of discontinuance, explaining the innocuous reasons for it if they so choose. On the other hand, the purpose of the requirement to publish is to inform the public and the consumers. Providing such information to consumers is of overriding importance. It ensures that others may not exploit any vacuum in any area of activity, be it within the insurance industry or in any functional or geographical area.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox referred to capping commissions and commission payments. The reasons for disclosure of commission payments is to enable the consumer make a rational choice between products. There is no reason the consumer should be deprived of this information because of the prod<Col N="399" /> uct bought. Unfortunately, there have been instances in the past where advice to consumers has been influenced by the remuneration received by the intermediary. Purchasing insurance, especially life insurance, is not like purchasing a car. In the case of insurance and assurance one may have to wait 20 years to see the real product and to benefit from it.</P>

      <P>I know the Senator agrees with me. I only make the point for the purposes of clarity. Senator Cox also referred to equivalence. I have every confidence in the Society of Actuaries and the commitment of its members to achieve equivalence of disclosure. I was the first Minister of State with responsibility for commerce to address all the insurance AGMs. I have addressed many functions and in every case have made it clear what I want to achieve, which is equivalence through a level playing field for both the insurance and financial services industry and all consumers.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox referred to spurious claims payments by insurance. It is very frustrating. I am especially frustrated with situations where the insured, having made a premium payment, finds that a settlement for a claim against him is reached without prior consultation. That is wrong. The insured has the right to be consulted. We are examining ways of dealing with personal injury compensation and have considered ways of including it in this legislation. It is very difficult.</P>
      <P>However, we are dealing with personal injury compensation. A number of professional groups and volunteers have considered the issue and a number of reports have been produced. I am considering a report in consultation with my officials and I hope, as soon as possible, to bring proposals to Government that will address some of the issues raised by Senator Cox.</P>
      <P>In a wide ranging speech Senator Mooney referred to the illustrious Mr. Gay Byrne. Mr. Byrne gave power of attorney to his solicitor. This legislation cannot prevent this from happening, but where a consumer gives money to an intermediary they will get it back either from the intermediary's capital or from the financial institutions standing behind the intermediary. This, of course, depends on the status of the intermediary. Mr. Byrne gave absolute power to this wonderful person whom he trusted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> As Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, as a legislator and a citizen I value and understand the contribution of the insurance industry and those who sell its products. I accept that independent brokers make an invaluable contribution to Ireland, both urban and rural, especially in rural areas where big financial services are not located and where I am proud to live.</P>
    <P>However, the purpose of the Bill is to protect the consumer. By empowering the consumer we will encourage the better working of the market. As Senator Cox has said, consumer protection legislation here is relatively new and could not be regarded as excessively onerous. We have always tried to strike a balance that is best for society and the citizen.</P>
    <P>We have also tried to strike a balance between the parameters, exigencies and criteria laid down by the EU Commission in terms of what we consider to be good for Ireland. Sometimes we are able to be slightly ahead of the European situation. When Europe introduces new directives and examines our legislation what we have done is often commended and an indication given that no changes are required. It would be good if we could achieve that in this area. It would ease the pressure on insurance intermediaries and others having to worry about European legislation in the immediate future. Over time more directives will be issued which will affect their situation. We must respond to that, as in all aspects of our lives.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to the single financial regulator. He appears to be worried that we will not proceed with this. The group appointed by the Government to examine the implementation of its decision to establish a single regulatory authority for financial services reported in May of last year. It produced a lengthy report and we compliment the chairman, Mr. McDowell, now the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Since then, the Minister for Finance has been working with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to develop a proposal for Government that will provide a sound basis for the regulation of the financial services sector and which will enjoy the confidence of all concerned. Discussions have taken place at official level between officials from both Departments and the two Ministers are constantly consulting on these issues. As soon as they have finalised their consideration of the various issues we will bring our proposals to Government for approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the House again. This is a very complex matter. This legislation transfers responsibility to the Central Bank to be the regulatory authority to deal with the insurance industry and with insurance intermediaries. Hitherto there has been part self-regulation, part regulation by the Central Bank and <Col N="401" /> the involvement of various bodies. We are now streamlining that. It is another chapter in financial regulation. It will make it much easier to achieve a SFR in the future.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan confirmed this is a very complex area. He made a strong case for his choice as SFR. Our minds are still open. We await the conclusions of the Ministers and officials. It will entail a big and complex decision about how the financial services industry is to be regulated.</P>
      <P>Ireland is an island nation with a very open economy. There is a huge opportunity to capitalise on the strength and integrity of the financial services. We must ensure that we get it right. <i> Festina lente</i> is always the better motto when big decisions are to be made.</P>
      <P>In October 1997 I signalled that I would introduce this Bill. Senator Mooney referred to an article that contained derogatory comments about me to the effect that I had shied away from it. I was compared to innocuous things, to which I will not refer. Everybody knew this legislation was imminent. We consulted widely and I hope that, ultimately, the collective wisdom of the Legislature, the industry and the people will produce the proper kind of legislation that will serve the country well. The same will happen with the SFR. Following the Government's final decision on this matter, the necessary legislation required for the establishment of the authority will be introduced by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Coghlan referred to the effectiveness of the legislation. It will be effective, whatever the regulatory environment. Whether legislation is administered by the Central Bank or a new single regulator, it will make no difference to its substance. Any legislation introduced, such as this Bill, will be included in the legislation covering the SFR. Senators Coghlan and Cox referred to the disclosure pertaining to protection products and the right of the consumer to information to avoid creating loopholes. Earlier I referred to the cap on commissions. I abolished that and again I was criticised. I felt it was better to abolish the cap on commissions and have disclosure rather than provide a cap and have a situation where the industry could find other ways of getting around it. I felt that would provide a more level playing field. By and large the people in the industry are pleased with that. It was the best way to proceed. The European Union would not be impressed by the imposition of a cap on commissions. The European Union wanted competition and, as Senator Cox said, we have much for which to be grateful to the Union. It has created competition and the systems it introduced have ensured there is competition here. All this is another reason for disclosure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of pressure on me to exempt protection products. I would relish the ability to say in this House that I could do that. I <Col N="402" /> will give this further consideration. I must be sure before I take a final decision that if I exempt protection products, little gifts would not be given for the number of protection products a person sells because there was non-disclosure. I would need to be sure that there would not be an additional bonus for pushing protection products and that the bonuses for performing in other areas would be included with the protection products. I have not been convinced yet that such a situation would not prevail. The matter must receive more consideration by me and my officials before I could come to a conclusion on it. Whatever we decide, we want to make sure it is sustainable, it will stand the test of time and will be equitable for the consumer and fair to the industry.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was published in December last, and during its consideration by the Dáil and now by this House, I and my officials have continued to consult with the insurance industry and the various other interests, including the Central Bank, regarding its contents. In addition we have had valuable contributions from all sides of the House during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil and again here today. Arising from these consultations, a number of issues have been resolved by amendments tabled by me on Committee Stage and Report Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members of this House for their contributions. I will reflect on all the points raised. My mind is always open because I have no monopoly on wisdom. Legislation must embrace the totality of the collective wisdom of the Members of the Houses of Parliament elected by the people. If we operate on that basis, I am confident we will get it right at all times. I will, therefore, reflect on all the points raised and, as I have signalled, I will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage, notably to permit cash handling by restrictive activity investment product intermediaries. I will also consider the position concerning travel agents and tour operators and report to this House on the issue on Committee Stage. I am satisfied that the adoption of these amendments by the House will benefit the overall quality and effectiveness of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to record my deep appreciation of the insurance industry, both the intermediaries and the industry itself, for the constructive and co-operative manner in which they have approached the development of the Bill. As a group, they have recognised the need for an improved regulatory regime as well as the various other shortcomings of the industry in so far as consumer information and protection are concerned. As a result of this co-ordinated and co-operative approach, I am convinced that this legislation will enhance the standing of the insurance industry in the eyes of the public and will help to repair a reputation somewhat tarnished by a small number of devious operators in recent years.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, the staff and all the Members who spoke today as well as my excellent officials for the co-operation afforded to <Col N="403" /> me in this matter. I look forward to returning to conclude the business on Committee and Report Stages as soon as the House orders same.</P>

      <P>I wish to explain that we had sought to have a Minister from the Department of Foreign Affairs to come before the House to take statements on the Middle East. Neither the Minister nor the Minister of State from that Department was able to be present but I was told that a Minister of State from another Department would attend. It appears that the Minister of State who was due to attend has been delayed in the Dáil due to a disruption of business which occurred there this morning.</P>
      <P>I have been trying to resolve this problem for the past 90 minutes and the most recent telephone call I received indicated that there is no Minister of State available at present. I can only be guided by the House in either postponing the taking of statements until another day or proceeding without a Minister of State and sending the transcript of the debate to the Department of Foreign Affairs. The position is unsatisfactory and I apologise for the inconvenience caused.</P>

      <P>The Government Chief Whip has my complete sympathy and anything I have to say is no reflection on him. This is absolutely outrageous and intolerable. The Leader of the House should be here personally to answer for what has happened because it is his job to organise business and ensure that Government Ministers are present. The Minister from the relevant Department should be present. There have been occasions in the past when Ministers of State from other Departments attended but the fact that not one Minister of State is available is a terrible reflection on the way in which business is organised. It is also a reflection on the House.</P>
      <P>I do not believe we should proceed with the debate. Members did not come to the House to speak and have a transcript sent to the relevant Minister, they came here to put their concerns to the Minister and have him listen to them and provide answers. While I know that my colleagues have gone to some trouble to prepare their contributions, I do not believe that we should take this debate without a Minister being present. We should also be provided with an explanation by the people responsible for this debacle.</P>

I was witness in the ante room to their desperate attempts to produce a Minister. On the other hand, this arose quickly. I was not aware of it yesterday. I missed it when the Leader said, almost as an aside, that we would have a debate today, and it was on the Order of Business this morning that it registered with me that we were to have this debate.</P>
      <P>I would be prepared to proceed because there is a situation in the Middle East. Having been alerted this morning to the fact that there was to be a debate on the situation, I have spent the past few hours thinking about it and talking to people to obtain briefings of various types. The absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or someone from that Department is regrettable. It is a charade to have a Minister of State from a different Department take the debate because he or she will sit there like a stuffed pheasant, bored as blazes and not involved in a key way.

It is just that one must ask how he or she can be interested given the way business is organised. How can a Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government be reasonably expected to be engaged? That is not a slur on him or her and I do not mean any. The position is unfair to him or her and all that will happen is that the debate will be transferred through him or her. He or she will be the messenger boy or girl of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs was present last night for a debate on Tibet. However, in the absence of that Minister or the Minister of State, it is just as efficient, although regrettable, to hold the debate. After all, they are statements.

We could all adjourn to the bar and have a chat among ourselves and send a letter to the Minister for all the notice that will be taken of what is said. I regret to say that but it is true. <Col N="405" /> It is an insult to the House that no Minister, not even a Minister of State, is present. It would be better were either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister of State at that Department present. I would even accept another Minister of State.

The reason for this is what I perceived as a wrong which was done to a group of people in the Middle East who had the right of tenure and involvement and who had been in the area for many years.</P>
      <P>There is no point in going back in history to outline why the Balfour Declaration was made and why, before and during the Second World War, there was a pogrom against the Jews in Europe. There is no doubt that what happened in Europe in the last century is the cause of what is now happening in the Middle East.</P>
      <P>For millennia people of different religions and no religion lived in Palestine without very many problems, other than the normal problems which occur in any society. Many people do not realise or want to acknowledge that Israel is one of three states in the world set up by UN vote. Since it was set up in this way I would expect it to accept the rules, regulations and responsibilities attached to this. However, Israel has not accepted this responsibility. Rather it has tried at all times to eliminate the Palestinians from the land they originally lived in. People think this conflict is centuries old or that it dates back to biblical times. However, this is not true; it concerns the ownership of land and the elimination of people from their own land.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> About five years ago, when an estate in Tipperary was being taken over, I was visited by a group of people in Kilkenny who were very militant in saying they were the original owners of the estate. The group produced maps, bills and various other documents, with the claim to ownership going back 500 years. These people from Ballingarry, Thurles and Clonmel were criticising the fact that the State was going to allow the takeover of this land. In Palestine the situation dates back to the 1940s. Before he died, I brought my father to where he came from but we were unsuccessful in our attempt to find exactly where he was born. He was very upset by the visit and I was also upset.</P>
    <P>In the Middle East the proposal is peace for land, or land for peace, and anybody would suggest that as the way forward. However, the Israelis have not agreed this is the way forward.</P>
    <P>I have kept my mouth closed in the House for the past two or three years about what I wanted to say on the Middle East process as I felt it was best to leave the Israelis and Palestinians to solve their own problems. Of course their problems were being dictated to by the intervention or help of the United States. Ireland and the US have a huge affinity. A huge number of people in the US will vote on 7 November, not on the issue of Palestine but for a president whom they think will give them what they want. Nevertheless, the US is the broker in the equation between the Israelis and Palestinians, and I understand another invitation has been issued to President Barak and Yasser Arafat to again go to the US to discuss a peaceful resolution of the situation. I do not think this can work. Europeans should have a bigger say in what happens in the area.</P>
    <P>Ireland should have a greater say in what happens in that area given that it is much closer to the region than the Americans. We have a trade relationship with Israel which is beneficial to both Europe and Israel. Trade relations should not be open-ended to the extent that the Israelis have tried in every way possible to break the spirit of the agreement. They will not allow European involvement because they believe Europe is more pro-Palestinian than the current power brokers in the area, the Americans.</P>
    <P>Might is right in the Middle East at present, particularly on the Israeli side. They say they must respond with bullets when stones are thrown and that Chairman Arafat is putting the children of Palestine in front of the bullets. I would not like to have grown up in two generations of poverty and deprivation while living in Gaza or any of the other territories. It is not very nice to have to be in home at 8 p.m. and not be able to leave between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m., when one's parent may have to queue in a cattle pen to go to work in a menial job in Israel. If one misses the bus when returning home, one may be shot because of being in Israel illegally at night. These children grow up in an atmosphere of deprivation <Col N="408" /> and become adults much sooner than children who live in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I abhor the fact that Israeli children were in the army and had guns on their backs at the age of 15 or 16. Many years ago in Gaza, I saw children playing cowboys and Indians, like normal children, but they had real guns. There is no point my getting up here as a pro-Palestinian and saying we can solve the problems of the region in this House. That will not happen. Reasonable people must begin to talk. If the Israelis backed off just 200 to 300 metres in certain areas in Gaza and the West Bank, many problems would be resolved. Instead they are trying to persuade Ariel Sharon to take part in a government of national reunification.</P>
    <P>I have been visiting the Lebanon for many years. When Mr. Sharon was head of the invasion troops going into the Lebanon in 1982, while thousands of people in Sabra and Shatila were being killed, he said he was wiping his hands of the problem and that the Christians were killing them. The intention to bring this man back into Government is not acceptable internationally or from a human rights perspective. While Mr. Sharon paid a private visit to the Temple Mount, he was accompanied by 1,500 Israeli soldiers. This was 500 more than the Pope had when he visited the area. Perhaps the Pope is not as important as Mr. Sharon. Mr. Sharon was contacted from Mr. Barak's home, in the presence of very senior Palestinian people, and asked not to make that visit, yet this man is now being asked to go into government with Mr. Barak.</P>
    <P>There is no point pretending this problem will be resolved easily. Everyone acknowledges the right of the Israelis to live in their own country in peace and harmony, but they must live in peace and harmony with their neighbours. People think of settlements as little encampments in various places. These settlements are major cities. At one time when I was in Israel, I saw a convoy of 50 or 60 buses filled with émigrés from Russia being brought around Israel to places where they might &ldquo;settle&rdquo;. These people did not want to be placed in the middle of a Palestinian area but they were forced to go where they got cheap houses. Approximately 25% of houses built in the settlements were never occupied.</P>
    <P>I want to see peace in this region and to see the Israelis and Palestinians live together. This will not happen unless might and right can meet in the middle. There is no doubt that Mr. Barak, together with the Americans, can bring about this peace. Europeans, including Ireland, should seek an equitable solution to this problem which will not be solved unless there is give and take on both sides. Young Palestinians are now doing all the taking, while Israeli might is doing all the giving.</P>
    <P>Anyone who believes the Israelis do not have the might to win the war is a fool. They have the might. They can win the war but they can never win the hearts and minds of the people with <Col N="409" /> whom they will have to live for the next thousand years. These are the Ashkenasic and Sephardic Jews. The Ashkenasim were forced from eastern Europe by Britain and Germany to a difficult land. They take the Bible as an absolute. Nothing is absolute and the Israelis will have to live with the Palestinians for the remainder of the next millennium.</P>
    <P>Unless both sides come together, we will be discussing this issue for the next 25, 35 or 40 years. In the meantime, thousands of people will be killed in an effort by a nation created by the United Nations to dominate a nation which existed for millennia.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for stepping into the breach. However, I protest at the way the House has been treated and at the fact that the debate could not begin at the appointed time.</P>
      <P>We have recently read headlines referring to clashes in Jerusalem and to peace hanging in the balance. The Middle East presents a depressing news item at this time and we are a far cry from the days of the Oslo agreement in 1993 when we thought the formula to achieve peace had been found. Since then there has been so much hope but recent events make one realise how easy it is to destroy peace and how difficult it is to build it up.</P>
      <P>There are parallels in our own country. We should not be surprised to see people who face each other with daggers drawn. We need only look 100 miles up the road at what has been going on in our own country. Thankfully, we believe we have found a solution to our problem but the situation remains on the brink. We should not be surprised at the enormous difficulties encountered by those who are trying to achieve peace.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago I stood in the Holocaust museum in Berlin. Although there is no art in this wonderful building yet, it is a wonderful monument. I reflected on what I had read about the setting up of the Israeli state in 1948 and the determination of the great leaders of that time. One of these was Golda Meir, whose autobiography I read some years ago. It is easy to empathise with the hopes and dreams of those people, particularly when we consider the Holocaust and the great suffering of the Jewish people.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan has referred to the other side of the story. The displacement of many of the Arab peoples to different parts of the world and to a disparate foundling Palestinian state brought its own human tragedy and suffering. There has been huge suffering on both sides and a great depth of passion has been ingrained in people over many years, exactly as has been the case in Ireland. It is difficult to deal with these issues because emotions run high and it is difficult to stand back and be objective. Pictures of helicopter gun ships and the killing of children tug at the heart strings. People in the Arab world speak of child martyrs and it is difficult to broker peace in such an atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> It is no harm to remind ourselves of the hopeful times of the Oslo agreement and the multilateral conference in Madrid. There was talk in Madrid of resolving the difficulties between Israel and its Arab neighbours and of dealing with arms control and economic development. Those two issues remain to be dealt with and we should be dealing with them. It is right to look to the EU in this regard. Who is selling the arms to Israel and its neighbouring states? We could look to our neighbour, Britain. Who is showing up this aspect of the problem? We must ask who benefits from war. We should be very critical of the sale of arms. We are unique in being able to point the finger at other countries in this regard. In many others instances we cannot afford to do this. What is the effect of the arms race? It is the killing of little children on both sides. We know all too well in Ireland that no one is safe from the bullet or the bomb.</P>
    <P>The subsequent Oslo agreement, the concessions made, the recognition of the PLO by Israel, the acceptance of land for peace by Israel and the recognition of Israel by the PLO were tremendous achievements. We have followed the ups and downs of the peace process since then.</P>
    <P>Senators Lanigan and Norris are more familiar than I with the Middle East. My interest stems from the fact that my late father was one of the first Irish observers in Lebanon in 1958. As a young child I saw my father go with great hope of what he could give as a peacemaker and we are still talking about the possibility of peace. There have been great achievements and we must pay tribute to the people who have been prepared to risk their political careers and their lives in the thrust for peace in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for President Arafat who seems to be embracing the more fundamental elements of Hamas. How can we rescue him from that? We are alarmed that Mr. Sharon is in Government with Prime Minister Barak and we reflect on the inflammatory visit to Jerusalem. How can we alleviate that situation? We should let the United States act as a broker if that can provide a forum for peace. One must never stop trying in the cause of peace. It is too easy to give in to the people of violence and it is something we must never do. We have not done it in our own country. There are many people in the Middle East who will not allow that to happen and I hope they will hold sway.</P>
    <P>It is good to discuss these issues in order to illustrate the depth of feeling in this country about them. We do not have answers. We can only facilitate the efforts for peace. We must do this within the context of the European Union. We must support those who bring forward peace initiatives.</P>
    <P>It is dreadful to read that 131 lives have been lost. These people lost their lives because there is no peace agreement in place. The fact that most were Palestinians indicates the might of the State of Israel. The moderation shown at the recent summit of Arab leaders is to be welcomed. I hope <Col N="411" /> it will be a further incentive to the Palestinian people to place their trust in their leaders and encourage them to come back to the table to seek a peaceful resolution so that they and their children can live in peace and no more children will have to die.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very difficult debate for any of us who feels strongly about and has connections in this region. I offer my sympathy and I am sure that of the House to the people of Israel and the people of Palestine, both of whom have suffered in this appalling situation. The historical perspective has been referred to and I am glad to say that this is a more tempered debate than others in which I have taken part in this House. I am not sure how useful it is to go back over all the historical perspective because it is a tangled skein; there are rights on both sides. There are also very clear parallels with the situation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Europe should have a role in this issue for a number of reasons. I applaud President Clinton who has worked extremely hard from a position of principle and conviction, but I am not sure that any more can be done from that angle for a number of reasons. He is coming to the end of his presidency and the future in America is a little obscure in electoral terms and by one side he is not regarded as neutral. There is no question that Palestinians regard him as partisan in the cause of Israel. This casts certain questions over the role of America.</P>
      <P>We owe it to the people in the region to become properly involved because we did solve certain of our problems. For this reason not only should we seek to have a greater degree of political involvement &ndash; I welcome the proposed visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to the area &ndash; we ought to be prepared to pay for it. One does not get a seat at a table for nothing. This is critical because one of the unresolved problems is the situation of Palestinian refugees. It is not practical to imagine that they can all physically go back. It is very sad, but it is a fact; it is not possible. I was very interested in watching Faisal Husseini on television last night. If one decoded it, that was more or less what he was saying. He was saying, &ldquo;Look at the Jewish people; how many of them are there? Even with the law of return, only a proportion will come back to Israel.&rdquo;. It is not feasible or practical, therefore, for all the Palestinians to go back. The Palestinian negotiators know this too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can one distress a people such as this without any form of compensation? Those involved in the distress are not just the people who established the State of Israel, they are the Europeans as well. There is a clear moral obligation on the European Union, particularly if it wishes to have a seat at this table, to be involved meaningfully in the negotiations. The price ticket should be involvement in the compensation of Arab refugees. Even from a practical point of view, it is <Col N="412" /> necessary because if one has a large discontented and disadvantaged group, it is a recipe for trouble. The two peoples in the area have to live together, share things and resolve the problems. This is difficult, particularly in a polarised situation.</P>
    <P>I will not go back over the whole historical perspective, but I was very sad, not surprised, to see a couple of reports in <i>The Irish Times </i>today, the first of which is by Deaglán de Bréadún under the heading, &ldquo;Palestinians now haunt the international conscience as Jews once did&rdquo;, in which he quotes a very interesting man, Professor Israel Shahak, a survivor of Belsen concentration camp, from which he was released when he was 13 years old. He is a highly intelligent man and thinks that world public opinion will cut no ice with the Israelis: &ldquo;They have the US on their side. They can disregard public opinion.&rdquo;  As a strong friend and supporter of Israel, I caution against that approach. In the long term it is highly dangerous to disregard public opinion. This, again, raises a question mark about US as opposed to European intervention.</P>
    <P>Directly underneath there is an article which shows how widely this conflagration of opinion has spread. There is a quotation from the imam of a mosque near Barcelona who is reported as saying, &ldquo;Hitler realised that the Jews were taking all Germany's wealth. He wasn't mad, nor was he stupid. He merely administered insecticide on the [Jewish] worms so that the German plant could flourish&rdquo;. That is very dangerous. We need to try to take the temperature down and understand the difficulties in the situation.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that we have in the Visitors' Gallery two distinguished people, Dr. Yousef Allan, from the Palestinian side, and Mr. Boaz Rodkin, from the Israeli embassy. I express my admiration for both teams in the recent negotiations because they both took huge risks. I hope they will continue to pursue the difficult road of peace. It is extraordinary to look at what Prime Minister Barak was prepared to do. He was virtually committing political suicide within his own context by going as far as he did. It seemed that there was a real chance that they were within a hair's breadth of moving much farther forward towards a resolution in the weeks before the explosion. That is the route that must be travelled.</P>
    <P>There is no question or doubt that there are parallels with this country. One of the two principal and appalling incidents which helped to inflame public opinion was the shooting of a 12 year old boy, which was inexplicable. There must be a proper impartial inquiry. There are certain clear dangers from the Israeli side because if a report comes out that is critical of Israel, it could be used as further fuel to the flames, especially where the Palestinian side appears to have uncorked the bottle and let the genie out, especially in terms of the release of the Hamas bombers. That was extremely regrettable, but we <Col N="413" /> must honourably, honestly and openly face the truth.</P>
    <P>I was in Israel at the time this was going on in the immediate aftermath of Sharon's visit. Although a friend of Israel, I regarded that visit as provocative. There was no other word and no excuse for it. With his background, it was particularly dangerous. Ariel Sharon was, however, strongly criticised by the report produced by Israel after Sabra and Chatila and I have yet to see anything like it on the other side. There is a degree of criticism which places persons like myself in a great difficulty because if one tries to take a balanced position when the other side is not prepared to be balanced, one can appear to be treacherous towards the very people one wants to help towards a broader view of the situation. Unfortunately, that is a risk I have to take as a result of my experience in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>When I got home to Jerusalem from a visit to Cyprus this was all starting off. Sharon had made his visit. One of the things we looked at was Palestine and Bethlehem television. The outrage of the Palestinian people is understandable, but I found the broadcast absolutely blood curdling. It seemed to be specifically and deliberately edited so as not to create conditions of peace or to pull people back. It is almost as if a deliberate tactical decision had been taken to use this provocation &ndash; and I agree it is provocation &ndash; in order to politically advance the situation. That is very dangerous.</P>
    <P>People ask if Arafat cannot control his people and Barak cannot control the police. At a certain stage, when the situation becomes particularly inflamed, they cannot. Nobody could, in my opinion. I listened to people being interviewed in Ramallah and so on and they were asked that question but they said no. They said that this is the second <i>intifada</i>, that it was their struggle. Once it is let out, it is very difficult to put back in. The only way is to slowly create a feeling of investment in the country by the people who feel most disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>As I said, there were direct parallels to this country. There was the shooting of a large number of people. We had that on Bloody Sunday. On the other side, there was the appalling murder of the two soldiers. We had that with the two British Army people who wandered into Milltown cemetery. Two savage events happened here exactly as they happened in Israel and Palestine but the difference is the disproportionate response on both sides. We have to advise our friends on both sides to try to pull back, just like in the North of Ireland. There is a conflict of culture.</P>
    <P>I know a family who live near Bethlehem, a most delightful family. They are friends of ours. They are farmers and it is a joy to see the farm that these Palestinian people occupy because of the care of the land, the meticulous well being of the animals, the family structure and all of that. They have been there for many generations but because of the way in which land tenure was held <Col N="414" /> by the Palestinians, they do not perhaps have all the legal documentation that the Israeli state requires. On the other hand, there is the Israeli modern, aggressive, pushy, feeling for a new state and infrastructure and in the middle of this land, some of the good agricultural land will be taken over by a road junction. In my experience that is an image of the real basis of a lot of the conflict and I do not see how it will be resolved if the people do not meet not just at the top but also as ordinary people. That is essential and it needs movement on both sides.</P>
    <P>I listened to a woman settler being interviewed from one of the new settlements and I thought what was said from both sides was very sad. She said that when the settlement was being built, she had some contact with the Palestinians buying fruit and vegetables. After that there was no contact. She was asked if she ever had a Palestinian in her home and she said, &ldquo;I don't think so. What for? We do not speak the language&rdquo;. It is extraordinary that people who are living so intimately together have so little understanding of each other and my hope is that there will be greater understanding between these two peoples. This will not be helped on the one hand by the release of the Hamas bombers, which was a highly dangerous thing to do, or on the other by the clear and continuing provocation by the settlers. The most difficult and thorny point for the Israelis is the settlers and again we have a parallel here. The most dangerous complicating factor in the Irish situation is represented by the people in New York and Boston whose grandparents left this country in tragic circumstances during the Famine and who, through the last two generations, have cherished and fostered a dream which has festered into a nightmare so that we now have people like Martin Galvin fundraising for the Real IRA.</P>
    <P>With regard to the settlers, that will be an exceedingly difficult problem for the Israeli Administration to handle but at least it was addressed in the recent negotiations. Some of the settlements will have to be dismantled. It is difficult for me to say that from this side but it is something that the realists on the Israeli side will accept.</P>
    <P>Jerusalem is the other major problem. It will have to be shared, and it looked to me as if Mr. Barak was moving dangerously close to that position. Again I applaud his extraordinary courage. He presented an opportunity and it is a source of immense regret that this was thrown away. I wish there had been more courage on the other side as Abba Eban, who was a very moderate and wise Foreign Minister of Israel, said that the Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. There was an opportunity which required enormous courage on both parts and I hope there will not be a further failure of courage on either side. That is why I say, although I am a friend of Israel, that there should be balance in the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> One can understand some of the difficulties of the Palestinians with regard to the settlements. If one looks at the map of Israel and the way in which settlements are dispersed throughout the land, it increases our understanding of the complexity of the situation. I will give one further example. I seem to be giving many examples of what I hope is a moderate view. A number of casualties have been created because the Arab farmers are going out to pick the olive crop. This is not just a tourist thing for the Arabs; it is part of their livelihood and they are easily attacked by the settlers. I believe the settlers must be confronted. I heard on the radio about a situation which arose recently in Nablus where a spokesman for the settlers outlined an attack on a group near Nablus in which, regrettably, a rabbi was shot dead. It was dangerous and irresponsible of those settlers to go there. We must look at the situation where the clear view of the Israeli army is overridden apparently further down the command chain.</P>
    <P>I do not have a final solution; I do not think anybody in this House has one. I am very glad that at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs the other day, the Israeli Ambassador, Mr. Sofer, and Dr. Allan, were still able to exchange views in a civilised way. I commend both of them and I want to record that as difficult as it has been, Mr. Sofer has consistently pushed the notion of peace. He was an adviser to Peres and Rabin. We know the difficulties. Rabin went for peace. He got shot as his reward. Sadat took the initiative in going to Jerusalem and he got shot. There are immense dangers. It is vital for us in Europe to support the doves on both sides, to support the people who will go for peace. It will be a long-term strategy because the people in that part of the world will have to learn about each other. They have to discover how to live together and it will not be easy. They were close to a solution. I hope that opportunity occurs again but on both sides, malign forces have been released.</P>
    <P>A policy of separation and of closure of the territory will not work. That will not be satisfactory. That is simply creating a type of apartheid that will explode. They must learn to live together. I wish the courageous people on both sides well.</P>
    <P>Leaving here a few weeks ago there was a demonstration outside &ndash; which is understandable because I remember what it was like here after Bloody Sunday when they burned down the British Embassy &ndash; and I understand the feelings of those people but some of the slogans worried me. One of them said, &ldquo;Jerusalem is Islamic&rdquo;. It is not. If it was, the situation would not be so complicated. It is much more complex than that.</P>
    <P>I was agonised by the 12 year old boy who was shown cowering behind his father. I understand the father gave an interview from the hospital during which he was distraught. Imagine a parent seeing the death of a 12 year old child. It beggars description. At the end of the interview, however, <Col N="416" /> in the tradition of somebody like Gordon Wilson who called for peace, that father appealed to both sides to turn against violence. That was carried in the international media, but it was cropped on Palestine TV. That was a pity, as it was an opportunity lost. Instead of sending out unremitting messages, understandable emotionally, people on both sides should think and encourage every possible effort towards peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator and I are very good friends and I will use that analogy to illustrate terminology in this context. When the Senator referred to a final solution, I could not help but reflect &ndash; this was evident on the occasions I visited the Middle East &ndash; that the sad reality is that on the Israeli side, whatever about our Palestinian colleagues, there is a deep mistrust of European involvement, although I fully support the Senator's view on Europeans having an input. The Israelis see themselves very much orientated towards the United States.</P>
      <P>I have tried to wrestle with my conscience on this issue regarding the Americans' role in the Middle East. Their portrayal as honest brokers sometimes reminds me of the early stages of the Northern Ireland conflict when the British were always very happy to refer to themselves as honest brokers while we on the Nationalist side would have had a view about the British Army being honest brokers in what was an extremely volatile environment.</P>
      <P>I am glad there is a recognition that there is a role for the European Community in all of this, but the key is not so much the Palestinians acknowledging and encouraging that, but the Israelis doing so, although one cannot blame them for not doing that. They have a very deep distrust of Europeans, especially of Germans for obvious historical reasons. They see America as their main guarantor of survival in the Middle East. If I were an Israeli &ndash; 60% of Israelis support the peace process, notwithstanding all that has been happening &ndash; living in Israel surrounded by a group of Arab countries, and I do not include the fledging Palestinian state, which know or care as much about democracy and democratic ideals as our dog at home, I would feel somewhat threatened as well. That is not acknowledged sometimes, perhaps because vital interests are at stake. The Americans are certainly not going to upset the Saudi Arabians who have one of the world's largest reservoirs of oil. I have often thought how different the situation would be if there was oil in Palestine but, unfortunately, there is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two sides are attempting to come to some sort of resolution. Like Senator Norris, I do not have an opinion to offer on a solution, but I wish <Col N="417" /> to make a point I raised earlier on the Order of Business, as I feel very strongly about it. We have witnessed continuing violence in the Middle East during recent weeks and the horror of the murders, most of which have been perpetrated by the Israeli defence forces &ndash; all one need do is check the statistics. I acknowledge the gruesome murder of the two reserve soldiers by a Palestinian mob. That cannot be justified under any circumstances. I am sure that young man who appeared at the window with his two hands covered in blood does not care one whit what we in far off Ireland think. I am sure he sees himself as being &ldquo;one of the chosen people&rdquo;, if I could use that term about the Palestinians, and that if he were to be shot or killed he would see himself as a martyr. That is a sad reflection on the culture of that part of the world, that there is such a glorying of killing, notwithstanding the fact that most of the murders have been committed against the Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>Throughout all of this, according to the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, which published a statement in the international media last week, more than 200 incidents of anti-Semitism have taken place in Western Europe since the start of this latest cycle of violence in the Middle East, the most recent of which occurred in London when a young man was attacked because of his religious background. We in Ireland have the high moral ground when it comes to condemning unequivocally and unambiguously anti-Semitic attacks on innocent people, not only because of the vileness of anti-Semitism but because we as a country do not have a history of racism or of deliberately targeting people because of their religion or point of view, notwithstanding the difficulties we face with illegal immigrants, refugees etc.</P>
    <P>I would like to think we are a civilised race and that most of western Europe is made up of civilised nations, but it is especially important because of the historical pall that hangs over anti-Semitism that we in the west take every opportunity to condemn outright these attacks. The Simon Wiesenthal Centre said it was somewhat ironic that in the midst of the welter of anti-Israeli motions passed at the United Nations not one country suggested there should be a motion condemning anti-Semitic attacks. There must be some balance.</P>
    <P>I am a student of the Second World War. I am as familiar as most people would be with the horrors of the Holocaust. I have visited the concentration camps. I can understand in a real sense the thinking and psyche of many Israelis in their attitude towards Europe. What sort of message is it sending if, on the one hand, the European Union and those participating in debates of this nature call for a more inclusive dialogue with European countries if, on the other hand, Europe remains silent when Israelis see some of their co-religionists &ndash; 200 incidents in all &ndash; being attacked and do not utter one word of protest? When everybody remained silent in the 1930s six <Col N="418" /> million Jews were killed. I will not labour the point, but I feel strongly about it.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland, who have a very proud record of defending human rights and have stood with the Palestinian people when it was unpopular to do so, have a right and an obligation to take the initiative in this regard. I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs will reflect on these comments and consult his European colleagues. I hope the outcome of such consultations might be some form of public condemnation of the attacks being perpetrated on European citizens because of their religion.</P>
    <P>In the narrow context of the Middle East, I endorse fully what Senator Norris has said about Jerusalem. That is one of the key problems in this debate. Jerusalem does not belong to the Muslim or the Arab people, no more than it belongs to the Jews. It belongs to all of us. From when I was a small child, even when I had no appreciation of the latent problems of the Middle East, I had read and absorbed that Jerusalem was an open city for all religions, was owned by all of us and treated with equal reverence by us. If there could be a change in the mindset in that regard, that might help. That is not to detract from the political reality that Palestinians see Jerusalem as the capital of a fledging state. The world held its breath for a brief moment some months ago when it seemed as if Israeli Prime Minister Barak and Palestinian President Arafat had agreed on some sort of <i>modus vivendi</i> for a way forward on Jerusalem. For a brief moment it seemed possible that both tribes could accept Jerusalem as a united and divided city in a complex political arrangement. The fact that they came so close to it means they can revisit it.</P>
    <P>While the Palestinian people yearn for statehood and all the benefits it would bring, I hope there will be general recognition that the political situation in Israel is now extremely volatile. We are used to trapeze acts by politicians. Currently David Trimble is engaged in another trapeze act in Northern Ireland in an effort to deal with those who are against him in the Unionist Council. I hope he succeeds. Ehud Barak faces an opposition majority. When he goes before the Knesset early next week he will be able to count on only 30 votes in the 120 seat chamber. That is not a ringing endorsement of a Prime Minister who is unquestionably seeking a peaceful resolution of this problem. That is a real concern and I hope the Palestinian leadership will acknowledge the political difficulties facing Barak.</P>
    <P>There is a second worrying element, if one is to accept the news reports from the Middle East. The Israeli defence forces, while not exactly out of control, are not under the same command culture that was traditionally the case. In recent years the route to success in Israeli society is not, as heretofore, membership of the armed forces but through other means. Although Barak was a member of the special forces and was involved in a number of well publicised episodes during that time, the understanding is that those who are now <Col N="419" /> in control of the Israeli army are not so much outside political control but are flouting it. If that is the case and if there is evidence to that effect, it would explain why such extreme measures were taken by the Israeli defence forces against stone throwing Palestinians.</P>
    <P>It is alleged, for example, that they have been utilising silent sniper fire against Palestinians in Ramallah and are using a type of bullet which is not only smokeless, allowing the sniper to remain hidden, but which mushrooms on entering the body, turns and, like the dumdum bullet, tears out the internal organs to such an extent that a Palestinian doctor was quoted last week as saying it was the first time he had encountered the damage done by this weaponry in all his years of dealing with volatile militaristic episodes. If that is the case, there are questions to be answered by the Israeli military leadership. Why is it using a hammer to crack a nut? Why is it doing what we have seen repeatedly during military engagements in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years, using excessive force? The army of any country, particularly a democracy &ndash; Israel is a democracy &ndash; is responsible to its political masters.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed at the wording of the statement that emerged from President Clinton at Sharm-el-Sheikh. On closer examination, it appeared to be the language of somebody who was on the one hand attempting to portray himself as an honest broker but on the other was attempting to ensure that the Israeli vote on 5 November in America would be secure for Vice-President Al Gore. It was distasteful to see the manner in which senior politicians in various Senate election campaigns in the United States &ndash; I am thinking of one well known campaign in which we have a particular interest &ndash; were falling over themselves in front of American-Israeli audiences to show their credentials as true friends of Israel. That does not suggest honest brokerage. It suggests what we have seen many examples of in America and other countries, political expediency taking over from basic decency and humanity.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Palestinian people are aware of the obstacles they face trying to get their message heard above the clamour from the American-Israeli lobby. However, that is the political reality they have had to live with, as we in Europe have had to live with it. It is the main reason the Israeli political leadership has traditionally not been interested in or concerned by what Europe thinks. However, in view of recent statements by Israeli politicians, particularly following Sharm-el-Sheikh, I hope there might be a role for Europe and I like to think we could contribute something to the resolution of the problem. It would not, therefore, simply be seen by the Palestinians and the wider Arab community as a case of America attempting to shore up its vital interests in the Middle East. The Europeans, with no agenda other than an honest desire for a resol<Col N="420" /> ution of this problem, could act as honest brokers. If Europeans achieved nothing more than getting their foot in the door in the wider debate taking place between Israel and Palestine and the Arab world, that would be a major achievement.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs, given the position we hold with the Palestinians and, to a lesser extent, with the Israelis, to act. Ireland is seen as a non-aligned country with no baggage. We could act in concert with our European partners to formulate some way of getting involved in the negotiations that might lead to what everybody wants, peace and prosperity for all the people in the region, security for Israel and nationhood for Palestine.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowen regrets that he cannot be present for this debate. I thank the Senators who have contributed for their informed comments.</P>
      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the crisis in the Middle East. It has already taken an appalling toll of life and put in jeopardy the Middle East peace process in which so many hopes have been placed. It poses a threat to the stability of the region. The Minister has extended his deepest sympathy to the families of all those who have been killed and injured.</P>
      <P>What has happened in the Palestinian territories and Israel is tragic. Just at the moment when the parties were closer to an agreement than they have ever been, the essential basis for peace &ndash; trust and confidence &ndash; has been seriously undermined. Instead, anger and frustration stemming from the failure of each side to understand the problems of the other has boiled over, resulting in the horrors we have witnessed.</P>
      <P>Intensive diplomatic efforts have been made to bring the crisis to an end. I pay tribute in particular to the efforts of President Clinton and President Mubarak, together with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and other leaders who have, in recent days, tried to save the peace process. We know from our own experience of building peace in Northern Ireland that there is no other way forward.</P>
      <P>The immediate cause of the crisis was the ill advised and provocative visit by Mr. Ariel Sharon to the Temple Mount, or Haram-al-Sharif, in the old city of Jerusalem. This site, holy to both Moslems and Jews, is at the heart of the dispute over the future status of Jerusalem, which is one of the most difficult and sensitive issues remaining to be resolved in the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Sharon's visit gave rise to the outraged reaction by Palestinian demonstrators, which in turn led to the excessive reaction by the Israeli military. Further widespread protests and incidents followed, resulting in countless injuries and over 100 deaths, including many children, and the <Col N="421" /> brutal murder of two Israeli soldiers in a police station in Ramallah.</P>
    <P>The Government has made clear its position. We deplore all acts of violence. We have called on both sides to exercise the utmost restraint and to do all in their power to avoid further escalation. We have underlined the need for both sides to act quickly to reach agreement in the Middle East peace process and to avert the danger that this conflict might extend further. The objective must remain the achievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East, which must necessarily recognise both Israel's right to live in peace and security and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>In our own bilateral contacts within the past two weeks, we have strongly put forward our views. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, recently met with the Palestinian Minister for Planning and International Co-operation in Dublin, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, met with the Israeli Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, also in Dublin. Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, met in Leinster House with Minister Rabbi Michael Melchior, a special emissary of Prime Minister Barak, and encouraged him to join with the Palestinians in rebuilding trust and confidence, mutual respect, parity of esteem and a spirit of partnership. The Minister described our experience in these islands in developing a win-win approach. Stressing the need for maximum restraint, he assured him of our support for all the efforts to restore calm and to find a peaceful solution. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, also reminded him of the very concrete contribution we have made to peace in the region through our participation in UN peacekeeping in Lebanon, where the safety of our troops is of paramount concern.</P>
    <P>We have also fully supported the European Union in its ongoing efforts to defuse the crisis. The informal European Council meeting in Biarritz last weekend called for an immediate end to all violence and urged all parties to demonstrate political courage and responsibility, so that reason and tolerance might prevail over fear, hatred and extremism before the point of no return was reached. The European Union has been active in encouraging the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to come together and work for a ceasefire. President Arafat, President Chirac, Prime Minister Barak and US Secretary of State Albright met in Paris in an effort to find a solution. The Union's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, participated in the summit at Sharm-el-Sheikh in Egypt earlier this week.</P>
    <P>The meeting at Sharm-el-Sheikh produced a number of agreements on measures to halt the violence. The major points agreed were that, first, both sides are to issue statements unequivocally calling for an end to violence and to take immediate concrete measures to eliminate points of fric<Col N="422" /> tion. These include withdrawal of Israeli forces to positions they had occupied before the outbreak of disturbances, an end to the closure of Palestinian territories and the reopening of Gaza airport, as well as renewal of security co-operation between the two sides. Second, the United States, together with the Israelis and the Palestinians and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, will establish a fact finding committee to look into the events of the past weeks. Third, the United States will consult with the parties in the next two weeks on how to resume the peace negotiations leading to a permanent settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</P>
    <P>We appeal to the parties, who have demonstrated their sense of responsibility at this critical moment, to implement these decisions without delay. The two essential aims will be to end the violence and to restore at least a working measure of confidence. This will require openness and transparency on all sides in implementing the measures. Some of these measures are already being put in place. Reports overnight suggest that the first signs of easing of tension are appearing. However, fears of renewed violence persist, and developments over the next few days will be of crucial importance.</P>
    <P>The General Assembly of the United Nations has begun debating the crisis. On Saturday, Arab leaders will be meeting in Cairo for their first summit in four years. Their discussions will focus on the crisis and the ways in which a consensus approach can be developed. Later this month, the Israeli Parliament will resume and it, too, will be focusing its attention on the grave situation now facing the Israeli Government and people.</P>
    <P>The first priority, as agreed at Sharm-el-Sheikh, must be to end the violence. This, however, will not be enough &ndash; the immediate causes and effects must be addressed. The underlying frustrations and anger have to be removed. If a cessation of violence is to take hold and remain in place, it will be essential to move quickly to rebuild trust and confidence. This will not be an easy task but it is a vital one. In this context, it is important that the investigation of what has happened will be as open, thorough and transparent as possible. We, with our EU partners, have supported a full international investigation. If this investigation is to help restore trust and confidence, it can only do so if it itself enjoys the trust and confidence of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I see a resumption of the peace negotiations as offering the only path out of the recurring cycle of bloodshed and suffering. Although the Camp David talks in July made considerable progress, it did not prove possible to overcome some major difficulties. Chief among these were the question of Palestinian refugees and, most intractable of all, the question of sovereignty in Jerusalem. This is the central issue. If it can be solved. everything else is likely to fall into place.</P>
    <P>At the core of this issue is sovereignty over the Jewish and Muslim holy places. Most difficult of <Col N="423" /> all is the problem of the Islamic Haram-al-Sharif and the Jewish Temple Mount, which share the same site. For both sides, this is more a religious and symbolic matter than a territorial one, and both are said to have adopted mutually exclusive positions. What seems clear is that no comprehensive solution is possible unless each side accords the other sovereignty over its own holy places, or accepts a form of international sovereignty.</P>
    <P>Ireland has long been sympathetic to the unqualified right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, which includes the option of a state, and is not subject to any veto. We would prefer to see this achieved through a negotiated solution. We believe, together with our partners in the European Union, that the establishment of a democratic, viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian state would be the best guarantee of Israel's security and acceptance as an equal partner in the region, an objective which we equally and fully support.</P>
    <P>Our contribution to this process was reflected earlier this year in the decision of the Government to establish a representative office in Ramallah and to increase our development co-operation activities in the Palestinian territories. Last week the Government allocated $100,000 to the Palestinians as a humanitarian response to the shortage of medical supplies in the West Bank.</P>
    <P>In parallel, we have sought to encourage the development of relations with Israel, both bilateral and in the framework of the EU, in a way that will also strengthen the basis for lasting peace and stability in the region.</P>
    <P>In ten weeks time, Ireland will be taking on the responsibilities of membership of the Security Council, and we are preparing ourselves for this task. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, expects that developments in the Middle East will continue to be one of the issues of major concern, and he will be anxious to ensure that, through our diplomatic network and his own contacts, we are in a position to make a constructive and effective contribution. He is currently looking at the possibilities for making an early visit to the Middle East.</P>
    <P>I spoke, at the beginning of my remarks, of the tragic nature of the crisis. It is particularly poignant that, in this millennial year, which should be a time of celebration and bringing peoples together, the holy places should have been the scenes of violence and death. That is regrettable when they should be places of peace and enjoyment. Thousands of pilgrims from this and many other countries have been visiting these holy places. Many of these visitors and pilgrims have been affected by the disturbances. However, I am glad to report that all Irish citizens in the region are safe. We have provided information and guidance to those planning to travel, as well as providing consular assistance, where necessary, to those already there.</P>
    <P>It is a source of particular sadness to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, which I am sure will be <Col N="424" /> shared by all in this House, that the land and place which are sacred to many millions who adhere to these major world religions &ndash; Christianity, Islam and Judaism &ndash; should have witnessed such hatred and violence. The Minister wishes to assure the House that he will continue to work together with our partners and friends in Europe, Israel and the Arab world to encourage a return to the path of peace which leads away from conflict towards genuine peace, security and justice for all the peoples of the Middle East.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also make every effort to ensure that this House and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs are kept fully informed and notified of the Government's activities to this end.</P>

At present, Mohober national school has a staffing level of a principal, plus one assistant teacher, a shared remedial teacher and a Breaking the Cycle co-ordinator. The school's current enrolment is 41 pupils. The Minister for Education and Science is aware that this school is currently accommodated in two prefabs and the school authorities have applied to his Department for a permanent building to replace these prefabs.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science's planning and building unit is currently assessing the long-term enrolment situation at the school. When this process has been completed further consideration will be given to the future accommodation needs of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister for Education and Science fully appreciates the concerns of the school authorities in this matter, the Senator will appreciate that there is a large number of school building projects on hand in his Department at present. Within this constraint, the Minister for Education and Science can assure the Senator that the application from the management authorities of <Col N="425" /> Mohober national school will be dealt with as speedily as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke recently about this matter regarding Longford-Westmeath general hospital to the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, who visited Mullingar early in September. On that day the Minister visited all the health institutions in the town. I thank the Minister for his generosity in giving of his time on that occasion. My concern relates to the decision of the Department of Health and Children not to accept the recommendations of the project team. On Wednesday, 27 September, in the conference room at Longford-Westmeath hospital, a document was produced which was the first feedback members of the board had received from the Department regarding the contents of phase 2B. In my opinion the omission of the four-bed intensive care unit, the six-bed coronary care unit, the medical rehabilitation unit &ndash; which was to have 15 beds initially, but had a plan to expand to 25 beds subsequently &ndash; along with the day hospital, the unit for child and adolescent psychiatry, and a day services unit, was ill advised.</P>
      <P>The day services unit is a new concept being introduced for the first time by the project team, including consultants and members of the board. This will consist of all-day services in future and will more than likely replace a number of pre-existing units in the hospital.</P>
      <P>I find it extremely difficult to understand a proposal to add another phase to the three phases of the development of Longford-Westmeath general hospital. First, we had phase 1, followed by phase 2A, and now phase 2B, which is an unsatisfactory building. My remarks concern that particular edifice in the context of the services to be provided therein. The medical rehabilitation unit is currently situated across the road in St. Mary's Hospital, Mullingar. The consultant geriatrician, Dr. Murphy, and his staff who do a marvellous job, find it difficult at times to convince people to go to this particular facility because it is a relic of a bygone era. In my opinion it is not suitable for such services, although a great service has been provided there over the years and is still being provided. Nevertheless, when people see the building they are somewhat reluctant to go there for physiotherapy and rehabilitation generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who will lose out are members of the most vulnerable sections of our society. The child and adolescent psychiatry service has been operating in unsatisfactory conditions ever since the appointment of Dr. Antoinette Dalton about eight years ago. Her counterpart in Laois-Offaly, who was appointed after Dr. Dalton, was provided with refurbished accommodation at Portlaoise general hospital. I do not begrudge the individual concerned those facilities, but the same <Col N="426" /> facilities should be made available in the Longford-Westmeath catchment area.</P>
    <P>The day care services unit is a new item on the agenda and not one that I wish to go into now. I feel strongly that the intensive care unit, the coronary care unit, the medical rehabilitation unit and facilities for child and adolescent psychiatry should be included in phase 2B. There was never a mention of further phases in the proposal which included phase 1, phase 2A and phase 2B. I would be very unhappy if a further phase was added to the existing three phases.</P>
    <P>Elderly patients in our catchment area are urgently in need of rehabilitation. We need an ICU with four beds and a coronary care unit with six beds. At present, we have 57 beds and when phase 2B is completed that number will increase to 93. Even with 57 beds we often have a bed occupancy of between 100 and 120. As the Minister of State knows, beds from other specialty facilities, and sometimes even maternity beds, are taken up by ordinary medical patients. This situation is far from satisfactory.</P>
    <P>When this phase is completed, the number of surgical beds at the hospital will increase from 53 to 62. They will be made up of the following, 31 seven-day beds, 19 five-day beds and 12 day beds.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider what I have said. The extra facilities are imperative, not alone for the clinicians and the ancillary staff who are providing medical services in Longford-Westmeath, but especially for the patients involved. The Minister should accept the recommendations of the project team for the completion of phase 2B at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, Mullingar.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Glynn for raising this issue on the Adjournment. I suppose it is &ldquo;To be, or not to be: that is the question&rdquo;. I am pleased to address the Seanad this evening on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, on the development of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, Mullingar. As the Senator will be aware, the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, approved the establishment of a project team in May 1999 to commence the planning of phase 2B development at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital. As is the normal procedure in major capital developments of this kind, the project team was asked to prepare a written brief for the development of phase 2B. The project team was requested to complete this work as expeditiously as possible having regard to the considerable detail involved in developing a brief of this kind and the consultation process that is central to the overall success of such a project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make the Senator aware that the Minister has not received the brief for this development. The Minister has been informed by the Midland Health Board that the project team received a draft brief at its meeting on 27 September 2000. The board is currently finalising this <Col N="427" /> brief and has indicated that it hopes to be in a position to submit it to the Department of Health and Children in the near future.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the brief for the development of phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, the Minister will ensure that the project moves to the next stage of planning without delay. This will entail the appointment of a design team which will prepare a development control plan to identify in detail the best options and final configurations for developing the whole hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister is looking forward to receiving the brief from the Midland Health Board for the phase 2B development of Longford-Westmeath <Col N="428" /> General Hospital and I am sure he will take on board everything the Senator said in regard to that development.</P>

I do not think it is unreasonable to ask that Mullingar be completed in three phases. Phase 2B is most essential.</P>
