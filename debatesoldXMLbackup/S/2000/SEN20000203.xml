      <P>I have notice from Senator Liam Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reason acute hospitals are being penalised for keeping patients too long, without due regard to the medical needs of the patients whose interests should be the priority consideration.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mary Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline his views on the fact that public meetings by an unregistered adoption agency are being held to facilitate inter-country adoptions for financial gain.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Margaret Cox of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make available an information and education video outlining the current national policy on waste management and indicating the advantages and disadvantages of thermal treatment, recycling and landfill.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected those of Senators Cosgrave and Henry and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Cox may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5. No. 1, motion re approval of terms of memorandum of understanding between Ireland and Israel, will be taken without debate. This motion will be referred for discussion to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and <Col N="210" /> Small Business. No. 2, motion re referral of the Civil Service user's network report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee and Finance and the Public Service, will be taken without debate. No. 4, statements on the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children on Attention Deficit Disorder in Ireland, will be taken between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 10 minutes and those of other Members not to exceed eight minutes. No. 5, motion re Appropriation Act, 1999 (resumed), will be taken between 1.30 p.m. and 3 p.m.. Business will be interrupted between 1 p.m. and 1.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. All of us are watching with a sense almost of helplessness as events unfold in Northern Ireland. All the great achievements of the past two to three years are in peril. It is not my intention to comment on why that is but I wish the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister and all others involved well as they try at this late stage to ascertain whether the good work of the past number of years can be salvaged. All of us believe that too much has happened and that we have travelled too far. Many people have changed their minds and moved a distance that none of us could have expected previously. All of us hope that all will not be lost. However, it is the biggest crisis since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and it is important that all of us wish those are trying at the last minute to salvage the Agreement well and hope that they will be successful.</P>
      <P>I refer to the invitation of distinguished visitors to address the House, a prerogative which has been available to us for some time but has been used very sparingly. Given that Seamus Heaney has received three great international awards over the past few weeks and has won the Nobel Prize for Literature, the House should invite him to address it under the distinguished visitors protocol. William Butler Yeats was a Member of the House in its earliest manifestation and Brian Friel, another great playwright, was a Member during our time. It would be fitting if we could honour Seamus Heaney by inviting him&mdash;</P>

      <P>I apologise, a Chathaoirligh. Will the Leader make Government time available to discuss the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998? It is a Private Members' Bill in the names of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Independents. It will be taken during Fine Gael's Private Members' time next week. Will the Leader consider making Government time available next week as a large number of Members on all sides want to contribute to the debate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the point raised by Senator Manning in December, the INTO had a big row with the Minister of Education in Northern Ireland, Mr. McGuinness, about the millennium holiday. Yesterday teachers, school children and their parents gathered outside Stormont demanding more resources for schools. The day before, farmers demonstrated outside Stormont demanding the same for their sector. It is great to see normal politics in operation throughout the whole island and it would be an awful shame if that were to cease. Having achieved unity of purpose among the people on the island, we must wish the negotiators well today, try to recognise the difficulties they face and hope we can retain what has been achieved.</P>
      <P>On another issue, I would like to bring it to the attention of the Leader of the Labour Party that his incoming general secretary is negotiating a new national agreement which I presume he will expect the Labour Party to endorse when he comes out of the negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I note Senator O'Toole did not mention that he is not the current general secretary; he is the incoming general secretary. We will wait and see what he has negotiated before the party leader supports it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will hardly support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly will not come into this House with a blanket recommendation, as Senator O'Toole did yesterday. There are certain items we would like to carefully tease out.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I called for a debate on Northern Ireland. Next week would be an appropriate time for such a debate because the crucial talks are taking place today, and perhaps tomorrow, and everything needs to be sorted out before the weekend is over in terms of what will happen. We all wish the negotiators well, particularly the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, in the work they are doing. It would be a terrible travesty of justice if at this time, just a few months before the completion of the Good Friday Agreement in all its manifestations, we fell at the last hurdle. We all hope that the negotiators can do something to bring about a solution to the problem and prevent the downfall of the Executive and a return to the crisis we have experienced over the years. I would like the debate extended to include other issues such as the Patten report, the de Chastelain report and the cross-Border arrangements on co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the issue of waste and litter. Kerbside, the only public and private initiative established to deal with waste as distinct from landfill, where approximately 90% of our waste is dumped, has been a financial dis<Col N="212" /> aster in that only £80 was made on the sale of any recyclable products. It cost £1.6 million to run Kerbside, and 40% or thereabouts of all kerbside waste went to landfill, so a major question arises in that regard. As a result of European Union directives we will now be responsible for incinerators and the disposal of hazardous waste and many questions arise from that. I ask the Leader of the House to arrange an early debate on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I also call for a debate on Northern Ireland. We hope such a debate will be held in the context of an Agreement and an Executive that is working in Northern Ireland. This is the most pessimistic period, however, since the Good Friday Agreement was signed and all we can do at this stage is encourage those who are still involved in the negotiations to continue their efforts. We are with them in spirit and, despite the fact that the situation looks bleak, we are hoping against hope that there can be some sort of positive outcome later today. We wish both the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach well in their negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to consider extending sections 6 and 20 of the 1972 VAT Act as suggested by the Irish charities reform group? The changes suggested by that group show a saving of £35 million to charities. When we consider that organisations are totally underfunded, that would be an ideal consideration. Will he also ask him to consider extending section 848 relief on personal donations? Such relief, which currently applies to Third World charities, if applied to domestic charities would bring in a sum in the region of £16 million at a cost of £2.5 million to the Exchequer. I hope the Leader will discuss those issues with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader draw to the attention of the Minister concerned a problem which has arisen in Britain and which I fear Ireland has not protected itself against? It relates to the enforcement of fines incurred under health and safety regulations by companies outside the State. I will explain the position briefly.</P>
      <P>A Swedish company was held responsible for the death of six people in Britain, but Britain has been unable to enforce the £1 million fine. It also appears that Britain will have to write-off a £500,000 fine imposed on an Australian company. I mention this in the context of an inability to enforce fines on companies outside the State. We have had experience in the past of having to enforce fines on Irish indigenous companies which are unenforceable outside the State. If our present laws do not permit us to take such action we should take steps to ensure we can do so in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also draw the attention of the House to the successful outcome of a conference on genetically modified foods in Montreal last week. Represen<Col N="213" /> tatives from over 100 countries were involved. That is an amazing achievement when one considers that when the Minister for the Environment and Local Government tried to get people from different sides of the argument around the table last year one group refused to talk to the other and the talks fell apart. The Minister, and perhaps the Minister for Agriculture and Food, may look again at this issue to see if we can achieve success. If it was possible to reach a successful outcome in Montreal taking 100 different viewpoints into consideration, surely it is possible to do so in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the bodies of some of the patriots executed during the War of Independence are still buried in the grounds of Mountjoy Prison. Included would be the revered and much respected Kevin Barry. It is only right that the mortal remains of such noble people should be re-interred in a much more appropriate place like Glasnevin cemetery, affording people the opportunity to visit their graves and pray for them. I hope the Leader will investigate that matter for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Leader managed to penetrate the impenetrable Government to find out what is happening to the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill? Telecommunications infrastructure is a necessary condition for continuing economic growth. Sitting on our hands will not make it happen. However difficult the issue, if we do not deal with it we will run up against a brick wall in terms of economic development.</P>
      <P>The joint committee on Trinity College Dublin and the universities seems to be proceeding interminably. The committee was set up to facilitate an institution which regards itself as particularly special. I am intrigued about who is paying the costs for this. Is the body which thinks itself so special paying for it or is it the taxpayers of Ireland who are paying? Perhaps you, a Chathaoirligh, could clarify that point for me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there Government proposals to change the university franchise to extend it to those currently disenfranchised and to restore some sort of proportionality to the distribution of seats between one university which has 100,000 graduates and another which has a mere 35,000 and is already very special without having such representations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello and Keogh in sending good wishes to the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister who are having very serious discussions in the United Kingdom today. An enormous amount of work has gone into bringing the talks to where they are today. Over the past number of months Northern Ireland as a <Col N="214" /> whole has been transformed, but what I did not realise until I visited it the week before last is that the changing fortunes in the strength of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the punt is having an enormous effect, particularly on all the businesses along the Border and for 25 miles away from it. Most businesses in the North are decimated. I join with everyone today in wishing them well and I hope there will be a breakthrough even at this late stage.</P>
      <P>I will convey Senator Manning's views to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges regarding his proposal to invite Seamus Heaney. As the Cathaoirleach has said, another formula for that is being considered.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning called for additional Government time to debate the Shannon River Council Bill. I will consult the leaders after the Order of Business. I have read the Bill and I realise that 95 per cent of it is a Brendan Daly and Michael O'Kennedy Bill. I am pretty certain that practically all sides of the House are in favour of it. It is a matter of convincing the Government that this should happen. I am being honest about this on a non-political basis.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello called for a debate on waste and litter and I will allow time for that. Senator Kett asked me to convey his serious concerns and those of the charitable organisations regarding section 848 relief on personal donations. He also referred to the 1972 Act, particularly sections 6 and 20. I will discuss this matter with the Minister for Finance and, if necessary, I will allow time to have it debated over the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>I can tell Senator Quinn that I will allow time for a debate on the implementation of fines, particularly in the area of health and safety. I will also convey his views to the Minister regarding the enforcement of fines on companies outside the State which are trading in the State through their related companies.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Murchú raised the important issue of the remains of Kevin Barry and of those people who are buried in Mountjoy Prison. I will discuss it with the Minister. I concur with the Senator that Kevin Barry should be buried in Glasnevin cemetery.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan inquired again about the Telecommunications Bill. I will bring it before the House when I am instructed to do so. With regard to his request for the Minister and the Government to look at the form of the Independent Senators' constituency, I can inform him that it is being closely looked at. Senator Ryan will have a difficulty because he may have to go back there at some stage. He should bear that in mind.  </P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and congratulate him on his appointment. I wish him every success in his new office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement to the Seanad on attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. I am aware that some Senators were members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children which published the report on attention deficit disorder in Ireland in April 1999. The primary aims of that report were to establish the need for new services, determine the level of services &ndash; medical, psychological and educational &ndash; throughout the country, and to investigate the extent of expertise in these services available for children and adults with ADHD. The study carried out by the committee had a number of objectives encompassing both the health and education services. These objectives varied from the needs of families with per<Col N="216" /> sons suffering from ADHD to the qualifications of those likely to encounter persons suffering from the condition, such as teachers and general practitioners. These core objectives formed the basis of the recommendations of the report.</P>
      <P>Attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were first recognised in the 1980s. Researchers disagree on the exact causes of the disorders. However, there are two aspects of the conditions which are more or less agreed upon: that it is an inherited condition and that the problem of the condition results from a subtle difference in the fine tuning of the brain. ADHD is an internationally recognised condition of brain dysfunction. It is a complicated and variable condition with many different presentations. The combination of inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive behaviour in children is recognised as a disorder when these behaviours are severe, developmentally inappropriate and impair functioning at home or at school. The numbers presenting to the health boards who require medical care would indicate that the prevalence rate is in line with the international norms at approximately 1% to 3% of the child population, and is based on criteria for the disorder contained in the ICD, the International Classification of Diseases.</P>
      <P>ADHD is a clinical diagnosis and there is no test for establishing the presence of the condition. As I have pointed, out the gradient of dysfunctional intensity can vary greatly and it is important to seek evidence of other psychological conditions, such as stress disorders and adjustment reactions, before a definitive diagnosis and treatment programme may be undertaken. A physical examination is useful in ruling out issues such as hearing problems or neurological conditions. Co-morbidity is present in as many as two-thirds of referred children with ADHD who may also have conduct disorder, mood disorder, anxiety disorder and substance abuse in adolescence.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the numbers presenting to the health service may not be representative of the level of children presenting with ADHD-like symptoms. Child psychiatrist teams are fully capable of differentiating the child who has a neurophysiological problem from the child whose restlessness is due to anxiety and, therefore, assessing whether medication is the preferred form of treatment or whether it may have more of an environmental cause, such as parent disharmony or bullying. It is crucial, therefore, that the role of the educational sector is properly recognised with teachers being provided with the necessary skills in identifying a child under stress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The diagnosis, assessment and treatment of attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder normally comes within the remit of the child and adolescent psychiatric services in each health board. The development of a comprehensive child and adolescent psychiatric service in each health board area has been identified as a priority in my Department's health <Col N="217" /> strategy &ndash; Shaping a Healthier Future. Each of the health boards now has a dedicated, multi-disciplinary child and adolescent psychiatric service led by a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist. These multi-disciplinary teams would primarily consist of registrars in child and adolescent psychiatry, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and social workers.</P>
    <P>Shaping a Healthier Future also recognises the important role of the voluntary sector in the provision of health and social services. It acknowledged the position which local support groups have to play in many instances of identifying needs in the community and in developing responses to them. As to the level of funding available for support groups for children suffering from ADD and ADHD, I am aware that some health boards have already provided financial assistance to support groups operating in their respective functional areas. I understand that a number of health boards are in direct consultation with local support groups to discuss their needs, including funding requirements and what role the groups might have in the future development of services. These consultations will strengthen links between health boards and local support groups, thereby securing an efficient and effective use of resources to respond to patient needs.</P>
    <P>A draft policy document for the further development of child and adolescent psychiatric services has been completed by Dr. Paul McCarthy, clinical director of child and adolescent psychiatric services in the Eastern Health Board and adviser to my Department on child and adolescent psychiatric service policy. The draft development plan, which was circulated to all health boards for comments, includes consideration of the specific needs of children and adolescents with attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The views of the health boards are currently being considered and a final report is in preparation. In the meantime, additional revenue resources of approximately £3 million have been provided since 1998 to enable improvements in multi-disciplinary teams to be undertaken in the child and adolescent services including the development of services for children suffering from attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is intended that these services will continue to be developed in the next few years as resources permit.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that a national strategy is put in place to ensure that overall services in this area are provided in a consistent and co-ordinated manner. To this end, I intend to establish an appropriate framework with the chief executive officers of the health boards. My Department is currently in communication with the health boards in this regard.</P>
    <P>As has been identified by the Joint Committee on Health and Children and as I have stated earlier, the ability of teachers in identifying ADHD <Col N="218" /> and other learning disabilities is extremely important for the long-term welfare of the child. In view of this, during my term of office as Minister for Education and Science I established a planning group on which the Department of Health and Children was represented, on the development of a national educational psychological service for all schools. The report of the planning group was published in September 1998 and arrangements were put in place to establish this service under a national educational psychological service agency. On 1 September 1999 I formally announced the establishment of the agency to provide a comprehensive school psychological service.</P>
    <P>The national school psychological service will be gradually phased in over a five year period. As many as 50 psychologists will be appointed before May of this year and 25 were appointed this month. At the end of five years it should be able to provide a comprehensive service to all schools. It is important that the transition be made in an orderly manner and that children should not be left without an assessment service during the five year development phase of the national school psychological service. In order to minimise any difficulties that may arise over this period I wrote to my predecessor in the Health Ministry, Deputy Cowen &ndash; my own letters are now visiting me on my desk &ndash; requesting that health board psychologists continue to provide assessment of children in schools. A letter issued to the chief executive officers of each health board requesting their boards to co-operate in maintaining existing services and that health board psychologists liaise with educational psychologists in accordance with the recommendations of the planning group.</P>
    <P>Prior to its establishment there was consultation between the two Departments on how a new national educational psychological service will relate to psychiatric services provided by the health boards for children and young people and on related matters such as the development of guidance and counselling and support for schools in relation to children under stress.</P>
    <P>This new service will have an orientation towards early identification of learning and socio-emotional difficulties with a view to more effective and successful interventions for children under stress. This should subsequently reduce the number of referrals to the health service to those most in need of medical intervention.</P>
    <P>It was once believed that ADHD disappeared at puberty but it is now acknowledged that it is a lifetime condition for many adults. The high level of stress in adults suffering from unrecognised ADHD often results in substance abuse and other problems such as overeating and overspending. Their behaviour reflects their confusion, frustration and despair and they have an inability to get control of their lives. They frequently change jobs and have many absences from work. It is therefore important that a service be developed to assess the needs of those persons who have gone through adolescence without <Col N="219" /> being diagnosed. It is equally important that treatment is maintained, if necessary, for those who were diagnosed at school or in early childhood and have been receiving care and treatment throughout their lives in the child and adolescent services.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I thank the members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children for their report on attention deficit disorder in Ireland and I assure the Senators that the Government shares the public concern about the need to provide an early intervention for children suffering this condition.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education and Science I had a particular insight into the special educational needs of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. I see my role as Minister for Health and Children as identifying particular service deficits and rectifying these on a phased basis. Increased resources have been provided by the Government for the development of these services in recent years. The impact of the early intervention of the school-based national psychological services, the provision of capital funding in the national development plan for the development of improved facilities in child and adolescent psychiatry and greater links being forged between health boards and voluntary organisations should mean the assessment and treatment for persons suffering from this condition will be improved significantly in coming years.</P>
    <P>I intend that the child and adolescent psychiatric service should be further developed in line with Dr. McCarthy's report. I have a particular interest in the needs of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and will endeavour to provide for these particular needs as part of the overall development of the child and adolescent psychiatric service. I note the committee's recommendations regarding the needs of older age categories and will consider these as part of my development programme for the mental health services.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to the Seanad. It is his first official visit in that capacity and I wish him well. I also welcome the visitors in the public gallery from the educational and medical fields and, most importantly, support groups throughout the country. I welcome in particular members of the mid-west support group who have travelled from Limerick. These people have done much to highlight the need to address immediately the needs of those suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which is treatable. Given that he comes from an educational background I hope the Minister will be proactive and give this condition the priority it deserves. There is a need to allocate immediately a sum of £30,000 for a national prevalence study to follow through on the report under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot give the report the attention it deserves in ten minutes. Senators have read it <Col N="220" /> from cover to cover. It is extensive and ought to be essential reading not just for officials of the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science but also of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Each of these Departments has a role to play in the assessment, treatment and monitoring of this condition.</P>
    <P>The report was adopted by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in April last year. In response to a request from the support groups I had asked the joint committee to examine ADHD and received some funding as rapporteur. The research was done by the Health Research Board. I pay tribute to Dr. Deirdre Killilea, clinical and educational psychologist, and Professor Michael Fitzgerald, who cannot be with us today, for their invaluable assistance.</P>
    <P>The appendices to the report ought to be compulsory reading. The parents of ADHD children have harrowing stories to tell, from disturbed childhood to adult violence. On Tuesday I visited Limerick Prison with two mothers of ADHD children to speak to a young man of 19 who has been diagnosed as suffering from ADHD. It was a harrowing experience. I do not know what lies ahead for him, but he should have had a fulfilling life, instead he is serving a prison sentence. There are many others like him. There is a mother present whose son is in that predicament.</P>
    <P>This matter has to receive immediate attention. There is a national development plan and I appeal to the Minister to provide in his first few months in office the £30,000 required to determine the prevalence of ADHD. Statistics are not available. This debate gives us an opportunity to highlight the lack of services. The Minister will be very <i>au fait</i> with ADHD from his visits to Limerick in an attempt to address some of the educational aspects of this issue. Some of the parents here today have had to resort to the courts to ensure the provision of appropriate educational services for their children. I do not need to cite the constitutional reference to every child's right to be educated. It is shocking that in the year 2000 parents have had to resort to the courts.</P>
    <P>Efforts are made on behalf of ADHD sufferers by a small dedicated group which is already overburdened by the enormous demands placed on it. These people have responsibility for their ADHD children as well as their other children and their day to day family life. They are not merely acting on behalf of their own children, they are also acting on behalf of the unknown ADHD sufferers in this country who may not even have been given an assessment but are regarded as troublesome or spoilt children. The parents of ADHD children have spent huge sums of money being pushed and pulled from one psychiatrist to another without really finding out what was wrong with their children while knowing instinctively that something was wrong. One of the women here today, a past pupil of my own, detected that something was wrong with her 18 month old child. She has fought through to the courts to get something done for her child. Parents should not have to <Col N="221" /> dedicate their entire lives to highlighting ADHD suffering. The Minister and his colleagues, the Ministers for Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, must address this issue urgently.</P>
    <P>ADHD and its coexisting conditions are treatable. The best results can be achieved through early diagnosis, medical and behavioural cognitive treatments and specific educational services and interventions. The report clearly points to a severe level of under-recognition and under-diagnosis among health and education professionals.</P>
    <P>The aims are very specific. Support groups want to determine the extent of existing services throughout Ireland for child and adult sufferers and they want the provision of new medical, psychological and educational services. They also want the extent of expertise in the medical, psychological, educational and social services here to be determined.</P>
    <P>I do not have sufficient time to comment on the ten objectives which merit more detailed discussion. However, I will address the recommendations which I consider to be the most important aspect of the report. There is a need for extensive ADHD diagnostic centres to be located in the regions. It is not sufficient to have a national centre. The mid-west support group is seeking a designated service specifically for comprehensive diagnosis and appropriate medical and psychological treatment.</P>
    <P>The report states that a large number of children wait five to 11 years for a diagnosis, following parental identification of problems. Not alone are families spending money attending various psychiatrists, they are also spending thousands of pounds travelling to the UK for treatment. That is a waste of health board funding when the assessments could be carried out here.</P>
    <P>Diagnostic centres must be provided for adults, namely those over 18 years of age. There is no adult ADHD service in Ireland at present. One adult referred to in the report waited 15 years for a diagnosis. The statistics are shocking. Health board adult psychiatrists must develop expertise in the study of adult ADHD. There is also a need for out-patient clinics. Only one adult in this study was in contact with a medical professional. Services must be available through the health boards and parents should not be required to pay privately for diagnostic services as many have had to do. Diagnostic centres must also be provided for young children as early diagnosis is essential for successful treatment.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a multi-disciplinary team of psychiatrists, neurologists, paediatricans, clinical and educational psychologists is essential. Diagnostic centres must be equipped with the necessary assessment materials, including psychological and computerised tests to determine attention levels. The necessary expertise is available in the UK and Europe. I have asked Senator Avril Doyle, MEP, a member of the EU health and environment committee, to conduct a comparative study of ADHD treatments in other EU <Col N="222" /> countries in order that we may liaise with our European counterparts whose treatment methods may be more advanced and ensure we follow best practice. Many of the parents visiting the House today travel to Britain to see Dr. Cooley, a well-known expert in this area. He has also visited Limerick and we know the expertise is there. The centres within the health boards must be multi-modal, providing behavioural, cognitive and medical treatment.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board needs to approve a far greater number of medicines which are unavailable at present. Medications have been shown to reduce the core symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattentiveness. They also reduce oppositional and aggressive behaviour. In this study parents noticed that their child's behavioural problems had diminished since the introduction of medication. The drug Ritalin needs to be available on prescription to adults with ADHD. Within this city the ADHD services within Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin need to be extended to cope with the huge waiting list.</P>
    <P>I speak to the converted when I address the Minister on the issue of educational services. Children with ADHD should be regarded as having specific educational needs. As a teacher I would not be equipped to diagnose or assess, but in retrospect I saw children who manifested ADHD symptoms. Children with ADHD in mainstream schools need access to remedial and resource teachers specially trained in the area of ADHD. They also need structured tailor-made activities and concrete learning experiences, preferably with a teacher trained in ADHD.</P>
    <P>A specific school is required to accommodate children with severe ADHD. I know children who have been expelled from school, not just once but two or three times. Parents have been obliged to take legal proceedings to ensure they receive an education. These are innocent children born with a disorder that can be treated. They are unable to cope, yet they are labelled as dysfunctional and aggressive with a stigma attaching to them through life. I referred earlier to imprisonment and the study specifies what happens to children when people are unable to diagnose their problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the 1998 report of the planning group of the National Educational Psychological Service which states that psychological services should be available. The youthreach services should be made available here because many of these children end up using them. In addition, professionals need to be educated in the medical, psychological and vocational services. Professionals are probably gleaning knowledge from their work with persons with ADHD.</P>
    <P>Teacher training colleges and educational institutions need to train teachers how to recognise and cope with ADHD children in the classroom. Cursory recognition in the training course is insufficient &ndash; modules are required. Continued <Col N="223" /> professional development is required. We can tap into increased research in the UK and other EU countries and America. There is a need, therefore, for inservice training, lectures, conferences and psychology courses in the assessment and diagnosis of ADHD. Staff providing vocational services need to be trained in behaviour management techniques.</P>
    <P>Research is vital. Dr. Deirdre Killilea has made valuable research findings, but she and many like her, such as Professor Michael Fitzgerald, must be supported to ensure a heightening of awareness of the disorder among the medical and education professions.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has been appointed to the Department of Health and Children. He has proved what he can do, especially for children with special needs within the educational services. The health service is his biggest priority and I ask him to address this issue and to liaise with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that none of these innocent children will end up in prison, with prison officers telling us they know they should not be there. They are in prison because they have slipped through the net. On behalf of the parents visiting the House today I beg the Minister to spare their suffering and that of other parents who as yet do not know their children have this disorder.</P>
    <P>We need to link into the research available elsewhere and to act quickly. Each day somebody is falling through the net. I know the matter is in capable hands and that the Minister will respond immediately. The immediate response required is minimal &ndash; the sum of £30,000 to assess prevalence because we need to keep the research ongoing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an tAire go dtí an Teach. I take the opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Health and Children. If he brings, as I am confident he will, the same level of efficiency and achievement to this brief as he did to his previous one, I have no doubt he will be remembered equally for his achievement in his current field. I welcome the parents present in the public gallery. As someone who worked in the health services for many years I identify with the sentiments expressed by the Minister and I agree with what Senator Jackman has said.</P>
      <P>When we talk about attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder many people will wonder what we are talking about. I agree with Senator Henry that many people have found their way into our prisons and many have been incorrectly diagnosed in the psychiatric services as a result of ignorance of this condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, is one of the most common psychiatric disorders of childhood and early adolescence. Attention deficit disorder refers to a cluster of behaviours that make a child underactive at school for his intellect levels and under-behave at <Col N="224" /> home for a standard of parenting. It is more correct to refer to ADD as ADHD. ADHD is a chronic condition which continues throughout the school years. It is believed that as many as 60% of children affected by this condition will take most if not all of the symptoms into adulthood.</P>
    <P>ADHD children vary in the number of these behaviours and the relative severity of each. ADHD is described as being made up of three core behaviours. First, inattentiveness &ndash; the child is easily distracted, forgets instructions, flits from task to task, is best with one-to-one supervision and has a poor short-term memory. Some children are distant, dreamy and spaced out. Second, impulsivity &ndash; the child speaks and acts without thinking and has a short fuse. Third, overactivity &ndash; the child is restless, fidgety, fiddles, touches and has hyperactivity.</P>
    <P>In addition there a number of other behaviours that might be seen in children with ADHD. One of these is insatiability &ndash; the children are never satisfied. They keep putting up the crossbar, so to speak, as in a high jump competition. They go on and on, interrogate, intrude, and invariably lose friends. A child may be clumsy. The child may be out of tune socially, act silly in a crowd, misread social cues, be overpowering and bossy. Such children may have poor co-ordination &ndash; about half of them may be clumsy and half have an awkward flow of movement, experience difficulty doing two actions at once and produce messy written work. They may be disorganised. The children may be blind to mess, have problems structuring school work and be unable to get started on homework or projects. Variability is another behaviour. A child may suffer from mood swings, have unexplained good and bad days and can be extremely volatile. Such children also have special learning disabilities, examples of which are dyslexia, language problems, difficulties with handwriting and mathematics. Most have problems with written work and 60% have some other specific weaknesses.</P>
    <P>What causes ADHD? In the past professionals tended to blame the parents for causing their child to have these behaviours. Others said that ADHD was due to additives in food. We know now that neither of these is the cause, although poor parenting and some food substances may occasionally influence existing ADHD sufferers.</P>
    <P>Researchers still disagree on the exact cause of ADHD, however, there are two aspects of the condition that are agreed upon. First, it is a strongly hereditary condition and, second, it is caused by a minor difference in the fine tuning of the normal brain. Heredity is obvious, as many families have a parent or close friend with a similar problem. If one identical twin has ADHD, there is over a 90% chance the other will also have the condition. If one sibling has ADHD, there is about a 30% chance another child will be affected.</P>
    <P>For years it was presumed that ADHD was a biologically-based condition which was part of the child's make-up. It was thought to be due to a <Col N="225" /> slight difference in the functioning of the normal brain. This can be shown by the most modern research scans &ndash; PET and SPECT. Not only do these scans show the slight difference of tuning in ADHD, but the difference can be largely reversed in many cases after administering stimulant medication such as Ritalin.</P>
    <P>For every child the environment in which they grow up is extremely important. A member of the immediate family having ADHD may lead to a more disorganised, chaotic family environment. Also, when a child has ADHD the fact that they seem to have an insatiable need for attention can wear out parents and make it difficult for families to enjoy the child's growing up as much as the growing up of a child without ADHD. Neither of these things causes ADHD, but it is important to be aware that they occur and that parents are not blamed for the behaviour of a child with ADHD, as is very often the case. Uncaring people say, &ldquo;If they were minding their own business and staying at home with their children, etc., they would not be in such a position and the children would not be carrying on as they are&rdquo;. This is a load of nonsense.</P>
    <P>Food allergies or intolerance have been talked about as making ADHD worse. It is an established fact that some children react specifically to certain foods. Parents will often know which foods cause their children to become more excitable and they try to cut these out of their child's diet. For example, certain children become hyperactive when they eat chocolate.</P>
    <P>ADHD is a clinical diagnosis &ndash; there is no test for it. Parent and child interviews are the core of the assessment process. In addition, it is essential to obtain reports of behaviour, learning and attendance at school. Standardised instruments may be used for obtaining this information, although observations may be needed in classroom, family and peer group settings. A number of standardised rating scales and specific research tools are used. Medical evaluation includes a complete medical history and physical, neurological and laboratory investigations are also indicated. Speech and language evaluation may be suggested by the clinical findings and occupational therapy assessments can be valuable, for example, with motor clumsiness and adaptive skills. In many clinics psychologists have specialised in the use of these assessment instruments for diagnosis and ongoing evaluation. Liaison with school psychologists is absolutely crucial.</P>
    <P>Treatment is multi-modal, representing a combination of psycho-social, educational and pharmacological interventions tailor made for the individual patient. While increasingly there is a popular focus on medication, this should not be used as a substitute for appropriate educational curricula, a point made by the Minister, appropriate student-teacher ratios, a matter which has been addressed to a large extent by the Minister, or other environmental accommodations. Certainly, pharmacotherapy is useful, with Ritalin and dextroamphetamines being useful in certain <Col N="226" /> cases. In addition, treatment must be focused on the comorbid conditions.</P>
    <P>There are a number of pyscho-social interventions which include family focused interventions &ndash; parent education, parent support groups, family therapy, parent management training, behavioural approaches, home-school liaison; school focused interventions &ndash; teacher information, teacher management training, structured classroom and school placement, remedial education; and child focused intervention &ndash; individual psychotherapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, social skills groups.</P>
    <P>I am delighted this matter is being discussed and commend my colleagues who are members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children for the attention they have given this matter. Many people have ended up in prison and the disturbed wards of psychiatric institutions because of ignorance of the condition.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to spare a thought for the long suffering parents of those children and, most importantly, for the sufferers who may slip through the net. We must devote our attention to ADHD. The behaviour of sufferers impacts in a very adverse way on family and school life &ndash; sufferers can cause absolute chaos in schools, as those among us who are educators are aware. It is imperative we get to grips with the problem as soon as possible. I know that given the Minister's performance in his previous portfolio we can expect great things from him in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. If he brings to this task the same enthusiasm he brought to his last portfolio we will all benefit greatly. I get a sense of that enthusiasm and achievement from what he said today.</P>
      <P>I never heard of this problem until last year when, in one of our supermarkets, a customer explained it to me. That night I talked about it with my wife and we said how lucky we were that we had not known of the problem. Before solving anything, the real task is to recognise and identify the problem. This debate and the efforts of the committee are doing exactly that by bringing attention and putting a spotlight on it. We cannot attempt the first steps towards a solution until we identify the problem.</P>
      <P>When I read Shaping a Healthier Future I learned things for the first time. I was unaware that this was also an adult problem &ndash; I thought it finished at adolescence. I suddenly realised this problem is not one that can be handled by a single Department. If ever a national crusade was needed it is necessary in this regard. I learned that between 1% and 3% of the child population may suffer from this &ndash; it is a much bigger problem than I thought. It is a task not just for teachers but also for employers and a solution must be broadly based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a crusade and, therefore, champions &ndash; those who have come together to bring this to our attention &ndash; are necessary not only to say there is a problem but to indicate that there are <Col N="227" /> solutions. Research, which the Minister spoke about, is necessary. The Minister also spoke about the need for a national strategy. I have no idea whether such a strategy would nibble at the surface of the problem or be a move in the right direction. I am sure it is a move in the right direction, but it is not enough. I get the impression from the Minister that he will give a listening ear to the problem if we can convince him that it needs far more attention. Our task is to ensure we put the spotlight on the problem and identify it so that those concerned &ndash; teachers, employers, children and others &ndash; recognise this is a disorder which can be tackled.</P>
    <P>I have been involved for five years with the leaving certificate applied and I was aware of the Minister's successful efforts in regard to it when he held the Education and Science portfolio. That programme identified that certain talents, abilities, skills, intelligences were not recognised in the traditional manner in the education system and, consequently, were not measured, assessed or rewarded. The great success of that course reminds me of what can be achieved. Parents who have had to follow a lonely path for many years suddenly feel, following the publication of the report, that they are not on their own any more and that they have support. The support they receive depends on how much the nation gets behind them and drives the effort to address this disorder. I am confident that this debate is the first step.</P>
    <P>Champions are needed, although they are not always identified and rewarded. For example, I read recently an article on the heroes of the 20th century. The inventor of the seat belt was included, but he selflessly insisted that he would receive no royalties because he described it as an example of how he wished to help the world. Parents and, particularly, teachers who have contributed a great deal in this area behave in a similar manner. Such selflessness will mean that many people will get behind efforts to deal with this disorder.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for more research. Previous speakers, including the Minister, have touched on the areas about which we are knowledgeable already. However, we do not know enough and need to find out a great deal more. Extra resources must be committed to address the problem but it is up to us to make the case. I met a successful man last year and I asked him how he had succeeded when so many others had not. He was not able to answer immediately but a half an hour later he replied that whether one believes one can or cannot, one is right. For example, if one goes out to play a football match believing one has no chance against the other team, one is right and will not win, but if one goes out to play believing that one will win, one can do so. Those involved with ADD need to adopt such an attitude. If we believe that we can solve this problem, we will. This debate is another step forward in making sure that the nation recognises <Col N="228" /> it. I was pleased with the Minister's contribution. I am aware that no matter how many words he uses, they will probably not be enough to resolve the problem but he is heading in the right direction. I congratulate him for accepting this challenge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister is intensely bored with having compliments showered upon his head. I was waiting for a halo to accompany him into the House. Professor Ronan Fanning, a feature writer in a Sunday newspaper, stated that as far as the universities are concerned, Deputy Martin was the best ever Minister for Education. Fergus Finlay, a columnist in the Saturday edition of <i>The Examiner,</i> could not remember any new initiative that the Minister took during his time in the Department of Education and Science. I am tempted to conclude that Mr. Finlay must be suffering from acute ADD. He was not paying attention when Deputy Martin took a plethora of well acknowledged initiatives, but I hope that he will pay attention to the fact that he has received an honourable mention in the House.</P>
      <P>The problem has been identified, particularly by the Mid-Western Health Board. Its representatives compiled a comprehensive report, to which all of us have had access in preparing for the debate, and I thank them. I also commend the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children which identified ADD as an issue that needed to be addressed urgently. It too produced a comprehensive report. The Minister and I come from a city where it is often asked why we are always one report away from action.</P>
      <P>A great deal of research has been carried out and it is critical that extensive and sustained action should be initiated. That should be the outcome of the debate. The Minister should bring to bear in his new brief his insight and understanding of children's issues and the expertise and experience available to him. Armed with this information he should spearhead the action required to tackle this problem in a sustained manner.</P>
      <P>Early detection is the most important element in dealing with the problem. It is estimated that one in 30 children suffer from the disorder. Teachers are the first professionals with whom children come in contact for a prolonged period. It is important that they are enabled to detect the disorder early and that is a big challenge. Every time the economy needs more skills, something new is tacked on to the requirements on teachers. Where would we be without them? However, there is a body of research which demonstrates without doubt that when this problem is treated early and adequately, significant improvements accrue. That should be a huge impetus for us to tackle the problem quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional burden of early detection must be placed on teachers. We pride ourselves on having an education system that is child centred and has teachers of children rather than subjects. <Col N="229" /> However, teachers are provided with very little training to enable them to detect such a disorder and that is a fundamental flaw in teacher training at every level. This issue must be taken seriously in the context of teacher education. If education is to be truly child centred, teachers must at least be enabled to detect this disorder and others, such as dyslexia, so that they can refer children for diagnosis and treatment.</P>
    <P>Literacy is an issue which has arisen again and the Minister concerned himself very much with it during his time in the Department of Education and Science. An issue arising now is that, after a number of years of remedial education, there has not been a significant reduction in the number of young people with reading disabilities. We must ask what kind of co-ordination there should be between the classroom teacher, who has a holistic approach to education, and the specialist teacher who may make a direct intervention. Where do we create the space or the time for collaboration between these two types of teacher? That is a broader issue which perhaps I should not have raised, but it is important. Parents suffer enormous anguish when their child experiences the symptoms that have been well described, and very often it is the teachers with whom they should be in closest contact.</P>
    <P>The key to addressing this problem is early diagnosis. It is stated in one of these excellent reports that by the age of seven every child who suffers from this disorder ought to be referred for adequate medical treatment. We should set as an objective that by the age of seven, every child should be referred for treatment because early diagnosis and treatment will achieve the best possible results. I envisage the day &ndash; I hope it is not too far away &ndash; when this problem is seen in the context of health and education, and not in the context of justice. The fact that we are discussing this issue in the context of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a testimony to our failure. Before the end of the Minister's term of office in the Department of Health and Children, I hope this issue will have been dealt with so successfully we will not be discussing it in terms of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Having a national strategy is the correct approach but it is important that such a strategy is implemented at a local level. There is little point in having multi-faceted services unless young people have access to them, regardless of where they live. It is not sufficient that this range of treatment is available to young people living in the major cities. The challenge for us is to ensure that when a package is put in place, arising from the national strategy, it can be accessed by all children who have a need for and who will benefit from the service. That is critically important.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk about social inclusion and poverty. Very often, such talk is couched in trade union language but young people who are born with a disorder of this nature, and who do not get adequate treatment <Col N="230" /> within our education and health services from a very early age, are condemned to a level of exclusion. They are deprived of the opportunity to attain their full potential, the potential they could achieve given the proper services. It is important that the services identified in the context of these reports are developed against a national framework but that they are accessible at a local level.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat all the symptoms of this disorder; that has been done already. The time for action has come. Senator Quinn talked about the cleverness of the man who invented the seat belt, and fair dues to him. Perhaps the Minister will be the man who will give a life belt to parents who suffer anguish when they are confronted with this problem, and to all the professionals who have put such a body of work together to enable us discuss this problem in a serious and systematic way. I hope that before the Minister's term of office has expired there will be an appreciable difference in the size of the problem. Perhaps we will debate this issue again and assess the progress made or action taken and the improvements that have been effected. That is what I would like to see as the outcome of this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to the House and wish him well in his new portfolio. The Minister's combined experience in the Department of Education and Science and now the Department of Health and Children puts him in a unique position to deal with the specific issue before the House. I welcome also the representatives of the attention deficit disorder national support group and in particular the mid-west group with whom I have a lot of contact and whose members have done tremendous work in the past three to four years in bringing to our attention the existence of this disorder. It is true that politicians in particular, and the wider public in general, were unaware of this disorder until it was raised by this group. The amount of work it has done on a voluntary basis demands high commendation. This debate has come about because the group lobbied so effectively over the years.</P>
      <P>The work that has been done has given politicians specific information which has also been brought to the attention of the various Departments. I compliment my colleagues in this House and in the other House who are members of the committee for children, particularly our own spokesperson, Senator Jackman, on the work they have done in putting together the report published some time ago on attention deficit disorder in Ireland, which we are discussing today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that due to time constraints our contributions have to be restricted. There is now a volume of information on the cause of this disorder, the difficulties it creates for the individuals and families concerned as well as the professionals within the schools structure. Specific recommendations have been made in the report <Col N="231" /> of the Oireachtas committee and information has been given to us by the attention deficit disorder group. There is now an onus on legislators, and particularly on the Government, to come to specific conclusions.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister is in the House today to listen to the debate. This is not a problem for one Department only. The Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform should have a major input in dealing with this problem. I ask the Minister to ensure this issue is put on the agenda of the Cabinet so that a Cabinet sub-committee can be established comprising those three Departments and the Department of Finance. A multi-departmental approach must be adopted to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>There are specific recommendations in the report in relation to the Department of Health and Children. I ask the Minister to ensure that proper funding is allocated to the eight health boards. We can have all the reports and documentation in the world, but what we need now are services. The facts have been established. We now have to deal with the realities and to do that we need to put in place the services. First and foremost is the need for diagnostic services, with properly trained psychiatrists, psychologists and counsellors to diagnose the problem.</P>
    <P>The earlier the problem is diagnosed the greater the results and advantage for the sufferer, the family and the wider community. It is important this matter is dealt with by health boards immediately. We do not have the necessary services. The Minister has a unique opportunity to address this matter and I urge him to engage in discussions with the health boards to ensure properly trained staff are employed and diagnostic units established to deal with this problem. It is extremely important that proper treatment services be established. People suffer at different levels of severity of the disorder. It is important that treatment services are set up as close as possible to the homes of the children concerned so that they can have a normal family life and proper social interaction. We need a very specific treatment centre for those who suffer from a severe form of the disorder. We must address the issue in a structured way and with urgency.</P>
    <P>As a former teacher, I know many teachers did not understand why particular children were disruptive in class. Only as we educate ourselves do we learn about these matters. We now realise that some of the children had the very symptoms identified in the report. Such children are considered by many educational institutions to be disruptive. There is no follow-up when many of them leave school, with the result that they end up in difficulties with the law. They are often convicted of offences and detained. This is a very serious matter. A directive should be given &ndash; particularly to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; that a person identified as suffering <Col N="232" /> from attention deficit disorder who commits a first offence should not be detained. They should instead be given the necessary treatment to correct their disorder.</P>
    <P>Various reports on this issue have been produced throughout Europe. A report compiled in southern California suggests that approximately 77% of people detained for criminal offences were identified as having some symptoms of attention deficit disorder. That figure compares closely with the statement recently by the Governor of Mountjoy Prison, Mr. Lonergan, that approximately 70% of inmates there display symptoms of attention deficit disorder. If the Government looks at the problem from that perspective, leaving aside the social issues involved, it will recognise that it is in the long-term interest of the community to ensure corrective action is taken at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer of not addressing this issue is enormous. It might be useful, if the Minister proceeds with the setting up of a sub-committee to examine this issue, to have each Department assess the costs involved in not addressing it. Not addressing it is, I suggest, costing the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform more money than the amount required by the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science to correct the problem. Money provided for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be much more effectively used in other areas. I hope the Minister will take a serious look at that point.</P>
    <P>We are not into plaudits on this side of the House but the Minister, a formidable person in Government, has an admirable record and we have every confidence that he has the breadth of vision and openness required to address this issue. I thank him for coming to the House and look forward to a positive response.</P>

      <P>It is not necessary for me to add to the fine words the Opposition Senators have spoken about the Minister. They have said as much in terms of praise as I, a member of the same party, could bestow on him. I hope people will speak as highly of him when his term of office in the Department of Health and Children ends.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman referred to the joint committee's report. I will read some extracts from that report which I think highlight more than anything else the personal experiences of families. Before doing so I wish to welcome members of the support group and people from Monaghan who have come to hear this debate.</P>
      <P>I want to highlight the quest by one set of parents to have their child diagnosed and treated in Ireland. The report states:</P>
      <P>When he was eight the phrases &ldquo;class clown&rdquo; and &ldquo;smart alec&rdquo; were being used in school and remedial help was withdrawn as he was deemed to be inattentive and impulsive. This was interpreted to mean lazy and not wanting to learn. . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> When he was ten the words &ldquo;bad&rdquo;, &ldquo;bold&rdquo;  and &ldquo;undisciplined&rdquo; were being used. His parents tried everything but nothing worked. . . . .</P>
    <P>When he was 11 and while seeing the psychologist the child started to drink heavily, take drugs and steal from anyone and everyone. .  . </P>
    <P>When he was 13 he was expelled from school.</P>
    <P>At this stage the father felt moving from the city to the country might help the family in general. However, the report continues:</P>
    <P>The child's father, the image of head of the household and family protector shattered, started to stay out on his own &ndash; at least it was quiet. His wife remained at home heartbroken in an effort to contain her son who was now bulimic and paranoid. His frustration changed to aggression to violence.</P>
    <P>Such words are used constantly by the parents of untreated children. By the time the child was 14 years old his mother had received a black eye and, desperate to have anyone listen, this child spent a night in an adult psychiatric ward because the family could no longer cope. By the time the child was 17 he was transferred to an adult psychiatric department from which he never received any service. His mother finally sought professional help in England. Today the young gentleman continues on treatment and must live in England to be monitored.</P>
    <P>Many lives are ruined by attention deficit disorder. It not only destroys the life of the individual but that of the family and society in general. Figures of 1% and 3% have been mentioned in relation to the number of the population who may be affected by attention deficit disorder. The percentage increases to 5% depending on the report you read. Eighty per cent of affected children remain affected by the disorder by adolescence; by the time they become adults it is reported that 60% of them remain affected.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Jackman that the report is compulsive reading. The symptoms are classic and it is the parents who realise there is something different about their child. They can identify it in a child as young as 18 months but they cannot put their finger on it. Very often they have older children who never caused them a day's trouble. When a parent calls their own child a monster there is something seriously wrong. Over the past couple of years I have heard this from parents on so many occasions.</P>
    <P>When we talk about how to deal with it one has to ask whether we start in the prisons where quite a few of these individuals end up. Do we start with early school leavers, drop-outs and young people who have turned to drink, drugs and then crime or do we try to identify them at primary school? The disorder is such a vast problem. We have so many reports and studies that the time has come for urgent action. The Minister has said educational psychologists will be introduced on a phased basis over a five-year period. <Col N="234" /> That time should be shorter. We need emergency treatment.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Jackman's call for an initial allocation of £30,000 for a prevalence study. I disagree with all these studies because they are often left on shelves gathering dust. In this case, however, we must highlight sufferers in society because, as the Minister said, we do not know the exact number of people suffering from this disorder.</P>
    <P>Action can be taken immediately by giving people who are at the forefront in dealing with these children, the GPs, a greater awareness of this ailment. In many cases parents will go to their GP not knowing what is wrong with their child. They will just bring their child to the GP's surgery saying they do not know what to do with him or her. That is the start of it. With all due respect to them, GPs are not fully aware or as informed about this condition as they should be.</P>
    <P>All the other speakers referred to the role of teachers, which is of paramount importance. The Minister has had an input into the establishment of the remedial teaching service and that is the line we must take. Remedial teachers must be trained to identify children with this disorder and to begin the diagnostic process.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development of the National Educational Psychological Service for all schools. However, we must move with more haste on it. As I have seen in my constituency, the delay in assessing children with psychological problems, not necessarily with ADD, is too long. This condition is treatable but early diagnosis followed by continual treatment is important. Making a child wait five years is unfair and will lead to problems in society. Many individuals have had their children assessed privately as a last resort. This process is expensive but some families feel there is nothing else they can do.</P>
    <P>Medication for this condition is available up to 16 years of age. Unfortunately, families in my area cannot receive it at home. They must travel to the centres where their children have been diagnosed to be prescribed their medication. I can understand that there is a worry that abuse will take place after 16 years of age and that people will become addicted, particularly to Ritalin, but I cannot understand why an individual who has been prescribed medication must travel to a centre to get it. The medication is necessary and has proven effective but it should be given, under strict supervision, to people over 16 years and adults.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Health and Children must adopt a comprehensive approach to this problem. The time has come for us to set up a pilot scheme. Each health board has a family centre but that is not enough. In the Cavan-Monaghan constituency it is estimated that there are 300 children suffering from this disorder but there is one centre in Drogheda. Psychologists in that area must deal with children suffering from a var<Col N="235" /> iety of psychological disorders, not just those with ADD.</P>
    <P>We must invest in tackling this problem. If we invest in our children it will benefit us all in the future. I ask the Minister to bring together the three Departments. We have a Minister with specific responsibility for children. I support Senator Taylor-Quinn's call for a sub-committee because this is such an important issue. Such a measure can only benefit our children and society in the future.</P>

      <P>I regret I must leave the Seanad because I have another appointment. However, I am thrilled with this debate. It is a tremendous opportunity to debate ADHD. For the parents concerned it is more progress in an ongoing campaign which I was aware of when I was Minister for Education and Science. The Minister of State, Dr. Moffatt, will take over from me and will listen to further points other Members have to make.</P>
      <P>I will take seriously the comments made here. The training of teachers is a key issue. In my former post I initiated two significant teacher training review bodies, one at primary and the other at secondary level. One of the areas of their terms of reference was special education, learning difficulties and how future pre-service training programmes and modules could accommodate special education so that all new teachers could have more significant exposure to these issues than perhaps heretofore. We are working with the partners in that regard.</P>
      <P>With regard to the national prevalence study, I will work with the groups and come back to Members on it. I am sympathetic to that proposal and we can make progress on it. I will work nationally with the support group to ensure there will be a national study and that we can have a proper baseline study for the first time in the history of this State on this specific condition. I do not see a difficulty in progressing that issue either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past two years £3 million has been spent on establishing child and adolescent psychiatric units in every health board area. Within those multi-disciplinary teams ADHD will be accommodated. Therein lies the key to the future for structural developments in this area. At present we are appointing four more consultants. By the end of the year we will have a significant infrastructure in place, not just studies. Consultants in the child and adolescent units will deal with these issues in a hands-on approach. There are other issues in terms of other paramedics. We have more work to do in finding more psychologists and language therapists. There is a historical deficit in the provision of language therapists. I was aware of that from the education side and now I will tackle it from the health side. I will <Col N="236" /> go back to education again because we have not cracked the problem of providing language therapists and occupational therapists. Once we build up those support services then we will be on the way to providing proper services for children and adolescents.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for intervening in what may be an unprecedented manner but I just wanted to let Members know that I am taking very seriously the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee and the views articulated.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his words. I also welcome his appointment as the new Minister for Health and Children. He is the living image of a man I have been doing business with for the past three years in the Department of Education and Science. I wish him well in his new ministry and I look forward to finding a result for this issue. I also recognise that he must leave at this point.</P>
      <P>It is crucially important that issues relating to ADHD are developed. I am delighted with this debate. It is the type of debate where aspects of education can be teased out, brought forward and points made. However, there are dangers in terms of some of the recommendations and I have a view on how this might be approached. The extraordinary good work being carried out by the support groups and parents to draw attention to this problem needs to be fitted into what is happening in the mainstream. There is always a danger that a group of people with a particular difficulty will be left on the outside or kept in a corner and will have to battle on their own against a huge group demanding more, when they should be right in the middle and be part of any education and health developments as they require.</P>
      <P>The OECD issued a report three years ago which stated that one in four people in Ireland were suffering from literacy difficulties. Over the last couple of months a report issued by the Department of Education and Science indicated that more than one in ten pupils leaving primary schools have literacy difficulties at some level. We must look at how to deal with that.</P>
      <P>I have made a proposal to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Education and Science and anybody else who will listen to me, including the Joint Committee on Education and Science, based on a number of fundamental principles which are the same as those being put forward by the support group. The first principle is early intervention. It applies not just to this disorder but also to autism and other conditions where children have special needs. A parent who is coping with rearing a child might be experiencing some difficulty, but very often by the time they figure out what is causing the difficulty too much time has been lost. It is unfair to set up a system which requires the parent to initiate diagnosis of the problem. That system cannot and will not be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> Where can we make the intervention? The first intervention should take place when the child is five years of age. Teachers of senior infant classes in every school should be asked to indicate the children who are having reading or pre-reading difficulties. Following that, there should be a case conference involving the class teacher, the remedial teacher if there is one in the school, the principal teacher and an educational psychologist. The case conference can evaluate the child's difficulties. The difficulties could be due to a mild form of dyslexia, a serious emotional problem or to a range of other conditions, including attention deficit disorder. At that point, the net can be pulled and we can see who is caught in it and requires support.</P>
    <P>At that stage, it should be possible to put in place an individual programme for each child with a reading difficulty. A year later the programme can be assessed to see whether progress has been made, if the child has developed, if the child is developing social and reading skills and whether there has been an improvement. If there is not, the programme must be changed.</P>
    <P>I wish to focus on how to implement this. First, we ask the class teacher to indicate the children having difficulties. That is straightforward and can be done without any new investment &ndash; it is simply a teacher input. The next step is a case conference of the appropriate people. That requires a huge increase in the number of educational psychologists. The Minister said there is a difficulty in finding such people. That is because the State is not supporting the education and qualification of educational psychologists.</P>
    <P>I was speaking this weekend to three young people who are studying education psychology at Queen's University, Belfast. Their salaries are being paid by one of the education and library boards in the North in return for which they give a commitment to work there for a number of years after they qualify. That is how to deal with shortages. One simply ensures that a sufficient supply will be available. That policy should be implemented in the South because the case conference is the point at which the first intervention can and should take place.</P>
    <P>The teacher input at this stage needs to be a specialist input. The teaching profession, for which I am a loud spokesperson, has to focus on the fact that teaching now requires specialists. The generalists must be supported by specialists. That means the colleges of education must put in place courses for teachers who will specialise in issues such as ADD. This matter is left slightly vague in the report and in the proposals put forward by the support group. It is not enough to propose that every teacher in the system should get two hours training on ADD. On qualification the teachers should be obliged to do a further year's training in these specialist areas. The colleges of education will have to change their ways and ensure that people with such skills would be available to schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> There are two specialists, the educational psychologist and the teacher specialist, who may or may not be required to be part of the input. In some cases, the programme they put together for the child could be delivered through the remedial teacher and the class teacher. In other cases, that will not be possible. It must be stressed that the work can be done at this stage. I made passionate proposals to the Government before the publication of the national development plan, before the budget and in the course of the talks on the new social partnership programme, which I left this morning in order to speak in this debate, to address these issues.</P>
    <P>I urge the people who are interested in this issue not to let themselves be hived off into a new committee or into producing another report. They need, deserve and have the right to be supported through the education and health system. This is how it must be done &ndash; identification at five years of age, a programme put in place, annual assessment and the proper professional support. I can make an input into this matter having been a teacher, and a pretty disruptive pupil, for many years &ndash; some might say I am still a disruptive pupil.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a political decision to intervene, to invest the resources and to move the programme forward. That will not be cheap. We must decide as a society what to do with all the money we have created. This would be an investment in the future and savings will be made on prison and other treatment costs. If there were such early intervention, we would reap a huge reward.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfadh an Rialtas rud éigin mar sin. Tá géar-ghá leis; ba chóir go mbeadh tacaíocht do na moltaí atá sa tuarascáil seo. I highly recommend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, also knows a great deal about this problem and I welcome him to the House. We are surrounded with knowledgeable people &ndash; the Minister, Deputy Martin, the Minister of State and the teachers who have already spoken. There is a team working on this matter who know a great deal about it.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the support group on compiling this well researched document. It has made it easy for Senators to appreciate the problem and how it has been neglected over the years. It was known as the hidden handicap. I have 15 years' experience as a career guidance teacher and I encountered many children with this disorder. Like other teachers, I misinterpreted the condition and assumed it was due to lack of parental control and discipline. One assumed the pupils needed a talking to and often they were sent home because we were incapable of containing them in the classroom. It transpires now that we were treating them incorrectly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> The report is timely. The Minister said he will devise a national strategy which will encompass an integrated interdepartmental approach and he will set up a subcommittee to that end. Many points have been made in relation to how best we can inform the public about this matter. To date the public have not been informed. Professionals and community workers had no feel for this area and its implications. We need to look at how best we can assess this disorder and diagnose the real problem. The only way to do that is when children enter primary school at four years of age. The earlier the intervention, the better chance there is to adjust the child to a normal routine in the school. Often when children enter second level all their bad social skills, low self-esteem and bad behaviour have been repeatedly reinforced and they cannot see themselves behaving any differently. We should intervene at an early stage, at the age of four, and a case study should be compiled which would adopt an integrated approach involving the educational psychologist, the school principal, the remedial teacher, the home-school link and parents to see how the problem can be best diagnosed, the situation assessed and a treatment programme devised to help the child.</P>
    <P>The report suggested that at least 1% to 3% of the population suffers from this problem and I agree. In my 15 years' experience as a guidance counsellor, there was always one child coming from primary level who could not be contained in the classroom. The report reinforces that and, in some cases, some of those children would have had mild forms of ADD, although we would not have known then what is was. We need the information to be well informed.</P>
    <P>Teachers have a huge role to play. They are the people who will deal on a one-to-one basis with children with this problem who attend school. Unless they develop a good relationship with the children and their parents and are familiar with the treatment which has been prescribed and the programme set in motion and how to handle that programme, not much progress will be made. It is a concentrated area.</P>
    <P>Enough research has been conducted but we need constant case studies. I do not need any more research than has been conducted already and I would not ask for any more. If I were a guidance counsellor, I would know what is the problem, so I would want the educational psychologist, the school principal, the class teachers, the local GP, if necessary, so that he or she is familiar with problem, involved. I would want reference to them if further progress could not be made through normal channels to see how best a programme could be introduced. It is very simple in that the monitoring of children should be set in motion in schools in conjunction with parents. I do not see what more research can achieve.</P>
    <P>More educational psychologists need to be employed in this area and the Minister has made a commitment in that regard. An integrated sub-<Col N="240" /> committee of the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be established and teachers, guidance counsellors and local people should be involved. Four or five primary schools in an area should be grouped together and work should be done with them. Each area should also be grouped accordingly. That would lead to a structure being put in place and it should not be too difficult to implement measures after that.</P>
    <P>We have had a great debate on the subject. I am delighted with the Minister's commitment. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is familiar with this area as a doctor and a public representative. He will hear another doctor speak on the matter, Deputy Fitzpatrick. Furthermore, many former teachers who are now politicians would be familiar with the area. The Minister could not have more support for his actions and we support him and compliment and congratulate him for giving us the opportunity to discuss it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am neither a teacher nor a doctor but am representative of the general population in that, if it was not for the information sent to me by the representative groups in this area, I would be unaware of this problem. This is a key point in the debate. There is a need for awareness of the existence of the difficulty, as has been stated by other speakers, at school level, among GPs and among the population generally.</P>
      <P>I have only recently become a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, so I was not part of the compilation of this fine report on attention deficit disorder in Ireland. I commend committee members on their work on it and commend Senator Jackman on her work in this area. I also commend the representative groups and lobby groups for parents and families on their excellent work in bringing this matter to our attention. I commend the Minister on his response and welcome the debate which, with other actions, will move the issue forward.</P>
      <P>The report makes clear the extent of the difficulty faced by the family of a child with this problem to anyone who would not otherwise be aware of it. We are talking about the lives of children, their parents and their community. When one reads of the effects of severe cases of attention deficit disorder, one can see the havoc which can be wreaked on an individual's life. It is unnecessary because we know the extent of the problem and we have solutions. The bottom line is that we are agreed on the analysis, the extent of the problem and the solution to it, so now is the time for action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister who, as Minister for Education and Science, was not found wanting in spending money on certain areas, to put the necessary resources into this area now and not to deliberate further on the matter. We have the resources and we are familiar with the cliché about the Celtic tiger. The prosperity available to us gives us choices and options. We now have <Col N="241" /> possibilities available to us which were not available before. We now have the ability to ensure that the best possible service and the best delivery of it can be made available to those who need it. As Senator O'Toole pointed out, it is not just in this area but in other areas, such as autism, where services can be resourced or put in place which would make an extraordinary difference to the lives of those involved. Obviously early detection is extremely important, as are continual service, regular reviews and managing the problem.</P>
    <P>This problem was diagnosed only in the 1980s. That does not mean it arose then. Obviously this means a considerable number of adults continue to suffer from attention deficit disorder whose lives have been blighted by it or who have suffered a lesser disability as a result of it. We must not forget those people in this debate and we must ensure that they are remembered when resources are put in place. There are a number of stories contained in the report of the Joint Committee which make harrowing reading. One could not help feeling that a considerable number of people have effectively been failed by the support system. However, it is not too late to do something for them and put an action programme in place to ensure they are no longer failed by the system and that the long years of suffering and neglect they have endured do not continue.</P>
    <P>We are agreed on the problem and the solution. The time for talking is over and the time for action has arrived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the report and welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt. This is the greatest challenge this country faces at present. We are seeing huge social change in our lifestyles and family structures. Social workers and health board officals are agreed that there are major deficiencies in our support services. While I welcome the report and see the need to identify and address problems, I do not approve of pigeon-holing people. A major factor in the problem of attention deficiency disorder is the lack of family support systems in health boards and local authorities. Health boards and local authorities must co-ordinate their structures to support families who are our responsibility. Health boards provide very little support to help families to deal with the problems which affect them on a daily basis. With proper management and co-ordination between local authorities, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and health boards, we could, without major cost, establish structures which could co-operate with families and provide the necessary support structures for the betterment of children and families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently spoke to a front line social worker who deals with problems and crises as they arise. The main function of social workers is child protection, and rightly so. However, their resources are very limited. We must establish family support services which will help families in their diffi<Col N="242" /> culties and with the problems which arise in rearing children and in dealing with the difficulties which arise in homes. A social worker told me recently of visiting a house where a 12 year old child had been left to look after four younger children. Reports can identify problems and categorise situations as educational problems but I believe the most effective way to deal with these problems is to tackle them within the family. Health boards should examine these problems in their totality. They should deal with housing difficulties and provide support groups for families who need them.</P>
    <P>I once saw a young boy clear the cutlery from 200 tables which had been set for a function and stack the pieces neatly. He was trying to show those watching that he was capable of doing something useful. Such children must be helped. Our society and our family structures are changing. We have single parent families headed by men and women and a range of changes in our social structures. We must provide people who can support single mothers and fathers and work with families to provide them with stability and a function in life.</P>
    <P>The report is not unconnected to the problem of suicide. Unless people feel they have an importance and that their existence is meaningful to themselves and to society their problems will not be solved by being analysed or pigeon-holed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, to the House. Like myself, he has experience in his other life of people with ADHD although when he and I were going through medical school the condition had not been heard of. The subject was not on the curriculum. I thank Senator Jackman for putting the subject on our curriculum and for bringing it to our attention.</P>
      <P>We have all known children who were difficult but we could not identify what was causing the difficulty and we were often quite dismissive. It was only when I worked as a GP that I met parents who were under considerable stress caused by the behaviour of, perhaps, only one child in the family. There were no support services. As a GP I was unable to give them any counsel or help and I could only refer them to the school psychiatric service. Even that service is only beginning to come to grips with this problem and is very understaffed and overworked. In my own area there is a three to six month waiting period for assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear Senator O'Toole identify what should be done and where it should be done. I have a slight disagreement with Senator O'Toole. By the time a child reaches the age of five his parents &ndash; and this disorder affects mainly male children &ndash; are distracted and will need very heavy intervention. Continuous assessment of children should begin when the child and his mother come home from the maternity hospital. We must establish structures and, as Senator Chambers recommends, they should be family <Col N="243" /> orientated. We should not wait until a disaster is about to befall a family or a child before taking action. Support structures should be in place from day one. Neither the Minister nor I can wave a magic wand and put everything in place but we should be working in this direction.</P>
    <P>Many adults are irreparably damaged because they were not helped when they were going through the school system. I wonder if the elderly people who are sometimes found dead, having lived alone in cold water flats, might have been suffering from ADHD in their younger years? It is possible that their condition was not diagnosed and they were pushed to the margins of society and left there. So long as they did not bother anyone no one bothered them until they were struck by a personal disaster.</P>
    <P>In her recent excellent address to the joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas the President said that children are not born bad, that there is a tendency to label them as disruptive, that it is adults who make them like that, perhaps through our sins of omission in not recognising their problems and in not taking steps to help them through the systems currently in place, which I realise have to be broadened and beefed up through the allocation of far greater resources.</P>
    <P>As other Senators said this is the time to do so when the coffers are burgeoning. We can afford to put the necessary systems in place at pre-school level to help the children concerned. I do not like using the word &ldquo;treat&rdquo; as it turns ADHD into a medical condition, which carries a stigma. It is behavioural in character and cannot be diagnosed by a blood test. There is a need for continuous assessment and intervention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am not at all pleased with the Appropriation Act or the manner in which its stewardship was handled by the Government. It is amazing, when one considers the figures, that a better job was not done in terms of the budget, the national development plan and the projected social partnership pay deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note in one of today's newspapers that the Exchequer surplus stood at an incredible £698 million in January. That must have brought a smile to the Minister's face. The figure was £72 million this time last year. If we were to have anything like a similar surplus in the remaining 11 <Col N="244" /> months of this year, £698 million multiplied by 12 would give us more than £8.5 billion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That comes from having a good Minister for Finance who knows how to run the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not back Senator Farrell's views 100%. The figures indicate an enormous expansion in the Government's budget. Of the £698 million, £575 million was taken from PAYE earners whose taxes account for the vast majority of the budget surplus. That was described today by Dermot O'Brien of NCB stockbrokers as being quite extraordinary. It is amazing to witness such a dramatic change in the surplus figure from one year to the next. Only two years ago, we did not have any surplus.</P>
      <P>All the indicators are that the economy will continue to grow quite dramatically and that has implications for the manner in which we plan. The figures cited by the Minister in the budget, the national development plan and in the current pay negotiations for a three year deal are dramatically out of date and do not bear any relation, good, bad or indifferent, to the 1999 figures. That issue must be addressed in terms of the Minister's fiscal vision, at least for the period of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>Ireland has only experienced this largesse for a very short time. We now have an historical window of opportunity where we can make Ireland a truly great country. Our economy has been developed on a tiny, fragile base in terms of infrastructure, facilities, ability to combat poverty and social exclusion, house prices, labour force shortages and the issue of asylum seekers. We can now address all of these issues but we are going about it the wrong way.</P>
      <P>Last week I referred to the Minister's speech in which he stated that inflation was expected to reach 1.6% in 1999. We now find it stands at 3.9%, two and a half times the Minister's confident predictions of 15 December 1999. That indicates just how rapidly the fiscal situation is changing. Perhaps the Minister could give us some idea of where those figures came from. How could there be such a dramatic gap between the projected and real figures?</P>
      <P>We are now tied into the euro and are out of line with the sterling area which remains our main market. That means imports will be considerably more expensive than heretofore. We are also beginning to import at a greater rate than we previously did. There is more money in the economy, yet despite this the Minister skewed the budget to ensure that the extra money provided would go more to the better off than to those on low incomes. As a result the middle and upper middle classes will buy expensive consumer goods that will not be available in this country. They will have to be imported from the sterling, dollar or yen areas and this will import inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The low paid pay tax on earnings above £107 per week. IBEC and the Government continue to <Col N="245" /> insist on pegging the proposed minimum wage at £4.40 per hour which will result in a weekly wage of £176. This means that almost £70 of it will be taxed. That is outrageous. How can the Minister insist on adhering to a minimum wage of £4.40 per hour and at the same time refuse to grant any tax concessions on it? He is under pressure from the social partners in the current negotiations to act, but it should not be necessary for his hand to be forced in this way. He should be responsible and lead in this area by giving direction to the economy and the finances. It is a bad omen for future Ministers when the Minister has twisted and turned and shown a readiness to take measures beyond the provisions that could be better introduced in the budget or the Finance Bill. I am surprised and disappointed at the manner in which he has dealt with the low paid.</P>
    <P>Child benefit has also been dealt with in a mealy mouthed fashion. The provision of an extra £2 per week for the first and second child and £2.50 for the third child will not do much for the 40% of children below the poverty line. The Government is seeking to negotiate with the social partners a flat payment of £10 per week to all parents with children under the age of five years. It should have been included in the budget. The social partners seek £20 per week to give a proper chance to children in disadvantaged areas and to parents in impoverished circumstances.</P>
    <P>The only child care provision in the budget was a 100% capital allowance for crèches or child care facilities. Again, this is skewed in favour of the private sector and to those with means. Why can we not have a pre-school service of the kind to be introduced in Northern Ireland? The first major initiative by the Minister there was for state provision of a pre-school service to all. Why can we not do something similar? Given that 40% of children are below the poverty line, it would give the best opportunity to youngsters in disadvantaged areas. We should do something dramatic to benefit children. It would also improve the economy in the long-term. In its general election manifesto Fianna Fáil promised to provide tax relief of £2,000 per annum for married couples. That needs to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Government has offered a package of £1.3 billion to combat poverty and social exclusion over a three year period. This should have been included in the budget and the national development plan. On the news today Fr. Seán Healy rightly rejected the offer. He asked how the Government could consider that a sum of £1.3 billion over three years would be an appropriate amount to combat poverty and social exclusion. At less than £500 million per annum it is a ridiculous proposal.</P>
    <P>Nothing the Government has done to date has addressed the rising trend in house prices nor has anything been done to put a roof over the heads of those who cannot afford one. In 1998 the increase in house prices was 25% nationally while it was 18% in 1999. While the rate of increase in <Col N="246" /> 1999 dropped in urban areas it was 25% in rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is clear that mortgage interest rates are to increase following the decision by the ECB to increase interest rates. Only last month most economists confidently predicted that there would be no increase in rates this month or next. I presume rates have been increased on the back of increases in the US. The impending increase in mortgage interest rates will further escalate house prices and will have an adverse impact on those who borrowed heavily to buy a house. Given the recent survey indicating that houses in Ireland have the lowest standards of insulation and energy conservation in Europe, it is apparent that houses built today are of poor quality.</P>
    <P>It takes two years for a homeless single person to secure accommodation from Dublin Corporation. That is not a glowing tribute to the economy. We have deliberated at length on problems such as hospital and housing waiting lists, inadequate infrastructure and lack of services to children and we have invited Ministers to address them. Neither the budget nor the national development plan contains adequate proposals to deal with these issues and I am not satisfied that the negotiations with the social partners are addressing them. Perhaps a second budget and national development plan would tackle the issues and crises facing society.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Senator Costello's assertion that the Appropriation Act was badly steered through the House. Nor do I accept many of his assertions on what he described as fundamental flaws in the budget and the legislation to give effect to its provisions. The Senator pointed to what he called a number of weaknesses on discretionary spending in different areas. The approach taken by the Minister and the Minister of State to the past three budgets has not only borne fruit but propelled the boom in the economy.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello also referred to inflationary dangers. Some economists have expressed concern. However, the Minister and Minister of State have said that taking all factors into account, they are satisfied that the budget, the national development plan and other strategies take account of social exclusion and are adequate. They are also satisfied the economy is sound enough to take account of the programmes that will be put in place. The Department of Finance project is for an average annual inflation rate of 3%.

      <P>While this may be higher than the EU average it is low in the context of our exceptionally strong economic growth. The Senator knows as much about economics as I do and where there is exceptionally high economic growth, as opposed to less strong economic growth in other countries, inevitably there will be an inflation dimension.</P>
      <P>The latest inflation figures released by the Central Statistics Office show that headline inflation for December was 3.4%. This high figure is the result of temporary adverse factors, such as higher import prices due to the strength of sterling and higher oil prices. These pressures are expected to ease over the year resulting in an annual average of 3% for the year as a whole. It is projected that inflation should average at or below 2.5% over the period 2000-05.</P>

      <P>Mine is merely a humble expertise from the 1970s school of economics, updated now and then. I listen to experts but do not always agree with them. I have confidence in the figures being put forward. The 3% projection is a broader measure of a harmonised consumer price index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello also referred to the house price inflation. We all agree there is a crisis. The Senator said Government had done nothing about it but the contrary is the case. The Government has taken temporary measures to try to halt the spiralling house price inflation and those short-term measures have had the effect of cooling down or reducing the rate of increase. Anybody who knows anything about the basic laws of economics knows that it boils down to demand and supply. The demand is escalating out of con<Col N="248" /> trol and one cannot simply pull thousands of houses out of the air.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of the efforts made at Dublin Corporation to get a few additional houses on the fringes of the city but obstruction after obstruction was foisted on the council by a certain group of parties to stop building on those lands. I ask myself how a person can talk out of both sides of his mouth. On the one hand he says that the Government has done nothing about house price inflation, which is rapidly getting out of control according to these so-called experts, yet at the same time these same people are blocking every attempt to build a house on a piece of land. It defies logic.</P>

I do not mean to be argumentative but I have to address this issue which we admit is serious for our economy and for young couples trying to get houses when their wage increases have not and could not match the spiralling inflationary trends in house prices. I intend to deal in detail with educational deprivation and disadvantage if I have time because I have a few figures to throw at Senator Costello and his party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Act. The budget and the Acts that give it legislative effect reflect the vision of the Government, the Minister for Finance and his Minister of State at the Department of Finance and the objectives set <Col N="249" /> out for the short, medium and long-term development of the country. The budget plays an important role in influencing the domestic economy. This has never been truer than with the current budget. Many people say that the budget was not that welcome because the national development plan for the next six years which preceded it rendered it obsolete. I do not agree. It was preceded by some days by the national development plan which provides a blueprint for the economy over the next six years. Yet the reality is &ndash; and I am supported by many people, including the Minister &ndash; that the national development plan depends enormously for its successful delivery on the very measures which the budget and the related legislation introduced.</P>
    <P>The budget strategy is formulated against a background of a very buoyant economy. It does not take a genius to know that. We are all witnessing that the national infrastructure is under considerable strain. There are labour shortages across a broad spectrum of the economy and the housing market is still in crisis, although slightly less than it was. With these factors the Minister had to focus firmly and carefully on the negotiations for a successor to Partnership 2000. As Senator Costello has left the Chamber I will not dwell on this. His focus was entirely on the budget, that Partnership 2000 did not really count and that everything should have been signposted in the budget. I wonder what his trade union friends and colleagues would think of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged responsibly and took into account that a partnership discussion that had already commenced would have to be taken into account sensitively when he was formulating his budget proposals. The negotiations had just commenced at that time. His real challenge was to strike a balance between a number of competing factors, for example the high and rising expectations of various interest groups. The newspapers were fuelling these expectations. We all know what happened in the past when they were let out of control and how wage and salary expectations caused inflation because of the way they were handled. The real needs of the economy also had to be taken into account, which is fundamental.</P>
    <P>In addition, consideration had to be given to the threat of overheating through inflationary pressure from various sources, whether from wages, consumer demand or other corollary factors, all of which come, ironically, from the successful management of the economy by the Government. All these pressures compete and the Minister had to strike a reasonable and fair balance in the budget, yet at the same time take account of external factors. Any reasonable person wishing to be objective is compelled to admit that in overall terms, given all the many mitigating factors, a fair and rational balance has been struck.</P>
    <P>There are problems and shortcomings. The national partnership negotiations are almost con<Col N="250" /> cluded. I am confident they will be concluded and that a fair and reasonable balance will be struck between all the competing interests. Some of the purists among our economic experts &ndash; and I could name a few of them &ndash; decried the budget immediately because capital spending, as opposed to what Senator Costello spoke about, was to rise by 26%, much of it to be spent on social infrastructure. While they accepted that social inclusion was given major priority, they unashamedly said budget policy and national plans should have as their singular priority the securing of the economy and not, as they put it, pander to the poverty lobbies. This was most unfair and an insult to voluntary organisations who lobby the Minister and the Government to take full account of poverty, deprivation, social exclusion, etc. in these booming times. Judgments such as these in boom times invoke the wrath of all well meaning people concerned for the plight of the poor and the socially excluded.</P>
    <P>The social welfare package in the budget amounted to £400 million and there is scope in the partnership talks for further top-ups. This is the largest ever provision for social welfare, with payment dates being brought forward. Reports in today's and yesterday's newspapers suggest substantial additional top-ups. These features mark a significant further step on the road to creating an inclusive and socially cohesive society in the new millennium. Total spending by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will be almost £5.4 billion. Additional social inclusion measures, before any top-ups agreed in the partnership talks, will bring current spending to almost £500 million in a full year. For example, the weekly income threshold for family income supplement is being increased by £13, resulting in an additional benefit of about £8 per week.</P>
    <P>Other social welfare payments also show significant increases. Pensions, for example, were given priority in 1997 and 1998 and in the 1999 budget they were increased by a further £7. In the past week the Taoiseach publicly and categorically stated that the elimination of poverty will be a primary target in the national development plan which has funding of £40 billion. The aim is to tackle social disadvantage and try to provide a better quality of life for all our people. As the Taoiseach said, we must confront the cliché that the poor in society will always be with us.</P>
    <P>I was very heartened to receive, as did all Oireachtas colleagues, correspondence from the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services for People with Mental Handicap, an area in which I have taken an interest and produced a document on in the mid 1980s. The letter said:</P>
    <P>The National Federation of Voluntary Bodies welcomes the provision in budget 2000 of £28 million Revenue funding &ndash; £35 million in a full year &ndash; together with a three-year £80 million capital programme for new service <Col N="251" /> developments for people with intellectual disability.</P>
    <P>Those with an intellectual disability are the voiceless in our community who depend on voluntary bodies to speak for them. The letter continued:</P>
    <P>The provision of 555 new residential places, 185 new respite places and 100 new day places in 2000 will make sufficient inroads into the waiting lists for services.</P>
    <P>I have never read a similar comment from this voluntary body. The letter concluded:</P>
    <P>The national federation would like to convey our sincere gratitude to all . . .  and request your continued support for the elimination of waiting lists within the three-year timeframe as announced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and am glad of the opportunity to speak on the Appropriation Act. I intend confining myself to two major topics which relate to infrastructural development and decentralisation. I may have a slight parochial interest in what I say, but I am sure this will not surprise the Minister.</P>
      <P>The national development plan must be wholeheartedly welcomed by everybody. Fortunately, for the first time we are capable of delivering and implementing the type of development required for the next 20 to 30 years. We can plan ahead and put in place the infrastructure required for the years and generations to come. I do not think we have ever been in such a position. In that context the national development plan is particularly important. It has identified some of the most important areas which have been neglected through the years by successive Governments, mainly because of a lack of cash. Now that we are in a position to do something I wholeheartedly welcome the approach of the Government in the plan to develop the main road network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main centres of population include Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Wexford and it is important that there is a proper road and rail network between them and Dublin to accommodate traffic and business. A difficulty arises in relation to the N9 which links Waterford with Dublin, as there are a number of options which the National Roads Authority can consider in terms of upgrading the service between the two major cities. The existing route, the N9. runs through Thomastown, Paulstown, Carlow and Kilcullen, and is crying out for development, probably more than any other road in the country. The Minister of State, who regularly travels the route, is well aware of this. Over the past number of weeks there has been a debate about the route the NRA may select for upgrading the connection between Dublin and Waterford. It is <Col N="252" /> imperative that the NRA selects the N9. The important issue is not just the route but the area it will service. The difficulty with taking the N11 as the main route is that a huge area around Carlow, Kilkenny, parts of County Laois and south Tipperary would not be serviced at all by a proper road network. For that reason it is particularly important that the N9 is extended to Waterford by means of a motorway or high standard dual carriageway, with an eastern by-pass of Carlow town.</P>
    <P>An issue which has caused much debate in my town over the past few months is where the by-pass of the town should be located. The obvious route is east of the town. If one takes the western route, as is proposed by a number of people, new bridges will have to be built over the River Barrow, one to get to the far side and another to get back, which I think is daft.</P>
    <P>The area is divided by the River Barrow into Objective One and Objective One in transition areas. County Laois is in an Objective One area while counties Carlow and Kilkenny are in an Objective One in transition area. It is vital that the correct decision is made as soon as possible so that everybody will know the route the road will take and the standard of the route so that people can plan accordingly. In that context I congratulate Carlow County Council on recently purchasing 70 acres of land to develop an industrial business park on the edge of the town. It is totally dependent on the road taking that route. The case for developing the N9 is strong and there is no other option unless people have other interests which are not based on the proper development of the region.</P>
    <P>The link between Rosslare and the western seaboard should be seriously considered given that it was omitted from the NDP. The N80 which runs from Enniscorthy through Carlow and Portlaoise to the west is crucial because of the importance of Rosslare port. That road also needs to be upgraded to a high standard. If that were to happen, an extremely good network of roads would be in place in the south-eastern region which would link many centres and provide an opportunity for further development.</P>
    <P>The rail service must be upgraded if decentralisation and housing are to be addressed. The Waterford-Dublin service is totally inadequate. Trains do not run frequently enough. The 6 p.m. service to Waterford is the only one which runs in the evening. That is not on in this day and age. Many people who commute daily from Carlow, Athy and Monasterevin would take the train if a proper service was provided. Money needs to be invested to upgrade the line. A service based on the Arrow model should be adopted to service the region as it would benefit Dublin and the towns I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment which the Minister for Finance gave in his Budget Statement. He said that the Government would be much more <Col N="253" /> radical in its decentralisation policy than was the case previously. Only 4,000 jobs were decentralised from Dublin over the past 12 or 13 years. In identifying locations for decentralisation, we must consider why it is being done, what are its benefits and what regions will benefit. Dublin will benefit because the congestion of the city will be relieved to some extent. As a result of modern telecommunications there is no necessity for everything to be centred in Dublin. Decentralisation has benefited towns, such as Waterford, Wexford, Thurles, Kilkenny and Portlaoise in the past. However, Carlow has been omitted again. It is crucial that a Department is relocated to the town. Diversity is required in the area because that will keep it vibrant.</P>
    <P>In a past life I worked as a research officer with An Foras Talúntais, the agricultural research body, which has changed its name to Teagasc. I never understood why its headquarters were located in Sandymount Avenue, Dublin. It did not seem to make sense because all its work was carried out in seven major centres around the country. It is still centred there and it located a horticultural unit in Kinsealy for no particular reason. Research into horticultural and amenity crops can be carried out wherever there is good soil. Teagasc has the opportunity to realise its assets at Sandymount Avenue and Kinsealy and use the money generated to develop its service.</P>
    <P>It is currently involved in biotechnology, which is the science of the 21st century. We have moved away from physics and chemistry. If Ireland is realistic about research, it must get extensively involved in this field. I propose that the Oakpark Centre in Carlow should become the plant sciences centre for Ireland and a centre of excellence for plant biotechnology. The centre's personnel has the necessary expertise and CIT also works closely with Teagasc. Land is available and it makes sense to implement this proposal. However, money is required to develop a proper unit. Teagasc can obtain the money by selling its assets in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Government's commitments in the NDP to investment in infrastructure and decentralisation. I hope that a commitment will be given to the development of Carlow as an urban centre in the not too distant future, not just in terms of its infrastructural network but also in terms of technology and decentralisation.</P>

      <P>The concerns and complaints which have been voiced during the debate emanate from good news but it is only the most negative, cynical and begrudging of people who would not want to be part of this celebration. All of us can recall the bad old days when there was more than 15% unemployment and the House debated economic decline, high inflation and interest rates, which were very much centre stage at that time. The difficulties facing us are the <Col N="254" /> challenges which one expects from success and progress. Nobody could have foreseen 20 years ago that there would be labour shortages in specific industries, the cost of child care would be a significant issue, there would be congestion in major cities and towns, not empty streets, and house prices would escalate in heavily populated areas.</P>
      <P>We must exercise our minds in this regard. The population is young and highly educated. If young people wish to leave Ireland they do so out of choice, not necessity, and wherever they go they generally find a ready welcome in their adopted country. People emigrated during the past two centuries because they had to and they were not always prepared for the new world. They were not always in a position to immediately avail of the opportunities which existed. Today we know that is the case. We now have a highly educated young population, most of whom wish to remain at home, who are able to command exceptionally good salaries. It is not only young people who are benefiting from this good news. Older people are benefiting also. There is a lot of concern abroad for people who are vulnerable, unable to help themselves or who in some way feel deprived. They are all part of the ongoing debate. The bottom line, particularly in the area of poverty, is that there is no better way of relieving poverty than by providing employment rather than thinking only in terms of charity or a hand-out.</P>
      <P>That is the good news story we are talking about and I believe the Government has got it right. Anyone who examines the national development plan will realise that few countries in Europe could feel as confident or as happy as Ireland. It would be wrong, however, for us to rest on our laurels. As well as those that are evident, there are other challenges facing us but if we listen to what people are saying, perhaps those who are less vocal and who may not have any lobby groups behind them, we will meet those challenges. These problems are sometimes aggravated by talk of the Celtic tiger, the almost mystical figure that underlines our economic progress. The Celtic tiger exists, and we should celebrate that, but there is a lot of concern among small farmers in certain parts of rural Ireland in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making an argument for the big farmer, and I do not want to get into the specific issues which come to the fore from time to time &ndash; it is particularly important that many of those issues would be addressed &ndash; but I am thinking of small farmers who in the past could rely on making a living from their farms. They were self-sufficient, and a young person in the family would be proud to inherit the farm and continue in that occupation. That is radically changed now, whether because of market forces internationally, new technology or new demands which are now placed on farmers. That is a reality. When such <Col N="255" /> changes take place, a traditional way of life changes also not only within the farming community but within the general community in that environment. A GAA club may find it difficult to put together a hurling team because most of their young people, benefiting from the new economic progress and the opportunities available, have moved away from their own environment. As a result, rural Ireland in some instances is being denuded, and that is not good. I am talking about the hidden problems. I do not wish in any way to take from what we are now celebrating but our policies must always take these issues on board. We can concentrate development first on the cities and then on the larger towns, and hopefully on the villages also, but there remains a whole area of life from which we can all benefit, even if we do not live in that particular area.</P>
    <P>I am not saying our policies are not focused in this regard. Obviously our policies have to be focused on the populated areas but the time will come when these small towns will prove exceptionally attractive for people as they become more affluent and want to get away from the hustle and bustle of town or city life. They may choose to move to those areas and it is important that the basic infrastructure is there when they decide on doing that. That is already the case where Dublin is concerned. Many people now travel 40 and 50 miles to work, for a number of reasons. They may prefer to live away from the city; house prices are not as high or they may have ancestral ties with the area in which they choose to live. The main point is that it is happening and will possibly happen more in the future.</P>
    <P>In talking about decentralisation, which has been raised in the debate on a number of occasions, perhaps it is not necessary to always talk in terms of decentralising a complete Department. We are living now in a time of technology, with computers and the Internet, and it is not always necessary to be close to the centre of activity. That has been proved already by our decentralisation policy over a number of decades, some of it experimental, which nevertheless has been highly successful. It would be worth examining the possibility of decentralising smaller agencies to particular areas as a workable proposition because it would greatly benefit a small number of people. There would also be a consequential follow-up to that type of decentralisation. From the point of view of technology, it is no longer necessary to have large buildings for that purpose. I can think of many areas that could be considered for decentralisation and which would be particularly appropriate to the environment in which they would be sited.</P>
    <P>Such an initiative would be good for the quality of life in Dublin. We all join in the sense of success in Dublin but there is another aspect to that, and I am thinking largely in terms of tourism. I <Col N="256" /> do not know whether Senator Doyle will agree with me, having been pivotal to a lot of the activity, but Dublin has become an exceptionally attractive city, particularly for young people, internationally. It is a fashionable place to visit; one need only look at the number of new hotels. I do not know what the latest figure is but there must be 160 or 170 hotels in Dublin. Driving in a certain area, one is often surprised to see another hotel has been built, as we can see in the Ballsbridge area. That is a good development and I would not be among the pessimists who say they hope it lasts. I believe it will last, but I would be concerned that the very thing which makes Dublin attractive could be undermined. We advertise Ireland in the context of space, facilities and amenities, yet when people come here they are back to what New York City was like 20 or 25 years ago, with everybody tooting the horn, until legislation was brought in to stop it. That would bring about an urgent decline in Dublin. It would not be a gradual decline, and we should seriously examine that because Dublin is becoming congested. More and more of the population are moving here.</P>
    <P>Another area I would like to touch on is the contribution made by the people who went abroad over the years, because of economic necessity or otherwise. In the context of the peace process, I do not believe the President of the United States would have played such an intrinsic role were it not for the role the Irish community played in the development of the United States; in other words, it was payback time. The same applies in Britain. The Irish community played a positive role in Britain and they had a very good image there. People had first hand experience of the Irish, not just through headlines but from working with them in industry and they were aware of their dedication and integrity. In return the tourist business benefited from that because much of the interest in Ireland would have come through the Irish community abroad. In a time when we are doing exceptionally well economically, those making policies should keep those people in mind. That would make it possible for them to come back to Ireland with their newfound experience or with money to invest.</P>
    <P>Recent surveys have shown that people who emigrated in the fifties and sixties, many of whom never married and are living in Britian, are deprived. Those people should be able to come back to Ireland and avail of our new found opportunities and affluence. While discussing the Appropriation Act and focusing on the national development plan, we must bear in mind that there are other things besides economic progress. I would like to think that as we cultivate our economy we would not cultivate a corresponding greed. Many people say greed is central to much of what is happening here.</P>
    <P>Much of the language being used today in relation to refugees or other immigrants is close <Col N="257" /> to being racist. Instead of using our affluence to help the less well off in the same way as other countries helped us, we must make sure to minimise the whole concept of greed. Likewise, when people are doing well I would not like them to forget those who are not. Some people are not as well off as we would like them to be. We should keep them in mind when it comes to the distribution of wealth. They may have suffered for their country and are perhaps in nursing homes now, are unemployed, are grieving as a result of a bereavement or illness in the family or are suffering because of the excesses which our new economic climate has brought. Certain sections of the community are suffering because of the excesses of affluence. It is important that we look after such people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. We have a good reason for celebration and this has been recognised by all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to speak on this motion. The Appropriation Act deals with many areas including Government spending and national and parochial issues.</P>
      <P>We should reflect from where we have come. It is fair to say that this country was as close to bankruptcy in 1987 as makes no difference. Twelve years later we have arrived at a place beyond our wildest dreams. Successive Ministers for Finance through their prudent handling of the economy have brought us here. They should take a bow for the fantastic job done.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance received a great deal of criticism, not all of which was justified, when he introduced the last budget. I welcome the efforts made by him in various areas. The most controversial issue related to the concessions made to double income families. The Minister was trying to address the problems of people who have to pay for second cars and child care facilities. He has gone a very long way in making it worthwhile for both partners to work. He is to be complimented for extending such benefits to the stay-at-home housewife, in particular those caring for young children or elderly relatives. Those who care for elderly relatives at home do so at enormous saving to the Exchequer. I am quite sure the Minister will extend such benefits to those at home who do not care for families. A person drew to my attention recently to something which I had not thought about before. We all believe that when one's family has been reared we do not incur the same expenses or problems. Let us take, for instance, the family with two or three children at college who come home at weekends and make huge financial demands on their parents. We must look again at the possibility of making concessions to such people. The Minister has gone a long way in dealing with the problems in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Gibbons referred to decentralisation. Decentralisation is to be welcomed. It would be <Col N="258" /> most welcome in Limerick and Newcastlewest which has had its fair share of job losses. I appeal to the Minister to consider decentralising a Department to Newcastlewest which has the required infrastructure in place.</P>
    <P>A pilot scheme for rural tax designation in the upper Shannon region was introduced by a Minister for Finance some years ago. It has worked very well. I hope the Minister will consider extending this scheme in his forthcoming budgets. The Leader groups in Newcastlewest and north Cork have made a very positive and worthwhile submission to the Minister on this issue. It is very important to have that scheme extended to the Ballyhoura, Duhallow and Newcastlewest regions. There is a very serious population decline in our towns, villages and open countryside, we have a high economic dependency ratio, there is very serious dereliction in the towns and countryside, we have a lack of quality accommodation to rent or buy, we have poor infrastructure, unemployment, under-employment in small businesses and farms and a very high dependency on agriculture. Sixty-seven per cent of our population depends on agriculture which we all know is declining. People are no longer getting involved or remaining in farming. From a young person's point of view, farming hours are very anti-social and the rewards are not as generous as in other areas of employment.</P>
    <P>We have a lack of high skilled employment, an under-developed tourism industry and a serious lack of enterprise space. There was a time when the IDA would have provided advance factories. They are no longer doing so which I regret very much. We have a lack of local or inward investment. Such investment would come if the Minister could see his way to extending the scheme in the upper Shannon region. I know that some of the benefits of the scheme were held up in Brussels for some time but that is no longer the case. I fully understand that the Minister wants to wait and see how the scheme works but my information is that it is working very well and the benefits are positive. I appeal to the Minister of State to use his influence with the Minister to see if the scheme could be extended.</P>
    <P>Some of my colleagues referred to the national development plan. While it is not entirely appropriate to this debate, we are talking about Government spending in the region of £40 million which is very welcome. That spending will take place over the next seven years and has the potential to take us to a new plane but it will involve more social partnership and the Government taking more initiatives. I hope it can be achieved over the seven years. It involves £40 million worth of investment in creating opportunities and development infrastructure. That is a massive amount of money and we should not lose sight of the fact that only 7% of that is made up from European Structural and Cohesion Funds. We have come from being totally dependent on those funds to the pleasant position where we can <Col N="259" /> provide the vast amount of funding from our own resources. We are on our own to a great extent and that is why the private and public sectors must gel together to bring this nation up to the level it can attain.</P>
    <P>I will now welcome some provisions in the national development plan. One of these is the allocation of £3 billion for water and sewerage infrastructure for our towns and villages. This provision will solve many of our problems because a small water and sewerage scheme can be the life blood of any village. Our planning and housing problems can be addressed if we have the infrastructure in place to continue the building programme. We are having extreme difficulties with planning applications in parts of my county, as I am sure is the case in other counties. The right place to build houses is in our towns and villages, which we will now be able to do because the Minister is making a massive amount of money available for sewerage and water schemes. This will not only retain the existing population but attract more people from larger towns. In a thriving rural community the number of teacher posts is guaranteed and the post office and Garda station will remain open. All of those things are important to the fabric of rural life.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the massive amount of money that has been allocated in the plan for marginalised people. I am referring to health services for people with mental and physical disability who have cried out for years for the recognition they are now receiving. These people and the organisations which represent them are the first to say thanks. They acknowledged that we have made a huge effort to provide extra facilities for them.</P>
    <P>Benefits have been extended in the budget to married couples but I would like further benefits to be extended to married women who, perhaps, do not have to care in the home for people but have students in college. The rural tax designation is vitally important to the part of the country that I come from. Decentralisation would also be a huge boost. All these issues can be addressed in time. We have come a long way in 12 years and I hope we can continue to make progress.</P>
    <P>Money is no longer our problem. Some Members may have touched on this during the debate on previous days. We have more money than we can spend and that is a problem. Over the past 12 months I know from local authority level that while we have the financial resources we do not have the engineers or the materials. There is such a vast amount of work going on in road construction and building across the spectrum that we will have serious difficulties in physically putting the plan in motion. We are all aware that engineers are walking out of county councils on a weekly basis because they can get better pay and conditions in the private sector. They also have a choice as to where they want to work. They can work at home whereas before <Col N="260" /> they would have had to travel 50 miles. That is a genuine worry.</P>
    <P>One way to address this problem is to attract into the workforce the young people who were obliged to leave this country many years ago due to economic difficulties. Furthermore, we will have to attract people from other European countries and EU members states, particularly skilled labourers. Without the help of these people we will not be able to put the plan in place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am glad to have had this opportunity to say a few words on the Appropriation Act. </P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I gather he was a distinguished Member of this assembly in a previous life and made many fine contributions to it.</P>
      <P>I will start by dealing with the medical and social welfare aspect of the Appropriations Act. I welcome the substantial funding increases for services to the elderly, an increase of £35 million. These people built this country and they deserve every penny. They deserve the recognition, albeit financial, for their endeavours. They raised this generation. They laid the seeds and nurtured what we are now pleased to call the Celtic tiger. At the end of their days or in their twilight years they are more than entitled to recompense and recognition of the efforts they put in. It was not easy, it never is easy, to raise a family but in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s it was particularly difficult with serious financial constraints on everybody. These people battled through. They stayed on and raised families in Ireland while other people had to go abroad, through no fault to theirs. They had to go abroad to seek fame and fortune. Some people fell by the wayside and became marginalised in foreign countries. An unskilled person who emigrates will start at the bottom of the ladder. If they settle down, get married and raise a family, perhaps the children will reap the benefit of their parents' work in that country.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the £7 per week increase for old age pensioners. There has been some griping about this. We should consider that the United Kingdom, a far wealthier country, could only grant a 75p per week increase to its old age pensioners. That gives us food for thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad this budget is people centred. At the lower end of the scale, £10 million more has been given to people with physical disability and a similar increase of £10 million has also been granted to people with a mental handicap. Last but not least, the dental services, which with psychiatry were, and still are to a certain extent, the Cinderellas of the medical services, received a £10 million increase. A further £23 million has been allocated to deal with hospital waiting lists. A crux in modern society is that the more we pour into health services and hospital care the longer the waiting lists become. In many cases this is a function of new technology, greater nutrition and <Col N="261" /> people living longer. Forty years ago a person suffering from a bad hip had to live with it but now it can be replaced. When a person suffers a heart attack or their coronary arteries are silted up, they can be replaced. All of these procedures take time.</P>
    <P>I come to another problem that was mentioned in another context by the previous speaker. The health services are finding it difficult to get appropriately trained staff. When we do get them or train them they leak out of the system. They take up other jobs outside of the system. I am a GP and for years the sales representatives who came to me were predominantly male. Now I have noticed that they are younger, female and most of them have a nursing qualification or a degree in biological sciences. These people are being lost to our hospitals. It is hard to blame them in the current context of greater mobility and financial rewards for working in the private and economic sectors. We will have to examine this issue again.</P>
    <P>Health and social services are highly labour intensive. To attract the right people into these services we will have to pay salaries that are appropriate to their skills, training and the demands placed on them. Working in the health services at either the clerical or clinical level is highly demanding and stressful. People are beginning to suffer burn out because the demands and expectations being placed on them in the practice of their profession are enormous. They are not prepared to accept anything other than the best. The gold standard of health care is not being set by the Royal Colleges but in the Four Courts on Dublin's north quays.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to infrastructure. Lavish amounts of money have been put into the roads infrastructure and there was an allusion earlier to the advisability of using the N9 as the direct road to Waterford as against using the east coast route. The Minister of State will have his own ideas about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a shame to miss the beautiful east coast, the garden of Ireland and the model county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a debate for another forum. The National Roads Authority will deal with it in the fullness of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rail infrastructure is also of great interest. The only Euro route in Ireland runs on the east coast from Dublin to Rosslare. However, the railway line from Dublin to Rosslare, which is probably one of the three major ports in Ireland, is extremely poor. It requires much upgrading and I cannot see why it should not be made double track from the port to Dublin and on to Larne. It would also be desirable to run this Larne to Rosslare line through Dublin Airport. That would connect three main entrance and exit points to the island of Ireland. I do not believe that the Luas, as proposed, will be able to cater <Col N="262" /> for the huge numbers coming through Dublin Airport. A Luas carriage will carry a maximum of 100 passengers but the airplanes arriving at the airport are carrying 300 passengers at a time. People expect to be moved quickly and expeditiously to their destinations. This is where the railway system alone can be effective.</P>
    <P>If the radial lines from Dublin to Wexford, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Sligo are developed and if our economic growth continues at its current pace, these lines will be unable to take the traffic that will seek to use them. We should also, therefore, look again at upgrading the line from Rosslare to Carrick-on-Suir and on to Limerick, Claremorris and Sligo. The Sligo to Claremorris line has been closed for the last 30 years but the rail bed is still there. It can be redeveloped or upgraded in a relatively short time because it will not be necessary to go through the planning process. Planning would not be an issue for the upgrade or development of, for example, the Cork to Youghal line and the line from Clonsilla to Navan. The latter rail bed still exists, substantially intact, even though it was closed over 40 years ago. We should look at what we have in rail infrastructure and build on it because people expect to be moved quickly between destinations.</P>
    <P>We cannot allow Dublin to become a major conurbation, sucking life from the rest of the country. We must develop nodes around the country. Cities such as Galway, Limerick and Waterford are reaching critical mass. Other areas will have to be developed and the infrastructure will have to be provided so people can live there and commute quickly to major cities. It is ridiculous that it takes one and a half hours to travel by rail from Athlone to Dublin. The journey could be much faster by upgrading the line and using Arrow trains on continuous welded rail.</P>
    <P>We must look at what we have and how we can build on it. We cannot waste this money. We must put it into the economy for future generations. We do not want them to look back and say, &ldquo;My God, they wasted a golden opportunity to develop the country and install infrastructure&rdquo;. I must allude to another infrastructural item, fibre-optic cable. A lot more of this cable should be laid throughout the country to connect towns and cities. The capacity of fibre-optic cable should also be upgraded because it will allow many people to work from home or from their local areas. Government offices could be located anywhere while multinationals could locate offices in any part of the country and be in daily contact visually and by telephone by using fibre-optic cable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to discuss a number of issues which are important for the country's development. We are criticised for some developments which took place in the past but great credit is due for many others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> People in rural areas tend to talk about the roads and the problem of getting from A to B. Mention was made of the railways but I will concentrate on the roads. We should commend the local authorities and the Government for the money spent to date on the roads, particularly those out of Dublin. The money was spent well and we have reached a point where the national development plan proposes to extend that network further to link the important cities and large towns.</P>
    <P>I read a proposal recently, in the context of the extension of the national routes, to introduce tolling on the national routes to the west. There is a strong view among elected representatives from the west, Border and midland regions that there should be no tolling of the roads to the west. For many years the midlands and the west were considered disadvantaged areas. The east and south were better off but there is no mention of tolling the roads in the east. There should be no tolling of roads to the west, no matter how they are developed.</P>
    <P>Large amounts of money are being spent by the NRA but one wonders why there is such spending when many of the roads will be bypassed in the next four to five years. Motorways will take a vast amount of the traffic currently using those roads. It is hard to justify that spend in those circumstances. The money should be spent on introducing traffic calming measures in our towns and villages in preference to spending it on some of the national routes. We must ensure the safety of people in towns and villages by controlling the speed of traffic and by upgrading the roads and lighting. That is where much of this money could be spent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed spend in the national development plan on housing infrastructure in towns. However, we have lost sight, to an extent, of proper development in these towns. We appear to be expanding these places at a huge rate simply by providing plenty of houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter and I welcome back the Minister of State who was in the House yesterday. I raise this matter to get the Minister of State to outline the reason acute hospitals are penalised for keeping patients for too long without due regard to the medical need of the patients <Col N="264" /> whose interests should be the priority consideration. This has come to light in recent weeks where about ten hospitals have been fined almost £2 million for apparent delays in discharging patients. There is a worrying trend that patients may not be given priority consideration and that hospital administration will take precedence to the point where doctors will be concerned that patients are staying too long.</P>
      <P>All of us have been or have had relatives who have been in hospital. Doctors will usually say that one will be discharged within a few days, a week or whatever. However, various factors can delay that, such as the patient not responding quickly, their contracting an infection or the doctor being very busy in theatre and not being able to discharge the patient until the next day. There are various average lengths of stay in hospital for various medical procedures. For pneumonia, the average stay is 15 days, for angina it is seven days, for cataracts it is three days, for hip replacements it is 17 days, for a coronary bypass it is 15 days and for a hysterectomy it is five days. Obviously no two cases are alike so it is important that the signal be sent out that decisions on the length of stay and when a person will be discharged will be made on medical grounds and not on the basis of financial considerations.</P>
      <P>I accept that hospitals must be run on an economic basis and that, for administrative purposes, it is important that a bed be cleared after a week or ten days. However, a patient's health must be the priority and doctors must make decisions on medical rather than economic grounds. The health, care and welfare of the patient must always come first. I accept the medical service is sometimes top heavy with administration and that there is room for improvement in the running and operation of health boards and hospitals and the administration of procedures. Part of the problem is that a patient may go to convalesce in a nursing home for post-operative care and a bed in such places may not always be immediately available. That is an area which should be examined.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State can reassure us that primary consideration will be given to the health and welfare of patients, that it will the number one priority and that doctors, in consultation with nurses, will make the decision whether it is prudent to discharge the patient or to move them to another place. We are all aware of the chronic situation surrounding the admission people to nursing homes, the operation of the homes and the manner in which beds become available in them. I hope it is not the case that the Department is seeking to penalise hospitals because patients' care and welfare have been put first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case in Drogheda attracted a great deal of attention and Professor Jimmy Sheehan, one of the leading orthopaedic surgeons, wrote to the papers saying it is imperative that the doctor or surgeon makes the decision and that, while there <Col N="265" /> is an average length of stay for cases, every case is different and people could have a setback. He also said that people should not be put under unnecessary pressure because they stay longer in hospital than the average for their condition. I remember a case some time ago in my constituency where a seriously ill woman left hospital early, suffered a relapse and died.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State would take on board what I have said and reassure us that, while she would wish to be prudent, in certain medical cases there is more to it than just balancing the books.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an deis seo a ghlacadh atá tugtha ag Senator Cosgrave to clarify for the House the arrangements in place to ensure the interests of patients are central to all aspects of our hospital system, including hospital funding.</P>
      <P>The motion from Senator Cosgrave refers to the system of what is known as casemix budget adjustments. That forms part of the process by which funds are allocated to hospitals. I reject the suggestion that this system places financial considerations ahead of the welfare of patients. The decision to admit or discharge a patient is, as Senator Cosgrave rightly said, a clinical decision to be made by the individual doctor in respect of the individual patient. The manner in which hospital services are organised, including the contract hospital consultants hold, explicitly recognises this clinical autonomy.</P>
      <P>The casemix system uses clinical information based on the practice of medicine in hospitals to determine the proportion of funding for hospitals. To understand how the casemix places the patient at the centre of the resource allocation process, it is necessary to explain the background to the Department's casemix programme.</P>
      <P>Casemix was introduced in an effort to collect, categorise and interpret hospital patient data related to the types of cases treated. It is an internationally recognised means of allocating funding to hospitals.</P>
      <P>The casemix programme was introduced to the Irish hospital sector in 1993 and has been expanded, with the support of all who work in the hospital system, including doctors, each year since then. The data gathered from patients' clinical records are collected under the national hospital in-patient inquiry programme which operates in 61 hospitals and cost data are collected under the speciality costs programme in 31 of those 61 hospitals. The data collected in respect of each case include the age, gender, diagnosis, procedures performed and status of each patient on discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to make the data more meaningful, they are grouped using a classification system known as diagnosis related groups, or DRGs, with each recorded in-patient care falling into any <Col N="266" /> one DRG. The whole system consists of approximately 500 DRGs. The system is developed on the basis that cases falling into any one DRG will be similar from both clinical and cost perspectives. It is, therefore, possible to compare medically similar cases within each DRG with regard to factors such as cost and length of stay. Medical similarities and differences are therefore taken into account in this system.</P>
    <P>Regarding length of stay, a measure of the average length of stay is arrived at by evaluating clinical practice as it relates to over 340,000 in-patient cases in the 31 casemix hospitals nationwide. The measures against which hospitals are evaluated in respect of length of stay are, therefore, set by the practice of doctors in the Irish hospital system. Cases with a longer than average length of stay actually attract additional credit under the casemix system. Length of stay is only one of many factors affecting any individual hospital's casemix adjustment.</P>
    <P>All funding allocated under casemix remains within the hospital system and any funding deducted from hospitals is distributed to the other hospitals on the basis of their positive performance under casemix. It is also important to bear in mind that casemix is only one of a number of factors affecting hospitals' budgets. The amount deducted from hospitals under the programme is just over £2 million in a general hospital programme of approximately £1.7 billion.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave made it quite clear that he recognises the need to be prudent and to have a system which cuts costs, but I share his view that the interest of patients must be central to any practice. It would be regrettable if the system which transparently allocates funding on the basis of information derived directly from patient care were represented as an attempt to impose arbitrary limits on clinical practice. I reassure the Senator that in all practices it is the intention that the patient should be central.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister of State to the House, particularly in her role as the guardian of children who are at the core of the matter I am about to raise.</P>
      <P>I assure the members of the International Adoption Association that I am not opposed to inter-country adoption. It is a splendid idea and I have an adopted godchild who has given me great joy in her 27 years. I know people who have adopted children from other countries and these adoptions have been entirely successful. However, I am at a loss to understand why the heads of a Bill which was considered to be emergency legislation this time last year have not yet been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission recommended the ratification of the Hague Convention on <Col N="267" /> inter-country adoptions nearly two years ago. This convention regulates adoptions which take place across national borders and is intended to ensure that inter-country adoptions are administered according to high standards and accepted procedures. It aims to provide a mechanism which allows inter-country adoption to take place in circumstances where agreed minimum safeguards have been established and complied with. The convention sets up a system of co-operation between the authorities in the child's country of origin and those in the receiving state. The convention provides for the automatic recognition of all adoptions which have been arranged through the convention process. The Law Reform Commission does not exclude adoptions from countries which are not signatories to the Hague Convention. The recommendations of the Law Reform Commission are based on &ldquo;the primacy of the rights of the child and the principle that the aim of inter-country adoption is to find the right adoptive parent for the child rather than the right child for the adoptive parents&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a most emotive issue. There have been many complaints about delays in assessing couples for adoption. The Eastern Health Board in particular has been singled out for blame and, of course, people who are hoping to adopt a child have the question of their age hanging over them like the sword of Damocles. The question of age can be debated on another occasion. In these emotive circumstances I can understand why people might prefer if I did not bring forward the problem I see arising. This time last year there was a considerable amount of excitement in the press because at least one agency, which was not registered in this country, was advertising meetings in various hotels and there were financial obligations for those who became involved with it. To some people the price asked seemed to be extremely high. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, recognised that this was a case which required urgent legislation but nothing has happened in the interim. This must be a cause of great concern for all of us.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's Department published a major study of inter-country adoptions last year. Ms Vivienne Darling, who was a member of the Adoption Board for 15 years until 1998 and a former head of the department of social studies in Trinity College, pointed out the need for this legislation again recently. She gave as an example the fact that a bilateral agreement with Romania which was made in 1994 proved to be meaningless because couples travelled to Romania in search of children and simply brought them home. The Adoption Board is most reluctant to cause further disruption in the lives of these children by removing them from families. A new agreement was put in place in 1998 which solved some of the problems but the question needs to be addressed in its totality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> International adoption agencies operating outside the State are assisting Irish couples to adopt children from abroad and many people have been extremely grateful for their help. The Adoption Board has brought this fact to the attention of the Department of Health and Children and the board was assured that the promised legislation would address the matter. It was necessary for the board to do this because it is not in a position to regulate the agencies. A year later, nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahey suggested that Irish adoption agencies could be given additional finance to help them facilitate inter-country adoptions. This seemed to me to be a very good idea. No one wants to see the exploitation of people who are hopeful adoptive parents or, worse still, the exploitation of children from abroad. One year on we still await legislation, the advertisements are appearing in the newspapers again and figures between $10,000 and $20,000 are being mentioned. These are very large sums of money.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State has some news on this matter, at the core of which are children who cannot afford to delay any longer.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising an issue which is close to her heart and to my own. It is an area on which I look forward to working.

      <P>Under the existing legislation a society may apply to the Adoption Board for registration under the Adoption Act, 1952. Sections 32 to 39 of that Act, as amended, prescribe the criteria to be met for registration. Such agencies may then make arrangements in relation to adoption, including the assessment of couples and the placement of children with suitable couples. In the area of inter-country adoption one such society, PACT, is currently carrying out assessments for inter-country adoption.</P>
      <P>Under section 6 of the Adoption Act, 1974, it is unlawful for any body or persons, other than registered adoption societies or health boards, to make or attempt to make any arrangements for the adoption of a child. Inter-country adoption is a phenomenon which only dates back to the late 1980s in Ireland with the first specific legislative provisions in relation to foreign adoptions being made in the Adoption Acts of 1991 and 1998. As it stands, any agency can apply to the Adoption Board for registration and will be considered under the criteria provided for in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sending countries have their own legislative and regulatory structures regarding the adoption of children. The bulk of inter-country adoptions involve the adoption of a child in their country of <Col N="269" /> origin. I am aware that many such adoptions are carried out with the assistance of &ldquo;mediating&rdquo; or &ldquo;placement&rdquo; agencies in the country of origin. Some countries of origin provide these services through state structures. Others provide for the accreditation of native agencies to arrange for foreign couples to adopt a child. Some allow third country agencies to make such arrangements. Such agencies are prevented from advertising in Ireland and from accepting payments or other rewards in consideration of the adoption of the child in Ireland. The board has raised in its recent report its concerns about these agencies and the fact that they are unable to regulate agencies which are based outside the State under current legislation. However, the Adoption Board has no jurisdiction to prevent sending countries accrediting agencies to make such arrangements in respect of the adoption of children in those countries.</P>
    <P>An Irish adoption order is not made in respect of such children. On return to this country, an application is made to the Adoption Board to have the child registered in the register of foreign adoption, assuming the effects of the adoption in the country of origin are the same as the effects of an adoption order made under Irish law. Children so registered are deemed to have the same status and rights as children adopted under Irish law.</P>
    <P>In the late 1980s the Hague Conference decided to deal with the subject of inter-country adoption. There were three main reasons. First, &ldquo;the dramatic increase in international adoptions which had occurred in many countries since the late 1960s to such an extent that inter-country adoption had become a world-wide phenomenon involving migration of children over long geographical distances from one society and culture to another very different environment&rdquo;. Second, &ldquo;the serious and complex human problems partly already known but aggravated as a result of these new developments, partly new ones, with among other things, manifold complex legal aspects&rdquo;. Third, &ldquo;insufficient existing domestic and international legal instruments and the need for a multilateral approach&rdquo;. Ireland has signed but not yet ratified the convention.</P>
    <P>The Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, 1993, was drawn up to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or the sale of children and to establish a system of co-operation among countries to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place in the best interests of the child concerned. Essentially, it was drawn up to create links between ratifying countries so that gaps arising in the inter-country processes could be closed by ensuring that there was a link between sending and receiving states' internal regulatory and administrative procedures.</P>
    <P>In the context of continuing work on the preparation of legislation to ratify the convention, my officials have been considering the accreditation <Col N="270" /> of agencies to mediate the placement of children from aboard with couples who have been granted declarations of eligibility and suitability by the Adoption Board. Practice abroad has shown that there are a number of positive features to such agencies being involved in the inter-country adoption process. It has been seen that they can develop an expertise in the area, particularly if there is specialisation in particular countries. By operating on the ground in both countries they can assist in ensuring good practice in matching children and the hand over process. They can also develop good post-adoption support networks for children and their families.</P>
    <P>There are concerns about such agencies, some of which were raised by Senator Henry. These concerns relate to the fees being paid for mediating services and the competition for children between such agencies which can effectively generate markets for children. I share these concerns and would abhor a situation in which this would be allowed to continue. I see the ratification of the Hague Convention, therefore, as a priority to ensure that mediating agencies involved in the adoption process demonstrate high ethical standards, a non-profit ethos and that they view adoption from a child-centred perspective, namely with the best interests of the child as paramount.</P>
    <P>In considering the issue of the accreditation of agencies, my officials have been looking abroad to those countries which have a longer tradition of inter-country adoption. It is notable that third country agencies are not allowed to operate in many of these countries &ndash; these are agencies providing services in a sending country to couples from a third receiving country. Native agencies operate in a closely monitored environment and have strict codes of ethics of their own. Many have development work as their primary service with child sponsoring and adoption as secondary to their primary development objectives.</P>
    <P>An acceptance that agencies can operate in an ethical and child-centred manner is essential to any decision in this area. So, too, is a detailed development of the possible regulatory controls which can be imposed on such agencies in the legislation to ratify the convention. Without further details, I cannot respond specifically to the particular issue raised by the Senator. However, I should point out that any unregistered bodies are prohibited from advertising under section 4 of the Adoption Act, 1952, and from receiving payment in consideration of the adoption of a child. Any improper financial gain in connection with adoption is also prohibited under the Hague Convention. The high level of fees being charged by agencies in some countries has been drawn to my attention. Many couples are, however, prepared to pay these large sums and fail to bring their concerns to the attention of the Adoption Board. Where couples have done so, I am aware that the board has been attempting to monitor the situation and in one <Col N="271" /> case, through the Hague Convention network, to actively seek an explanation of the high fee levels and to negotiate a limit on such fees.</P>
    <P>This matter will be dealt with under the legislation to ratify the Hague Convention. Work is continuing apace on the preparation of the legislation which now falls under my remit and I see this as a priority area if we are to deal adequately <Col N="272" /> with the many complex issues which arise in relation to inter-country adoption.</P>
