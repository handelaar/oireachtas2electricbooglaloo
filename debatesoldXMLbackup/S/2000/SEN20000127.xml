      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to introduce regulations to ensure the fortification of flour with folic acid in view of the many health benefits to be obtained.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to carry out maintenance under the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1995, on the section of the River Shannon between Meelick weir and Athlone town, as a co-operative scheme between the local authorities of Roscommon, Galway, Leitrim, Longford, Westmeath and Offaly and the public bodies of ESB, Bord na Móna and Dúchas.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1 and 2. No. 1, the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill, 1998, Second Stage, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and contributions of other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes. Senators may share time. Item 2, motion re the Appropriation Act, 1999, is to be taken from 1.30 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes. Business is to be interrupted at 3.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. Can the Leader indicate what legislation he intends to take this session? I asked him yesterday. He could either tell the House this morning or circulate the programme to the leaders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add to what I said yesterday as Senator Dardis reminded me that I should have welcomed the decision of the Tánaiste and the Government to bring forward the minimum wage legislation. I also welcome, as I am sure Senators Quinn and Ross do, today's Government announcement on union recognition and the need to get recalcitrant employers to make themselves available to the Labour Court in order that we can have proper industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>An interesting interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a progressive and positive step forward and one Senator Ross will welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator O'Toole raised the matter of union recognition. It is something we have proposed for a long time and was the subject of a Private Members' Bill. We are delighted that at last there will be trade union recognition.</P>
      <P>We are happy enough with the arrangements for the Order of Business but will the Leader clarify the situation regarding No. 3 on the Order Paper, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, 1999, which was debated yesterday? The debate ended in some confusion last night as to how Committee and remaining Stages were to be dealt with and we should have some clarification from the Minister as to when it will be debated again.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader consider a debate on Northern Ireland? Much has happened since we sat last. The Patten report has been implemented almost in full by the Secretary of State and it has caused considerable discussion. There is a new decommissioning deadline and there is also the matter of Deputies sitting in the House of Commons, which is also worthy of consideration. Considering the Agreement runs out at the start of May, we should take the opportunity to listen to the views of the House.</P>
      <P>I know we do this on a regular basis, but will the Leader invite the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with responsibility for housing to the House to discuss house prices? The rate of decrease has declined, according to the latest indicators, but they are still up 18% nationwide. Interestingly, there has been a significant increase in rural areas as opposed to urban areas, so it looks like the trend is reaching the country. This is a matter of serious concern to those looking for accommodation and there is also the problem of homelessness. I ask for an early debate on this matter with the Minister of State concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader inform us as to when copies of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts published before Christmas will be available to Members or have we been forgotten about? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> Will he also inform us when the Finance Bill will be published and if, when published, it will be the final instalment of the budget introduced in early December?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader consider holding not only one but a regular series of debates on inflation, the rate of which is fast increasing? I am not talking about a general economic debate but one on inflation. The significance of figures published in the past week or two is frightening. Inflation could stop the Celtic tiger in its tracks. House price inflation is running at 17%, oil prices are getting out of control and inflation in respect of factory gate figures on which our exports depend is running at 5%. Inflation in respect of consumer spending is running at 3%, a rate on the basis of which we would not have qualified to join the euro. There is a danger of an inflation epidemic. If inflation roars ahead, it could put a stop to our economic growth. I ask not only for a general economic debate but for us to consider the role the Seanad could play in this regard. It could become a focal point for drawing attention to this issue month after month. We could have a short debate each month concentrating on inflation. Will the Leader consider that proposal?</P>
      <P>Regarding two measures initiated in the Seanad, I am glad the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is determined that we should establish ourselves as an e-commerce centre. I congratulate her on that step. I also welcome the fact that the Minister will act to address the potential danger of the large number of motorists driving under a provisional licence who have not passed the driving test. These issues were raised in this House and these steps remind us we can initiate some action rather than just encourage movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader consider holding a debate on the recently published figures by the NRA and on the allocations to it that were announced with great fanfare? Almost every few months the NRA publishes figures and the public wonder what roads will be included under its projects, but it is merely re-announcing the same projects. I am concerned about that. A debate is required on road infrastructure and the problems associated with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey the congratulations of many people around the country to the Taoiseach on the Government's initiative in launching the building of a new national sports stadium that has been long overdue? I wish it well. Senator Hayes referred to the money being allocated for roads, but increasingly money has been allocated to sporting facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hooliganism on the terraces of many of our sports grounds has been a growing trend. Will the Leader ask the Minister to make a statement in this House on whether specific conditions should attach to future sports grants, which would pro-<Col N="92" /> actively encourage clubs to address this issue? I am thinking mainly of soccer clubs. I am a great supporter of Sligo Rovers, the nearest club to me. I go down there quite often and I brought my 12 year old daughter and nine year old neighbour's son to a cup match two weeks ago at which the amount of torrid abuse from a section of the home crowd was astonishing. We need to examine how this can be stamped out, particularly in light of the court case yesterday where a judge criticised a group of Bohemian football supporters for their attacks on Cork supporters at a recent game. This unwelcome trend, which was absent, seems to be creeping into Irish sport. There has been a great tradition of camaraderie between supporters of various sports. I would like to hear the Leader's comment on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House would want to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to send congratulations to the Garda on the interception of a carful of bombs in Tipperary last week. That is a strong argument in favour of decommissioning. We all know there are a large number of arms dumps in the South and that they are in the control of the Provisional movement, but some of this material is leaking out to the splinter groups. There could not possibly be a stronger practical or political argument in favour of decommissioning. We need to urge people in the republican camp to do something about this, particularly in light of the Omagh bombing. Can they do any less than decommission? </P>
      <P>I support what Senator Mooney said about the sports stadium that was announced. It is a most extraordinary gesture by J. P. McManus to give £50 million towards it and to make it a provision that his name should not be included in its title. It is an act of quite extraordinary generosity and I welcome it. Some time ago moves were made to try to attract the Olympic Games here but they were treated with derision. This kind of development makes that all the more possible in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn referred to action to address the potential danger of the large number of motorists who have not passed the driving test. Will the Leader hold a debate on the number of such motorists and include road safety and car insurance, as these elements are intertwined? It would be interesting to know the number of L drivers involved in accidents. Some years ago an amnesty was given to provisional licence holders who were given full licences without passing the driving test. Has research been carried out on the number of those motorists involved in traffic accidents as compared to motorists who passed their driving test? The driving test and the national car test were introduced to improve road safety, but such measures will not make an iota of difference to the price of car insurance or improve road safety. Road safety is not improved by what <Col N="93" /> people know about driving but by what they do when they are driving. They must use common sense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like research to be carried out on the number of L drivers involved in accidents and how many of the motorists who got an amnesty in terms of not having to pass the driving test were involved in accidents compared to the number of motorists who passed their test at that time. The findings of such research would be interesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Quinn for a debate on inflation and its effect on the economy. That is something the Seanad could do effectively. Nobody is taking any notice of these alarming figures that are emerging. Nobody is being told the reasons this is happening. Nobody is saying that what will happen in the next few weeks in the circus that is taking place in Government Buildings will also be inflationary. If the unions are granted 15% over three years plus local bargaining agreements, we will have further inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to pay Senator Ryan a compliment but I shall not do so now. We will have an inflationary situation which nobody in this House or in the other House will stand up against. It is important people should say that if the unions are granted 15%, that will reduce competitiveness in the economy and, with the inflation figures, it will mark the beginning of the end of the Celtic tiger. That is the danger we are in and that is why we should debate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The other reason for inflation is our joining the euro, which nobody in this House will say because they were in favour of our doing so. Our inflation rate is now double the rate of any other EU member state. That is because we joined it without thinking and because Ireland does not matter to those who dictate the rate of the euro.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to <i>The Irish Times</i> to confirm that Senator Ross was wrong. The annualised inflation rate in Ireland is 3.9%. The inflation rate in Spain is 2.8%. I am only an engineer and he is a business editor but 3.9% is not 2.8%. I know this because I can do simple multiplication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What has happened to the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill? Emergency legislation to facilitate e-commerce will serve no purpose if we do not have the telecommunications infrastructure to accompany it. I suspect the Bill is being sat on because the Government is afraid that certain powerful independents believe it will give people the right to put telephone masts wherever they wish. We cannot have a sensible and modern telecommunications system if we do not have the infrastructure to accompany it. The Government must deal with this issue. It has been on the Order Paper for six months and the best the Leader can say is that it is not proposed to take it in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the request for a debate on inflation, like every other index of economic performance, or under performance, it is worthy of debate. However, I wish people in society would not try to pretend that it is caused by the fact that, for the first time in 25 years, lower paid people are in a position in the market to demand something like reasonable wages. They should not be turned into the cause of something that has been equally caused by the euro, energy <Col N="95" /> prices and the welcome increase in the price of cigarettes. Those factors contributed a significant part to last month's inflation figures and it is a small price to pay for a deterrent which might save the lives of thousands of people.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning requested the list of forthcoming legislation. It is expected that 19 Bills will be published between the start of the Dáil and Seanad sessions and the Easter recess. I will circulate the list later to the leaders and Whips of the various groups.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole and Costello welcomed the Bill relating to the minimum wage. I wish to be associated with the Senators' comments and I look forward to the Bill's introduction in the House. Senator Costello asked about No. 3. It is anticipated that the Committee Stage debate will resume next Wednesday. Senator Costello also called for a debate on Northern Ireland and I will facilitate that request. The Senator asked too for a debate on house prices and housing in general and I will also accommodate that request.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan asked about the Finance Bill. It will be published on 10 February. Regarding the report of the Committee of Public Accounts, I understand any Member who sought a copy received one. It is a simple matter of a telephone call.</P>
      <P>Senators Quinn, Ross, Ryan and Doyle expressed concern about inflation. This matter is appropriate to the debate on the Appropriation Act which will continue from 1.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. today. The debate will resume every Thursday afternoon for the next two or three weeks and I hope every Senator will make a contribution.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has made e-commerce a priority over the past 18 months. The Minister should be congratulated in that regard. The Seanad afforded the Minister and Senators whatever time they needed to discuss this matter. I thank all Senators for their participation and congratulate the Seanad on the leading role it has played, in conjunction with the Minister, in highlighting and promoting e-commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farrell called for a further debate on road safety. I will provide time for such a discussion. Senator Tom Hayes called for a debate on the report of the National Roads Authority. I understand there is an increase of 23% in the authority's allocation for this year which is welcome. My county, Westmeath, has responsibility <Col N="96" /> for the new motorways from Kilcock to Kinnegad, from Kinnegad to Athlone and from Kinnegad to the Longford border. Westmeath County Council has been given responsibility for approximately £580 million and it will head up the design team in the midland counties.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a unique occasion and I am very proud and privileged to move a Labour Party Private Members' Bill in Seanad Éireann in Government time. The Bill was debated in the Dáil after it was moved by my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan. I thank the Minister for accepting the Bill in principle. Important amendments have been already discussed and some were accepted in the other House. Other important amendments remain to be made and I look forward to Committee Stage when they can be debated in detail. I hope the House can add constructively to the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to correct an injustice done to a group who, all Members would agree, have already suffered horrendous injustice. As children, these people were subjected to physical and sexual abuse and were effectively disbarred from seeking legal redress because of the current Statute of Limitations Act which effectively gives them only up to the age of 21 to initiate a legal action against the offenders. The fact that the Bill has been accepted in principle by all parties proves there is a widespread consensus that the balance in the legal system needs to be tipped to ensure that justice is available to this most sinned against group in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past years our society has finally begun to lift the veil of silence which kept the <Col N="97" /> whole issue of the physical and sexual abuse of children hidden and secret. The horrendous stories of abuse in the past decades and in more recent years have shocked us to the core as a society and forced us to face up to some harsh realities.</P>
    <P>We have begun to learn about where power has resided in Ireland, the nature of power and how it has been exercised. In particular we have learned how power has been abused. We now know the power of the church, the State, and authoritarian parents has been used to physically and sexually abuse children and to allow it to continue and, effectively, to protect those who have been responsible, while victims continued to suffer in silence and were not believed. They simply had nowhere to go.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to give victims an extension of the right which currently exists to take legal action on the basis that it is not tolerable that people should effectively be debarred once they have reached the age of 21 from taking such legal action. The Bill has its roots in the Sophia McColgan case. This case involves the action taken by Ms McColgan and her siblings against the North-Western Health Board and a general practitioner for their failure to act when evidence of severe abuse of these children over a number of years was presented to them. The children took the case as adults. Ms McColgan had allowed more than three years to elapse after her 18th birthday before initiating the action. At that time the health board claimed she was statute barred since the existing Statute of Limitations Act only allows an action to be taken within three years of the occurrence of the act being complained about. Since the case was settled out of court no legal judgment, which might have lit our way on this matter, or legal precedent is available.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to remedy the situation. It seeks to accommodate cases of childhood abuse by extending the definition of what is known in this context as a disability during which time the clock does not run on the statute of limitations. Being under a disability in this context generally means the plaintiff is under 18, of unsound mind and, therefore, unable to take a case. By extending the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; the Bill provides that a person can be regarded as having been under a disability by virtue of the severe emotional or mental injury suffered and attributable to the acts complained of, that is, physical or sexual abuse. In other words, they had been so assaulted as to be considered unable to make a decision to take such an action. This is a reasonable position.</P>
    <P>Ms McColgan relates in her excellent book on the experience written by Susan McHale that she was unable to confront her father until such time as she had built a life for herself, got a degree and gained a measure of self-belief and self-confidence. It is not unbelievable that a person would be so traumatised and damaged by the experience of childhood abuse as to be unable for many years to confront it sufficiently to take a legal <Col N="98" /> action. While Ms McColgan was in her twenties when she initiated the action others could be in their forties, fifties or older before being in a position to confront the offender and come to terms with what had taken place in their childhood. Sophia McColgan's is not the only case.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, who introduced the Bill in the Dáil told the House that the Minister for Education and Science, in reply to a parliamentary question, had told her that 145 cases relating to his Department, involving allegations of sexual or other physical abuse of children in State-run or State-supported institutions, have been initiated. This was in the middle of last year. In February, 1999, <i>Magill</i> estimated that 560 victims were suing the State and the Catholic Church. The Artane boys' school case which has come to light recently is enormous and adds to a long list, including the Kilkenny incest case, Brendan Smyth, Ivan Payne, Donal Dunne etc. There will be more.</P>
    <P>We are witnessing what I and many others would consider to be one of the most painful periods in our history in that we are coming to terms with a heinous breach of trust by a number of people, entrusted by the wider community with the care of children. It is necessary for us as a community to confront what happened in the past, to make proper reparation to victims and to ensure it does not happen again.</P>
    <P>In the past number of years we have heard unbelievable stories of cruelty, trauma, abuse and torture of children, many of them in the care of institutions run or funded by the State. The Government's response in the establishment of a commission on childhood abuse goes some way towards tipping the balance in favour of victims as well as constructing a mechanism whereby victims will be heard and facts investigated, particularly allegations of systematic abuse in institutions run or funded by the State. This is essential. I note this morning's newspaper reports that the Government intends to take a new approach in this commission by establishing a two-stranded approach, one which would investigate facts and make findings and the other which would allow victims to speak. There is some merit in this approach but a number of issues remain to be answered in relation to this commission and investigation. One is the discovery of documents and the release to victims of information, particularly that held by educational establishments and former educational establishments, in the context of this commission. The issue of legal representation remains but we shall discuss that at another time.</P>
    <P>This Bill forms part of the wider community response that we must make to ensure that for victims justice is not only done but is seen to be done. The Bill has been debated extensively in Dáil Éireann by our colleagues there and a number of amendments have been put forward, some by my colleague Deputy O'Sullivan, and debated, in response to concerns raised by victims while the debate was taking place. Given that some <Col N="99" /> matters have not been satisfactorily dealt with we will table new amendments on Committee State in an effort to make the Bill as comprehensive as possible. I would point to the need to include physical abuse in the terms of the Bill, on which we shall have an extensive debate. There is also the question of ensuring that the victims of childhood abuse have access to the legal system, in other words, that people who have already visited a solicitor or Garda station on the matter of childhood abuse, with a view to initiating an action, may be considered able under the law and, therefore, covered by the terms of this Bill. This is just one aspect that has emerged and which will be the subject of amendments to be tabled on Committee Stage. The Minister told the Dáil before Christmas he would come to the Seanad and consider a number of issues raised there. I look forward to the Minister's response today.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work done on this Bill by the Labour Party's legal advisers, Finbar O'Malley and Richard Humphries, and thank them for their support and advice to us in bringing it forward and as it goes through the House. I thank also a number of visitors in the Gallery who have a particular interest in this issue and have come forward to debate the matters contained in the Bill. I thank them for their enlightenment, tenacity and courage in bringing forward their own experiences and uncovering that dark episode in our history to ensure there is justice and accountability. They are doing a great service and we should be grateful to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity in this House to demonstrate the Government's support for this important Bill. It is significant legislation for victims of childhood sexual abuse as it will give to many, who might otherwise have been unable to do so, an opportunity to take civil proceedings in the courts to establish liability and seek recompense for the wrongs done to them.</P>
      <P>I again commend Deputy O'Sullivan of the Labour Party for her initiative in promoting this Bill in the Dáil and I take this opportunity of reiterating to Senator O'Meara, who leads on the Bill in this House, the Government's continuing support for the Bill and our commitment to ensuring it makes its way on to the Statute Book without delay.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as initiated, has undergone a certain reworking on the basis of amendments agreed on Committee Stage in the Dáil and the work involved has, I suggest, benefited the Bill considerably. I do not propose to dwell on the various amendments as such because they largely are no longer an issue unless, of course, some Senators were to suggest otherwise, but I will address certain of the principles involved with a view, hopefully, to informing further debate in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> The provisions in the Bill are of a kind which formed a significant element of the comprehensive package of measures which the Government announced a while ago to tackle the issue of past childhood abuse. In order to put the Bill's proposals into context I should like to remind Senators of the more salient features of that package, as announced by the Taoiseach in May last. These include an apology on behalf of the State to the victims of child abuse, the setting up of a commission to inquire into childhood abuse, expansion nationwide of the counselling services available to assist victims of child abuse, the preparation of a White Paper on the mandatory reporting of child abuse, priority advancement of legislation to include a register of sex offenders, amendment of the limitation laws as they relate to civil actions based on childhood sexual abuse and the referral of the question of limitation in other forms of childhood abuse to the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>The unreserved apology made by the Taoiseach on behalf of the State was an important starting point in addressing the wrongs of the past. There was general agreement that this was an appropriate response for the State to make to those who have suffered in childhood; indeed, it was a response with which spokespersons across the political spectrum have associated themselves.</P>
    <P>The Government has been actively progressing the measures announced by the Taoiseach, which represent the considered and proactive policy of the Government in this area. It would be useful if I briefly outlined to Senators the latest developments in the implementation of these measures which fall broadly into two types: steps designed to deal with abuse which has occurred in the past and others aimed at limiting the scope for such abuses into the future.</P>
    <P>The Commission to Inquire into Childhood Abuse, which is chaired by Ms Justice Laffoy of the High Court, has produced two reports on its terms of reference and the powers and protections it requires to carry out its work generally. Following the consideration of these reports, the Government decided to bring forward legislation in order to confer the necessary powers and protections so that the commission can carry out its work as effectively as possible. The drafting of this legislation is at an advanced stage and the Minister for Education and Science will bring the text of a Bill to the Government for approval in the very near future. Rather than discuss the contents of that legislation in a speculative manner, I think it will be accepted that it would be best if we were to wait to see the full text of the legislation before commenting in any detail on it. The commission sittings will provide an opportunity in which victims can tell of the abuse they suffered to a sympathetic and expert forum. It will also provide as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of abuse suffered by children in institutions and other places.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> The health boards, under the aegis of Minister for Health and Children, are co-ordinating the work of expanding the counselling service for the victims of child abuse available in each health board area with the aid of annual funding of £4 million from the Exchequer and recruitment of additional highly skilled staff to boost these services is under way at present.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse is in the process of being drafted and an interdepartmental advisory group is in place to assist in this work.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children is co-ordinating the work on developing the national children's strategy. Deputy Frank Fahey, the former Minister of State with cross-departmental responsibility for children, recently invited submissions to contribute to the strategy; the closing date for such submissions is 11 February next. The strategy will map out a direction for the next ten years through a set of realisable goals which will address all aspects of the child and young person. It will promote the best interests of children and young people, reflecting the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
    <P>As Senators may be aware, I published a discussion paper on the law of sexual offences in May 1998. Much of the paper deals with offences against children and I have recently published the Sex Offenders Bill, 2000, as my initial response to the proposals in that paper. This Bill provides for a major package of innovative reforms to protect the public against sex offenders, including a new notification procedure or tracking system for all convicted sex offenders, a requirement which will also extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad; a system of sex offenders orders, to be issued by the civil courts, to deal with instances where the behaviour of a convicted sex offender gives cause for concern that an order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm; a new system of post-release supervision for sex offenders released from prison; separate legal representation in rape and other serious sexual assault cases in certain circumstances and new requirements for sex offenders when seeking employment where unsupervised access to children is involved. I consider the provisions of that Bill to be of special benefit in safeguarding society, and particularly children, now and into the future against the risk of sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>In particular, the new offence relating to employment is designed to reduce the risk of unsuitable people obtaining access to children through the workplace. Such legislative sanctions, by themselves, will not be sufficient to remove these risks. There will continue to be a particular onus on employers to maintain good employment practice, both during the recruitment stage &ndash; for example, good interviewing practice, checking references, etc. &ndash; and also when it comes to ensuring adequate post-recruitment supervision arrangements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> In the context of the employment of sex offenders, there are already arrangements in place since 1994 whereby the Garda authorities carry out clearance checks in respect of full-time prospective employees in the health care area who would have substantial access to children or vulnerable individuals. These arrangements, which were introduced by my predecessor at that time at the request of the then Department of Health in response to allegations of abuse of children in residential child care centres, are implemented by the Garda authorities in strict adherence to legal advice received in the matter from the Attorney General. It is my wish to have the Sex Offenders Bill in force as early as possible.</P>
    <P>That, then, is the context in which the Government supports the Bill before the House. It is a key aspect of the considerable body of work which now underpins the package of measures that are in train to deal with past and future child abuse.</P>
    <P>In our jurisdiction, the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957, is the basis for the law on limitation of civil actions in personal injuries actions. Only one significant amendment has been made to that statute since 1957, that is, the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991. It is no harm to look in a little detail at the 1991 provision since the changes being brought about by this Bill are comparable in certain respects with the 1991 amendment. Up to that point, the position was that a person had three years from the date of accrual of a cause of action for personal injuries based on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty within which to commence proceedings. That three year period does not start to run during any period where the person is under a disability. Section 48 of the 1957 Act specifies that a person is under a disability while not of full age or while of unsound mind.</P>
    <P>The significant change brought about by the 1991 amending Act was to introduce the concept of &ldquo;discoverability&rdquo; to limitation law as it relates to personal injuries cases based on negligence, nuisance or breach of duty. The effect of this is that if an injured party does not know that he or she has been injured by the wrongful act or omission in question at the time it occurred, the three year period does not begin to run until such time as the person discovers, or could reasonably have discovered, the injury.</P>
    <P>The 1991 amendment was made on the basis of a report on the matter by the Law Reform Commission. That report analysed the approaches to the question of discoverability taken in other jurisdictions as well as the framework of Irish law, both constitutional and statutory, into which such a change would have to be integrated before arriving at a detailed and technically complex set of recommendations for amendment of the law. Among its recommendations, given effect to in the 1991 legislation, was that the new discoverability rule should apply to all causes of <Col N="103" /> action whether they accrue before or after the commencement of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission has also recently produced a consultation paper on another aspect of limitation law, that is, the law as it should apply to latent non-personal damage arising out of professional negligence. This would cover such matters as negligent surveying of a building where defects may not become apparent to the occupier for years, or defective legal advice given to a purchaser on the title to a property which may not emerge until that person goes to sell the property on.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the serious trauma which acts of sexual abuse committed against children can have, often long into adult life, trauma which can prevent the victim from seeking help or redress for the abuse suffered. The psychological disability engendered in the victim by the abuse means that the normal limitation period for the taking of a civil action against those responsible is often long spent before the victim can contemplate taking steps to overcome the after-effects of the abusive conduct. Such persons cannot benefit from the &ldquo;date of knowledge&rdquo; provisions of the 1991 amending Act. They are all too keenly aware of the nature of the wrong done to them, and it is this very knowledge which causes the feelings of guilt and self-blame and gives rise to the disability hindering them from seeking the help which they need.</P>
    <P>By treating such a person as being under a legal disability for the purposes of bringing a civil action, the Bill will enable many, who hitherto could not seek redress in the civil courts against their abusers or those responsible for the acts of their abusers, to embark on court proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands applies to civil actions where the cause of action includes acts of sexual abuse. There is clearly an unanswerable case for this reform of limitation law as it applies to sex abuse cases. This is not to suggest that the issues surrounding other forms of abuse in childhood are regarded by the Government as being less serious or of less significance. I am very aware from representations made and from having heard, at first hand, the harrowing stories of some of those whom I have met, how such abuse has blighted many lives, leaving emotional as well as physical scars. I want to assure such people and this House that neither I nor the Government seek to neglect their position or to exclude them in any manner.</P>
    <P>The issues in relation to other forms of abuse, however, are not quite so clear-cut as they are in relation to sex cases. There are questions arising from the wide range of activities which at one end of the scale would have been classed until not too long ago as reasonable corporal punishment, and which at the other end of the scale are by any standard unacceptable, but may not affect the ability of a person to take legal proceedings in a given time. The Government needs to obtain the advice of experts on whether and to what extent <Col N="104" /> other forms of abuse are likely to have an inhibiting effect on the victim long into adult life.</P>
    <P>Some other jurisdictions have modified their laws in respect of sexual abuse in childhood but not in relation to other forms of childhood abuse. Research needs to be undertaken into the position in a wide range of other jurisdictions so that we can benefit from the experiences of those states that have taken a wider or a narrower approach to the issue of limitation periods for various forms of childhood abuse; understand why different approaches have been taken in different countries; and apply the most appropriate reasoning gleaned from that research to whatever changes we should make in our own law.</P>
    <P>It is because the issues in the non-sexual abuse of children are not clear-cut that the Attorney General, at the request of the Government, referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission. The purpose of that referral is to have the benefit of the commission's research facilities, their well-established consultative processes and most importantly their independent and considered advice as to the way forward in this area of the law. I understand that the commission's researches are well under way and that they envisage publishing a consultation paper on the matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am aware of arguments made that, by referring the matter of non-sex abuse cases to the Law Reform Commission, the Government is in some way rowing back on the commitments given last May. I have also seen and heard attributions of motivation for this referral which are, at best, inventive. Let me say here and now, as I have said before, that there is only one reason for seeking the Law Reform Commission's advice on this matter, and that is to have the best possible advice available to inform legislative change in this difficult area. It does not make sense to pre-empt the advice sought by going ahead with legislation to deal with such cases. Before we can decide what changes should be made, the Government must know how best those changes should be achieved, and I suggest that the Oireachtas should also be in the same position. It would not necessarily make for enlightened law-making to provide, in effect, that a civil action grounded on assault should automatically, and without qualification, be distinguished from all other forms of actionable loss or personal injury which might have occurred before a person's eighteenth birthday.</P>
    <P>I have given repeated assurances elsewhere that I will act on the commission's report in a prompt and pro-active manner. I repeat that assurance in this House.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as originally introduced, would have applied the new disability principle only to instances of child abuse occurring after the passage of the Bill. As the text of the Bill now stands, following Government amendments accepted by the Dáil, the disability principle will apply to all cases of child abuse, whether before or after the passage of the Bill. This approach is modelled on <Col N="105" /> the recommendation on the issue of retrospectivity recommended by the Law Reform Commission, and given effect in the 1991 legislation, regarding the application of the &ldquo;date of knowledge&rdquo; principle. This approach is consonant with legal principle in that it puts all those who shared the disability caused by childhood sex abuse, after the introduction of that concept into law, on the same footing.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed by groups representing those who have experienced abuse in childhood in the past that victims who have already overcome the disability which would have prevented them from taking steps to institute civil proceedings against those responsible for the sex abuse and for whom, by any measure, the three-year limitation period expired before the change in the law now proposed will be unable to benefit from that change. This question of whether the Bill should operate in a more retrospective fashion than that already catered for in the current text involves difficult issues of legal principle.</P>
    <P>I am considering these questions in more detail in consultation with the Attorney General. Those consultations are going on at present. Any proposals I may have as a result of those discussions will be brought forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which is worthy of support and which, most importantly, will be of real benefit to many victims of child abuse. The Government is happy to support the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Jan O'Sullivan on having introduced this Bill in the Dáil. The legislation is commendable, although long overdue. All parties have been somewhat negligent about this matter over the years and they must take responsibility for that. Because of the sensitivity of the issue involved, for many years people were unable to cope and did not want to know about it. That was most unfortunate. The reports on television brought home the stark reality of the terrible events that children suffered in industrial schools and other institutions across the country. Public opinion then forced the political system to take a much more pro-active position on the awful problem of child abuse which existed and, let us not be under any illusions, continues to exist. We are inclined to talk about what happened in the past but we must also be very aware that this is continuing in some places. Structures must be put in place to protect children at all levels. Abuse has occurred in families and in places where people were acting <i>in loco parentis</i> such as institutions, schools, places of recreation and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It takes courage for politicians and Governments to introduce the legislation which is so urgently required. I am disappointed at the Minister's repeated references to the need to refer the issue to various consultative committees, commissions and so on. At some stage, some country had to take the initiative to introduce legislation without the prior existence of a formula in another state. Will we ever be able to stand on <Col N="106" /> our own feet, do what we believe to be correct and act on our own knowledge, information and common sense, rather than looking to models in other countries? We seem to refer consistently to what is done in America, Europe and Australia. We do not feel in a position to introduce legislation until we have collected and collated all the information.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of people in this country, and among those who have emigrated, suffered child abuse in institutions and schools and in their families. We should not underestimate the substantial trauma and huge damage done to those people. We have seen very stark examples of institutional abuse on television. We have also heard stories from individuals, both publicly and in private as politicians, about what happened in various institutions.</P>
    <P>The State stands condemned for what occurred in those institutions for which it had responsibility. The reality is that, until very recently, politicians were so controlled and influenced by the church that they were afraid to take action. That is very sad and deserves to be condemned. They did not have the courage of their convictions to stand apart from what the church was dictating at that time. We know of cases where school managers left teachers in position, whom they knew had committed sex offences against children, and did not take action until a public outcry arose locally. That is extremely serious and should be condemned from the highest level. The Government and the Department of Education and Science ignored or reneged on their specific responsibilities in those instances. I hope this will never arise again and that all State institutions, and the health boards and Departments responsible for them, whether it is the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Health and Children, will take full responsibility. They must be made accountable for any abuse which occurs. The onus must be specifically laid on individuals in particular positions to ensure someone carries the responsibility for the occurrence of abuse.</P>
    <P>We have had very clear and specific instances of abuse in families. There was the Kilkenny case, with the subsequent Kilkenny incest report, and the Kelly Fitzgerald case in Mayo and the subsequent report. Every Member of these Houses is aware of abuse cases in their constituencies. Over the years many public representatives have had the experience of hearing reports that certain matters could be happening in certain households, but when the authorities were approached they were somewhat hesitant about responding or unsure how they should approach the matter. This was primarily due to the lack of specific guidelines, criteria and legislation to guide people such as gardaí under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, officials and social workers under the Department of Health and Children and teachers under the Department of Education and Science. We must examine that and produce enabling legislation which will allow <Col N="107" /> these people to take clear and specific action when a report is made to them.</P>
    <P>Judges in the District, Circuit and, in particular, High Courts have expressed their disappointment with the minimal provision of facilities to deal with sex offenders in comparison with the number who need treatment. It is unacceptable that, while there are facilities to deal with only ten sex offenders, 200 such offenders are serving prison sentences at present. That must be addressed. These people are released into society without having received specific treatment for their particular weaknesses. That is very serious for society because it has been proven that such people continue to offend. Children are being put at high risk by the release of these people. There is an onus on the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide the necessary personnel to treat these people.</P>
    <P>New cases surface every week in practically every county of people who were abused in schools, institutions or families many years ago, some of which date back 20 or 30 years. In many cases, the State has taken the complaints on board, made detailed investigations, found extensive evidence and put together cases. There are cases involving sex offenders before the courts at present and others will come forward shortly. Some of these offenders will plead guilty, which will mean the whole book will not be fully opened, and others will deny the allegations.</P>
    <P>In cases where the defendant pleads guilty, it is very important that the victims, who have given evidence to the Garda, are given an opportunity to make a statement in court and put it on the record. I know if they were all to do that some court cases could last for weeks because of the number of victims abused as children by some offenders. However, I stress to the Minister the importance of his Department engaging in dialogue with the Judiciary to ensure that judges hearing these cases adopt a very flexible and open approach and allow victims, regardless of their number and of the extent of their cases, to make a statement if they so desire. That is important because such people have suffered appalling abuse and need to be heard. For many of these people, it may be 20, to 30 years later but they deserve to be heard. It is particularly important for them that they are seen to be heard, so to speak. Many of these people will travel from America, England, parts of Europe and Australia.</P>
    <P>It is vital that legislation is enacted to protect children today. I am sure if a question was tabled to the Minister in the Dáil on the cost to the Exchequer of investigations of child sexual abuse cases and if a costing was done on the number of psychiatrists and psychologists who have travelled overseas to meet and speak to victims on behalf of the State, it would be phenomenal. This is something which should be taken into consideration. In instances where this is done, it is highly <Col N="108" /> commendable. It should continue to be done regardless of the numbers involved.</P>
    <P>Going to court is a traumatic and slow process. We suggested that a tribunal be put in place soon. I urge the Minister to reconsider his position on that issue. There is a large number of victims who deserve and justly merit compensation. No matter what monetary compensation they receive, it will never undo the damage which has been done to them, the impact on their lives, the trauma they have suffered and the difficulties they have experienced in relationships. No financial compensation will compensate them for those difficulties and we should fully appreciate that. It is important in order for these cases to be dealt with expeditiously that the Minister puts in place a tribunal to hear the cases.</P>
    <P>It is also important that children who are under the age of majority have a facility to lodge complaints and to be heard. That is why it is necessary to appoint an ombudsman for children. Every child knows about Childline because of the advertising campaign over the years. If an equally effective advertising campaign was put in place for an ombudsman and if one was appointed, it would extremely helpful and could be a source of protection for many children. I urge the Minister to consider that matter.</P>
    <P>I understand about 46,000 children went through the industrial school system. Most of these schools were run by religious orders. It is important to put on record that the majority in the religious orders did considerable good work, made huge sacrifices and were extremely kind. However, a minority did much damage and the damage they did spoiled the good work of many others in the institutions. These institutions were starved of financial resources and left unsupervised and unregulated by the State, and it stands condemned for that.</P>
    <P>It is important that those children who are now adults, some middle aged, are compensated for the terrible trauma they suffered. They suffered considerable personal trauma because they were taken away from their families and, in some cases, were never visited by their families or relations. They were left in splendid isolation in institutions in the hands of people they did not know. Some of these people who acted <i>in loco parentis </i>abused their position and they stand condemned for that.</P>
    <P>While talk of investigation continues, legislation is introduced and commissions' reports are presented, it is important that the only person who is protected is the child who was abused or children who are currently being abused. The perpetrators of abuse should not be protected and old age should not be considered a reason not to pursue a person who abused 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Age should not be a mitigating factor in this matter. Whoever perpetrated abuse should be followed to the end and the abused person, the victim, should see that that person is followed. That is extremely important.</P>
    <P>While it is important the Minister listens to various people and groups concerned and hears from <Col N="109" /> interested parties, we must realise that only a few years ago when the then Minister for Education introduced &ldquo;education for living&rdquo; to the schools, there was a group which argued strongly against that because of the damage it would do to children and that it was dangerous for them to be too knowledgeable about matters of sexual nature at a young age. In some instances, there can be a hidden agenda behind many of the cases put forward by certain people or some organisations. Let us be honest about it. I know of cases where people taking a particular stance on that issue could have had other agendas. We should be aware of that.</P>
    <P>It is important the Minister stands up to that. He is an intelligent man &ndash; Senator Ryan said that repeatedly yesterday &ndash; and has common sense. The Minister should stand up, use his intelligence, common sense and life experience and make decisions without too many inputs from too many sources. He has a fair idea of what is going on and a fair amount of common sense about how to deal with the issue. I suggest the Minister takes the initiative, does not wait for too many reports and gets on with it sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>It is a considerable problem and many people have been damaged. It is vital that we, as legislators, legislate to protect children today and ensure children are not abused as they were in the past. As the Minister will know, children in rural areas are being invited into cars on country roads. It has happened in every county, including west Kerry and Clare and it goes on all the time. We must do everything to protect these children and the responsibility lies with us as legislators and, primarily, on the Minister and on his party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill, 1998. At the outset, I compliment the Minister for coming to the House and supporting a Bill initiated by a former Member of this House, Deputy O'Sullivan. It is positive that the Minister has been accommodating and supportive of a Bill introduced by another party, which is not the norm. Normally it is the Government who introduces a Bill. The Minister's position on this matter and the gracious way in which he has accepted this Bill must be recognised.</P>
      <P>I compliment Senators O'Meara and Taylor-Quinn on their sincere contributions to the debate on this sad problem. There is no doubt that there can be no hidden agendas on this issue. I fail to see from where Senator Taylor-Quinn is coming in that regard because this is such a serious and fundamental problem in our society that we must move forward &ndash; whether by introducing legislation, establishing a tribunal or whatever else &ndash; in a spirit of openness and transparency and in the absence of agendas of any sort, hidden or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since he took office, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who, thankfully, remains with us following today's Cabinet reshuffle, has been one of the most reforming holders <Col N="110" /> of that office in the history of the State. The amount of legislation he has introduced and initiated in this House during the past two and a half years is indicative of the strength of his no-nonsense approach. I have no doubt that he will pursue this matter with great vigour and passion and that he will be supported by the Government, which now recognises the problems that have existed in our society for some time.</P>
    <P>If this debate had taken place 30 years ago, the official record of it would make for mind-boggling reading. In my opinion, this debate could not have taken place 30 years ago &ndash; that is a sad indictment of our society &ndash; because of a lack of political will. Abuse of children, whether it took place in the home, was carried out by those acting <i>in loco parentis,</i> or occurred in institutions such as schools, swimming clubs and industrial schools, has gone on for decades.</P>
    <P>I grew up in a humble and religious background in west Cork and I know that people in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s were afraid to oppose the church. That is a simple fact. I know of a case in which took place almost 100 years ago where a young girl was raped by a farm-hand and she was sent to live with an aunt in Boston. Her parents decided to say nothing about the incident because they believed it would bring shame on their family. Unfortunately, this type of situation has been allowed to exist for many years and we put up with it, as did our forefathers. Thankfully, however, it has all come out into the open in the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>At long last there is a political will to set matters right and we are now moving in the right direction. There has been some form of reformation or renaissance in our churches. The abuse which took place was incredible and it is difficult for any sane person to accept what happened. As a family man, I often wonder how I would react if it happened to my children. I have the greatest sympathy for anyone who has suffered any abuse, in whatever situation. Such abuse was undeserved and I am incredulous when I consider what took place.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara referred to the Sophia McColgan case which was appalling but which also proved to be a milestone because of the courage this young woman showed in bringing matters into the open. Ms McColgan, who was in her twenties at the time, suffered because of the Statute of Limitations but she still had the courage to take on the health boards, who defended the case vigorously. If I recall the facts correctly, the GP in question also defended his position vigorously. However, through might and main Ms McColgan was victorious. It indicates that the Judiciary recognises that this problem exists and that it is prepared to make decisions it would not have made several years ago.</P>
    <P>If one considers the case of Brendan Smyth or those of several boarding schools and colleges where abuse took place, it is difficult to accept the facts. I attended a boarding school for a number of years and I read in the newspaper recently <Col N="111" /> that two former priests at the school are in prison for abuse of children which took place subsequent to my departure. That indicates that abuse has taken place until recently. However, a new approach is being put in place.</P>
    <P>The Government should not crow about this or seek plaudits for what is now being done because it should have been done 20, 30 or 40 years ago. We should not politicise this issue because it is a human problem with affects everyone in society and we should work together in seeking to find a resolution to it. I am pleased that funding has been made available for counselling to be provided by health boards, etc.</P>
    <P>On several occasions in my legal career I have come across cases where a member of a family committed suicide. Twenty years ago, the prospect of counselling for children whose father, mother, sister or brother had committed suicide was not entertained. It is an accepted fact now that counselling should be given to children who have undergone the trauma of having a close relative commit suicide. How would a child react if they were systematically abused by their father, a person they trusted, a teacher or a priest? It must be an appalling weight to carry during their life.</P>
    <P>The essence of the Bill, which I do not doubt will receive broad support, is to ensure that a mental block which has been established in a person's mind due to an extremely traumatic experience during their childhood or adolescence will not prove a barrier to their taking proceedings in the civil courts in order to obtain compensation. That is another milestone. People might say that we are not going far enough but at least we are going in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The type of mental block to which I refer can affect a person in their twenties &ndash; for example, Sophia McColgan &ndash; thirties, forties or fifties. I read an interesting newspaper article recently about a retired Garda sergeant who undertook one of the most difficult tasks of his life when he was approached by a person from a town in another county who stated that he had been living under a cloud for many years as a result of being abused as a young boy. The sergeant gained the confidence of that man. It took him years to get to the bottom of the case but he succeeded in doing so. It was the pinnacle of his career as a member of the Garda Síochána that he was able to help the man in question and that justice of some sort eventually prevailed.</P>
    <P>I have read a number of books which exposed situations of this kind and brought them into the public domain. I accept comments by other Members that the financial recompense victims of such abuse receive offers scant compensation when one views the overall picture. However, if it helps in any small way &ndash; particularly in allowing them to seek help from counsellors or members of the Garda Síochána to lift that burden from the shoulders of those who have been abused for many years, in some instances decades &ndash; then we are moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> When speaking on subjects of this nature I sometimes find it difficult to remain calm and collected. When one hears about cases of abuse or reads newspaper reports or see television programmes about them it is difficult to remain calm and objective. However, we must endeavour to do so. I am glad the Government has, although not before time, grasped the nettle.</P>
    <P>Aside from sexual abuse and trauma, people are concerned about physical abuse. I have studied this issue and I have spoken to the Minister. I realise the difficulty with regard to defining physical abuse. Does it occur when someone gets a smack on the hand? When I was growing up I often got a smack on the hand. I got a smack from my teacher when I did something wrong but I had no difficulty with that. I am not saying someone should be thumped around the classroom or end up with black eyes or bruises. I recognise that if someone has been cruelly beaten and sticks are used or girls end up with black eyes or bruises, that has gone far beyond what is reasonable and proper.</P>
    <P>The Minister is wise to refer this matter to the Law Reform Commission, which has done wonderful work. I must acknowledge that it was under a Fine Gael-led coalition Government that the Law Reform Commission was set up; the Act was initiated in 1985. That is not so long ago. We should not criticise the Minister for his sensible approach in seeking the advice of the Attorney General in order to get this aspect right. If we do not get it right the State will be in difficulty again because people will say it has gone too far and is unreasonable. The Minister in power could be in difficulty. We do not want to make a bad situation worse. I hope that the Law Reform Commission, the Minister and the Attorney General will work together to get this matter resolved in months rather than years. If not, we might be back here again trying to rectify this matter before the end of the year. I urge the Minister to propel this matter forward in every way possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to points raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn with regard to how courts do their business. Owing to the independence of the Judiciary we must let them do their job. However, I was in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court last Friday because I had a particular interest in a case about child abuse. I spent two hours in the courtroom and several cases were up for sentence. I listened to a judge who professed that the lowest sentence for this type of serious offence is three and a half years ranging all the way up to a life sentence. He warned the legal profession and the media present of his views on this issue. He said that there was only one occasion where he granted a suspended sentence in his courtroom. This happened after a full investigation and it was discovered that the case was of a more trivial nature than originally presented. We cannot interfere with the system of sentencing in the courts.</P>
    <P>In the past decade or less matters such as sexual abuse and other form of abuse have passed through the courts system to reach the Central Criminal Court. Many cases are not being dealt <Col N="113" /> with in minor courts such as the District and Circuit Courts. They are going all the way to the Central Criminal Court. Such cases are being treated with great sincerity and a realisation that these are serious matters. This shows a new direction for society. People have been fighting this issue since the 1950s and 1960s. Society is opening up. Politicians are coming right. Hopefully, the clergy, State agencies and health boards are coming around. Perhaps they have been taught a lesson. The circle is coming close to what it should be. Any person facing the courts now on a charge of indecent or serious sexual assault or rape of a male or female will face the rigours of the law and I support that type of approach.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way. We are debating a subject that would not have been tackled 20 or 30 years ago because of a lack of political guts. I come from a protected and cocooned rural background. However, I am not saying abuse does not happen in rural areas. There is no doubt that for decades people in power and authority, bishops, politicians and parents knew this was going on but for some reason that I cannot define it was hidden away so as not to bring shame on the family. People were told that they could not take on the priests, clergy, health boards or institutions. That day is gone and thank God it is.   </P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response. I also thank all the Members who have contributed to the debate on this significant legislation. I thank them for their insight into this area and for their comprehensive remarks. Senator O'Donovan's last comments ring true for those of us, including myself, who grew up in quiet rural areas. As he spoke I was reminded of a time when I was a child and rumours went around among us that we should, particularly girls, be careful in the company of a particular individual. When I reported this to my mother she was shocked and horrified at the idea. She and her friends who spoke about it found it difficult to comprehend that it could happen. That would have been indicative of the time. To most fair-minded, decent people it seem incomprehensible that a member of the church and a respected member of the community could be engaged in any activity which would be detrimental to children. We now know it did happen. It is difficult for people, particularly for the older generation, to comprehend the information that was revealed in programmes like the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;. It is hard for them to believe that State institutions, particularly institutions run by the church, should have been centres where widespread abuse took place. People were entrusted by the wider community with the care of vulnerable individuals and children and believed by the wider community to be genuinely caring for children. People believed that they were doing an excellent job. In more recent times those individuals have been shown of having totally breached that trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the separation the Minister <Col N="114" /> has made between sexual and physical abuse. We will debate this issue on Committee Stage because I am disappointed with the Minister's response. I read the debate on Report Stage in the Dáil and I suspect we will have a similar division of opinion here. The Minister is incorrect in his approach. He seriously undermines the Bill by taking the issue of physical abuse out of the thrust and effect of this legislation. He says he is sending this matter to the Law Reform Commission and it should be allowed to consider this matter. He says it is a complex matter, presumably in relation to the definition of what is physical abuse. The effect of that will be not only to undermine this legislation but to create an injustice. We are all agreed that we want to end an injustice and deal with it here. We do not want to create an injustice but this measure seems to do that.</P>
    <P>We are capable and we have defined sexual abuse. We are not incapable of defining physical abuse. The Attorney General should also be able to give us some guidance. Many individuals were subjected to both physical and sexual abuse. In some cases it is hard to make a distinction between physical and sexual abuse. For instance, beating a child might appear on the surface to be physical abuse if there was no sexual content involved in the abuse, but it is very possible &ndash; and in some instances is the case &ndash; that the person perpetrating the physical abuse was doing so for sexual gratification. How does one make that distinction? Is that sexual abuse or physical abuse? Some might say it is both. We are limiting the possibility of someone taking an action by splitting the issue in this legislation.</P>
    <P>This decision also raises the issue of having to revisit this legislation in the future on the basis of the Law Reform Commission's recommendation. As a result people may have to take two actions before the courts &ndash; one regarding sexual abuse under the Bill if passed in its current form, and, if we ever amend this legislation, a second action concerning physical abuse. However, we have no idea if this legislation will ever be amended and the Minister is creating more problems than he is solving by taking this approach with which I have serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>Some consider the beating of a child a lesser offence than sexual abuse. However, experts have shown that this is not the case and that the trauma of physical abuse can be as bad as that resulting from sexual abuse. Are we suggesting that physical abuse is a lesser crime? I do not suggest that the Minister considers it is a lesser crime but to some extent it is the inevitable conclusion one would have to reach if we split physical and sexual abuse in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan said rightly that we have come to a point in our history where we are dealing with these matters. In doing so let us deal with them properly. Let us deal with them in such a way as to show our utter, complete and total abhorrence of the events which took place and of the societal structure which allowed them to <Col N="115" /> happen. Senator O'Donovan also said that we did not have the political will to deal with this issue 20 years ago but that is not a true reflection of the situation. Twenty years ago we were incapable of dealing with it because people who came forward with stories were not believed. This was because the sense of openness, transparency and accountability which is current in our systems was not as strong at that time. We did not have the same sense of accountability and, to a large extent, we were still in the grip of a very authoritarian society, the type of society which allowed this abuse to take place. Thankfully, our society is changing and as legislators we are charged with an onerous responsibility to ensure that legislation passed in both Houses is capable of dealing with the problems of the past which, in some cases, still exist. The beating of children has not stopped. It has stopped in institutions but it has not stopped in the domestic context and much abuse still takes place. We will not have completed our work in this area until we root out and deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>This issue is about power and control. As legislators we are charged with the responsibility of getting legislation right. We have come up against a severe difficulty regarding the separation of physical and sexual abuse. We will come back to this on Committee Stage and the Minister knows my views. He said that he is awaiting the Attorney General's advice concerning the other complex legal issues such as the three year limitation and the central issue of retrospection. I look forward to the Minister's proposals on these issues.</P>
    <P>I thank Members who contributed to this debate. The legislation has widespread support. I appeal to the Minister to listen to what victims and Members, particularly those on this side of the House, have to say on this issue. He should also remember that as legislators we are taking an extended role in reflecting the views and concerns of victims. We should listen carefully to what they have to say to ensure that legislation passed has the maximum effect and the widest possible powers so that justice is served for those who were so badly served in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to come back into the Seanad and resume debate on the 1999 Appropriation Act. Although the Appropriation Bill was passed by this House and the Dáil and enacted at the end of 1999, it was agreed that the Members of this House would be given a further opportunity to discuss the Act when business resumed in the new year.</P>
      <P>When I addressed this House on the 1999 Appropriation Bill at Christmas, I outlined in some detail the purpose of the Bill and the various provisions in it. I am sure Members will be relieved to hear I do not intend to go over the same ground again today. The Bill is a routine and somewhat technical piece of legislation to give statutory effect to the 1999 spending Estimates. However, it does provide an appropriate context in which to discuss the broad thrust of the Government's general expenditure and budgetary and economic policies. Needless to say, I am always happy to have the opportunity to outline the considerable success which this Government has achieved in pursuit of its ambitious plans to sustain and advance the unprecedented economic and social progress of recent years.</P>
      <P>I will begin, therefore, by briefly summarising recent developments. In 1999 the economy grew faster than expected by the Department of Finance and all other commentators. GNP is expected to have grown by 7.5% in 1999, broadly in line with the average of the exceptional growth since 1994. Employment for the year as a whole is estimated to have increased by 74,000 or 4.75%. Employment has risen by over 150,000 over the past two years. Unemployment has fallen and now stands at 5% compared to 10% when the Government was formed. The increase in employment, the fall in unemployment and the increase in disposable incomes show that this Government's policies are working. The economy has been transformed and this Government has succeeded in building on the economic achievements we inherited.</P>
      <P>The public finances have also been transformed. The general Government surplus was over 1.4% of GDP in 1999. Our debt-GDP ratio continued to fall in 1999 and was around 47% at the end of the year. Our current economic situation has created great opportunities for our society but it also presents a new set of policy challenges. This Government is taking positive and determined action to address these challenges through the review and ongoing implementation of its Action Programme for the Millennium, through the implementation of its budget strategy, the national development plan and its efforts to successfully negotiate a new national agreement to which I will refer later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rapid economic growth is leading to problems. <Col N="117" /> Labour shortages are emerging in the economy and the cost of child care has become a significant issue. Congestion is increasing in our towns and cities. House prices have also risen but show signs of stabilising. As already mentioned, the Government is taking action in all these areas to reduce the pressures which are emerging and which, if left unchecked, could pose a serious threat to economic growth.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully aware that it must also prepare for the future. Economic growth will inevitably moderate over the next few years. The Department of Finance now forecasts that the economy will grow at 6.25% in GNP terms in 2000, decelerating to 5% by 2002. These forecasts present a very favourable assessment of our future prospects. Of course, a shock to the economy would upset this scenario and adversely affect the public finances. A prudent policy is, therefore, to run a substantial surplus now to prepare for a period of slower growth. This is a key element of the Government's budgetary strategy. This strategy foresees continued surpluses and reduction in debt levels as a percentage of GDP. In that context, it will be possible to devote substantial resources to further tax reductions and improvements in public services without undermining stability. This approach also ensures that we manage our economy in such a manner as to ensure that our current economic success is consolidated and continues in future years.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the importance which the Government attaches to the successful negotiation of a new national agreement in the context of the many challenges which our current economic success is now posing for us as a nation. The successes achieved by this country over the period of the four national programmes are well known to everyone in this House. Those in employment, those seeking work and those relying on the State for assistance have all gained from social partnership. Our record speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>We can all recall the period before we embarked on the national consensus approach to economic and social planning. In the early 1980s Ireland faced a quite depressing situation of economic decline, high emigration, escalating unemployment, high inflation, rising interest rates and fiscal stagnation. There was no national or social consensus on the way forward, only conflict and divisions among all the social partners. However, in the mid-1980s we succeeded in arresting the decline and laying the foundations for turning the situation around. It was at this stage that the forging of a national consensus, through the co-operation of all the major groups in our society, became so important. Over the past 14 years or so, successive Governments have, in conjunction with the social partners, put in place a series of measures which, when taken together, have transformed Irish society and the whole economic outlook.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> Those at work have received significant increases in their take-home pay. The increases in real income have been particularly high over the period of Partnership 2000 &ndash; some 15% compared with approximately 5% during each of the first three programmes, the Programme for National Recovery, PESP and PCW. Since 1993 there has been a 25% increase in the number of people at work in Ireland and a fall in our unemployment rate from approximately 15.5% to 5%. There is now net immigration, whereas not so long ago thousands of our young people had to emigrate to find work.</P>
    <P>Employment creation remains the most effective route out of poverty. Progress made in that regard has transformed the poverty position during the recent years of social partnership. There has also been significantly increased spending on social inclusion measures and public services to the benefit of all citizens. It was only by turning away from the old approach of uncompetitive and inflation-creating income increases that scope emerged for employment gains. In addition, pay moderation allied to employment growth enabled tax reform which produced still stronger gains in take-home pay for all. It is this interdependence between different groups in society and this interaction between different elements of public policy that is at the heart of social partnership, and at the root of the improved living standards delivered over recent years.</P>
    <P>This Government is strongly committed to social partnership and is determined to negotiate a new agreement to succeed Partnership 2000. I am aware that social partnership has its critics but I believe the vast majority of people will freely acknowledge the role the social partnership approach has played in the past in tackling the problems of unemployment, inflation and the public finances. Social partnership is also the way to address the new challenges facing us such as problems associated with rapid growth, maintaining our competitiveness into the future and sharing the fruits of that growth.</P>
    <P>Faced with these challenges, we need to ensure that we retain the true spirit of social partnership with its inherent mutual commitments and trade-offs. Therefore, the best way to proceed and the way which is most in keeping with the problem-solving approach which has underpinned social partnership is for all the social partners to engage meaningfully, creatively and intensively in discussions to achieve a successful outcome in their negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000. The overriding consideration for all involved must be the continuation of sustainable economic growth. Our successful performance to date is testimony to the sound economic policies we have put in place. If we can agree a new national programme based on implementing, in a realistic and balanced way, the vision and strategy in the recent NESC report and the Government programme, we should be well placed to meet the <Col N="119" /> challenges ahead. That should allow us to continue on a relatively strong growth path capable of delivering further solid increases in employment and living standards.</P>
    <P>As the talks on a new national programme enter a crucial phase over the coming few days, I conclude by appealing to all parties involved to explore all possible avenues to overcome whatever difficulties and seemingly insurmountable differences with which they may be confronted. The risks to our continued economic success of a failure to reach agreement cannot be underestimated. However, the rewards for achieving a successful outcome will be great for all. I look forward to hearing the other contributions during this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. We are discussing the Appropriation Act which gives statutory effect to departmental spending. The figure of £14,248 million, generated entirely by the taxpayers, is not insignificant. Credit for this must go to the present Government, the previous Government, the social partners and all who contributed to this great achievement.</P>
      <P>I have identified two factors that have contributed enormously to underpinning this great economic advance, that is, social partnership and the tax regime which has been in place for many years, particularly for foreign industrialists. Tax rates are very favourable to foreign companies coming to this country. Many local authorities, including my own, gave them the added incentive of tax relief on their property which was not insignificant in many instances. They benefited in many areas from the tax regime and the attitude of local authorities in attracting foreign industrialists to the country.</P>
      <P>We may well say that the aircraft which takes us up to the stratosphere also takes us down to the ground. If there is any cloud or negative factor on the horizon, it is possibly our over-dependence on foreign industry. Thousands of foreign industrialists are generating massive job opportunities and income. This may be distorting GNP figures by way of what could be euphemistically referred to as colourful accounting with multi-national companies. These companies are essentially the engine which is driving this economic miracle machine into the stratosphere. This must be preserved and maintained to ensure nothing happens by way of an increased explosion in wages. There is a serious labour shortage in the economy which is being reflected in higher wage inflation. There is a virtual explosion in the public sector pay bill which has doubled since 1995. Teachers and other professionals are demanding further increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A minimum wage Bill is being introduced. I agree with the principle of a minimum wage, even though this will impose considerable hardship on <Col N="120" /> many small businesses, particularly in rural Ireland where there is depopulation at present, despite the Celtic tiger. Depopulation in rural areas is having a detrimental effect on the viability of many small businesses. The minimum wage will contribute to this demise because many of these business would not be able to bear it. If we contrast this with teachers and others earning £40 per hour and demanding an increase, we can detect an imbalance creeping into the wage structure in the economy. The Government must be extremely vigilant and firm in its response to these demands because, if conceded, they could take us out of the stratosphere and bring us quickly to the ground.</P>
    <P>There was an announcement yesterday by Coca-Cola, a major global company, that it is to reduce its workforce by 20% worldwide. I have a particular interest in this company because one of the largest manufacturing outlets in the world is located in my town of Ballina. I am pleased the announcement by the company does not affect the Irish operation at present. However, initial announcements from such companies usually do not give the full picture and more information is added as time goes by. I hope nothing is added to the initial announcement from Coca-Cola about jobs in this country, but the announcement underlines what can happen. I am interested in Coca-Cola and traced its history one night on the Internet. I found a growth pattern throughout its existence since the last century and now it has been hit with this hiccup. Nortel, Intel and other multinationals are here in a vibrant, buoyant and expanding market, but history has proven that such markets do not continue indefinitely. Technology changes and companies that do not adapt usually go out of existence. In this regard the Celtic tiger is riding on the back of our Celtic technology, so to speak, which has been built up by our graduates and others.</P>
    <P>The labour shortages emerging are affecting local authorities, as there is a shortage of engineers and architects. The length of time it takes to get a project from the design stage to moving contractors on to a site is getting longer due to the labour shortages in these critical areas and that will slow up the implementation of the national development plan. The money is there to be spent but at present we do not have the capacity to spend it. Our infrastructure is underdeveloped. We have poor roads, traffic congestion and poor port facilities.</P>
    <P>Our ports are not well located and in that context I extend my congratulations to the new Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey. I note he is from Connacht and hope he devotes considerable energies to rectifying the situation on the west coast, where there is no major deep sea port. Dublin and Cork are clogged with articulated lorries, yet there is deep water along the west coast where a major deep sea port could be developed, yet nothing is <Col N="121" /> being done. We should see this in the context of a £280 million stadium in Dublin that will only be used, I am told, by the IRFU for five or six games a year. That is very hard to justify when we in the west are looking for funding for small projects that would cost £20 to £30 million, such as a port development, and which would revolutionise and facilitate the growing commerce in the west. Companies such as Coca-Cola must export products through Dublin Port to the entire world, which is a major shortcoming. I hope the new Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources dedicates himself to some of those deficiencies in the west of Ireland where there is rural depopulation while Dublin and the main cities expand at a major rate.</P>
    <P>Inflation is rising, which is a serious matter, although we are substantially protected by the euro. We should, therefore, have a stable currency for years to come but if chilly economic winds blow across Europe that position could change. We may not always have low interest rates. In ten years &ndash; not a long time in economic terms &ndash; we may not occupy the favourable fiscal position we do now.</P>
    <P>The Government must take cognisance of these matters. The seeds for a future downturn are there, but we must ensure those seeds do not develop and grow. The Government must be particularly vigilant and firm on public sector pay in coming years. I mentioned the serious labour shortages in critical sectors within local authorities. A bypass has been on the design board in Mayo County Council for ten years and it was only last week the compulsory purchase order for that project was published in the newspaper. I asked why the CPO and the project was not proceeding two years ago at the council and was told there were shortages, that the design was not ready and had to be changed and that the route had to be changed. The route was changed three times, but all those changes take time and we are years waiting for those projects to come to fruition.</P>
    <P>This is a major problem with the national development plan. The money is there, as is the Government's commitment to spending it, but in many areas we do not have the capacity to spend it. That may be a strange irony, but it is a fact.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to note that this year's allocation to Mayo County Council for both improvements and maintenance for the roads is down on the 1999 allocation. That does not suggest improvement or progress to me. It is bad enough to have the labour shortages I referred to, but when one matches that with the decrease in funding, it does not augur well for infrastructural development, particularly in County Mayo.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, who, as I have said in the past, always has a good brief when he comes to the House and today is no different. He did not <Col N="122" /> repeat what he said before Christmas, but he opened a new page, which is very important. I compliment him on that.</P>
      <P>We can talk about the budget and related issues, but it is important to look to the future. We can look to the future from a sound foundation resulting from a co-operative economic approach dating back to the 1980s. During the 1990s, in particular, that approach was adopted by the political parties and the social partners. We as a nation can congratulate ourselves on that. We have looked on ourselves as a people who could play a role in the international scene, particularly in the European Union, and we have achieved that.</P>
      <P>It is well established that this island of five million people is a major player in the European context and our international standing was never higher. Our desire to play such a role was innate in our psyche but we were never in a position to express it. While we have talked about this country's role in the past as an island of saints and scholars, we have never had an international role to play except in some historical events.</P>
      <P>The position is different today. There is a new situation which has resulted from good housekeeping since the 1980s, investment in education, social partnership and our wish to be a major player in a European context. We have achieved those four objectives and it is a matter of building on them. That is in line with what the Minister of State said. Since 1983, 150,000 more people have secured employment, the rate of unemployment has fallen from 15% to 5% and our economic standing on the world stage has never been higher.</P>
      <P>What approach should we adopt into the future? Should we make this country a place to which people can retire and relax in or should we achieve what we are capable of for our young people and future generations? We should look to the future and avail of the opportunities presented to this lovely island. The Government is not resting on its laurels but looking to the future and reinvesting in what is important &ndash; education, infrastructure and the creation of opportunities.</P>
      <P>The national development plan, which will span the next seven years, has the potential to take us to a new plane but it will involve more social partnership and the Government taking more initiatives. I hope we can achieve that over those seven years. It involves £40 billion worth of investment in creating opportunities and developing infrastructure. That is a massive amount of money and only 7% of it is made up of European Structural and Cohesion Funds. We are on our own to a great extent and that is why private and public sectors must gell together to bring this nation up to the level it can attain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned labour shortages, child care facilities, congestion in our towns and house prices as important issues. Addressing them is within our grasp. This nation has an <Col N="123" /> opportunity it did not have previously. We have highly educated and well motivated young people. No other country in Europe has such a well motivated, young population. I am very much in touch with what is happening. My family are teenagers and have completed second and third level and I know what young people are thinking. An opportunity exists for this nation that did not exist during the mid to late 1960s. I congratulate all those who contributed to developing it. That involves all the social partners.</P>
    <P>Henceforth, there are two possible scenarios. Greed could take over and people might want a bigger slice of the big cake, but they might want to eat it now. The other side of the coin is that people may agree to take what they believe is the right amount and allow the country to go forward and create opportunities for the next generation. That side of the coin is the one on which we should focus. I support what the Minister of State said. I hope social partnership will continue, good sense will prevail, that people will say the future is important and will invest in it by entering into a new agreement on wages and structures and that the nation will progress along the lines provided for in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>It would be a poor democracy if it we did not have an Opposition. Irrespective of whether we talk of the Opposition in this House or the other House or among people outside these Houses, there is a consensus among the people that we should not waste the opportunities presented. That is the view I encounter no matter where I go. Irrespective of Government, how can political parties tap into that resource to encourage young people to become involved in public life to help this country progress over the next decade and throughout the century?</P>
    <P>If we do nothing in first year of this millennium other than express our wish that we must progress on the basis of social partnership and agreement on Northern Ireland, which is vital at this time, we will do well. The potential of the Good Friday Agreement has probably received more recognition outside the country than here. It is vital we take advantage of the potential afforded by the Agreement, the good relations between the people of Northern Ireland and the people of the 26 Counties and between the islands of Britain and Ireland and their islands.</P>
    <P>Where is the European Union to expand other than in the direction of the Urals? Which are the English speaking nations of the European Union? The islands of Ireland and England. That presents these islands with an opportunity and the two islands should co-operate as their interests are equal in the context of European Union enlargement. The interests of the two islands should complement each other. There is no great need for division or acrimony at this time between the island of England and the island <Col N="124" /> of Ireland. I come from a very strong republican background on my mother's side but not on my father's side. If I had made that statement or if such a statement was heard in our house when I was 17 or 18, somebody would probably have broken all the delph, but there is no problem in making such a statement today.</P>
    <P>An enormous opportunity is presented to the country at this time. The Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats has its finger on the pulse. If one were to probe the Opposition deeply on this issue, I do not think one would find any great conflict as regards where we are going as a nation. There is opposition to policies and some matters are a cause of conflict. However, in the bigger picture, it is not an issue. When that is the case, two things can happen. One is that complacency can arise and things are allowed to slip. This would be a mistake. The second is that we actively pursue each other's policies. Now is the time to actively pursue new ideas and new thinking on the future direction of the country.</P>
    <P>My comments perhaps are not entirely related to the Appropriation Act, but they are relevant on the basis that the Act gives effect to the budget and the annual expenditure of billions of pounds. It is also tied to the national plan which has been decided by the Government. It creates different regions and gives Objective One status to one area which has been the Cinderella region for many years. It will redress the imbalances between east and west and the Border area and the south. It is good in the overall context and it must be considered in terms of the broader picture.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who is from my old constituency of Roscommon-East Galway. The first time I ever canvassed for votes was with the Minister of State for his brother, Deputy Micheál Kitt, following the death of their father many years ago. Things have changed a great deal since then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>They certainly have changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great time for this country and young people. I hope that those of us in public life use it to the advantage of future generations. We should not in any way feel complacent about the current state of affairs. We should strive earnestly to ensure the country progresses further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and the earlier contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, particularly in light of Senator Finneran's comments. The Minister of State said that over the past 14 years successive Governments have, in conjunction with the social partners, put in place a series of measures. He was willing to note the role of other Governments in the current success and this is an <Col N="125" /> occasion on which to congratulate ourselves as a nation for what we have achieved.</P>
      <P>I returned late last night from Arizona where I attended a conference on food. I was impressed by the respect Ireland now has in the eyes of the world. Senator Finneran referred to this aspect. There is huge regard for and recognition of the fact that we did it ourselves. We should be proud of that and I am delighted to hear the self-congratulatory terms used in the debate. However, I was reminded of another aspect during Senator Caffrey's contribution because among the people I was with at the conference were the new bosses of Coca-Cola. I was reminded that things can go wrong with any company; some of them are within their own control, but many of them are outside their control. This is relevant to what is happening to our economy. Some of the influences are within our hands but others are outside our control.</P>
      <P>There was not enough emphasis in the Minister of State's speech on the dangers and threats we face. I wish to focus on inflation, the greatest challenge to our economic success and future. It is the greatest threat to the health of the Celtic tiger of which we are all so proud. From talking to some of the British representatives at the conference in recent days, I was reminded that five or ten years ago there were jokes about Irish people. The Irishman was always the butt of the joke, but there has been none of that in the last two or three years. It appears the recognition currently afforded to Ireland has many other implications. The Irish success story has had effects in many other areas, including culture, art, music and sport. The future is in our hands but the Minister of State did not refer in detail to the threat of inflation. It is the greatest threat to the opportunities now available to us to create a better country in the future.</P>
      <P>I wish to focus on the conspiracy of silence about this threat. In spite of the abundance of writing on the wall, almost nobody wants to know about it. It does not appear to be getting the attention it deserves. Consumer inflation is now more than double the EU average. It is by far the highest in Europe. Ireland is so far out of line on that indicator that if it was to apply for membership of the euro mechanism now, it would not qualify. Ireland would not fulfil the Maastricht Treaty criteria but nobody, including the Government, seems to care. The Minister of State barely mentioned it in his speech earlier.</P>
      <P>The latest wholesale factory gate inflation figures were released this week. These figures are most important and they show that the current rate is 5.1%. This rate affects our exports and the foundation on which the economy is built. The figure of 5.1% should stop us in our tracks. We should be considering the danger to our exports posed by inflation, but nobody appears to care. We do not hear much about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> The reason the factory gate wholesale figure is so important is that if Ireland is to continue its export led success story, we must ensure that we control anything which affects it. This is the case because the strength of sterling is giving many Irish companies a competitive advantage in the UK. The current rate is 77p but in the past we paid dearly for our over-dependence on the UK market. It could go wrong overnight if sterling changed direction. This has happened many times over the past 30 years. For example, in 1993 Ireland had to spend £50 million in a couple of months trying to bail out Irish firms who lost their competitiveness because of currency movements.</P>
    <P>Asset inflation continues to rip ahead at a totally unsustainable rate. We appear almost proud of the fact that house price inflation is only 17%. It is trumpeted as good news. However, it is not good news. Admittedly, the level of growth has decreased. It is slackening but the key point is that house prices are still going up. After several years of the rate almost doubling, we are pleased that it is increasing at the slower rate of 17%. However, houses price figures do not show up in the consumer price index and that is particularly worrying. We are fooling ourselves if we do not see the major inflationary threat which is undermining the economy. Nobody appears to care and we hear little about it. The suggestion is that the crisis has passed and the rate of inflation in house prices has reduced to only 17%. However, the truth is that we are in the middle of the storm at present.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about this because I am old enough to remember what happened in the past when inflation took control of the economy and we became victims of a vicious spiral which got worse as time went on. It happened at least twice in the past 30 years and on both occasions we made a mess of dealing with it. I am concerned we will go down that same road a third time. Why is inflation at 4% a crisis when at 2% it is not a crisis? The reason is that inflation is not a linear thing. It is not that 4% is twice as bad as 2%. Inflation at 2% is controllable but inflation at 4% is uncontrollable or verging on the brink of being uncontrollable. It is a bit like the 'flu epidemic we have just had &ndash; when a small number of people get the 'flu there is no great concern and people can continue to get the 'flu at a low rate and nothing gets worse because by the time new people get it the first lot are over it. At a certain point, enough people get 'flu at the same time for it to start snowballing. Suddenly, there is an epidemic and one is no longer in control. That is the way inflation works because I have seen it before and somewhere around 3% is the trigger point. We are at that point now and may have passed it.</P>
    <P>I recall speaking on 1 December, the day the budget was published, and feeling almost like a Jonah because I expressed concern. I said that at least the Americans have Alan Greenspan to <Col N="127" /> look after their money and inflation. If he sees signs of something going wrong he can increase the federal interest rate and slow it down. We are no longer in that position in that we are not able to control our own interest rates due to our membership of the euro. Therefore, we have to use other methods to solve it. The first step is to recognise it as a serious threat. We need to give the matter attention but nobody seems to know that. I suggest the Government does not want to know, if we are to judge from the fact that it presented us with a budget that is inflationary in almost all its aspects.</P>
    <P>History will show that the Government was a fire brigade that came to the fire with its tanks filled with oil, not water. I can understand the reason. It seems employers' organisations are in exactly the same position. They are afraid to talk about inflation because the unions will worry and look for more. There is a conspiracy of silence. I suggest the Government and employers' organisations do not want to talk about it. That employers' organisations do not want to talk about it is the irony. The knee-jerk reaction, which has cost us so much in the past, is that when inflation threatens people clamour to raise the cost of labour. If threatened by inflation in the future the unions will look for more.</P>
    <P>I can understand the reason employers do not wish to draw attention to it. Once that happens it further fuels the inflationary spiral instead of dampening it down. What possible purpose could be served by hiding the truth about inflation at this point? If nothing is said for the next few months and after an agreement is signed inflation is acknowledged to be a reality, what will happen? The unions will cry foul and say that is not fair, they were not told and will seek to renegotiate the agreement.</P>
    <P>It is far better to face up to the problem now and to do so openly and honestly. I have little hope we will do just that. What we have done in the past is to run away from inflation until it has gone out of control and then focused on measures that made it worse rather than better. We have seen this happen in the past, certainly in the past 30 years. It has happened twice when we were unable to control it. As the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, said 12 or 14 years ago we grabbed a hold of the issue, sought a consensus and managed to achieve it. We will not tackle it by hiding the problem and saying it does not exist. I urge that we do something to help avoid making the same mistake. All the signs are that we are not doing that.</P>
    <P>The biggest challenge and threat to us is inflation. Let us be open about it, put our cards on the table and say &ldquo;that is the challenge&rdquo;. I do not see signs that it is recognised by the Government. If we do not manage to achieve an awareness of it we will look back and say we had the good years but they finished in 2000 and what a <Col N="128" /> shame we did not do something about it when it was in our power to do so. I urge the Government to grab a hold of this opportunity and face up to the difficult tasks. If so, we can look back on this year as the year we managed to take the right steps to maintain our position, rather than to lose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Appropriation Act provides for substantial public spending for various services and comes at a time when the economy has improved substantially. There have been tremendous improvements in the workplace and the number in employment has increased. All sectors have made a contribution to gross national product and to the strength and finances of the economy.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn referred to inflation. I concur with the view that people should be concerned about it. It is of fundamental importance to the national wage agreement with the social partners. It is important that it be referred to in the negotiations and taken seriously. If there is one thing that would undo economic growth for the welfare of young people it is inflation. Unless controlled, it could have a spiralling effect on the national wage agreement, unsettle any good budgetary management plans and make our exports uncompetitive. That would have an adverse effect on the economy.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Act in the context of the national development plan. I take this opportunity to wish our Ministers well in their new appointments as guardians of the State. The great challenge is to look at the country in its entirety, deal with the elements of peripherality and treat our citizens in a fair and just manner. Elements of infrastructure, including roads, piers and harbours, and the development of our natural resources need to be dealt with under the national development plan. It is important to address these matters in this good economic climate.</P>
      <P>I will be a little parochial for a moment. We have seen major development in the west. One need only go through my colleague's county and that of the Cathaoirleach, County Roscommon, to see the number of public utility water supplies in the towns on the national primary route, right through Roscommon and into Mayo. The people see that something is happening. There are town improvement and enhancement schemes. There is activity, there are contractors at work and there is a strong sense of a future for the people in peripheral and disadvantaged areas. We are experiencing good times. It is most interesting how quickly that change has come and how affluent and confident young people have become through the education system in dealing with this development, in participating in and continuing to improve the economy, and in building up the strengths of all the economic assets through their participation in work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> There are other aspects with which the Government should deal in the context of the national development plan. The Government should assist the regional airports. The tax incentives which were introduced in that regard should be extended. We should make them the important hub of the industrial sector. Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland should look seriously at developing these airports as centres and they should participate with them and give them the necessary supports and encouragement to play their part in the creation of employment and the development of industry.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, the number of people working in Ireland has increased by 25%. That is a huge increase and when one sees the return to the Exchequer it is obvious what this is doing for the economy and the strength it has given Ireland's finances. When there are high levels of employment there is a tremendous tax yield and investment in the State. This gives the State the opportunity to develop, plan ahead and work for the benefit of the people.</P>
    <P>Within the context of our responsibilities, one of the areas which needs particular attention in a changing environment is agriculture. The Government has a responsibility, while having negotiated Agenda 2000, to sustain farming having regard to its importance to small farmers in particular. The Government has done that in the Finance Acts and in the Appropriation Act, 1999, it has provided the necessary funding to support and sustain farmers on the land within a changing economy and agricultural situation because of changes at European level and within world trade negotiations. While there is a change in the work practices of part-time farmers, there is a large group of people who need to see a future within the context of farming and living on the land. We need to keep people participating on the land in that context to sustain the schools, churches, etc., in the small towns and villages while there is an increase in the number of jobs and opportunities. It is important that we sustain farming.</P>
    <P>Recently Mayo County Council saw proposals for an allocation in the region of £19 million to £20 million for piers and harbours along the western seaboard by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and, while the proposals have not been agreed yet, I welcome them. These are things which we should plan for the future when the economy will not be as strong and will not be growing at today's rates. Now that we have the money, we should provide these added facilities so that the people may use the natural resources to help sustain farming and communities in the future. They will play their part in agri-tourism and diverse agri-practices. We should develop the natural resource of seaweed. We should develop those fundamental industries to sustain communities and provide income for families in the long term. Now is the time to make those investments. The Govern<Col N="130" /> ment is approaching this in that way and that is only right and proper.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources should, if it is economically feasible from an engineering perspective, decide that the gas will be brought ashore in County Mayo. In the interests of proper development, the supply should emanate from Mayo and service the rest of the country. Rather than have the county bypassed in the future, it is only right and proper that the people of Mayo, with the rest of the population, should benefit from this great resource.</P>
    <P>When one considers that the Appropriation Act, 1999, involves nearly £15 billion, one must ask how Ireland has arrived at this stage of development. Much encouragement comes from the practice of investment within the State and tax incentives in certain areas have increased the level of substantial investment outside the major centres of growth. Those schemes can be beneficial to individuals but at the same time they need careful management because they bring about much development which would not take place were they not in place. Such schemes should be focused and they should be examined carefully. They are important in the distribution of economic development.</P>
    <P>The national wage agreements certainly underpinned economic development. They instilled confidence within the workforce and guaranteed the future by taking inflation and other aspects into consideration. It is important that the new national pay deal, which is under consideration at present, is concluded because it is fundamental to any managed economic development for the future. This country needs another agreement. It is important that the parties concerned are encouraged to come up with a reasonable and sensible deal in their long-term interests.</P>
    <P>The cost of wages in the construction industry, according to people involved in the industry to whom I have spoken, has grown substantially outside the national wage agreement. While interest rates are low and people can afford to take on substantial investments, such as houses, if the economy is not handled properly and the greed element creeps in, we could bankrupt the young people who are taking out those loans if substantial interest rate increases were introduced in the future. It is important that there is an element of common sense in this and that management issues within the national wage agreement and the agreement itself are honoured. If that is so, the agreement will play an important part in underpinning the future of the economy.</P>
    <P>In the context of the £40 billion national development plan, there is a need for good infrastructure to bring people to all parts of the country. A good standard national roads network is important to the local economies and it is fundamental to many aspects of tourism and diverse investment in the future. The State should invest <Col N="131" /> in the national primary and secondary routes for the future. That is the responsibility of the National Roads Authority and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. One looks forward to each county council putting forward properly designed investment plans. It behoves each council to prepare such plans and to obtain as much money as possible from the national development plan to build up a proper road network.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and others on introducing the Appropriation Act and in getting the maximum return from it for the nation. I am delighted to see the success of State investments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an opportune time to contribute to the debate on the Appropriation Act because things have never been so good in this country. A few years ago no one would have believed it could happen and many people still ask how we did it. If we are to consider this question seriously, we must go back a long way to the introduction of free secondary education. In that way we began to educate our workforce and thus laid the foundations for our current prosperity. Much of the current economic boom is generated in the technological field, including the communications and computerisation sectors which are the major economic players. The booming economy looks set to continue for many a long day. I pay tribute to those in the teaching profession who have brought education to its current high standard.</P>
      <P>Social partnership has also done much good for the country's economy. I always like to give credit to our former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey &ndash; a man not always spoken highly of &ndash; who introduced the first social partnership system, got it off the ground and made it work. The social partnership system stabilised the labour market and eliminated wildcat strikes and other such unrest. Workers now know what they will receive from national wage agreements. Now that the social partners are sitting around the table again, let us hope they will bring the negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000 to a successful conclusion. The country's economic performance cannot continue without a happy, solid and committed workforce. The economy is working because a dedicated workforce is doing its job well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy would not work either without good government. When things go wrong there are protests outside the gates of Leinster House and the Government is blamed along with Deputies and Senators. However, when everything is going well one does not hear any praise for the Government. The attitude is that it would happen anyway but if that were so, why do things sometimes go wrong? Any business is only as good as its management. We now have a good management in the Fianna Fáil-PD alliance <Col N="132" /> which is doing a wonderful job. The money is available and the Government is using it wisely. Many people say that we should spend the millions we have in the bank but that is a foolish philosophy. I pay tribute to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, for his good housekeeping because we must have something in the kitty for a rainy day. There is an old saying, which goes as follows:</P>
    <P>If you burn the candle at both ends,</P>
    <P>It gives a lovely light,</P>
    <P>But, oh my foes and oh my friends,</P>
    <P>It will not last the night.</P>
    <P>We could easily find ourselves with nothing for the rainy day because any business, or society for that matter, can have occasional hiccups. In fairness to the Minister for Finance, he is making sure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>The Government is spending money very wisely. Never before has such money been spent in local authority areas on road construction. It is rather sad, however, that so many road projects are held up, in many cases by professional objectors. The Kildare bypass project is a nightmare because it has been held up by protesters who want to protect an unusual snail which lives near its path. We are told that the extra traffic would discommode this remarkable mollusc. Things have reached such daft proportions that a multi-million pound project to construct this much needed new bypass is being held up for a species of snail, and the delay is costing additional expense.</P>
    <P>There are many other instances of such problems around the country. In my town of Sligo, the building of a through road has been held up for the past ten years by various groups of objectors. It is time to devise a system whereby we could overcome such problems without holding up road building projects for years. The construction eventually goes ahead, but not before millions have been spent on legal cases. It is a bonanza for the lawyers because such planning objections must go through the courts and, as we have seen in the Glen of the Downs case, some objectors will not accept the court's decision. Another way must be found around the problem because such planning objections could destroy our economy. The money available should be spent on better roads instead of being wasted by objectors.</P>
    <P>Child care is another issue which was discussed in the House yesterday when there were calls for more crèches and child care places generally. We should study this matter more closely because I do not think that extra crèches are the answer. In some countries that have widespread crèche facilities, children are not cared for by their parents at home. There should be freedom of choice and if a woman wants to stay at home to rear her children provision should be made to enable her to do so. She should not have to work owing to necessity. I have said that before and I will con<Col N="133" /> tinue to do so. We should debate the matter thoroughly to see if we can come up with a better system.</P>
    <P>Health boards have never before received such a level of investment. When I joined the North Western Health Board some 23 years ago, the entire health board budget would not buy food for hospital patients today. I am worried about where all the money is going. A very good audit is required because, while everyone is calling for more resources, that means more expenditure. The former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, was an active Minister, fair play to him. He tried to do something about hospital waiting lists by investing in the health services but the lists expanded. Where did the money go? The Government has made several financial injections to try to eliminate waiting lists, but I wonder if a proper audit is being carried out on how such money is being spent.</P>
    <P>It always amazes me that while medical card holders cannot get a hospital bed, if one decides to pay one can have an operation overnight in the same hospital, with the same doctors and nurses. There is something radically wrong with that. Many people are covered by the VHI and BUPA-Ireland health insurance schemes, as well as local authority and Civil Service insurance schemes. If one takes out those who are paying for such schemes and younger people who are not using such services, only a small number are availing of the State's investment in public health. What is the cost of each public hospital patient? It must be colossal because colossal amounts of money are allocated to public patients.</P>
    <P>Every town and village in rural Ireland, despite what people say, is booming at present. When I used to travel through County Leitrim, villages such as Dromod and Drumsna were dead. They are now built up. I cannot understand how there is a housing shortage because never before have so many houses and apartments been built. Entire farms have been built on around Bundoran. There is a huge amount of development in every town and village. Houses are being built on the lawns of other houses in Dublin. I sometimes wonder if the number of houses is being accurately reckoned because I am amazed there is a shortage.</P>
    <P>With regard to agri-business, more money should be spent on horticulture and organic farming, for which I know provision was made in the Estimates. What is referred to as organic farming now was the traditional, ordinary way to farm when I was a boy. We need to produce more fresh food.</P>
    <P>I read an alarming newspaper report recently that the clingfilm we use to wrap everything promotes the growth of bacteria and that there are more bacteria in wrapped than unwrapped food. Where are the experts now who told us that everything had to be hygienically wrapped? It transpires that is not the case. We are also told <Col N="134" /> that the latex gloves used by medical practitioners contain a cancer causing substance. I sometimes worry about what experts tell us. We hear today that the 'flu injection should not have been given to anyone with chest complaints, such as bronchitis, because it can cause them serious difficulties. Will there be compensation claims from people with bronchial complaints who suffered problems as a result of the injection? We need tests to ensure that what we are doing is 100% correct rather than being told what to do by big pharmaceutical, rubber and plastics companies which are making a great deal of money out of this.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about the environment and wildlife. The reason for the decline in our wildlife is starvation. In the days when every farmer tilled and ploughed, pheasants and other birds had plenty of food. There is no food in grass for birds. We could increase wildlife, bring back rural Ireland and make it more profitable for small farmers to till their land if we could devise a system for producing home grown foods and create a market for them. What happened with the market for potatoes in Donegal a few years ago is an example of the problem that can arise with home grown foods. When there was a big crop of potatoes in Donegal there was no market for them, but when there were no potatoes the price went sky high and we had to import them.</P>
    <P>More money should be spent on organic farming and the promotion of wildlife. There is great potential in the organic farming business but a market must be organised for such crops because they do not have a long shelf life. I doubt that vegetables and fruits with a long shelf life are healthy because they are injected with various substances to keep them looking good. However, do they taste good and they are wholesome? That is a big question.</P>

      <P>I support what Senator Quinn said about the alarming current inflation rate. It was extremely depressing to hear an economic commentator on the news say, when discussing <Col N="135" /> interest rates in Europe, that it was the inflation rates of Germany, France and Italy, which are about 1.5%, which would be taken into account when overall interest rates were being considered and that Ireland, with a current inflation rate of 4% and perhaps worse to come, would not be in nearly as satisfactory a position as those countries. Senator Quinn's words must be taken on board very seriously.</P>
      <P>Changes were made to the membership of the Government today. A large amount of extra funding has been allocated to the Department of Health and Children. However, I hope the new Minister will address some areas which get very little publicity but which are very seriously affecting people's health. One example is the appalling situation regarding radiotherapy. We have the most out of date equipment in Dublin and Cork. I am sure complaints have been made to the Minister of State about the serious lack of up to date radiology and radiotherapy equipment in Cork. Sometimes the equipment is broken for weeks.</P>
      <P>There is a crisis in some areas of the health service which have not been looked at. I will ask the Minister for Health and Children to address this. We start grand projects in the treatment of cancer, for example. The medical profession does what it can but one cannot make bricks without straw, as the Israelites were required to do. The same situation applies in the medical field if the tools to give the required treatment are lacking. I do not see why Irish patients should be in a more invidious situation than those in other countries. We have the expertise but we need the tools to fulfil the expectations of our patients.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Henry's point about inflation, which was strongly emphasised by Senator Ryan earlier. When we began the debate on the Appropriation Bill on 15 December 1999, the Minister for Finance told us inflation was expected to average 1.6% this year. Could anyone believe he told us that a month ago? Inflation is now 3.9%. Where did the Minister get those figures? Surely, he should have been advised by the mandarins in the Department of Finance that matters were out of control and totally askew. The rate is now two and a half times what the Minister told us it would be less than a month ago. I expect the Minister of State to address that in his reply. How can it be stated on 15 December that inflation is expected to be 1.6% and then find on 26 January that it is 3.9%? That is by far the highest rate in the European Union and nearly three times the EU average. It looks as if it is rapidly getting out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, came to the House on that occasion and described how he was right wing in economics generally but that he was a prudent fiscal <Col N="136" /> manager. There is nothing very prudent about the management of inflation. This could well be his nemesis. It would seem the decisions he took in the budget have fuelled inflation considerably. He put much money at the disposal of those who are already well off. What are they going to do with that money? They will buy expensive consumer goods which will come from abroad. We have a terrible relationship with sterling at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, to the House. It is nice to see a familiar face from the Department of Health and Children. I hope he will enjoy working with the new Minister who, I am sure, will be a splendid appointment.</P>
      <P>I cannot remember if the Minister of State took this Adjournment Matter previously but on 22 October 1997 I asked the then Minister for Health and Children to consider the need for the fortification of flour with folic acid. As the Minister of State is well aware, we have one of the highest incidences of spina bifida and hydrocephalus in the world and the knowledge that this could be greatly reduced by a higher intake of folic acid in early pregnancy should have been addressed at that time. It is well known that this is an important way to address this problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister said then that the fortification of flour with folic acid would &ldquo;have to be considered in an EU context in view of the implications for the free movement of goods&rdquo;. In fact, I got the impression that the entire confectionery trade might collapse if I continued to pursue it. He said this was well outside the remit of the Department of Health and Children and that consultation would have to take place with some other Departments. As that was nearly two and a half years ago, I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell me the result of these consultations and his views on the fact the United Kingdom Government is considering supplementing flour with folic acid. The health benefits additional to that of preventing neural tube defects have now become obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State knows, flour in the United States has been fortified with folic acid for many years. This was done on the recommendation of the Food and Drugs Administration which is a fairly conservative body when it comes to recommending anything such as that. This was <Col N="137" /> done because it was recognised that the inference of folic acid on the synthesis of DNA in many cells was of great importance. It felt it was an important course of action for it to take.</P>
    <P>Folic acid has been shown to be very helpful in the prevention of heart disease and bowel cancer. Some of the most important research in this area has been done in Ireland because we, unfortunately, have a very high level of heart disease, as can be seen around the periphery of the European continent. High levels of folic acid have been found to reduce the level of homocysteine in the blood. This is important in the prevention of heart disease because we have found that many of the population are short of an enzyme which is needed for the lowering of homocysteine in the blood. This is probably a genetic problem. Similarly, bowel cancer increases where there are high homocysteine levels. What is interesting is that we may have been blaming our diet for many years for problems we had which are due to in-built genetic problems.</P>
    <P>There is only one satisfactory argument of which I have heard against the fortification of flour with folic acid and that is that it may mask B12 deficiency. The Minister of State and I know that B12 deficiency is fairly unusual and that we can also have B12 deficiencies without anaemia. The argument is that giving folic acid will improve the anaemia so it may mask the neurological signs which occur with B12 deficiency. In the overall health scene, we have to take that chance and hope people will carry out a better clinical examination of those expected to have B12 deficiency rather than use this as an excuse to persist in blocking the fortification of flour.</P>
    <P>Professor John Scott of Trinity College, who is an expert in this area, has said there is a convincing argument to add folic acid to all flour. Surveys on the uptake of folic acid supplements have been very disappointing. Women of child bearing age have been advised that they should try to increase their intake of folic acid prior to conception. Clonmel Chemicals and other drug companies have been good at trying to promote the uptake of folic acid, as has the health promotion unit but, unfortunately, the uptake has been extremely poor and is worse among public patients than private patients. Public patients are quite likely to have a less nutritious diet so they may already have a diet which is low in folic acid.</P>
    <P>It is sad that promoting additional folic acid in the diet will not totally eliminate cases of spina bifida. The Department of Heath and Children advisory group on this matter reckoned that it would cut the present rate which is about 70 to 80 per year by half. In other words, nearly 100 children are born with the serious defect of spina bifida who could have been saved from this problem if flour had been fortified when I suggested it in 1997. I hope the Minister will address this matter with a sense of urgency because it is one of the most distressing of the congenital defects <Col N="138" /> and is one about which we are at liberty to do a great deal if we put our minds to it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising this issue again. The prevention of neural tube defects is an important public health issue for society at large and for women in particular. My Department attaches particular importance to seeking a means of reducing the incidence of what is largely a preventable condition.</P>
      <P>I am aware that it was scientifically proven in 1991 that folic acid &ndash; a B12 vitamin &ndash; taken prior to conception and during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy could greatly reduce a woman's risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect. In 1993, my Department issued a recommendation that women likely to become pregnant should take an extra 400 microgrammes of folic acid prior to conception and during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. I am also aware of recent research linking the consumption of folic acid with the reduction of heart disease.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Advisory Board published a report in 1998 on the value of folic acid in the prevention of neural tube defects and discussed the possibility of the fortification of food with the vitamin. The report considered different ways in which food could be fortified with folic acid on a voluntary or a mandatory basis. Foods fortified on a voluntary basis are foods to which folic acid has been added at the discretion of manufacturers. This occurs at present in the case of certain breakfast cereals, milk and bread. Mandatory food fortification would require that a certain dietary staple or staples would be fortified to a specific agreed level.</P>
      <P>We would be obliged to try to ensure that the staple food chosen provides effective cover of women of childbearing age with as little excess exposure as possible to other groups. Unfortunately, there is no particular staple that is exclusive to women of childbearing age. It would, therefore, be inevitable that any introduction of mandatory fortification would impact to a greater or lesser extent on other sectors of the community. However, there is some concern that the mandatory fortification of a staple food such as flour could lead to the masking of pernicious anaemia, thereby preventing the early diagnosis of this condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Food Safety Advisory Board made three key recommendations in its report &ndash; first, that a comprehensive and sustained health promotion campaign be introduced at national and local level to promote the use of periconceptional folic acid, second, that the sub-committee on folic acid should examine the fortification of a staple food or foods with folic acid as an alternative or complementary strategy and, third, that a study be undertaken to provide the data necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of the periconcep<Col N="139" /> tional use of folic acid. The Food Safety Advisory Board was subsumed into the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in January 1998 and the folic acid sub-committee continues to meet under the auspices of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the context of voluntary fortification, the health promotion unit of my Department, in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, is currently examining the possibility of using a folic acid &ldquo;flash scheme&rdquo;. Under this scheme, foods which are fortified will be able to feature one of two logos, called flashes, thereby making it easier for women to identify foods fortified with folic acid.</P>
    <P>At European level, a White Paper on Food Safety was introduced on 12 January 2000 by the Commissioner for Public Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. David Byrne. This White Paper reflects the EU's priority of ensuring that the highest standards of food safety are set and maintained throughout the EU. The White Paper, co-written by the Enterprise Commissioner, Mr. Erkii Likkanen, contains a detailed 80 point action plan on legislation in food safety, with a precise timetable for regulation and implementation of the action plan over the next three years. In this White Paper the Commission has committed itself to submitting a proposal for a directive on fortified foods to the European Parliament and the Council by September 2000. This directive will lay down the provisions for marketing of foodstuffs to which nutrients such as vitamins and minerals have been added. It is unlikely that this directive will make fortification of a staple food mandatory. Rather, it will lay down the conditions under which fortification of food is permitted. The target date for adoption of this draft directive by the Council and Parliament is September 2001.</P>
    <P>I look forward to engaging in detailed discussions with interested parties in Ireland and with the Commission on this draft directive. My Department does not propose to develop national, unilateral legislation prior to the deliberations of the Commission having been completed.</P>
    <P>At the standing committee for foodstuffs meeting in Brussels on 15 December last, the Austrian delegation presented a request for an exchange of views on the issue of mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid. A number of member states were opposed to EU level action for reasons such as varying rates of unplanned pregnancy in member states, varying local eating habits and different recommended daily allowances for vitamins and minerals in member states, existing information campaigns in member states targeted at women planning pregnancies, labelling requirements and ethical issues. At this standing committee for foodstuffs meeting the Commission concluded that the issue of the possible regulation on an EU basis of the fortification of <Col N="140" /> flour with folic acid should be revisited in the context of the proposed draft directive on the addition of vitamins and minerals to food which I referred to earlier. I understand that the EU scientific committee for food is currently examining the upper safe limits for vitamins and minerals including folic acid. Its report is due for publication in October of this year and should provide a scientific basis to the draft directive.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for food, I look forward to engaging in detailed discussions on this matter in the future. I am aware that the fortification of a staple food with folic acid is a complex issue with commercial, legal and logistical aspects. I would like to thank Senator Henry for again raising this important issue in the House. I take this opportunity to assure the House that the Department and I are committed to ensuring that no effort is spared to ensure that the number of babies born with neural tube defects can be reduced or eliminated altogether.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senator that this matter should not be placed on the long finger. As she said, it is over two years since she raised this issue in the House. Despite what I said earlier, namely, that we would not take unilateral action, in my opinion the time has come to consider this matter if there is no movement on it at EU level. I again thank the Senator for her support in respect of this issue.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. The use of food flashes is a novel idea which could prove helpful. Will the Minister of State, when he next addresses the standing committee for foodstuffs, take into account the situation regarding cardiac disease? I am sure he has been approached by increasing numbers of cardiologists who, particularly those from the rim of Europe, say that this could be very important. It is sad to think that we were warned to stop eating crubeens and a morning fry because cardiovascular problems were caused by fat when it has emerged that such problems may be due to a genetic predisposition. I will ask cardiologists to contact the Minister of State in the hope that he can raise this matter at the committee.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for accepting this matter on the Adjournment. I also thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for being present for this important debate. I wish to raise the need for the Minister for Finance to carry out maintenance under the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1995, on the section of the River Shannon between Meelick weir and Athlone town, as a co-operative scheme between the local authorities of Roscommon, Galway, Leitrim, <Col N="141" /> Longford, Westmeath and Offaly and the public bodies &ndash; ESB, Bord na Móna and Dúchas.</P>
      <P>It is as a result of the serious flooding crisis that has been experienced in the Shannon basin that I raise this matter. During the Christmas and new year period, the people who live in the basin and in the catchment area of the River Shannon and its tributaries experienced flooding of a degree unseen since the 1950s. It is not acceptable in the year 2000, at the dawn of the new millennium, that we should be faced with a situation where the people and children who live ordinary lives in ordinary communities in the areas to which I refer should be obliged to remain housebound as a result of flooding on one of the finest natural waterways in Europe.</P>
      <P>As a House of the Oireachtas we have a responsibility to address the cause and effects of flooding. Tonight I will deal with the effects and a proposal that I believe is constructive enough to deal with it at least on the basis of maintenance. There will be another opportunity in both Houses to debate the matter of overall responsibility for the catchment area of the River Shannon and whether we need an authority for the river. Perhaps a decision will be made.</P>
      <P>My motion is based on an opportunity that presents itself in the 1995 legislation into which I had a major input in this House. Serious flooding problems can be dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis under amended arterial drainage legislation. I recall that the late Hugh Coveney, then Minister of State, responded to a direct question of mine. Where local authorities in co-operation with public bodies decided that it was appropriate to carry out maintenance work on a section or sections of the River Shannon, I asked if the legislation would cover that activity. It is on public record that he gave a positive response provided there was co-operation. That is at the heart of my motion.</P>
      <P>I call on the local authorities of Roscommon, Galway, Leitrim, Longford, Westmeath and Offaly and the public bodies of the ESB, Bord na Móna and Dúchas to come forward with a scheme that will deal with the serious maintenance neglect of the River Shannon from the Meelick weir to Athlone town. I ask the Minister of Finance to oversee and respond to them if that happens. We all know that over the past 50 years everyone, farmers, industry, tourism, all public bodies and local authorities have contributed to the problem. For 50 years they have used the channel of the River Shannon as their dumping ground. They have allowed all their waste to go into that channel and no one has thought fit to take one shovel of refuse or dumped material out of it. My motion addresses that issue by asking for a co-operative approach under existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not talking about the drainage of the River Shannon. Local authorities spend many thousands of pounds in each of their catchment areas on roads and in other areas of their activity that have been damaged by flash flooding and a <Col N="142" /> lack of maintenance of the River Shannon. We now have a spill over. We are redressing and rebuilding. We are spending public money in 2000 on works carried out previously in 1996 and 1997. Much money has been spent on upgrading roads and many other areas of public activity. Now we must spend public moneys on those areas again. Surely it is time to call a halt to that when there is a simple solution. Unfortunately, it will not deal with the overall problem.</P>
    <P>We have 70,000 acres of Bord na Móna peat land, 250,000 acres of farm land, all the industries along the River Shannon and a tourism industry involving hundreds of boats, but we do not have pump out facilities. All of these factors have contributed to the dumping of material in the channel. This legislation gives us an opportunity to redress that by carrying out a maintenance programme. I am not putting a time limit nor estimating the cost of such a scheme. However, a five-year plan should be considered for carrying out a maintenance programme from the Meelick weir to Banagher bridge to Athlone town. This would alleviate the serious flooding that my constituency of Roscommon/Longford and the other counties I referred to have experienced over Christmas and the new year period.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is responsive to this matter because he appreciates the crisis and the complications involved. I also know that it is not within his jurisdiction alone. All he can do is act as a facilitator. If the local authorities and public bodies have the will to put their heads together then I ask him to act as facilitator. Only then can we discuss the finances necessary to do the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for raising this important issue. I know he is deeply concerned about it.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to explain to this House the role of the Office of Public Works in relation to the recent flooding on the River Shannon. I sympathise with the victims and I appreciate how traumatic flooding of this magnitude can be. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, described graphically to me the problems particular to the Athlone area during the flooding. Senator Finneran did the same.</P>
      <P>As Senator Finneran has said, the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995 gives the Commissioners of Public Works the power to prepare a drainage scheme for any watercourse or part of a watercourse where they are of the opinion that such a scheme is expedient. This means that any scheme must be cost beneficial, environmentally acceptable and not cause problems elsewhere. It must also be considered that the recent flooding in the Shannon basin was the worst for over 50 years with rainfall for December 1999 being twice the normal average. Much of the area in question floods every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the Shannon is that there has been a consensus over a considerable period that capital works to relieve flooding are <Col N="143" /> not viable and there is no evidence to suggest that this position has changed. The most recent of many reports on the Shannon, commissioned by the IFA and carried out by consultants Delap and Waller, concluded that there were no obvious localised engineering works apparent to them which, if carried out, would significantly improve the regime of the river. It is not possible to carry out maintenance work on any river without first setting the standard to which one requires it to be maintained. My office has statutory responsibility for the maintenance of approximately 40 arterial drainage schemes which are maintained to the design standard publicly exhibited prior to the execution of the capital works on each of the original schemes. No arterial drainage scheme has been carried out on the River Shannon by the Office of Public Works so it is not possible for it <Col N="144" /> to undertake maintenance works, nor would it have any authority to do so.</P>
    <P>However, I am conscious of the particular problems in this part of the Shannon and my office has been in contact with Westmeath County Council in this regard. Should any of the other bodies listed by Senator Finneran in his motion have any proposals or suggestions as to how the problem between Meelick and Athlone might be alleviated, the Office of Public Works will be delighted to consider these proposals or to offer any other advice that might be appropriate. I do not need to remind Senator Finneran or the House of the Government's concern about the difficulties experienced by the people of this area and I welcome the views of all bodies mentioned.</P>
