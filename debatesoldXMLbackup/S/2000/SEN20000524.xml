      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline the deliberations of the UN Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, which took place in Vienna in April 2000, and Ireland's views and input on restorative justice.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Coghlan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to make a statement on the local fishermen's traditional rights on the Caragh River and to clarify if a map can be produced clearly indicating ownership of the various sections.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 2 and 3: No. 2, the Human Rights Commission Bill, 1999 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 3, Registration of Lobbyists Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Business shall resume thereafter if not previously concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is not agreed. On numerous occasions in the House Senator Cassidy has given an assurance to Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello that he would bring a joint motion before the House for debate on party political funding and all other related matters. Given that it is a current topic, it is disgraceful the motion has not been put <Col N="594" /> together since the House last sat. I do not think Senator Cassidy has acted with the due speed to which he committed himself on the last sitting day.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate and to bring the Minister for Public Enterprise to the House to discuss Eircom shares. The Minister has to answer the people who bought shares, particularly given that Alfie Kane, the chief executive of Eircom, has stated publicly that at the time of going public he advised against selling the shares at such a high price and that the Minister went against that advice.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the ongoing tragedy of haemophiliacs, particularly the 75 people who have died. While this matter is still being considered by the Lindsay tribunal, sufficient evidence has come to light to call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to immediately undertake an investigation into criminal negligence. I ask that time be provided to debate this very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to the Order of Business. On two days last week the Leader gave a clear commitment that an all-party agreed motion would be tabled allowing us discuss the allegations of corruption and sleaze and how we might deal with them and put our house in order. I asked for that to be done before any names were on the table. It is absolutely unacceptable, having agreed a wording with the Leader which would have allowed him put this motion on the Order of Business, to find it is not on today's Order Paper. It is not the way to do business. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we take motion 21 as the first item.</P>
      <P>Last year I claimed due process was not observed in dealing with Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty. I believe he was badly treated&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;by the system then and I believe he is again being badly treated by the system. On the basis of what was an unwise and poor judgment, he was cast to the lions and wolves. It is unfair that a man who was driven by humanitarian concerns is again being publicly destroyed. The Government handled the matter badly last year and is again handling it badly this week. I have trust and confidence in Mr. O'Flaherty that he will do a good job for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the crocodile tears being shed by Members on both sides in relation to Mr. O'Flaherty. The man did nothing other than make a poor judgment. In these Houses the most we can do in the face of extreme levels of corruption is put people on a paid holiday for 30 days, while we are worried about the way in which we are dealing with Mr. O'Flaherty. He has been poorly served by politics and the Government and is now being made a scapegoat for the fact <Col N="595" /> that we do not have our house in order in terms of dealing with sleaze and corruption. We should examine what we are doing, give ourselves the necessary powers, be seen by the people to take proper action where required and observe due process. We are all agreed on the need for due process and we should deal with the issue by putting together a protocol for these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator O'Toole. I also wish to express the same sentiments regarding the absence of a motion on corruption. The Leader proposed two weeks ago that all the group leaders would meet and that a joint motion would be tabled last week. That did not happen and he then promised that we would meet last week and that the joint motion would be tabled this week. We met last week and agreed the text of a motion, yet a motion has not been tabled. That is an unsatisfactory response to something that was decided in the House. This matter involves corruption, bribery and scandal. It is being discussed throughout Ireland but we have not had the opportunity to discuss it in the House. The Leader made a commitment which he did not fulfil. We have no choice but to oppose the Order of Business. The motion Senator O'Toole and I proposed should be the first item on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader facilitate a debate on the appointment of the former judge, Hugh O'Flaherty, to the European Investment Bank? It has also been discussed elsewhere, including in the other House, but such a debate is not provided for on the Order Paper and I do not know whether the Leader proposes to do so. It would be appropriate to debate the matter today. It is a matter of considerable public importance.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Senator O'Toole's remarks. When Mr. O'Flaherty was a judge he refused to appear before an Oireachtas committee to make a statement. He stepped down voluntarily when the Government partners were about to impeach him. There are serious matters involved, including the death of a woman, the imprisoning of a young man and a controversial judicial decision. Why are judges appointed to high office if they do not make proper decisions? If it was appropriate for the coalition partners to suggest impeachment at that time, it is now more appropriate that they should not reward somebody they were about to impeach by appointing him to high office in Europe. An urgent discussion is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the flotation of Telecom Éireann, now Eircom, which was raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn. It would be useful to debate this issue. Had the shares been offered at a lower level the Opposition would have been the <Col N="596" /> first to criticise the Minister for not ensuring maximum accrual of revenue to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear. That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I say this with some degree of feeling as someone who invested in Telecom Éireann and still holds Eircom shares. The Opposition would have been the first to criticise the Minister for dereliction of duty had she not conducted the sale in the manner in which she did and employed two firms to establish the valuation of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should come in and explain it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if the Opposition Members hurt as a result of the fall in the shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We know where the hurt is. The Senator should give us an account of his party's meeting this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will also be well aware that in all such flotations a statement is provided to the effect that shares can go down as well as up.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other issue raised, we have three hours this evening to debate issues regarding lobbyists and I am quite confident that many of the issues that have been raised with regard to the other matter can find their way into that debate. It surprises me that if there was such pressure from the Labour Party to have this issue debated immediately it did not avail of its Private Members' time to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with Senator O'Toole's remarks about Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty.</P>
      <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the House a warning issued today by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that there is a contaminated supply of heroin available in Dublin and elsewhere. The warning was issued following the deaths of eight young people within the past two weeks from heroin overdoses or related illnesses. The Leader of the House should invite the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement to the House on this serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House should congratulate the Minister for Health and Children on the £10 million initiative to reduce waiting lists. In Ireland, however, it is still traditional to anaesthetise people, either by local or general anaesthetic, when they are undergoing surgery. I would be grateful if the Leader would ask the Minister to attend the House to explain how he proposes to carry out the waiting list initiative in <Col N="597" /> view of the shortage of anaesthetists in many hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>He will hypnotise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>In Monaghan, for example, consultants have pointed out that no junior anaesthetists will be employed from July onwards, so they will not be able to maintain the service.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children also for deciding to divide his largesse 50-50 between hospitals and the general health service. Given that there are such constraints on staffing, both nursing and medical, within the hospitals, it is more sensible to apply them to the non-hospital health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the comments made by Senator O'Toole. This House and the Lower House have put Mr. Justice O'Flaherty down as a marked man. He is a man who has served this country through the decades but now we want to mark him down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have a little more humility. If we lack humility it will be a sad day for both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the shortage of qualified teachers in primary and secondary schools, a matter which arose yesterday at the Joint Committee on Education and Science. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House for a debate on how we can overcome this shortage? We should face up to the problem now rather than next October or November. A huge number of untrained teachers are doing substitute work in schools while staff teachers are on maternity leave. I wonder if the Department's forward planning is correct because in recent years something has gone wrong with the assessment of the rate of decline in pupil numbers. It is a serious matter to have untrained teachers instructing young people in school. It would be opportune to have such a debate before the summer recess. In that way we could reassure the public that our children are being trained and taught properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Taylor-Quinn's request for a debate on the flotation of Eircom. This is not about what the Opposition or the Government said. The public feels conned over what happened.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader provide information on forthcoming legislation dealing with the committal of people of unsound mind and the granting of orders under the Mental Health Act? On a recent radio programme I heard of a man who had to commit his own father. He did it in a gentle and caring way &ndash; it was for his father's good. The family was distressed, however, to find that in the documentation they signed, the person being committed was described as a &ldquo;lunatic&rdquo;. Obviously, we will have to examine that matter. During the same programme, the Oireachtas was criticised for not dealing with this legislation, although I understand that something is happening along these lines.</P>
      <P>I strongly support Senator O'Toole and Senator Ormonde on this nasty matter of the EIB appointment and, in particular, the way in which it is being stirred up. It is most regrettable. As I understand it, it is principally a question of optics. Even in the Hamilton report, although the judge was described as being inappropriate and unwise in some of his actions &ndash; which of us has not? &ndash; it was principally that these actions could be misinterpreted by the public. I do not think somebody should be so completely and irrevocably damaged because of a perception by the public. That perception should be cleared up. I listened to the radio last night and it was quite astonishing that people were taking lumps out of each other on all sides, stirred on by Emily O'Reilly who, in the middle of it, out of nowhere, said: &ldquo;.. and I understand David Norris is friendly with him&rdquo;. What has that to do with the price of eggs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we getting to the point where there is a kind of ludicrous guilt by attainder and everything, including cabbages, carrots and the kitchen sink, is thrown into this unseemly stew? I can see the political parties getting into the rough. They all have their little slogans &ndash;&ldquo;that's typical Fianna Fáil, spread the muck&rdquo;. If we descend into the level of sloganeering and refuse to look at the actual sequence of facts, we will all be in trouble and we will damage not just one individual and his family but also the unfortunate people whose mother was killed. We will damage the whole fabric of political life in this country and I do not think we should go down that line. We should look at the situation calmly, clearly and rationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment some speakers on the other side of the House who have taken a very humane view of the Hugh O'Flaherty issue. The only point I would make on it is that people should realise that when most senior counsel are appointed either to the High Court or eventually to the Supreme Court, they can earn tenfold their salary working in a private capacity. Many senior counsel with whom I am familiar would not accept an appointment because it would mean they would have to take a huge drop in salary.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader allow a debate on bank charges, possibly before the end of this term? I was appalled to read yesterday a number of reports to the effect that of all the European countries, Irish banks have the highest charges for international exchange transactions. That is appalling. We have called for debates previously on this issue and it is about time the banks were called to heel. Some reports suggested there was a lack of competition in Ireland. I do not believe that is the case but there seems to be a cosy cartel among the main banks and the public are suffering. It is an appalling indictment that it is three times more expensive to exchange money in Ireland than it is in Finland. That problem will have to be tackled and there is an urgent need for a debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader endeavour to get the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to streamline the level of communication between the National Roads Authority and the ESB with regard to flashing warning lights at schools, which currently are being put in place throughout the country? They are valuable but there seems to have been a breakdown in communication because some of the lights have not been turned on. In Annagh national school, near Tuam, County Galway, the lights were put in place last October but they still have not been turned on, despite the fact that the school is close to one of the most dangerous bends in the country. There has been a breakdown in communication between the National Roads Authority, the ESB and the local authorities, and my representations and those of others have failed to solve the issue. Perhaps the Leader, through his intervention with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, might get a satisfactory conclusion and allow these lights to be turned on. I would appreciate the Leader's help in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's amendment to motion No. 21. It is essential that we debate it today &ndash; I understand that a promise was made to do so last week. I call for an urgent debate on the consultant's report on the Health and Safety Authority published yesterday. The nature of the criticism in the report is a cause for enormous public concern. Such criticism is unprecedented. Lives are at stake and it is urgent that <Col N="600" /> we debate the matter. It is better to act now than have a tribunal pick up the pieces later. We must protect lives and prevent the dangers heralded in this report. It is a disastrous condemnation of the actions taken and is worth reading.</P>
      <P>Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty is being tarnished in a manner which groups him with those who are guilty of more serious crimes which have been debated recently. He is clearly responsible for a misjudgment due to his taking a compassionate view. As Senator Norris said, there is absolutely no comparison between that misjudgment and the crimes of which others are accused. He is worthy of support and there should be a debate which reflects this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for an urgent debate on the O'Flaherty affair. Rather than getting into the events of the past, it is important that we look carefully at one of the more unfortunate side effects of this affair, which is the clear undermining of public confidence in judicial appointments and the independence of the Judiciary. As legislators, we need to examine carefully judicial appointments and the political appointment of judges. We must decide whether it is time to reform that system and consider a judicial council and the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. We should have an urgent debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ormonde's request for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to discuss the scarcity of teachers. I ask the Leader to draw to the attention of the Minister an issue now emerging, that this year the examination branch of the Department is finding it impossible to get qualified teachers to correct State examinations and it is casting about in the universities for undergraduates or post-graduates to fill the role previously filled by practising teachers. Will the Leader indicate to the Minister my alarm and that of many parents at this?</P>
      <P>If the integrity of our public examination system is to be maintained, there must be coherence between those who teach the courses and syllabi, those who set the questions and those who correct them. Anything which dilutes this would undermine public confidence in State examinations. In this country, everything hinges on State examinations. We do not have an interview system or in-house assessments &ndash; we put all our eggs in one basket. It is critical that the integrity of the system is upheld in every way and that those who correct State examinations are qualified and have demonstrated that they are competent to do so. I ask the Leader to ensure this matter is addressed urgently because the State examinations are about to commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Independent Senators on their remarks on the O'Flaherty affair. I fail to see the relevance of Senator <Col N="601" /> O'Meara's comments. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, acted independently by suggesting Hugh O'Flaherty for the position. He could have appointed a senior politician but did not.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Donovan's request for a debate on banking which, perhaps, the Leader could arrange. We had a debate on banking some time before we entered EMU. We castigated the banks, particularly regarding credit card charges. We also referred to the high level of interest rates after we joined EMU when interest rates had fallen. I was appalled, therefore, to learn yesterday that we are being charged 27% in this State when the country with the lowest rates charges only 9% and the average is 15%. Something will have to be done to tackle the banking system. When the two most profitable banks in the State are heading for profits of £1 billion, it is wrong that the customer is being charged such high rates.</P>

      <P>I support Senators Ormonde and Quill in their call for the Minister for Education and Science to come into the House and assure the parents of national school pupils that the high number of substitute and part-time teachers will be addressed. There are almost 1,600 such teachers, an extraordinary figure. Some of those people are well qualified but they are not trained teachers. The parents want to be assured that those pupils are receiving an equitable education.</P>
      <P>There have been calls for a debate on Eircom shares. Senator Dardis was quickly on his feet to reply to that but not to the other matters that have been raised. I am delighted he held on to his shares and did not make a quick profit at the initial stage. Many people, particularly first time investors, have done the same.</P>

Eircom is a company which demanded support and I hope it has a future, if it is not destroyed by the ineptitude of this Government first. It would be worthwhile to <Col N="602" /> debate the matter in this House so we could hear an explanation for the initial flotation price.</P>
      <P>The Leader promised many Senators time and time again that there would be a debate on waste management, particularly with reference to incineration. With the recent report from the United States by the EPA on the carcinogenic nature of dioxins and their relationship with incineration, and the Minister's recent statement that he still supports incineration, this House should debate the issue. People want to know whether incineration is safe. This House, not the media, is a suitable place for such a debate.</P>

      <P>As an Irishman, I am particularly saddened by the manner in which Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty is being treated. It is sad to see such an eminent person, and by extension his family, being ridiculed, denigrated and lampooned. This is turning into a national entertainment &ndash; a scapegoat is picked and thrown to the lions, as if we are trying to satisfy some hunger in ourselves for sensationalism or trying to comply with a political correctness which is self destructive. Mr. O'Flaherty has given great service to this State and it is sad to see the manner in which he is being treated. It brings no credit on us.</P>
      <P>If we are to have a debate in this House, why not have a debate on due process? Over the weeks various people, who have not been proved guilty of anything, have been brought out and we point the finger at them and ruin their careers. It is time for us to stop bowing down to the media and to take a stand for decency and fair play.</P>

      <P>To add to what Senator Doyle said, I ask the House if we are living in the real world. He spoke about the deaths of eight young people in a fortnight. In my electoral area I attended the funerals, one day after another, of two young men under 25 years of age. The deaths, unfortunately, were drug related. Putting it mildly, I will be exceedingly perturbed if the Leader tells me he will make time available for this debate at some stage. What is happening to young people is tantamount to a form of genocide. That may sound extreme, but there have <Col N="603" /> been 12 deaths since January in my area. What will we do about the fact that there has been eight deaths in a fortnight? No other discussion could rate as highly as trying to do something about this curse and plague which is upon us.</P>
      <P>Are we living on separate planets? Does anyone know how bad the problem is and what it is like? I would be most interested in the Leader asking the Minister to take realistic action by way of extra resources for the Garda and the voluntary groups who are trying to deal with this problem.</P>

      <P>I echo what has been said on the matter and I compliment those on the other side of the House who have defended and upheld the decision to appoint former Justice Hugh O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank. He has been treated disgracefully and I do not believe he did anything wrong. He compares with a similar great man, the good man from Nazareth who was crucified.</P>
      <P>Last week I raised a question on inland water sports and I thank the Leader for agreeing to have a debate on this matter.

      <P>I have heard of Governments being criticised for an enormous number of things but to be criticised for share prices in an open market seems to go beyond the realities of the situation. I want to declare that I have Eircom shares and I intend to continue to hold them. I am not sure whether a debate in this House would help people who have taken up these shares. Perhaps the Leader would encourage the Minister for Public Enterprise to dispose of the <Col N="605" /> 35% overhang in the market as quickly as possible. If that was done Eircom would know who its shareholders really are.</P>
      <P>With all due respect to Members who wish to raise this issue today, it seems to me that they do not read the financial newspapers very often. Telecom shares are suffering a downturn throughout Europe, it is not just confined to Eircom. In the circumstances I do not believe that there is any point in debating this issue. What would we debate? Would we debate the share price? Would such a debate have an effect on the stock market? None whatsoever.</P>
      <P>It was with some sadness &ndash; and I am sure that many Members feel the same &ndash; that I read yesterday that our friend and colleague, Senator Quill, has indicated her intention to retire at the next election.

      <P>Two momentous events took place this week. Yesterday many Members of both Houses were present when members of the RUC Police Federation, the Widows' Association and the Disabled Members Association visited Government buildings and met the Taoiseach. This was a ground breaking meeting which has been given extensive coverage in the media. Those of us who were present got a very positive response from the people who came south. This was an unprecedented meeting and I hope it was the first of many.</P>
      <P>Perhaps in the context of what is happening on Saturday, the Leader might consider having a debate on the ramifications of the Good Friday Agreement and wider Northern Ireland issues. Such a debate would give Members an opportunity to discuss the Patten report, which was uppermost in the minds of the people who visited us yesterday. I ask the Leader to convey to Mr. Trimble that we hope he will have some success. That may seem ironic coming from the Fianna Fáil side. Yesterday I talked to a number of politicians and it was suggested that if Mr. Trimble sat down with the dissidents over a cup of tea and a sandwich in their homes and did some old fashioned canvassing he might be able to make them waiver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with all of the comments that have been made about Mr. O'Flaherty's appointment and I applaud the Independents. It is significant that it was they who initiated support for him. The <Col N="606" /> viciousness of the campaign against this man and his family has gone beyond normal political debate and fair comment. I wish Mr. O'Flaherty well. He is a wise choice and will be an excellent ambassador for Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the comments on the manner in which former Mr. Justice O'Flaherty has been pilloried in the past week. It is nothing short of disgraceful and I have no doubt that in time his fine legal career will be replicated as vice president of the European Investment Bank. The House should wish him well in that important and onerous position.</P>
      <P>I support the call by my colleague, Senator Bonner, for a debate on banking charges. The most recent report told us only what we already knew, that is, there is no real and effective competition within the banking industry. As a consequence, the consumer is getting a raw deal. A debate in this House could crystalise the steps taken to ensure the industry is policed so that real competition is injected into it and the consumer is treated satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Like many of my colleagues, I declare an interest in Eircom shares and call on the Leader not to accede to the requests for a debate on the issue in this House. The value of shareholdings will not be enhanced by making the issue a political football in this Chamber. Responsibility for share values rests with the board and managing director of that company.</P>

      <P>I thank all 33 Senators for making a contribution on the Order of Business. Senators Taylor-Quinn, O'Toole and many others expressed great concern about the way in which business has been ordered for today. I have been in this House a long time, as have other Senators, and I have never seen a one page amendment on the Order Paper. I gave my word to the House last week and I consulted with my colleague, the Government Chief Whip, on allowing a debate to take place here today. I decided to extend the debate by one hour so that the concerns of Members, including funding of political parties, funding of politicians, all the allegations made about corruption in public life and many other issues relating to public representatives, can be discussed. I have no hesitation in extending the time tonight to facilitate the leaders to whom I gave my word and the Senators to whom I gave undertakings last week. Any Member who wishes to make an observation or speak on this topic may do so this evening, beginning at 6 p.m. I accept that Senator O'Toole tabled an amendment in good faith and we had an agreement last week. However, the wording in my amendment <Col N="607" /> covers every issue, including appointments, elections, public life in general and all the various allegations made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem allowing as much time as is necessary for each Senator to make a contribution on this topic. I agree with Senator O'Toole that not only should we deal with this issue, but we should be perceived to be dealing with it. I will extend the time to allow this debate to take place and this can be reviewed as the debate progresses. I ask the Senator to consider his amendment to the Order of Business and I accept fully everything he has said in good faith.</P>
      <P>On the various opinions of Senators on shares, everyone knows it is a commercial decision if a member of the public wishes to buy a particular share of their choice. While I do not have shares in this company, I believe the shares will be profitable in the long term. In the short term, however, there will be swings and roundabouts and I see no merit in having a debate in this House on the issue.</P>
      <P>Many Senators made their views known to this House, and justifiably so, on the appointment of Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty to the European Investment Bank. I was pleased to hear of his appointment. I have heard Members say, when discussing other matters, that everyone is entitled to a second chance. This man made an intervention on humanitarian grounds. There is no doubt that if he had not done so he would be the Chief Justice today and all parties would have applauded him. He is an eminent man and I have no doubt his credibility and ability will be recognised and acknowledged abroad. I wish him well.</P>
      <P>Senators Doyle and Ridge called for a debate on the drugs issue and, in particular, on the death in the last two weeks of eight young people from drug related illnesses. I will allow time for such a debate in this session. Senators Henry, Glynn and Leonard welcomed the allocation by the Minister for Health and Children of £10 million to the health services to help with the waiting lists. I will pass on to the Minister their concerns about the shortage of staff in that sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> Senators Ormonde, Quill and Coogan called for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to debate the shortage of qualified teachers.

    <P>Senators O'Donovan, Bonner, Coghlan and Walsh called for a debate on bank charges. Senator Finneran has called for such a debate on a number of occasions and it will take place in this session. I will pass Senator McDonagh's views regarding the NRA, local authorities and school warnings to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn called for a debate on the consultants' report on health and safety. I will allow time for such a debate. Senator Coogan called for a debate on waste management and the United States EPA's report. I will allow time for such a debate also. Senator Glynn asked for a debate on inland water sports and coarse fishing and I will allow time for such a debate in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke asked that his views regarding tourism be passed on to the relevant Minister. I have always found that if one gives value for money one never goes into recession. People who are giving value for money are doing very well and those who are not giving value for money are not getting repeat business. As the Senator said, the strength of sterling and the US dollar should ensure Ireland is an attractive country to visit over the next year or two. I will pass on the Senator's views to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney welcomed the visit by the RUC widows to the House yesterday and called for a debate on the Patten report. I will allow time for such a debate. Senator Mooney also expressed his good wishes to Senator Quill who has said she will not stand in the next election. I do not recall hearing or reading anywhere that Senator Quill would not be available to serve in the Seanad after the next election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The State shall, within 6 months from the passing of this Act, ratify or otherwise become a party to the following instruments&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)Protocol No. 7 to the European Convention, done at Strasbourg on the 22nd day of November, 1984;</P>

      <P>I thought I understood the intricacies of the rules of the House, but I am a little confused why amendment No. 1 is in order and amendment No. 2 is out of order. However, I will not pursue it or test the patience of the Acting Chairman, who has had a rough couple of days &ndash; I do not wish to further test his stamina.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to deal with the extraordinary tardiness with which the State ratifies various international conventions. Our tardiness in relation to Protocol No. 7 of the European Convention, which dates from November 1984, should be a matter of embarrassment. However friendly the Minister of State and I are, I would be naive to believe he will accept the amendment, but I would like to hear whether a timescale exists for the instruments referred to in amendments Nos. 1 and 2. Amendment No. 2, which is out of order, refers to the European Convention on Human Rights and Protocols 1 to 11.</P>

As was said during the debate in the Dáil, Ireland in so far as the adoption of international treaties and obligations is concerned takes the dualist approach in such matters because of the effect of Article 15 of the Constitution, which provides that the role and exclusive power of making laws for the State is vested in the Oireachtas, and Article 29.6, which states that no international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State save as may be determined by the Oireachtas. This latter provision has been interpreted as precluding the Irish courts from giving effect to an international agreement if it is contrary to or grants rights or imposes obligations additional to those of domestic law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the State wishes to adhere to an international agreement it must, therefore, ensure its domestic law is in conformity with the agreement in question. In some cases the entire contents of such an agreement are transposed into domestic law by providing that the agreement shall have the force of law in the State. In other cases it may only be necessary to transpose certain provisions <Col N="611" /> of the agreement simply because other provisions are either already incorporated in our law or are of a nature that they do not require incorporation. Sometimes no transposition provisions are required, an example is the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities which was ratified in May 1999 and which has been referred to in debates on the Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from that fatal flaw, the question of the ratification of all the instruments mentioned in the amendment is already the subject of detailed consideration. In so far as Protocol No. 7 to the European Convention on Human Rights is concerned, the matter is relevant in the context of the Government's recent decision to incorporate the convention into Irish law by next October in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and against the background of the legislative and other developments taking place in terms of immigration.</P>
    <P>Legislation dealing with the so-called torture convention has already passed through the other House and is currently awaiting Report and Final Stages in this House. The convention on racial discrimination is being examined now that the equal status legislation has been enacted. The 1996 revised Social Charter together with its additional protocol, which deals with a system of collective complaints, has been the subject of consultations with ICTU and IBEC. I understand our signature and ratification of both instruments is currently under active consideration. Therefore, I think it must be accepted that there is no need whatever to place a statutory obligation on the Government to do what it is already in the process of doing.</P>
    <P>Apart from that there is a more fundamental objection relating to the Legislature binding the Executive in a matter which clearly requires careful consideration and examination as to how best and by what means the State should take on board international treaties, agreements or conventions. Accordingly, I will not accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed reply but am quite taken by the idea that there would be something wrong with the Legislature binding the Government. Funnily enough, I thought our job was to define the limits of Government, to be the body which ensured Government did not abuse its power. Power can be abused by commission or omission. Omitting by delay or deliberate policy to ratify a large number of international agreements dealing with various aspects of human rights is an abuse of power because it restricts the right of citizens to claim rights which might not be explicit in our Constitution but which we have said, for the benefit of international public opinion, we subscribe to and which conveniently for Government we say at home we will not really subscribe to. I <Col N="612" /> am talking about such instruments as the convention on the rights of the child.</P>
      <P>There may have been serious and detailed objections to the amendment, and I would have listened to them carefully because I appreciate it is a complex issue. However, my patience is tested when it is said there would be something wrong with the Legislature binding the Government. The function of the Legislature is to define the terms within which the Government operates. The Constitution and the law are what govern the country, not the Government. Governments operate within the Constitution and the law and if it is not bound by both of these then we have tyranny. I know the Government has no desire to be tyrannical, but the language emanating from it makes it sound as if human rights are a problem and the idea of a citizen demanding fair treatment in a range of areas, such as racial discrimination, is an inconvenience and a further burden on the State.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to explain why ratification of these instruments takes so long and why it is such a tortuous process. I am not too concerned about what other countries do because we have a reasonably good tradition. People are often surprised to hear there are only three countries in Europe with a longer history of continuous democracy this century than Ireland, namely, Switzerland, Sweden and the UK. We have a longer tradition of continuous democratic government than most countries in Europe and we should recognise the worth and achievement of that.</P>
      <P>Human rights are a part of democratic government and are a continuously evolving concept. These international conventions are not particularly radical. By and large they are the lowest common denominator agreed between a large number of states. To allow indifference to cause the sort of delay which result in protocols dating back to 1984 being without full force in the State suggests a peculiar set of priorities and that this long delayed and overdue human rights commission would not have appeared if it had not been forced on us by the parties to the Good Friday Agreement. The Minister of State's reply was most regrettable.</P>

      <P>When Senator Ryan opened the debate on this amendment he said that he would not push it and that we would have a philosophical debate. I was disappointed with the Minister of State's reply because it seemed to rob the debate of all philosophy. My concern, which I expressed on Second Stage, is that the Bill tends to take a minimalist approach to civil and human rights and it is similar to pulling a tooth to get such commissions established. The imaginative language in the Good Friday Agreement regarding human rights and so on somehow runs into the sand. I am sorry that we were given an explanation which depended on a good deal of gobbledegook and some doubtful constitutional principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> I must apologise for myself every day for the number of times I wrote in drafts for Ministers that issues were under active consideration and I shudder to think that these instruments are under active consideration. The European Convention on Human Rights was only this year incorporated into Irish and UK law to some extent, 50 years after it was drafted. If that is the speed of gestation, we will wait a long time for the rest of it. The Minister of State's reply seems to miss the evolving nature of human rights across the world, the changing nature of society and the needs that throws up. The European convention is a splendid document and a model of its kind but it is a dated model which needs to be updated, similar to the UN convention, by various conventions and protocols.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Ryan, I admire the history of this country in regard to the protection of human rights, particularly the durability of the 1937 Constitution, but nevertheless times change and we should be ready to embrace change. I would be much happier if the Government outlined a concerted vision of human rights. We quickly assent to conventions rhetorically when they are promulgated but take a long time to implement them in our jurisdiction. The argument about separation of powers is quite tenuous. Like Senator Ryan, I believe that it is the job of the Legislature to show order. The law is that the Executive is in a position then to adhere to international treaties. I join with Senator Ryan in expressing disappointment in what seems to be a lack of enthusiasm for the entire process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the concerns of Senators Hayes and Ryan about the hypocrisy that exists. We are great at verbalising about, supporting and signing up to conventions, yet we do not ratify them in legislation. The EU has appointed a special committee to examine human rights to update the European Convention on Human Rights, which was introduced more than 50 years ago. Representatives from all member states meet on a regular basis in Brussels to examine the issue. The Heads of State will meet in December to formalise an updated convention on human rights for the EU. International conventions are the lowest common denominator agreed between states. Even within that committee there is a reluctance to address issues and push the boat out a little further. I am concerned that the <i>raison d'être</i> for the Bill is that the Taoiseach can at least say to his fellow Heads of State in December that Ireland has set up a human rights commission and is going through the formalities. However, basic issues are not being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State's reply was sketchy and not convincing. There has been a great deal of racial discrimination and intolerance in recent times throughout the State where refugees are concerned. There was even a slight indication of it on the Order of Business earlier. It is important that there are laws to govern this level of intolerance and indecency towards our fellow human <Col N="614" /> beings. The Republic of Ireland is supposed to be a Christian, ultra-Catholic community. Much of our response in legislation, if it were examined closely, does not clearly state that.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister of State should have no difficulty accepting the amendment, which provides for Protocol No. 7, the torture and racial discrimination conventions and the European Social Charter, 1995. These are basic instruments which are increasingly needed. As a result of the great economic boom, Irish people seem to be losing many of the basic principles and finer characteristics associated with them. There is a need to doubly ensure that such principles are protected and that those in vulnerable positions are protected by the legislation that we adopt, particularly in regard to human rights. Ireland is a relatively young and modern democratic State. It is not long since there was appalling abuses of human rights here and we should very much appreciate it so that we can legislate to protect human rights. I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment. While additional legislation may be needed, at least a start can be made by accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government proposes and the Legislature disposes. The taking of international agreements is a matter for the Government and it will only do so under certain conditions, such as a constitutional requirement. Protocol No. 7 is not even in force yet, as a sufficient number of states have not acceded to it. Our record on accession to international agreements is quite good, as the list I circulated following my Second Stage contribution demonstrated.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Hayes's remarks, the Bill adopts a much more imaginative approach than the corresponding Northern Ireland Act. Generalisations are almost always dangerously misleading but it is almost universally believed that the convention on human rights generally is liberally orientated while the provisions of the Constitution are more restrictive. Why then, when the Government proposed to limit the grounds on which bail could be refused by a court, did it find that under the convention bail could be refused if there was a possibility that the accused person might commit further offences while released? Under the Constitution bail can only be refused on the grounds that the accused might abscond or interfere with a witness.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as the Review Group on the Constitution pointed out in its 1996 report, the replacement of the existing fundamental rights provisions in the Constitution by the provisions of the convention would lead to a diminution in some individual rights as some of those rights &ndash; for example, personal liberty in Article 44 &ndash; are more extensively protected by the Constitution than under the equivalent provisions of the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, incorporation, as such, would not fill any gaps at constitutional level since every sub<Col N="615" /> stantive right afforded by the convention is either expressly protected by the Constitution or has been recognised as an unremunerated personal right under Article 40.3.1º of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As far as the incorporation issue is concerned, it is well recognised that the fact that we have had a written Constitution since 1937, ready access to the courts, and the fact that our courts can strike down legislation, is well ahead of most other States. Our record under the convention shows that six cases were taken in 47 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an extraordinary touchiness about this matter. Incidentally, I accept that there are aspects of the operation of the European Convention on Human Rights where narrower rights are defined than those in our Constitution. Unless we amend our Constitution, however, that will not cause a problem because obviously the Constitution will have a superior force. On the other hand, it was through the European Convention on Human Rights that Senator Norris managed to talk some sense into this State about areas in which the State felt obliged to put its nose. The State had felt obliged to regulate areas of human behaviour which were not its business. Therefore, we have benefited from the convention.</P>
      <P>I notice the Minister did not mention how many of the cases that were taken against us were successful and how many were not. My recollection is that one or two cases &ndash; in particular, the case of non-marital children and Senator Norris's case &ndash; were successful, even if on limited grounds.</P>
      <P>All this is very fine, but it does not get away from the fact that, for instance, the European Convention on Torture, which is tortuously making its way through the Oireachtas, has been in force for many years. If General Pinochet had landed here for his medical treatment, instead of in London, we probably could not have detained him because we had not ratified the convention. What concern of national security or anything else could have delayed for so long a convention to suppress torture? It is simply a lack of priority and this amendment is about encouraging such priorities. Apart from the Convention on Torture, we still do not have any real sense of urgency concerning a timescale within which many of these matters will be approved.</P>
      <P>For a variety of reasons I do not propose to push this matter to a vote. It is most regrettable, however, that we cannot obtain more satisfactory responses from the Minister about issues concerning international conventions. We are not dealing with them properly.</P>

      <P>I am just as critical of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Act and of the powers given to the commission there. I have said so already. It is a bit cheap of the Minister to throw <Col N="616" /> that in. I am concerned about another matter that flows from the Good Friday Agreement. There is a perception among Unionists in the North that they are being asked to swallow a heavy dose of human rights legislation which is not being pursued as actively here. This will become quite an active issue for debate as the policing Bill goes through its stages, and the demands of Nationalist parties and human rights activists and, I have no doubt, representatives of this Government to strengthen the human rights provisions in that legislation are heard. We should not do anything to weaken either the moral stance or the negotiating position of the Government by having a more diluted approach to human rights than others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have to keep on doing this, I will do so. The Bill is supposed to be a matter of urgency and we accept that it is. However, Governments seems to be determined never to bind themselves, even when matters are urgent. Section 3 states, &ldquo;The Minister shall by order appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;  It could be in 25 years' time. Why can they not say within one month or three months of the enactment of this legislation? The Freedom of Information Act was one of the very few Bills to have passed through the Oireachtas in recent years which contained a specific date for enactment. That was because the then Minister was worried that her successor might decide to sit on it for a long time.</P>
      <P>The Mental Treatment Act was passed by the Oireachtas in 1991, yet it was never brought into force. Some elements of the Local Government Acts were never brought into force either, because of the potential for major legal action against the State. Somebody should talk to the parliamentary draftsman's office to explain that this legislation is urgent and it should, therefore, contain a provision to appoint the establishment day within three months of the Bill's enactment. Why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why we have to have all these open-ended provisions. The Government is <Col N="617" /> particularly good at prescribing timescales for everybody else. Most legislation that deals with a subsidiary body contains a timescale within which things have to be done. When it comes to a simple matter of bringing leglsiation such as this into force, however, the Government wants to leave it open-ended and I think that is wrong.</P>

      <P>Section 5(4) states:</P>
      <P>A person shall not be appointed to be a member of the Commission unless it appears to the Government that the person is suitably qualified for such appointment by reason of his or her possessing such relevant experience, qualifications, training or expertise as, in the opinion of the Government, is or are appropriate, having regard, in particular, to the functions conferred on the Commission by this Act.</P>
      <P>Why does it not mention that the citizen ought to be of good character? The former Taoiseach, who was the beneficiary of £8.5 million of munificence from his business friends, would, without a doubt, have &ldquo;such relevant experience, qualifications, training or expertise&rdquo; to be a member of this commission. Doubtless, the gentleman who is soon to go to the European Investment Bank would also possess all of those qualifications.</P>
      <P>Why not insert into the subsection that the person should be somebody who the Government is satisfied is of good character, as well as meeting all the other requirements? I suppose we should be grateful that neither Ray Burke nor Pádraig Flynn has the necessary qualifications or expertise, or we might have both of them on the human rights commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection is a change from the previous position outlined in the heads of the Bill. It reflects the views of interested organisations and the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, as well as the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. The emphasis on legalism is now gone, though to some extent this criticism may have stemmed from the detail of the earlier provision which specified that the president of the commission had to be a Supreme Court judge and gave the impression that barristers and solicitors <Col N="618" /> had to be represented. Subsection (4) now contains a single set of criteria applicable to all members of the commission, including the president, who does not have to be a judicial person.</P>
      <P>The subsection is meant to convey the idea that a body such as the commission should be representative of a wide cross-section of the community. The subsection now provides that a person will not be appointed to be a member of the commission unless it appears to the Government that the person is suitably qualified for such appointment by reason of his or her possessing such relevant experience, qualifications, training and expertise as, in the opinion of the Government, are appropriate having regard in particular to the functions conferred on the commission by the Act. It is thus designed to ensure that members of the commission would be drawn from the widest possible background so as to ensure pluralist representation of the social elements involved in the promotion and protection of human rights in the State. Subsection (2), which provides for gender representation, and subsection (12), which is a guarantee of representation of Irish society as a whole in the composition of the commission, should be read in conjunction with this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to this matter on Second Stage. I am glad the Minister has taken the emphasis off in terms of only a judicial person being at the head of this commission, even if that was only an implication. I am content with the section as it stands but I would be encouraged if the Minister accepted a suggestion that there should be some advertising of the position so that people can express their interest in it.</P>
      <P>That comes back to something that was raised on the Order of Business today. I believe we are moving in the direction where all political appointments, and all public appointments in forms of patronage, should be made more openly and there should be some means of making people aware of vacancies so that their names can be considered. From my experience, albeit in other jurisdictions, there is often a tendency for the people who have worked the hardest in these fields to be overlooked when the time comes to make appointments, partly because people might think they made too much noise or whatever, but we should have due regard to the fact that there are people who have an honourable history of endeavour in promoting human rights when it was neither popular nor profitable to do so.</P>
      <P>On the whole question of filling vacancies in the Judiciary which may arise if a judge is appointed to the commission, that tends to overbalance the section a little and it could perhaps as easily be dealt with by way of a Schedule rather than in sections 4 or 5.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

      <P>It is vitally important that those appointed to the commission are people <Col N="619" /> who, voluntarily over the years, highlighted specific human rights abuses across the world. There are quite a number of people who have taken a particular interest in that and who have pursued, successfully in some instances, cases of abuses of human rights. Those people have a genuine commitment to and specific knowledge and detailed information about a variety of issues and the expertise they have built up over the years should not be ignored. At various stages these people have addressed the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, and I am sure the European affairs committee, and they have met the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I suggest to the Minister that a list of these people's names be compiled and from that list the people would be appointed to the commission. I would not like to think that people would be appointed to the commission because they had a particular political persuasion. Only those people who have a genuine commitment to and interest in human rights and who have a track record in pursuing the advancement of human rights throughout the world, including in this country, should be appointed to the commission.</P>
      <P>We always seem to look to the Judiciary in these matters but human rights is about basic respect for one's fellow human beings. I am not sure that we need judges to chair these bodies. It brings a wonderful legal dimension to it, but human rights is about basic respect for people and while there are many people who have knowledge of the various conventions but who may not necessarily be trained in legal matters, they have a much broader legal knowledge of that specific area than somebody who was appointed a judge and whose expertise may be in commercial, constitutional or company law. That is the reality. I have some qualms about the idea of a judge. Anybody with a track record in this area could chair the commission and I ask the Minister to re-examine the manner in which these appointments will be made.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) to encourage ratification by the State of human rights instruments or accession to those instruments, and to ensure their implementation,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a fairly innocuous amendment. Section 8 deals with the functions of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment gives the commission a proactive role in doing precisely what Senator Hayes and I were concerned about earlier, which is seeing to it that the international public relations work we do by signing conventions is carried beyond that and put into practice in the State. We are suggesting that one of the functions of the commission should be to encourage ratification by the State of human rights instruments.

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment dealing with the role of the commission in encouraging ratifications for the reasons the Minister outlined on Committee Stage. It will be open to the commission as part of its function under paragraph (<i>c</i>) to recommend to the Government that it should accede to or ratify particular human rights instruments. The provision in question is deliberately widely drawn so as to encompass precisely this type of role for the commission. It may take the initiative in the matter and this is particularly relevant in the context of the type of activity which is contemplated by the amendment.</P>
      <P>It must also be borne in mind that the commission would take action in this area is because it sees a need for the Government to act to strengthen, protect and uphold human rights in the State. The question of implementation of the instruments in question is already taken care of by the existing provision in the Bill. It is hardly possible that the commission, having raised the matter, will sit back and let it rest.</P>

It is my understanding that some Ministers will agree to an amendment for clarification reasons. In my experience, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform inevitably takes the view that unless there is an overwhelming reason it will leave an amendment out. It is easier for the Government not to have an explicit statement in legislation.</P>
      <P>I wish to clarify why the commission may be constrained. When the chief executive comes before the Committee of Public Accounts, the section of the Bill which deals with that states that &ldquo;he or she shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.&rdquo;  That is the level of constraint imposed on the chief executive when he comes before the Committee of Public Accounts. It is difficult to reconcile that determination to keep people quiet with the argument that what we are seeking to have made explicit is implicit.</P>

      <P>This is a straightforward and simple amendment which does not vary from the general principle of what the Government is promoting and elaborates on subsection (<i>c</i>). We have close ties with the United Nations, the organisations of the EU and national voluntary organisations. It is not a major conspiracy to get involved with them &ndash; it is something we do anyway so why not include it in the legislation? There is no conflict of interest between what the <Col N="622" /> Government proposes and what Senator Ryan proposes. I suggest the Minister of State should also accept amendment No. 5 which ties in with this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) to contribute to the reports which the State is required to submit to United Nations bodies and committees, and to regional institutions, pursuant to its treaty obligations,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to give the commission a further function, as of right, to contribute to the reports the State is required to submit to the United Nations bodies and committees and to regional institutions, pursuant to its treaty obligations. It would be strange if an Irish Government reporting on human rights in Ireland to any international organisation could write a report without a contribution from the statutorily established Human Rights Commission, which is the current position.</P>
      <P>We propose that, as of right, any such report an Irish government submits to such international bodies should contain a contribution and commentary from the Irish Human Rights Commission. If it cannot do that, what is its role?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the role of the commission intended by this amendment is adequately catered for by the provision of the Bill at paragraph (<i>c</i>). That is the primary intention behind that subsection. I envisage the commission will have a large input into the reports the State is obliged to submit to various international committees operating in the area of human rights, particularly the UN committees which examine our reports on the UN covenants on civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (<i>c</i>) states that the commission may &ldquo;either of its own volition or on being requested to do so by the Government, make such recommendations to the Government as it deems appropriate in relation to the measures which the Commission considers should be taken to strengthen, protect and uphold human rights in the State,&rdquo;. I can do that without any law. I can make, of my own volition, such recommendations to the Government that I deem appropriate in relation to the measures which I consider should be taken to strengthen, protect and uphold human rights. It is my freedom to do so as a citizen but it does not give me the least reason to believe that anything I say will be paid heed or incorporated in any publication subsequently made available by the Government.</P>
      <P>The same applies to the commission. The idea that it is a major concession to allow it to make submissions to the Government on human rights issues of its own volition emphasises the point we have been making throughout this debate &ndash; that this is a pretty mean-minded and minimalist piece of legislation when it should be generous and open. It is anything but that. It keeps the commission on the margins and ensures it is not an active, vigorous body with an independent profile within and without the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true that the amendment is covered by paragraph (<i>c</i>) because the amendment gives the <Col N="624" /> commission a right to be clearly identified as involved in reports. Therefore, instead of Governments skating over difficult areas of human rights, they would either have to deal with them or confront the fact that the human rights commission takes a different view from the Government, which will often be the case because there is a perpetual tension between the rights of the individual and the power of Government. We want this institutionalised, which would be the case if the commission was taken seriously and was not just a reluctant response to a commitment entered into under pressure from other people during the negotiations on the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, paragraph (<i>c</i>), line 3, after &ldquo;fit&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including to co-operate with the United Nations and any other organisation in the United Nations system, the regional institutions and the national institutions of other countries that are competent in the areas of the promotion and protection of human rights,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> We should be at the forefront in dealing with international bodies. We have a good record in terms of the stability of our democracy. Sometimes people like myself, with minority interests in politics, can find it a boring stability but it is remarkable and one which has not been based on any excess of order imposed by those at the top &ndash; it is a free society. Like Senator Hayes, and unlike many on the liberal left, I am not a critic of the 1937 Constitution. Some of the language used is quaint but it is an extraordinarily vigorous document in defending individual rights, much to the chagrin of a variety of Governments of different political complexions, including those of which my party was a member when it made the momentous and correct McKenna decision about referenda some years ago.</P>
    <P>Many people in politics, including those who comment and give advice on political matters, have a wish to row back some of the extraordinary protections that the Supreme Court and other courts have interpreted from our Constitution. As it would be unconstitutional, it would be impossible to implement any part of the British Protection of Terrorism Act because one would not get away with keeping a person incommunicado. That said, the amendment simply makes explicit &ndash; but I am sure the Minister will tell me it is implicit &ndash; the right of the commission to co-operate with the United Nations and any other organisation in the UN system, including regional and national institutions that are competent in the areas of promotion and protection of human rights.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said earlier, this Bill, like others, has come through the Attorney General's office and, therefore, the language has been carefully chosen. It uses the word &ldquo;consult&rdquo;, not the words &ldquo;co-operate&rdquo; or &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo;&ndash; it means consult. I am not sure if the commission can be consulted but it states that it can consult with bodies. In other words, the commission can ask for their opinions. I am not sure whether other international bodies can legitimately be consulted. We debated this issue earlier. This amendment attempts to make explicit the right of the commission to be involved with international bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not the most patient of people. I want someone in the parliamentary draftsman's office, the Attorney General's office or a Minister to explain to me how the phrase &ldquo;to consult with&rdquo; can mean the same as &ldquo;to co-operate with.&rdquo;  I defy the Minister of State, the Government or the two bodies I have mentioned to find a dictionary which says that co-operate is a synonym for consult. It is not the same thing. It is a trite, inadequate and offensive answer to suggest that consult means co-operate. It does not. I know full well that if the Government intended this commission to actively co-operate with all these bod<Col N="626" /> ies it would have inserted the phrase &ldquo;consult and co-operate with&rdquo;. In fact, the Government is so cautious that it stipulated in section 8(<i>d</i>) that the body could &ldquo;make . . .  recommendations to the Government&rdquo;. In doing so the Government accepts that the commission could not make recommendations to the Government without that provision.</P>
      <P>If we must have an explicit provision about something as natural as making a recommendation to the Government, how can the word &ldquo;consult&rdquo; be interpreted and distorted to include the word &ldquo;co-operate&rdquo;? This type of nonsense has emanated from various Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for many years. I wish they would start using the sort of English that the rest of us normally use in our ordinary lives.  </P>

      <P>Consultations can be ongoing and go on forever. People can consult all they like but there may never be an end result.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;operate&rdquo; comes from the Latin word<i> opera</i> which means work. Co-operate means we must co-operate in work. For example, the United Nations could consult and decide it needs a report from Ireland on how it is complying with a variety of protocols and issues that it has signed up to. The commission would then be obliged to co-operate and give the information required. In relation to consultation, the commission is not obligated in any way to give the UN what they require. There is a fundamental difference between the two.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the reluctance to accept this amendment, particularly given our record. Ireland has agreed to a number of charters and conventions at international level but it has not ratified them at national level. Are we afraid that if we co-operate we will be shown in a bad light at international level? The Department seems to be afraid of this and that is why there is a reluctance to accept this simple addendum to this subsection. It makes a lot of common sense. If we have nothing to be afraid of then we should not be afraid to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>This is extremely unsatisfactory. The Minister of State says no and neither he nor anyone else will talk about it any more. This is <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> stuff. If he says consult means co-operate then we must all agree. That is not true. I am not saying he is being deliberately dishonest. I am saying it is not true to say that consult includes co-operate. We are in a position where a House of the Oireachtas is endeavouring to find out what legislation means, but the Government says it means what we think it means and we will not tell you any more about it. This is unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 7, paragraph (<i>e</i>), line 14, after &ldquo;activities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including to assist in the formulation of programmes for the teaching of, and research into, human rights and to take part in their execution in schools, universities and professional bodies,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Who would think that this amendment, which explicitly refers to the possibility of a commission on human rights, would be unacceptable to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? The Department of Foreign Affairs does a remarkably good job at educating people about human rights abroad. It spends a considerable amount of resources on development, education and issues of human rights. It is good stuff which has been well researched and presented. It has had a considerable effect on the Irish public's perceptions of many things. It would be wonderful for an Irish commission on human rights to do the same thing.</P>
      <P>Section 8(<i>e</i>) which reads &ldquo;to promote understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights in the State . . . . .. to undertake, sponsor or commission, or provide financial . . . .  for, research and educational activities,&rdquo; is vague and inadequate.

      <P>This amendment was discussed on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil. I remain firm in my view that it is not needed. The provision in section 8(<i>e</i>) enables the commission to promote understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights in the State. That is the primary objective of the provision. For that purpose the commission can then undertake research and educational activities, sponsor or commission such activities or provide financial or other assistance for such activities. The role of assisting in the formulation of programmes for the teaching of and research into human rights and taking part in such activities in educational professional bodies is covered by section 8(<i>e</i>), particularly by the reference to undertaking research and educational activities throughout the State.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 7, paragraph (<i>h</i>), line 27, to delete &ldquo;in its absolute discretion&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the right of the commission to apply to the High Court to appear as <i>amicus curiae</i> which my limited legal understanding and somewhat less limited Latin knowledge suggests is a friend of care. In other words, it refers to someone who will play a supportive role where a human rights issue is involved. Section <Col N="628" /> 8(<i>h</i>) says that the commission may play such a role &ldquo;.. in proceedings before the court that involved or are concerned with the human rights of any person and to appear as such . . .  on foot of such liberty being granted . . . . &rdquo;, in other words, if the court allows him to do so. The subsection continues &ldquo;.. (which liberty each of the said courts is hereby empowered to grant in its absolute discretion),&rdquo;. I suspect that the words in brackets are probably unconstitutional because it is a gross interference with the rights of the courts. The courts have considerable rights to do what they wish. It is a gross presumption on the part of the Legislature to say that they could not do it if we did not let them.</P>
    <P>These words remind me of some of the strange phraseology used in the Freedom of Information Act which warns the Judiciary that if they have access to confidential material for the purposes of a legal challenge they must not leak it to anyone. Some judge will read this and will react to the cheek of the Legislature to warn the Judiciary about how it should behave. This provision is like that. Adding the words &ldquo;to grant in its absolute discretion&rdquo; implies that without this phrase the Judiciary would have something less than absolute discretion. Given the type of argument the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would normally use, the phrase &ldquo;in its absolute discretion&rdquo; is unnecessary. The courts have absolute discretion and the phrase should be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in section 8(<i>h</i>) which gives the Human Rights Commission the power to take on the role of <i>amicus curiae,</i> or friend of the court, is a novel one which has been widely welcomed as an innovative and helpful measure.</P>
      <P>The intention behind the phrase which the amendment seeks to delete is to underscore the fact that an application by the commission in a suitable case does not carry with it an automatic assumption that the court in some way is bound to accede to the request. A decision to allow the commission to appear in the role of <i>amicus curiae</i> must always rest with the court itself, taking into account all the circumstances of the particular case. To do otherwise could be seen as unjustified interference in the independence of the courts. It could well be, for example, that a party on one side or other of the argument might object strenuously to a third party involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, this provision is a new one with which I do not wish to anticipate any teething troubles. However, there is always a question over what form the proposed intervention by the commission will take. It is easy to think of a case where a lawyer retained by the commission will seek to make an oral submission to the court. Where a judge, at the stage of giving leave to apply for judicial review or on a review of a case before the substantive hearing of the issue, receives such an application from a body such as <Col N="629" /> the commission for leave to intervene and to be heard, he or she may consider that the most appropriate course at that stage is to restrict any leave which may be granted to furnish a written submission instead. It may be that at a later stage in the case a judge will be able to read this and determine whether an oral presentation or argument from the commission would be of sufficient assistance to justify adding an extra party to the litigation in process.</P>
    <P>The court must have absolute discretion in these matters. The present wording makes that clear and I am not prepared to alter it in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share Senator Ryan's concerns in this matter. I do not think there is a difficulty on any occasion of reinforcing what we accept as normal court practice. Once a matter is presented for adjudication before the courts, there must be absolute discretion and independence of the courts. To reinforce this in legislation does not infer anything other than what it actually states. This is acceptable and Senator Ryan should have no undue concern about the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">

      <P>Paragraph 8(<i>d</i>) seeks to make recommendations to Government either on its own volition or on being requested on measures to strengthen, protect and uphold human rights in the State. This is a most important provision in the UN guidelines which develops the thinking behind the Paris Principle which states that whether a national institution can advise or assist Government on its own initiative will generally be a matter for enabling legislation. An institution may be empowered to advise at the request of the Government, or it may be granted a wider authority to submit unsolicited recommendation. Rarely, however, the UN points out, will a Government be legally compelled to refer legislative or other matters to a national institution. The Government has given the human rights <Col N="630" /> commission a very wide role in this area by giving it the power to make unsolicited recommendations to the Government on its own initiative or on the basis of a request by the Government.</P>
      <P>It is the intention that this provision will be used to the fullest possible extent. In the case of draft legislation, for example, the commission will have the power to examine any Bill for human rights implications. The Government for its part will be able to consult the commission in the policy formulation phase or the draft heads phrase in the preparation of draft legislation.</P>

Section 2 reads, &ldquo;In this Act <Col N="631" /> (other than <i>section 11</i>) &ldquo;human rights&rdquo;  means (<i>a</i>) the rights, liberties and freedoms conferred on, or guaranteed to, persons by the Constitution, and (<i>b</i>) the rights, liberties or freedoms conferred on, or guaranteed to, persons by any agreement, treaty or convention to which the State is a party&rdquo;. Section 11 reads, &ldquo;The Commission may institute proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of obtaining relief of a declaratory or other nature in respect of any matter concerning the human rights of any person or class of persons&rdquo;. This is fine. However, in this section where the commission may institute proceedings, human rights is redefined in a much narrower form. It means the rights, liberties and freedoms conferred on, or guaranteed to, persons by the Constitution and the rights, liberties or freedoms conferred on, or guaranteed to, persons by any agreement, treaty or convention to which the State is a party and which has been given the force of law in the State or by a provision of any such agreement, treaty or convention which has been given such force. Therefore, all the noble rhetoric to which we subscribed in so many international conventions is that these rights are fine, we think they are great, they make us sound lovely in the eyes of the world, but if an Irish citizen wishes to claim any of those rights the commission cannot take action to protect them.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to delete the reference &ldquo;and which has been given the force of law in the State or by a provision of any such agreement, treaty or convention which has been given such force&rdquo;. That is to narrow the definition of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; where the commission could be active in vindicating human rights below the level at which the Bill in general defines them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>A more restrictive definition of human rights is necessary for the purposes of the Bill connected with the taking of legal proceedings by the Human Rights Commission as the courts can only deal with matters that are law for and in the State. There is no point in basing cases on human rights instruments which are not law in the State. While many such instruments have been signed and ratified by the State, it does not follow that the provisions of such instruments are cognisable or justiciable on their own in the State. They may be law for us on the international plane but on their own they cannot be pleaded before our courts. Article 15.2 of the Constitution provides that the sole power of making laws for the State is vested in the Oireachtas exclusively and Article 29.6 provides that no international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State save as may be determined by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Convention on Human Rights is a case in point, though the position in that regard will change in the not too distant future as action has to be taken to incorporate the convention into Irish law in the light of the obligation in the Good Friday Agreement to further develop <Col N="632" /> and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights in this State.</P>
    <P>To accept this amendment would be to make a nonsense of the commission's legislative powers. It simply cannot take cases based on rights which are not cognisable or justiciable under Irish law.</P>

      <P>Is the implication in the first part of the section that the commission can only assist action in domestic courts? The incorporation of the European Convention into domestic law will greatly reduce the necessity for people to take cases to the European Court of Human Rights. Does this section provide powers for claimants to pursue their rights through the European Court of Human Rights if the commission feels they should do so?</P>

      <P>Not to accept this amendment makes a total nonsense of our signing up to various conventions and charters at different levels, many of which have not been incorporated into our national legislation. This Bill further excludes them and compounds the offence in that we can only adjudicate on specific matters. There is duplicity and hypocrisy in the Irish Government signing up to various conventions and charters at European and international level and actively legislating to exclude them. That is what this section will do. I question the Government's sincerity in this area.</P>
      <P>The Bill states that the commission may institute proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction. Is the commission to be restricted to bringing cases to court within the jurisdiction of the Republic of Ireland? Will it be in a position to pursue violations in Belfast or Northern Ireland? Will it be entitled to pursue cases in the European Court of Justice? There is an element of hypocrisy in all this. Is this Bill being introduced so that the Taoiseach can put on a good face when he attends the Heads of State meeting in December to sign the revamped European Charter on Human Rights which is to be incorporated into Irish law?</P>

One could understand the inclusion of a provision in this section that a matter that is <i>sub judice,</i> confidential or a matter of policy for the commission in terms of human rights issues cannot be discussed. This is not the first time this type of provision has appeared in legislation.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) states: &ldquo;In the performance of his or her duties under this section. . . . . [in other words, when he or she is appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts] . . . . .the chief executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an independent, powerful commission. I do not think this provision was meant to be incorporated into this legislation. It was merely included because such provisions are standard. In spite of its minimalist nature, it is clearly intended that the commission can criticise Government. One section states it can make recommendations to Government as it deems appropriate and another states it can take cases to the European Court of Human Rights or to the domestic courts. What is the sense in it being able to do all these things if the chief executive is to be silenced when he appears before the Committee of Public Accounts? Why should he not speak at that committee about things he can speak about everywhere else? Has everybody but Members of the Oireachtas got rights? Members are forever being told they must stick to the limited agenda of Dáil committees. That is quite extraordinary.</P>

      <P>It may be normal procedure in departmental matters but the individual concerned is not a civil servant giving an account of specific matters within a Department to which the Minister has an opportunity of replying in the Dáil during the course of questions.</P>
      <P>The Bill establishes an independent commission which will be free to do many good things regarding the protection and maintenance of human rights. We are now faced with the scenario that the chief executive will not be allowed to discuss such matters before a committee which is supposed to be transparent, open and accountable. Such person will not be permitted to answer questions put to him by the Oireachtas. Are we denying Members the right to question the commissioner and commission staff on the Government's record on human rights? This is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>This section could not apply sensibly to an independent commission. I can understand that it could apply to a civil servant who transfers to it from a Department, given the strictures and restrictions that would apply in such a case. While the Minister can be questioned thoroughly in the other House on policy matters, this is an independent commission, not a Department. The section should provide more freedom and flexibility in this area. It inhibits freedom, accountability, openness and transparency.</P>

There is nothing in this section that ensures the commission would be muzzled. It could state what it would wish to state and one would presume it would do so. If it needs a mouthpiece, it will have a chairman who should be answerable to the Dáil and the various committees of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>This section is narrowly drawn. It deals with the stewardship of the chief executive's responsibilities to run the organisation, to ensure those responsibilities are carried out, that its accounts are in order and so on. We are making a meal of this section. There is nothing in it that would prevent the commission from stating what it would want to state. The chief executive is responsible to the commission. It would be strange if he or she were to use, as a defence for not doing his or her own job, the fact that he or she did not like the law, the policy or some other matter. It is right that he or she should be asked to account for his or her responsibilities, but he or she should not speak on policy matters as they should be ventilated by the commission and by its chairman.</P>

      <P>I was at one with Senator Hayes up to now. Section 15 deals with the accountability of the chief executive to other Oireachtas committees. I am a member of the Committee on <Col N="635" /> European Affairs which is involved in drafting the European charter on fundamental rights and freedoms. Members of that committee would be interested in the views of a body such as the Irish Commission on Human Rights. The legislation provides that the chief executive of the commission, not its chairman, can come before the Committee on European Affairs and speak about whether the Government was right or wrong in the way it dealt with certain matters.</P>

If the chief executive of the commission was asked questions by the chairman of that committee, he would have to say that while he would like to answer them, he is not be permitted to do so under law. He could tell the chairman of that committee, Deputy Jim Mitchell, that if his brother, Deputy Gay Mitchell, who is a member of the Committee on European Affairs, asked him to answer such questions at a meeting of that committee he would be able to do so.</P>

      <P>As is usual, the section provides that various matters must be dealt with quickly. It states that accounts must be kept and shall be submitted not later than three months after the end of the accounting period to which they relate by the commission to the Comptroller and Auditor General and, immediately after the audit, a copy of the income and expenditure account, the balance sheet and of such other accounts kept and a copy of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the accounts shall be presented to the Minister who shall cause copies thereof to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. However, it is open to the Minister to do that whenever he or she gets around to doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn, my colleague on the Independent benches, has made it a matter of principle that there is no excuse for applying a time limit <Col N="636" /> to others in dealing with a matter but allowing the Minister concerned to dawdle by laying copies of a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas whenever he or she gets around to it. A timescale similar to what which applies to submission of accounts in this case, whether it be two months or three months, ought to apply to the period within which a Minister, having received a report such as this, will lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The making public of reports such as those on the conditions in our psychiatric hospitals and reports of prison visitation committees has been delayed not only for months but for years because what was in them was inconvenient for the Government to deal with or its members were too busy or too indifferent to do so. A time limit ought to apply within which reports, having been received by Ministers, should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

With regard to legislation emanating from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it has been my experience as a Member of this House that if legislation originates in this House, virtually no amendments will be accepted to it here and it will be amended extensively in the Dáil, whereas if legislation originates in the Dáil, it will be amended extensively there and no amendments to it by Members of this House will be accepted here.

      <P>I thank those Senators who contributed to the debate on this Bill. It will create a human rights commission with the means and powers to protect human rights in this State. Ireland has an enviable record in the protection and vindication of human rights. The Constitution with its bill of rights, together with the case law developed by our courts, has proven to be a living and evolving guardian of our fundamental rights. The protection of those rights is further guaranteed by the functions conferred by this legislation on the human rights commission, the full realisation that human rights is achieved through adequate legislation, appropriate administration arrangements and informed community awareness of those rights. I am confident that the Bill, as passed, fully <Col N="638" /> embraces these requirements and tasks the commission with a wide and challenging job.</P>
      <P>I wish also to acknowledge the contributions of the many non-governmental organisations which have given comments and observations during the drafting process. It may be seen from a comparison with the draft heads of the Bill that the Bill as passed reflects the import of those observations in many key areas and is a better Bill, as a result.</P>
      <P>The commission to be established by the Bill, as the Taoiseach said in his statement in December 1998, will be a model for others as this legislation leads rather than follows standards of best international practice for such human rights institutions as are laid down in the 1993 Paris Principles.</P>
      <P>In an all-Ireland context the commission will play a crucial role, through the work of the joint committee to be established with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, in drawing up a charter open to signature by all democratic political parties reflecting and endorsing agreed measures of protection of the fundamental rights of everyone living in the island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It remains for me, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to wish the commission every success as it undertakes this new and important protection of human rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Fahey, to the House and I warmly welcome the opportunity to move this important and much needed Bill. As Members are aware my former colleague, Pat Gallagher, drafted and moved a similar Bill this time last year. He put forward a <Col N="639" /> comprehensive, cogent and well-founded Bill which would have radically changed the way lobbyists operate. To its eternal shame the Government decided to vote down the Bill on that occasion. Given what we have learned in the intervening 12 months about the role played by certain lobbyists in the corruption of the political system, I genuinely believed the Government parties in the House would have put to one side their petty political jealousies and taken a principled decision to support the Bill.</P>
      <P>The proliferation of paid lobbyists prowling the corridors of power makes regulation of their activities inevitable. The public has the right to know who has lobbied, is lobbying and will lobby politicians, and for whom and why lobbying takes place. The shocking disclosures by Frank Dunlop, lobbyist extraordinaire, to the Flood tribunal in recent weeks revealed the web of intrigue, bribery and corruption spun by one professional paid lobbyist to secure the interests of his clients, namely, big business and big developers.</P>
      <P>If the legislation had been accepted by the Government when first introduced in the Seanad a year ago it would have prevented some wrongdoing in the intervening 12 months. Had it been in place 15 years ago it would probably have made the Flood tribunal unnecessary. The lobbyist, his clients and their activities would have been a matter of public record. The web would not have been spun and politicians and public servants could not have been ensnared.</P>
      <P>The Government voted against a similar Bill introduced by the Labour Party 12 months ago. While agreeing with the principles in the Bill the Government said more research was necessary. The amendment tabled by the Government today makes precisely the same point, namely, that the Labour Party has tabled a good Bill but that the Government does not want to accept it yet. Nothing has been done by the Government in the past 12 months to show it has the slightest intention of regulating lobbyists. The cancer is now clearly evident and the Government should not be found wanting a second time. It can support democracy by supporting the Bill. It would be a belated but welcome conversion which would uphold the standing of the House and demonstrate the seriousness with which we treat the current public mood of revulsion caused by the near daily revelations of alleged corruption and malpractice in so many areas of public life.</P>
      <P>However, the amendment in the name of Senator Cassidy has dashed those hopes. It will be most strongly resisted by the Labour Party and other Senators who have correctly recognised the unprecedented growth of the lobbyist industry over the past number of years and the urgent need to put in place a fair regulatory system. The amendment tabled once again proposes prevarication instead of action and lethargy instead of parliamentary innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> The amendment refuses to address the core issues covered by the Registration of Lobbyists Bill. It puts all progress on this front on the méar fada. Unfortunately for the Government, the long finger approach was the stance it adopted in June 1999. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, declared in the House at that time that &ldquo;there are a number of initiatives in hand which are relevant to ensuring the highest standards of ethical behaviour and conduct and guarding against wrongdoing in public life. I expect the standards Bill will be published later this year.&rdquo;  He went on to say &ldquo;This Bill will provide an opportunity to consider bringing lobbyists within the scope of the new commission&rdquo;. Not a single thing has happened since then. Lobbyists still operate without public transparency or a regulatory framework. A standards in public office Bill has not appeared despite being promised on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>How on earth does the Government expect us to accept an amendment which again postpones action on this vital issue, given its disgraceful track record of indolence and inaction over the past 12 months? The shocking evidence of Frank Dunlop to the Flood tribunal has demonstrated beyond a shadow of doubt that lobbyists need to operate within a regulatory framework in order that decision-makers and citizens can be aware of their clients and the vested interests they represent. It beggars belief that in the wake of such evidence the Government is still resisting this important Bill.</P>
    <P>The action of the Government is not only damaging public confidence in the political system but is damaging the lobbyists' profession. Members of the profession support the introduction of a fair regulatory framework, such as that proposed in the legislation. They are annoyed and disgusted at the bad name of their profession which the Dunlop revelations have engendered. The Government alone is intent on adopting an ostrich-like position on this crucial issue. That demonstrates how after three years of the comforts of power the Government is rapidly losing touch with the electorate. It believes that it has a monopoly of wisdom and if the collective wisdom of the Government is not to do anything, then nothing will be done.</P>
    <P>Lobbying has become established as a permanent feature of our system of parliamentary democracy and decision making and in future years the practice of lobbying is likely to become more sophisticated and intense. There is no reason this Bill cannot be accepted by the House at the second time of asking. Detailed examination of the legislation can be undertaken on Committee Stage. It is designed to disclose the activities of lobbyists and their clients in the public interest, and is not aimed at preventing or stopping them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> If powerful groups in society are using public affairs consultants to change laws or influence public policy then the public has a right to know about such activities and who is behind them. It is a simple democratic principle, which the Government seems intent on rejecting again. There are no formal rules relating to the activities of lobbyists, yet there are laws on our Statute Book, such as the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, with which public representatives and public servants must comply. Under the new planning legislation similar standards will apply to elected local authority representatives.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if public and private companies are required by law to declare the names of their auditors and legal advisers in documents submitted to the Companies Office and in annual reports, legislation should be introduced which requires lobbyists to make similar declarations about those for whom they work. The Bill will go some way towards correcting the perceived notion or suspicion that lobbyists are able to gain unfair advantage for their clients. This impression has been further reinforced by Frank Dunlop's evidence at the Flood tribunal. The legislation would require individuals who, for payment or reward, lobby politicians or senior public servants to register their activities with the Public Offices Commission and this documentation would be open to the public for inspection. Nothing more drastic or radical than that is proposed. The legislation covers representative and non-governmental organisations which employ in-house lobbyists to influence office holders, in addition to covering those whose business it is to act as professional lobbyists, such as public affairs consultants.</P>
    <P>I will not delay in regard to the detail of the Bill. This is the second time in 12 months that the House has discussed this issue and nothing has changed in the intervening period. The Government has not done anything despite its stated commitment in this House. Given the Government's failure, surely it is time that this House behaved like a proper legislative body and sent a strong message to the Executive that if it fails in its duty to govern and to live up to the commitment it gave to this House last year, then as an elected assembly we should proceed with this much needed legislation. If we fail to do so, it will be a sad day for the standing of this House.</P>
    <P>The public is deeply shocked by the revelations of the past three years and, in particular, by the evidence emanating from the Flood and Moriarty tribunals. It is not good that the Progressive Democrats Party and Fianna Fáil spout fine words about standards in public life and the need to address issues. We have heard such words before and know how shallow and easily forgotten they are. It is time to take action and put on the Statute Book a rational and fair system for the registration of lobbyists. That is the question before the House. I ask Fianna Fáil and the Pro<Col N="642" /> gressive Democrats Party members not to turn their backs on this measure for the second time in 12 months. Enough is enough. We must accept the Bill and debate it on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé íona orm a laghad agus a thug an páirtí is mó sa Rialtas faoi ndeara an rud a bhí soiléir don chuid eile againn le beagnach fiche bliana anuas. Cuireann sé íona orm go raibh siad ábalta a bheith ag féachaint ar rudaí, ag éisteacht le daoine agus ag éisteacht leis an gclampar a bhí ar siúl faoi chaighdeán a bhí á chleachtadh ag daoine faoi leith ach nár thugadar faoi ndeara riamh go raibh sé ar siúl and as if by miracle in the past few weeks there has been an overwhelming movement by Fianna Fáil, in particular, to carry all of us on to a new plane of righteousness. Let us deal with reality. There is nothing new in this legislation. Fianna Fáil has had almost a year to talk about and reflect on it and to bring forward its own proposals. It did nothing until something outside these Houses, from which it could not escape, galvanised it.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil's conversion seems at best skin deep to many people because any party that experiences a revolution or conversion of a fundamental nature would not attempt to promote somebody whose impeachment it was prepared to seek a year ago. It now proposes to reward with a £140,000 per year post a person who resigned in order to prevent Fianna Fáil from going through the political discomfort of an impeachment and it ignores the hurt and the pain of that.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has not learned the standards that the rest of us believe politics should be about. There are many decent people in Fianna Fáil but they have allowed their loyalty to what used to be a wonderful national organisation&mdash;</P>

    <P>Mr. O'Flaherty was not appointed by accident. It was widely reported without contradiction that there was active lobbying on his behalf by Fianna Fáil barristers and again, irrespective of the public's view, Fianna Fáil responded. Apart from standards, Fianna Fáil also had a difficulty recognising what the rest of us could. It had a leader for almost 13 years whose lifestyle all of us recognised was irreconcilable with his parliamentary income and who we now know was granted the munificence of £8.5 million over that period, yet Fianna Fáil did not notice. Nobody wondered while the rest of us stood back in awe and asked how was he getting away with it. Fianna Fáil members stood back and then lined up one after another and said they never wondered how he maintained that lifestyle. The rest of us were struggling after three elections in <Col N="643" /> the 1980s to cover our costs but the leader of Fianna Fáil was involved in a grandiose experiment in the highest quality of life which involved purchasing shirts from Paris, islands off the west Kerry coast and mansions in north County Dublin, yet nobody in Fianna Fáil asked where he got all the money from.</P>

      <P>Suddenly they converted to a long-winded essay in righteousness, which is what the amendment is and we will come to it in a minute. In the same period, we had the appalling record of many of their councillors in County Dublin who could not see what the rest of us saw &ndash; that something was very suspect. They could not see it, but the rest of us could smell it. They were so self-righteous that when a party colleague of mine dared to suggest as much, she was inundated with threats of libel action by outraged members and former members. They are not suing her now, however. The comments were repeated less than two weeks ago in <i>The Irish Times</i> but nobody is suing. They did not notice then, either.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann,</P>
      <P>&mdash;conscious of the need as a matter of urgency to restore public confidence in the political system by the enactment of legislation to modernise and strengthen the criminal law relating to corruption, and noting the publication of the Government's Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2000, and further proposals for legislation to restate and amend the law in relation to corruption in public office published by Fine Gael and the Labour Party,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;noting the commitment of the Government to publish a Standards in Public Office Bill which will contain comprehensive proposals to reform and amend the law relating to standards in public office in accordance with the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and the Houses' Committees on Members <Col N="645" /> Interests and noting that the Bill will provide for the necessity for tax clearance certificates for persons elected to the Oireachtas,</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting the proposals published for the regulation of lobbyists,</P>
    <P>&mdash;conscious of the duty of the Oireachtas, when making laws relating to the funding of political parties to respect and vindicate:</P>
    <P>&bull;the constitutional rights of citizens to freely seek election, establish political parties, organise for political and democratic purposes within or without parties on terms of equality before the law, and free from arbitrary or invidious discrimination in relation to the provision of publicly funded support,</P>
    <P>&bull;the constitutional rights of independent candidates and candidates for new parties to organise politically between elections without being subject to invidious discrimination in favour of established political parties,</P>
    <P>&bull;the constitutional rights of citizens to freely form associations and to communicate to other citizens their political opinions and beliefs, and</P>
    <P>&bull;the constitutional rights of non-party organisations to freely campaign and participate in the democratic process by making their views on political issues generally known,</P>
    <P>&mdash;conscious that the regulation of political parties and of the funding of political activities must respect democratic constitutional values as found in the Constitution and enunciated by the courts,</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting the Government's commitment to reaching, so far as possible, a general consensus among the parties and individual members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting the commitment of the Government to the immediate establishment of an All-Party Committee to consider:</P>
    <P>&bull;in the first instance, the nine legislative proposals already announced relating to the funding of political activity, both between and during elections [a Standards in Public Office Bill, the Registration of Lobbyists (No. 2) Bill, 1999, the Registration of Lobbyists Bill, 2000, the Electoral (Amendment) (Donations to Parties and Candidates) Bill, 2000, the Public Representatives (Provision of Tax Clearance Certificates) Bill, 2000, three Prevention of Corruption Bills and the Local Government Bill, 2000],</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" />&bull;further measures to prevent corruption in public office,</P>
    <P>&bull;the need for statutory regulation of lobbying activities,</P>
    <P>&bull;the protection of &ldquo;whistleblowers&rdquo; and</P>
    <P>&bull;related matters,</P>
    <P>&mdash;noting the proposal to appoint an Expert Group in consultation with the Party Leaders to assist and advise that committee. The terms of reference will require it to report back to the Party Leaders not later than 30 September, 2000, so that all necessary legislative changes can be introduced and considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas not later than 31 December, 2000,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>&mdash;with a view to facilitating a fully considered constitutionally valid and comprehensive legislative response to public concerns about corruption in the political process and public administration,</P>
    <P>postpones the second reading of Registration of Lobbyists Bill, 2000, until 1 December 2000&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a comprehensive response to the motion. I take great solace from the recent indication by the Taoiseach that he has made contact with Deputy John Bruton, the Leader of Fine Gael, and Deputy Quinn, the Leader of the Labour Party, in an effort to further the creation of a better political atmosphere concerning donations and lobbyists.</P>
    <P>At its recent Ard-Fheis, Fianna Fáil established an internal committee to ensure the highest possible standards for party candidates in future local and national elections. The party will impose severe rules and restrictions on proposed candidates for election. This is a major development by the main Government party. To suggest for a minute that our party has not taken any action in this regard is rather unfair. We must not forget that the Flood and Moriarty tribunals, which have unearthed many unusual activities, particularly in the Dublin area, are still sitting. The jury is still out as regards the investigations being carried out by both tribunals. Even if it takes another 12 or 15 months for them to report their findings to the Oireachtas, we must await the outcome before casting aspersions or condemning without trial based on what we may have read in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>It is also notable that the only person of major concern who has pronounced himself as a lobbyist is Frank Dunlop, and we must proceed carefully in this regard. Do we follow America, which has a registration system for lobbyists, or do we closely examine the outcome of the tribunal before moving in that direction? I have an open mind on this issue. The whole political system has <Col N="647" /> been rocked, and the Government fully recognises that. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and other senior Ministers recognise the absolute need for trust in respect of people who hold positions in the three branches of Government, namely, the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to comment on the matters raised by my colleague, Senator Costello, concerning Hugh O'Flaherty. Some of the Members on the Independent benches put the matter in a nutshell. Going back to the Sheedy affair, they felt that this well established, renowned and highly respected legal intellectual was hard done by in a situation where he was compelled to resign. Be that as it may, he committed no crime or major wrongdoing, yet as a result of a compassionate interview while he was out for a walk he and his family have suffered considerably. It would be unfair, in the context of the Bill proposed by the Labour Party, to drag this unfortunate individual into the political domain. I spoke about this matter on the Order of Business this morning and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further other than to say that the appointment is made and he is a very capable individual &ndash; there is probably none better. Is he to be penalised for a simple misjudgment or human error of a rather trivial nature? That was the whole basis of the problem.</P>

That is a welcome development. I welcome the debate and the amendment is a wise and prudent way to proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>At about 5.40 this evening I was watching the news on television and a list of names and amounts of money was broadcast on the screen. I thought the list was never ending &ndash; perhaps it was not that long &ndash; but it included the names of all the people whom the Moriarty tribunal has identified as giving money to one Charles J. Haughey, and the sum came to something like £8.5 million. I wondered if all the other people watching that programme felt the way I felt, that it was an utter disgrace and that the current phase we are going through in our history is creating a major question of credibility and confidence in the whole political system. I am not lecturing anybody. I am simply saying what I saw on television this evening.</P>
      <P>The power that we have, as elected representatives, comes from the people we serve. It is a power to look after the interests of the people. It is a trust between the public and the elected representatives and this Bill is about enforcing that trust in a legal way. It is about ensuring that what we have seen in the past will cease and hopefully will never happen again, but legislation in itself will not solve the problem because human nature is human nature and regardless of the legislation we pass, what is in the heart and mind of somebody when they are lobbied or when they make a decision is something only they know. Sadly, as a result of the information coming to us from the tribunals our country has been shown to be very corrupt.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that sin is not all on one side. There are question marks over politicians of all parties. What we have to establish tonight, with this Bill, is that we collectively, as a group of politicians, are determined and committed to changing the situation as quickly as possible. The Government amendment, while it has a lot of nice sounding phrases, is putting everything back to 1 December 2000 but the people cannot wait that long for this action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Power is held in trust and should be used only for the benefit of the people. Lobbying is done not just by paid lobbyists. Lobbying is done by everybody. It can be done by a farmer stopping someone on the side of the road or a businessman talking about the changes he wants to see in the budget. Lobbying is not and should not be a dirty word because lobbying, in effect, goes to the heart of what Government is about. To use a different phrase, it is listening to the different interest groups. Lobbying is legitimate provided it is transparent and that no attempts are made <Col N="649" /> to corrupt people or to change their view for monetary or other reasons.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Bill goes to the heart of that issue. It is endeavouring initially to ensure that there is transparency in regard to the clients of the paid lobbyists, that we know who they are and that there is no delay in the passing of the Bill. As the Labour Party speakers said, they want the Bill passed immediately. When the next election comes around we will all stand before the people but the people are getting extremely cynical about what they are seeing and it is up to us to put our house in order. This Bill is clearly the first step on that road.</P>
    <P>Shortly after becoming a Member of this House three years ago, I listened to a statement by a former Minister of this Government who is no longer a Member of the Oireachtas, Raphael Burke, in which he said he was drawing a line in the sand. I believed him. I took him at his word. Some line, some sand. I attended the tribunal and listened to Mr. Dunlop giving his evidence. I was appalled by what I heard and no doubt we will be appalled in the future by what we will hear from that gentleman. I watched Mr. Redmond talk about his public life and I am disgusted and shamed by it all because it affects all of us. That people in positions of authority abused those positions for their own personal gain is an absolute betrayal of the fundamental relationship that there must be between the people and the legislators.</P>
    <P>My children ask me what is happening in Leinster House. They want to know the meaning of all the talk about brown envelopes and plastic bags. What are we about? Have we lost our way? We must go back to the foundation of the State, when idealistic men in all parties and in none served the people honourably and to the best of their ability. We must insist, as political parties, that everything is seen to be transparent. There has to be an end to this shameful carry on. It shames all of us when people who are called public representatives are engaging in this behaviour.</P>
    <P>A document which may go to the heart of some of this issue states:</P>
    <P>It is essential if legislators, ministers and public officials are to act ethically to provide them with the support, both technical and emotional, needed to perform their arduous public duties. In addition, they must be provided whether in a full-time or part-time position with adequate salaries to enable them to have a lifestyle appropriate to their position. This is not a lavish lifestyle but one which enables them to provide for their families and which compensates them somewhat for the stresses put on family life.</P>
    <P>At least, the remuneration must be sufficient to ensure that financial worries do not distract them from their public duties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> One of the issues that goes to the heart of our political system is that people in public life are not paid properly or adequately for the work they do. If they were paid properly, they could do their work and have the normal lifestyle &ndash; not a lavish one &ndash; to which they are entitled. This would address the temptation which has been there for many people. I have no problem saying that Deputies should be properly paid &ndash; they are very badly paid. I am not a Deputy so I can say that without claiming to have an interest in the issue.</P>
    <P>Those in private enterprise are well paid for doing a good job, while those in public life are not so well paid. This lack of balance needs to be openly addressed. This House must pass this legislation without delay. We must do it now and I urge those in Fianna Fáil to change their minds and support this necessary legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me begin by reaffirming the Government's position. There is no place in public life for corruption or wrongdoing. That message is clear, simple and unequivocal. Public service, by definition, is about serving the public. It is about serving the citizens of this country to the best of our ability. Whether a politician or an official, the fundamental duty of every public servant is to serve honourably and without fear or favour. Most of all, it is our duty to deliver to the highest standards and accept in ourselves and others nothing less than the best.</P>
      <P>We all understand that this Bill is prompted by the current spate of revelations in relation to contributions and payments to politicians. Revelations of corruption are intensely damaging to every politician and do huge damage to the body politic. Everyone, irrespective of whether they ever took a contribution of any kind, is damaged. We must act urgently and effectively to remedy that damage and to restore the faith of all our citizens in politics, politicians and the public service.</P>
      <P>We must deliver a comprehensive legislative response to public concerns about corruption in the political process and public administration. That legislative response must also be robust, constitutional and fully teased out in all respects. If we do not get the right solution once and for all, we will have failed the people and ourselves. We must move urgently but we must get it right. The Government motion aims to combine the twin objectives of urgent action and the right action. The Government motion sets out very clearly the rationale for the action and timeframe which we propose in order to progress this Bill. I stress that the Government is not opposing the Bill. I fully endorse the laudable intent behind it, as do all my colleagues. We all agree on the ultimate objective. The strategy for getting there must be one that ensures we deliver on that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> The motion has two main components. First, it sets out a substantial, comprehensive agenda which will ensure that all the complex issues involved can be thoroughly examined within an all-party framework backed by an expert advisory group. The all-party committee will be set up immediately and will consider, in the first instance, the nine legislative proposals already announced relating to the funding of political activity, both between and during elections, a Standards in Public Office Bill, the Registration of Lobbyists (No. 2) Bill, 1999, the Electoral (Amendment) (Donations to Parties and Candidates) Bill, 2000, the Public Representatives (Provision of Tax Clearance Certificates) Bill, 2000, three prevention of corruption Bills, the Local Government Bill, 2000, and the Registration of Lobbyists Bill, 2000. It will also consider further measures to prevent corruption in public office, the need for statutory regulation of lobbying activities, the protection of whistleblowers and related matters.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed that the all-party committee and the expert advisory group will be given all the support, advice and back-up they need from the relevant Departments. The work of the committee will be facilitated and assisted in every way. The motion also sets down an explicit tight timetable for the completion of the committee's work. The timeframe is deliberately ambitious and demanding. The urgency and seriousness of the situation requires nothing less than fast, effective and comprehensive action. The committee will be mandated to report back to the party leaders no later than 30 September. This will enable all the necessary legislative changes to be introduced and considered by the Oireachtas before the year ends.</P>
    <P>The Government firmly believes that the all-party committee working to an unrelenting timetable on all the complex issues is the best way forward. We have got to get this right. We are expected by the public, by citizens throughout the country, to get it right. We have a collective opportunity to set the rigorous standards which are rightly required of politicians. We have a collective opportunity to repair the damage done in recent times and we have a duty to go beyond that and to set the quality benchmark for the conduct of public and political business by everyone from here on.</P>
    <P>It is for the Oireachtas to get this right and it is appropriate, therefore, to proceed on an all-party basis to find the correct and lasting solution quickly. Let us use our collective wisdom to good effect. On that basis and in the interests of the public good, I commend the Government motion to the Seanad. This strategic approach and the timetable will deliver on our shared objective. By postponing the Second Reading of this Bill until 1 December we can achieve a well thought out consensus.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister although I do not welcome his views. I was delighted when he said he was not opposed to the Bill although he went on to criticise what it is trying to achieve. I am in favour of registering political lobbyists but I doubt if that will go to the heart of the matter. To do that, we must control the act of lobbying. Lobbying is good for democracy and only becomes dangerous and undemocratic in certain circumstances. When only those with resources can negotiate the bureaucratic maze of lobbying it becomes undemocratic because those with money have better access than those without it. Lobbying also becomes undemocratic when, as in 99% of cases, it happens in private. The majority of approaches to Ministers, officials, Deputies and Senators are clearly above board but because they take place privately, they became inherently dangerous. This privacy means there are no safeguards against the improper influencing of decisions. I am proposing that lobbying should take place openly and should be above board.</P>
      <P>Legitimate lobbying has no reason to fear a blaze of publicity, quite the contrary, but by allowing a private system of influencing decisions to develop we also create a mechanism for abuse. This is what we are afraid of. If we are serious about controlling the potential for abuse, we must have a different system. How do we create such a system? I have already proposed a preliminary examination of legislative proposals to abolish private consultations with vested interests when legislation is prepared. This would be replaced by an open and public forum into which everyone could have an input. The Department would draft the legislation, taking these contributions into consideration. All these contributions would be on the public record and no others would be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, lobbyists seek to affect more than legislation. To bring this into the open, we could create a system whereby every approach to a Minister, official or an elected representative must immediately be placed in the public domain. Every letter seeking to effect a decision would be immediately published on the Internet on the day it arrived. The record of every meeting and telephone call of a similar type would be immediately published in the same way. The Internet provides us with the technology which was not available previously and enables us to publish the records of such lobbying with the speed and ease of access necessary to make such a system work. Records would not gather mould in an inaccessible basement until they were found. They would be instantly accessible to and easily searched by <Col N="653" /> anyone with a computer and Internet access, which applies to almost everyone.</P>
    <P>This is not a fanciful idea. If one writes to the prime minister of any Scandinavian country, one's letter will instantly enter the public domain. We have the technology to extend that idea in a simple and practical way. Lobbying is a positive element in democracy.</P>
    <P>We should encourage it but it must take place within a system which is open and transparent to prevent it from becoming corrupt and undemocratic. That is the proposal and that is the direction in which we should go. We recognise the problem, let us be sure to do something about it.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator Quinn on his very constructive proposal. This is a difficult area to address, particularly the definition of lobbyists and what they should do. Senator Quinn has suggested that everything should be open and transparent. It is a fine suggestion and I am in favour of it.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear Fianna Fáil's response to his suggestion because its response to this motion is deplorable. The Minister's speech is an insult to the House, full of meaningless jargon. I have been in the House long enough to know one thing &ndash; when a Fianna Fáil Government proposes an all-party committee it does not mean it. It is a way of kicking the matter to touch. The Minister said that an all-party committee would be the solution and that we should use our collective wisdom to come to a conclusion. We never hear that about the budget or controversial legislation which the Government wants to ram through. We never hear it about appointments to the Judiciary or the European Investment Bank. Suddenly, however, when lobbyists are involved, there is time for our collective wisdom and we will all sit down together and agree some extraordinary solution which Fianna Fáil will endorse. This is simply nonsense.</P>

      <P>We are not all in this together. That is exactly what we are not because the Labour Party, to give it its due, tabled a very similar Bill a few months ago. We were not all in it together then. Does the Minister know what his Government did? Its Members came in and voted it down. They voted it down for no particular reason other than that they did not want their lobbyists discriminated against or having to register. Now, because public opinion is rising up against the Government, it suddenly says it is in favour of all sorts of politically correct measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> If the Minister would listen instead of speaking to the Leader of the House, it would be better manners.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of going even further than Senator Quinn. The system as it exists at the moment lends itself to abuse. I do not like lobbyists because they are a damn nuisance to be quite honest. I do not like lobbyists in this House because they are a damn nuisance and because I do not know to whom I am talking. I am happy for lobbyists to contact me in some ways &ndash; via the Internet, as Senator Quinn suggests, or by writing to me. That is very healthy. The problem is, however, that there are so many lobbyists hanging around this House under the guise of some other activity that a person would not know if he is being lobbied or if he is having a normal conversation. Occasionally I am bought a drink, thinking that a person likes my company, only to discover some extremely large organisation is lobbying me. It is not a frequent experience but, from time to time, I have been talking to someone who has bought me a drink, having a great time, when I suddenly find out he is a lobbyist and wants to talk to me about something else.</P>

      <P>Lobbyists should not be allowed into this House because they are paid. There are some people who leave the Civil Service to become lobbyists but still have special access to this House. That gives them a great advantage over others. There are those who become lobbyists when they lose their seats and they have access to Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came across an incident recently which I found very disturbing. The managing director of <Col N="655" /> a very large company in this city said to me that the company paid so much money to a certain person for access to Ministers. That is very unhealthy. Most people do not have access to Ministers but big business can buy access to them while small groups, small businesses and people without money cannot get near Ministers. That must be remedied.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I deplore the Government parties' attempt to postpone it and brush it under the carpet once more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has summarised the position accurately, particularly with regard to one statement &ndash; we all agree on the ultimate objective, about which there is no dispute, that is, the regulation of lobbyists. We want to ensure our democracy works openly and fairly. The question is how to do that.</P>
      <P>I have looked at the Bill and there are several defects in it, not least in the Title, where it mentions the &ldquo;greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest free and open access to central and local government&rdquo;. Those are very imprecise words to put into legislation. Even from a technical point of view there are deficiencies in the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that the vast majority of those who enter Leinster House are motivated by the public good, a desire to improve the State and to help its citizens. We must, however, concede that we reflect the society in which we live. It is one of the great strengths of our democracy that it provides Houses which are extremely representative of the State. There are wealthy people and people who are not wealthy, professionals and labourers or unemployed and so on. If it has that merit, it must also have the defect that within that population there must be some people who do not subscribe to the required standards.</P>
      <P>The manner in which we deal with those people is seriously deficient. I am a member of the sub-committee of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service which has looked at the issue. It is very difficult to devise procedures which will exert a discipline severe enough to act as a deterrent to those engaging in activities which are not illegal but which are undesirable.</P>
      <P>The practical difficulty with the legislation is how one defines a lobbyist. There are definitions in the Bill but does it mean that the Irish Farmers Association or the Vintners' Federation, or any other group, must now provide a schedule of all the people who work for them and their interests? That is not intended and it should not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where individuals are employed by large corporations, or even by the bodies about which I have spoken, they should be required to declare their interests. When they come to Leinster House we should know about them. We are presented with a difficulty where, say, people acting on behalf of a <Col N="656" /> bank, whether they are the executives or members of the board, come to see the Minister. How does one overcome such difficulties? In all the circumstances, it is reasonable for the Government to take a measured view, proceed along the lines proposed and come back with a system which will stand the test, constitutionally and otherwise, to achieve the objectives.</P>
    <P>It has been my experience during my membership of the House that when we deal with legislation in an immediate response to a major public incident or outcry, or when deficiencies are found by the courts, the legislation is invariably defective and must be revisited and improved at a later date. Almost without exception that has been the case.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross is incorrect that all-party committees do not achieve results or reach conclusions. I am a member of the all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, as is the Cathaoirleach, who knows we are dealing with a difficult subject in terms of abortion. There is wide consultation on the views of people and organisations, but conclusions will be reached which will be put to Government.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the fundamental nature of our democracy. One of its great strengths is that Parliament is close to the people and there is access for everybody to their public representatives and even to the highest levels of Government. We are all aware of this. If a local national school has a problem we arrange a meeting with a relevant Minister. People who do not have great power can, should they so choose, have access to the highest levels in the State. That is as it should be. Intimate contact with people is one of the great strengths of our democracy and it has an impact on the legislation with which we deal on a day to day basis.</P>
    <P>Lobbyists should be registered, particularly where there are individuals, and their interests must be declared. The point was well made by Senator O'Dowd on how one can prevent corruption. One cannot prevent corruption. If the people wish to be corrupt they will be. That is not to say there should not be law to deal with corruption. I am confident it is the Government's objective to bring forward that law. There is a terrible tendency &ndash; Senator O'Toole referred to it last week &ndash; to condemn people without due process and without trial. The way a Member of this House was treated by his party was disgraceful. I cannot believe for a moment that a member of his family would even consider doing anything improper. His service to the State over an extended period indicates otherwise and I do not believe he engaged in any impropriety. We must be careful not to reach conclusions which we are not allowed reach and which the courts would reach with great reluctance, if at all. There is a tendency in society to rush to judgment, adjudicate on matters best left to the courts and condemn people before they have the opportunity even to defend themselves.  </P>

It is an extremely long delay and there has been plenty of time for a response from the Government. I find it extraordinary, given the revelations which come to light week in and week out, that it is not shamed into accepting this Bill. The general public will demand an answer tomorrow when they realise that, once again, the Bill has been voted down. They will wonder what the Government is waiting for.

I do not see what will change between this and the first day of the last month of the year, apart from more revelations, which I hope will not be the case because the general public are so disillusioned. I wonder what will be their feelings on 1 December 2000. I have looked at the Bill and I cannot see what the prevarication is about. There will be time to propose those amendments on Committee Stage. It is not as if voting for the Bill on Second Stage means the Government is unable to have an input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First and foremost we should have an open and transparent democracy. There is freedom of information in local authorities and, obviously, everything is open to the public. There is tremendous accessibility in that people can visit us at our clinics &ndash; people from the EU and the United States marvel at this. There are representations at social functions and even walking down the street. Everybody realises we are open and accessible. The Bill makes it clear there is a difference in the payment aspect, the awarding of any contract, grant, contribution or other benefit <Col N="658" /> by or on behalf of a public body. That is being considered today, as well as various other areas where there is a need or a desire to influence.</P>
    <P>On Senator Dardis's comments about the IFA, INTO, ASTI and so on, it is clear that we need to have the expertise of such bodies in terms of the Bill. To take the IFA as an example, its representatives will speak to the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and Independent members. This happens every day of the week. For example, the asthma society will come to speak to us. That society is open and transparent. They will go through the corridors here, lobby us and tell us what is the reality on the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that. Everybody knows we need legitimate people to keep us informed on extremely complicated legislation &ndash; the dogs in the street know that. The big question mark is the influence and the payment involved. There are numerous lobbyists. It will be easy enough to separate the organisations and associations the Government side is worried about from others whom we know because we hear their names every day. They are affiliated to political parties, they receive payments and have an undue influence on rezoning, legislation or whatever else. The public is not so stupid that it cannot make a distinction between the ordinary day-to-day clinic, where they have access to us to deal with matters. They should not have to come to us at all but, unfortunately, that is the system. I will return to the issues on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people have probably never heard of lobbyists and do not know what they do. There is also a difference between the singular and the plural &ndash; Senator Dardis referred to lobbyists and lobby groups which are quite different. The fundamental definition of a lobbyist is a person who has acquired a special knowledge or experience by virtue of having been in Government, in a particular public institution or another body where they had access to information that is not available to the ordinary citizens. Ethics have a large role to play in this matter. A lobbyist can then set about selling this information or special knowledge to a particular person who may benefit substantially from it. That is my definition of a lobbyist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The spate of revelations from the tribunals indicates that some of these lobbyists were armed with more money than the Western Development Commission has to spend in seven counties at present. That fact has added a smell of corruption to the issue of lobbying and it is the kernel of the problem. We can legislate all we like but we will <Col N="659" /> not prevent it with human nature being what it is. It is the individual who makes the decision to peddle knowledge to people who are prepared to pay for it. One might make an analogy with a clergyman who is prepared to sell the secrets of the confessional for money. That is the essential ethical problem we face with regard to lobbyists.</P>
    <P>I have not read all of the Labour Bill but I endorse the main thrust of it. However, it will not achieve its goal. At present the Government does not intend to respond to it. The Minister's statement makes it clear that it will be deferred.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for Senator Quinn's views but putting representations on the Internet is going too far. Imagine a letter written to a Deputy, Senator or Minister being available on the Internet half an hour later. If that was done Ministers would get very few letters within the space of six months. It is not an option. I presume Ministers still have clinics and people have access to them. An ordinary citizen can walk into a clinic to meet a Minister. Should there be a video running and that the person should be recorded so that we can see what they said to the Minister? We do not want knee-jerk reactions to the tribunal revelations. We should look at them objectively and see the human element involved and the temptations that exist in relation to money.</P>
    <P>I support the main thrust of the Bill but I believe it will not achieve its objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of this legislation. I take account of Senator Caffrey's remarks and I agree that this is not the time for knee-jerk reactions.</P>
      <P>A paragraph of our amendment reads:</P>
      <P>noting the proposal to appoint an Expert Group in consultation with the Party Leaders to assist and advise that committee. The terms of reference will require it to report back to the Party Leaders not later than 30 September, 2000, so that all necessary legislative changes can be introduced and considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas not later than 31 December, 2000 . . . </P>
      <P>We have five more sitting weeks and by 30 September the expert group will have reported back to the party leaders. We will not have a knee-jerk reaction to the expert group's recommendations. We will adopt a common sense approach and put something in place that will stand the test of time.</P>
      <P>These are changing times. The booming economy has brought about a new way of life. Fifteen years ago very few of us could have foretold the opportunities and difficulties that lay ahead of us or that we would have to amend existing legislation to cater for a new Ireland and the new opportunities that have presented themselves. I welcome the opportunity that this problem has brought about. We, as politicians, will bring in the necessary legislation and we will see that everything is put right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> It is a great honour to serve and to represent one's parish, county and country. Senators are elected by the people of the 26 counties of Ireland. It is a wonderful honour to be a Senator and we have brought great honour to our families. It is a wonderful opportunity to achieve something for one's parish, county and the entire area. When we finish our terms of office we will be able to say that our hard work and endeavour has helped the families, school pals and the people in our parishes and counties. We can outline the work that we have done to highlight the difficulties that people experienced in their neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>I feel very honoured to be a public representative from Castlepollard, County Westmeath. I was nominated by the people in my parish because they thought that I could advance the parish and the neighbourhood and improve their lot for the future. As a result they sent me to Leinster House to be their representative in Seanad Éireann. I have never underestimated their confidence in me nor the integrity they want me to uphold as a public representative. I come from a rural background in which a person's honour and integrity was their wealth. Public representatives were respected in the community for the honourable way they carried out their functions, particularly as it was done on a voluntary capacity most of the time.</P>
    <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas are close to the people. We meet them on a daily basis at our clinics, at county council meetings and as members of the health boards and vocational educational committees. We make representations to Ministers, the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and Ministers of State on behalf of local authorities. We arrange deputations on behalf of county councils, health boards and vocational education committees. This has been the precedent under which we as public representatives have been carrying out honourably our function and duty since becoming members of Seanad Éireann or Dáil Éireann. However, as previous Senators said, there is now a new means by which to access Ministers and members of Government, that is by way of lobbyists. In the past, these people were known at fairs throughout rural Ireland as &ldquo;jobbers&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy Leader of the House said, the media rush to condemn people without due process. I agree with the Deputy Leader who said that a Member of this House did not receive due process last week from his own political party. Be that as it may, it is about time members of all parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas addressed the proposal that a press council be set <Col N="661" /> up, which would be a good thing. Many years ago there was a newspaper whose byword was, &ldquo;We print the truth of the news&rdquo;. Much innuendo is being printed at present which is causing a lot of hardship for families and members of families. Much of the coverage is based on rumour which is being used to sell newspapers. I do not think anyone has anything to fear, but the time has come when journalists and editors who print stories which are untrue should have to answer for their actions to a press council or other authority. At present there is no means by which to condemn these people. After all, Members of this House must account for their stewardship to the electorate approximately every three years. How we conduct our affairs and how hard we have worked to represent those who elected us to either of these two Houses is the barometer for the contribution we make.</P>
    <P>By the end of this year, with all-party agreement and acceptance of the amendment tabled here this evening, I look forward to being in a position to facilitate all parties in the House and all Members' requests. I do not think anyone in the House objects to the setting up of a lobbyists' register which is so urgently needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the fact that the Government has decided to try to bypass this legislation. It is the articulated testimony of all the parties that this issue needs to be addressed and it gives a completely wrong signal to say we will not do so until 1 December 2000. We could have taken Second Stage of the Bill and dealt differently with Committee Stage in due course. The message going out from here tonight is that the Government does not wish to address this issue and the reason for that decision is irrelevant. The fact that Mr. Haughey received £8.5 million will be carried on the news tonight and this is another subtext to that story which is not in our interest.</P>
      <P>We need to take a number of urgent measures. First, we must give an absolutely clear signal to the electorate that elected public representatives will take the business of politics in hand and will be seen to deal with the issue of corruption and sleaze. We know that the vast majority of Members of both Houses are decent, honest, diligent public representatives, but the public do not know that and they certainly do not believe it. That is the reality, whether true or false &ndash; the perception becomes the reality. Politics is held in low esteem, the lowest it has ever been, and we need to deal properly with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leaders of all the groups approached the Leader of the House recently and asked for an open debate on the issue. For instance, no decent Irish citizen watching television, in a pub or on the streets tonight would understand why the system here operates in the following manner, that is, if someone becomes an undischarged bankrupt, that person loses his or her seat in the House and is disqualified from standing for election. This can happen to people in business with<Col N="662" /> out ever having a bad intention. On the other hand, the legislation provides that if a Member of either House has been involved at any level in bribery or corruption, or is seen to be corrupt or to have accepted bribes, the maximum penalty we can impose by way of self-regulation as politicians is that that person cannot sit in the House for the next 30 days.</P>
    <P>I must take responsibility, together with others, for the legislation passed in my time, which is inefficient, inadequate and needs to be strengthened. The reality which must be dealt with is that we can only impose on someone a 30 day paid holiday as a punishment. On the one hand, we tell them to stay at home, that we will pay them for the 30 days, and then expect the ordinary punter, voter and member of the electorate in a cynical Ireland to believe this is some sort of punishment while, on the other, someone who may become an undischarged bankrupt through no fault of his or her own is disqualified and thrown out of the House.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the case of former Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty, he is not a criminal, he did not commit a crime, he never accepted a bribe and he was not found to be corrupt. However, he made an intervention, sparked by humanitarian feelings, which, in the words of the report, was subject to interpretation, was unwise and showed bad judgment. Therefore, he made a mistake for which he deserved to be punished. I said last year, and I repeat, that I do not think he deserved to be sacked from the Supreme Court or forced into resignation. There were other ways of dealing with the matter. It is completely wrong for reports in this evening's newspapers to put Hugh O'Flaherty in the same context as people who accepted bribes, sold votes and were seen to be corrupt. It does nothing for the perception if we do not make this distinction. I agree with other Senators that the Government mismanaged the case of Hugh O'Flaherty last year and again this year, nevertheless it is important to distinguish between that and the fact that he is an honest man, a man of integrity who made a mistake. There are differences and if we are to do the job properly, we need to be seen to do so.</P>
    <P>This raises the question of due process, which is crucial. I said here and in a number of interviews last week that a penalty of 14 days paid holiday is wrong. I am not referring to the issue or the person, but to the fact that the penalty is not adequate in the eyes of the public. Similarly, it is completely wrong for us to walk away from dealing with this problem. There must be due process which is basically the rights and tenets of natural justice whereby people have a right to see the evidence against them, a right to cross-examine and a right to give their side of the case, etc. I am not impressed by kangaroo courts, by political parties examining their own affairs. This is more important than political parties. Of course we must weed out the problems within parties but that cannot be the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> Our proposal would have complimented this Bill which was tabled by the Labour Party. We have to be heard to say that people who accept bribes for their votes and are seen to be corrupt have no place in the Houses of Parliament. I cite no further evidence than motion 21, which refers to Article 15.2 of the Constitution, to support my case. This House and the other House have a constitutional obligation to protect its Members against interference through bribery and corruption. We must do something about this, we cannot rely on the words and hope it will all fall into place. If voting records have been interfered with through bribery and corruption and if Members are being tainted, we have a responsibility to do something about it. We must deal with the problem before personalities become involved. Everything goes wrong when a name is mentioned. People are suddenly faced with party loyalties, friendships and all sorts of difficulties. If we deal with these problems before personalities become involved the matter can be dealt with in an objective and impartial manner. We have to be seen to take the lead in this matter.</P>
    <P>We must also look at funding of political parties. I strongly believe that those who fund political parties should be open about it. I take a different view from both sides of the House on the question of funding political parties. I do not believe in false glass ceilings for contributions because I do not think it is workable. One cannot legislate to stop dishonesty. People will always find a dishonest way to do things. If we put a ceiling of £500, £5,000 or £10,000 on the amount of contributions allowed there will always be somebody who will find ten people who will give £999 or £9,999 etc. All political contributions, regardless of how they are raised, be it through a golf classic, etc., should be recorded in the audited accounts. It is that simple. It is not about restricting the amount of money which people can spend on an election or restricting the amount of contribution any one person or corporation can give. The problem should be dealt with by way of legislation.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are strong arguments for putting a ceiling in place but the system must be capable of being policed and implemented. We should take the first step of ensuring whatever contribution is received by a party or person is recorded in the party's audited accounts of the election campaign. That should be our starting point.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau should be set on those who have made fortunes by way of criminal acts of bribery and corruption. If current legislation is not competent to deal with that problem we should change it. We should also ensure that those who acted in a criminal manner to gain planning permission should be ineligible to seek permission for development in future. This is the only way forward. We should also apply compulsory purchase orders to the holding of development land. The Government or the local auth<Col N="664" /> orities, rather than quangos or non-Government groups, should tell us who owns all the building and development land in the Dublin area. Those who are carefully parcelling out a couple of hundred acres of land every year so as to keep prices artificially inflated should be made known. We should incorporate three different types of housing &ndash; social housing, affordable housing and the rest &ndash; into the Planning and Development Act, with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's positive and progressive proposals.</P>
    <P>There are ways we can control and beat these people. We have the power and the authority. We can legislate to do it and we have the constitutional support to do so. We should be seen to clean up politics and move forward. I do not say any of this by way of high moral ground. I am no better than anyone else in this House or the other House. I do not put myself above anybody but I see this as a practical approach to put in place a proper structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I was looking back at Senator Gallagher's contribution on this matter last year and it struck me that we are going around in circles. He referred then to matters in the media, the Paddy Duffy affair, regarding the publication of this Bill. We now have further issues regarding lobbyists and the need for them to be registered.</P>
      <P>The Government's reaction that we should take a measured view and not have knee-jerk reactions suggests they do not consider this to be an urgent issue. As Senator O'Toole and others said, the public will laugh in our faces at that reaction. How long have we been waiting for the Standards in Public Office Bill? It is three years since the Taoiseach took office and we still have not seen it. The Minister spoke about the need for an urgent approach, that means at least six months delay. Let us not have knee-jerk reactions, let us have a measured approach.</P>
      <P>The Leader spoke about his sense of honour and pride at being here. I, too, feel that sense of honour and pride. I am one of the new Members of this House to whom he referred. It was with great honour and pride for my community and family that I took my seat in this House, but I feel a great sense of shame at the moment. How could one feel anything but shame when one hears on the radio and television and reads in the media of bribes being taken and a former Taoiseach receiving £8.5 million in payments? How could one feel anything but shame being a politician in this country today? It is up to us to re-establish trust. Trust has broken down, there is no point in our pretending otherwise. There is no point in our going around this House with a sense of injured pride and hurt at what the media are saying about politicians. We must put our heads down and think of how we are going to work to re-establish trust in our political system. The consequences for our democracy are too serious to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the level of cynicism and sheer distrust of poli<Col N="665" /> ticians and politics could lead to a turn-out so low that a political result cannot be trusted, a level of cynicism so deep as to be unknown. Let us not fool ourselves, we run the risk of doing that. Simply walking around with a sense of injured pride and hurt is not a good enough response. We have to move further than the public expect.</P>

      <P>We are not here as private citizens. We are not private citizens when we are reported in the press. We are public citizens and act on behalf of the public. That is the way in which we are reported, the way in which we must expect to be reported and the way the media should expect us to be reported.</P>
      <P>How will we re-earn the trust of the public? It will take a long time and much more effort in this area than is currently evident on the Government side. We must grasp the nettle of resourcing our democracy, with which this and other legislation on the capping and regulation of donations to politicians, published by the Labour Party, deals. We must break, once and for all, in the minds of the public any perceived or possible connections between business and payments to politicians. We must separate and create a wide open space between politics and how it is conducted and business and donations and how they are conducted. The only way we can do that is to fund the political system, including political parties, our offices and the employment of our staff, and ban donations. That is the only way to create an untouchability about politics that must be established if public trust is to be re-earned and re-established in our political system. If we pussyfoot around the issue and say that we must have consensus on this, we will further damage the political system. We cannot underestimate the level of damage that has been done to politics.</P>
      <P>Our political culture is changing and that is probably for the good, although it is with a sense of regret that I note the passing of the high regard in which politicians were held. One cannot but regret that public representatives who are in politics for only the best of motives, as we are, should be viewed as a bunch of crooks and criminals. Our political culture must change to ensure that at its heart lies the principle of accountability. In the same way as we demanded accountability for the decisions or lack of them that led to the death of people, such as haemophiliacs, and that led to children being abused in State institutions, an ongoing process of accountability must apply to our political system. The only way to ensure that is through a structure of strong legislation of which this is only one element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much I could say about political lobbyists. I commend this Bill to the House. Many comments have been made on it. We would welcome amendments to this Bill. Each Bill that comes before this House is debated, amendments may be tabled to it by Members on all sides of the House and we come up with what we hope is an <Col N="666" /> improved Bill. This Bill is a start in laying the necessary framework for re-establishing trust in our democracy. That is an essential approach if we are not to go down the road of what would be a disaster for our democracy, for which many people worked hard and some gave their lives at the beginning of the last century. Let us not throw it away because of negligence and a misplaced sense of hurt about these serious matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my Labour Party colleagues on introducing this Bill. I am disappointed the Leader of the House, Senator Cassidy, deemed fit to vote it down by introducing an amendment, particularly given that this is not a slapdash Bill. It is detailed and contains many sections and a good deal of research was carried out in preparing it. If accepted on this Stage, the Bill could be amended on later Stages and thereby improved.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that a politician of the Leader's experience would table an amendment that refers to noting the proposal to appoint an expert group. It is farcical and ridiculous that politicians would appoint an expert group to examine how the political system works and the corruption, which has been reported extensively in the media and is constantly being revealed. The greatest revelation was made today about the £8.5 million collected by Mr. Haughey, our esteemed former Taoiseach, over a period of years. Such corruption is a downright disgrace. To state that an expert group must be appointed when we know the reality of this matter and that it should not be dealt with here makes this House irrelevant.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with one aspect of the problem in this area, lobbyists. With regard to lobbyists, we are moving from the sublime to the ridiculous. We have a population of approximately four million, about half the size of the city of the New York, yet we are adopting the facilities and the type of nonsense one would find in Washington DC, which deals with legislation to cover the United States of America. We have lobbyists in this little island nation. Rather than introducing legislation to register them, perhaps we should introduce a Bill to abolish and outlaw them, as they interfere with the democratic system.</P>
      <P>It is only 80 years since our democracy was established. When one thinks of what our ancestors and forefathers did to establish this democratic republic and that in such a short time some successors of the founders of this State could abuse their positions to such an appalling degree, we are no better or worse than a banana republic. There are states in Africa with dictators that have a more credible political system than we have. It is disgraceful that I should have to say that, but the evidence is there to prove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a politician who comes from a political family, I very much resent that a handful of politicians can bring a bad odour and bad name to the entire body politic. In this laudable profession whereby we serve the people and deem it an hon<Col N="667" /> our to be elected to do so, I will not accept that a handful of politicians can decry the names of those of us in the political system who are well motivated. It is appalling if that handful of politicians can get way with that. We have a responsibility to put in place legislation that will stop that at all costs. However, as Senator O'Toole said, there are people with a mentality to be corrupt and they will be so. Introducing all the legislation possible to deal with corruption will not root them out, but we must ensure within our party structure and by way of the legislation we pass in this House that action will be taken to prevent the type of abuses that have taken place.</P>
    <P>One element of the problem in this area, lobbyists, is dealt with in this Labour Party Bill. Lobbyists have been used by developers and people in big business to get access to politicians, including Ministers and people well positioned in various Departments. I have a major problem with the use of lobbyists as we are talking about a sector of people who can afford to hire a lobbyist. I am talking about divisions in our society. Once the principle of employing lobbyists is accepted, we must acknowledge that a sector of the community can afford to employ a lobbyist to promote its cause and that another sector, which is more in need, does not have the resources to employ a lobbyist. There is a danger that the less well off will suffer while the better off can afford to employ a lobbyist to promote their cause.</P>
    <P>Developers, and in some instances big business people, have employed lobbyists and given them vast sums of money to disburse among people in the public service and people elected to public office. That has been done for good, bad or evil as the case may be. Legislation must be introduced to ensure that those who give lobbyists money to disburse are made responsible for their actions, as it is wrong that they have been able to influence people in public office due to the money they have behind them. That is not a fair or democratic system. It is not what our society should be about. I hope the legislation to which Senator Cassidy has referred will deal specifically with all those issues.</P>
    <P>In this House there is a variety of elected public representatives in various capacities. The majority come from the political party system while others are Independents. Within the political party structure there are various ways and means of providing funding, through fundraising events within the various parties and in some instances through donations directly to headquarters. I have a difficulty where a candidate is given money directly at election time or at any other time. It is highly dangerous for any person who stands for public office to accept money directly from any individual or group of individuals for the purpose of being elected. It should be outlawed completely in the party political structures and by legislation. Donations, if they are to <Col N="668" /> be made, should be made directly to the headquarters of the various parties.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should consider seriously the possibility of full State funding for political parties. There is a reluctance to follow that course because of a fear that the public would resent paying. Given what has come out in the wash recently, as a result of all the manoeuvres and manipulations in relation to the provision of funding, the public would be happy to provide taxpayers' money for political parties, independent candidates for election purposes and to cut out private contributions.</P>
    <P>Once a party has been funded by any individual, company or organisation it is compromised. There can be no mistake about it, that party is automatically influenced. It is difficult to define &ldquo;influence&rdquo; because people can be influenced in a variety of ways. There are subtle ways of doing it. The reality is that if a candidate is funded directly by an individual he or she will be behoven to that individual if elected. That should not be allowed and it must be outlawed.</P>
    <P>There should be a level playing pitch for candidates who stand for election. There are some candidates who have massive amounts of money, although that has been addressed because of the cap on spending at elections, while others have nothing. There will have to be a level playing pitch if there is to be democracy. We must strive to introduce legislation to regularise the position.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Government has decided not to accept the Bill in principle on Second Stage and allow it to proceed to Committee Stage where it could be amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on from what Senator Taylor-Quinn has said, the Taoiseach has repeatedly said he does not get the feeling there is a public appetite for funding the political process from the public purse. I am not sure he is right. If there was a cap on the amount that could be spent by politicians they might be enthusiastic about funding the political process. It is an extraordinary coincidence that on a day when we discover a former Taoiseach, in the course of 17 years, received at least £8.5 million, £10,000 per week, from various bodies, institutions or private individuals we should be expected to believe this Bill is not needed immediately. I am an altruistic person but I have never heard of such largesse without some return being expected. Politicians who expect the public to believe they gave nothing in return for the large amounts of money some of them appear to have received are stretching public credulity beyond belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed with the Minister's reply to Senator Costello. The worst aspect of it is that it tries to put all who approach us in the same boat whereas we know people come with legitimate points of view to put forward. It is important to take their views on board. In some cases points of view have been put forward which <Col N="669" /> Departments had not considered. It would be a great pity if such approaches to politicians were thrown out at the same time as those who need to be discouraged from their immoral activities.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister could have supported the Bill. The amendment is a long-winded way of saying &ldquo;Live horse and get grass&rdquo;. It is no more than pushing the problem away into the future where it will not be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am sorry I did not have the opportunity to hear his contribution which, no doubt, was eloquently delivered but disappointing. I will read it myself.</P>
      <P>I support the Registration of Lobbyists Bill, 2000. Its intent is good. In light of some of the shocking recent developments, which we must all face up to, it is long overdue. The Government's lengthy amendment, however belated, is welcome. That is not to take from the merit of the Bill which is laudable and timely. The measures to which it refers can be dealt with but there is nothing to prevent us accepting the Bill on Second Stage and allowing it proceed to Committee Stage where the Government can introduce the amendments it wishes. As the Government has a majority it could vote them through.</P>
      <P>The Government voted down this Bill ten or 11 months ago on the grounds that insufficient research and consideration of the issue of lobbying had been conducted here. We have had a salutary lesson recently about the adverse impact of lobbying. While there may be some problem with definitions we are all aware of what is involved. I have no doubt the Government, given the resources available to it, particularly through the Attorney General's office, could amend the Bill on Committee Stage to good effect. I plead with the Government to allow the Bill pass Second Stage and proceed to Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Leader was saying something. I am always willing to listen to him. He does not always have the information I wish him to have or, if so, he is not always prepared to part with it.</P>
      <P>Action is needed on a broad front. In its amendment, the Government refers to many of those items which I welcome but it should not be allowed take from the merit of the Bill. This is a good Bill and should be allowed to proceed.</P>
      <P>Speaking more generally, I wish to refer to a statement by Deputy John Bruton. I do not think there has ever been a successful prosecution for corruption, which in the light of recent developments tells us something is wrong with our law. Last month Deputy John Bruton said in a statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disclosures in the Flood tribunal today vindicate the value of this tribunal and are a <Col N="670" /> convincing answer to all those who have been complaining about it to the media and otherwise. These disclosures would never have been made if the full power of the tribunal had not been deployed.</P>
    <P>He went on to argue that legislation should be drawn up to register lobbyists &ndash; a suitable Bill is now before us &ndash; and that a definition should be fairly widely drawn. He continued: &ldquo;Lobbyists so defined should be banned from making any political contributions whatsoever.&rdquo;  He said the Corruption Acts, 1889 to 1916, should be amended, as he recommended that on 25 March 1999, so as &ldquo;to place the onus on anyone in a position to make a decision which will benefit another person or company to prove that any payment made to him by that person or company was not made in order to influence that decision&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill published by Deputy Flanagan would help meet some of the issues raised. We supposedly live in an age of openness, transparency and accountability. There are some dark murky things in our recent past, one instance of which is the sale of Carysfort, all the facts about which are not yet in the open. We must clean up the tarnished image of politics and to do so we must be prepared to root out corruption, particularly in the planning process. Sadly some local communities have been adversely affected by very questionable planning decisions. Some utterly unacceptable practices have been exposed. Big donations and politics do not mix and we can only allow small contributions on a personal basis.</P>
    <P>Earlier I heard people saying they were hurt. There is no point in politicians being hurt if we are not prepared to be proactive in putting matters right. That is why I plead with the Government to take a very firm step by accepting the Bill and then proceed to the rest of the programme as outlined.</P>
    <P>As a constitutionalist, I am very concerned with fair procedures, due process and not rushing to judgment. I respect the work of both tribunals and we should not be trying to jump too far ahead. It is fine for parties to carry out their own examinations, but we must be careful. The majority of politicians are honest, upright and dedicated people and I do not like to see them being sold short. We owe a duty to our electorate and we should listen carefully to them. I believe they all want us to process the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Registration of lobbyists is very important and should be tackled in a particular way. My special worry concerns not just the general lobbyist from outside but the number of current and former Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who are lobbyists and who, therefore, have special access and privileges. Even from my early days in the Seanad I remember how convenient it was to enter the Members' Restaurant, sit impertinently beside a Minister and bite his or her ear. That is all right if it is done on behalf of a voluntary organisation or a particular political cause or issue. When commercial companies are <Col N="671" /> involved, however, with former Members representing interests such as that of Rupert Murdoch, about which I am particularly sceptical, it is necessary to have some control, either in terms of access or by making it impossible for a person to simultaneously be a Member and a lobbyist. There is always the danger of the Trojan horse syndrome. Something could be unsuspectingly introduced into the body politic which could prove to be malign, and for that reason it is very important that we have a register of lobbyists and that we control the effect of lobbying.</P>
      <P>The Leader said this morning he would make provision for us to range widely over the various scandals and issues concerning corruption in this debate, and I propose to do this, although not to the extent of tedium. Such debates are very important for a number of reasons, first, because of the degree of cynicism and disillusion which is being spread throughout the land and the very low esteem in which politics is held in general. I take the unpopular view that politics is a noble calling and a profession which attracts decent people, something I hope continues. I regard my colleagues in the House as fitting into this category, regardless of their political persuasion. However, that is not the perception of people outside the House. People frequently use the phrase &ldquo;the politicians&rdquo;&ndash; I was on a television programme the other evening when the phrase was used and I heard it again on the radio &ndash; as if we were a special category of human being uniquely susceptible to corruption, bribery and malpractice, which I do not believe is true. However, it is obvious that some Members have let down the profession and for that reason a cleansing of the Augean stables is necessary.</P>
      <P>There are many in public life and in both Houses who are honourable and who have sacrificed themselves. The financial rewards, except in a few quite extraordinary cases, are comparatively small. I love politics. It is an honour to be a Member of the House and I hope the graduates of the University of Dublin, Trinity College, continue to demonstrate their political wisdom by re-electing me. It is also a pleasure, as politics is a fascinating game which is continually changing. In that way it is like a kaleidoscope of Irish life. Occasionally, even in this House, the weaker of the two Houses in terms of actual direct political power, one is able to do something which positively affects the lives of one's fellow citizens, something which is worthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A politician is an ordinary citizen who accepts an extra level of responsibility on behalf of the other ordinary citizens. Perhaps it is our own fault that we perceived ourselves as extraordinary or self-important in some way. Perhaps it is time we are brought back to earth and demonstrate that we are part of the plain people of Ireland, a great phrase in the 1920s and 1930s. If one examines the ongoing scandal and corruption, I believe the <Col N="672" /> country is suffering from scandal fatigue. We know it is necessary to get to the root of it and that it is important that it should be cleaned up but it is sickening that it goes on and on in a never ending mess. I hope at some stage it will be possible to draw a line under this as history and start afresh because if we do not manage to find a way of doing so, politics will be soiled forever.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that people feel bitter and cynical. I was listening to the wireless this afternoon and on &ldquo;Five Seven Live&rdquo; there was a fascinating collage which told it all. It featured little excerpts from the speeches of Mr. Haughey about belt tightening interspersed with details of his lifestyle. It is a tragic situation and it is worse that at local authority level people made large sums of money. Big developers and industrial interests handed out huge sums of money and they must have expected to get something for it. The result is seen in Ronanstown, north Clondalkin, where ordinary working class people have been deprived of the very things politics should have delivered to them, such as town centres and decent infrastructure. There is then the awful impertinence in this Republic where shops are classed as outside the range of such people and their children because they are working class and they are disbarred from some of them.</P>
    <P>I refer to the O'Flaherty case because it is a danger signal for us. He is a decent man whose errors were not great. They were largely due to an inability to imagine the public perception and the way in which his acts would be interpreted. As I recall, he was out for a walk when he was approached by a neighbour and some friends, asked a question about a technical area of the law, indicated that a relisting might be possible and then some short time after asked the county registrar into his chambers to confirm his advice. The registrar relisted the case and everything subsequently happened. Mr. Justice Hamilton in his judgment said that his acts were inappropriate, unwise and capable of misinterpretation. That is interesting. In other words, what had been done was not so bad but it was capable of being interpreted in an almost criminal way. We will be in a very dangerous area if we allow people to be sacrificed simply because the public may ignorantly misinterpret their acts and attribute malign motives to them.</P>
    <P>I hate listening to the way politics is being debased as the entire profession becomes partisan in undignified rows which break out night after night on radio and television with the main political parties slinging carefully prepared mud at each other. The slogans must be prepared somewhere because every person comes out with the same one, such as &ldquo;Fianna Fáil are spreading the muck about&rdquo;. The Fianna Fáil response is, &ldquo;Join the commission &ndash; yes or no&rdquo;. Ordinary decency must be brought back into politics if it is to regain respect and attract decent young people not just to vote, because they have stopped voting <Col N="673" /> in huge numbers, but to enter the profession of politics where they are more desperately needed than ever before.</P>

      <P>I thank the 15 Members who contributed, which is one quarter of the membership of the House. That is a record for a Private Members' debate. As usual, there was a large number of valuable contributions and suggestions. I would be delighted to take a number of them on board if the Bill reaches Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn stated that lobbyists should conduct their business in the full blaze of publicity and that everything should be open, transparent and above board, which should be built into the legislation. He then said that vested interests should not be met through private consultations, as is the case at present, and that an open public forum should be established. He also stated that all documents and letters sent to a Minister should be available to the public immediately on the Internet. These are valuable suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross went a step further and suggested that all lobbyists should be banned from the House because of the privilege accorded to it, especially those who are former Members or were political advisers in the Houses of the Oireachtas. That should be examined and it could be taken on board. Senator O'Toole pointed out that the only penalty that exists for wrongdoing by a Member under the rules of the House is to suspend him or her and punish him or her with a &ldquo;30 day paid holiday&rdquo;. That is hardly satisfactory. Senator O'Meara said that, as public representatives, we should be seen to go further than the public demands. Senator Taylor-Quinn made the <Col N="674" /> most radical proposal. She said the legislation should abolish the entire lobbyist industry, that the entire system should be eradicated and we should not think about regulating it. The Minister's contribution was quite derisory and involved nothing but slogans and jargon. No specific commitment was given and it was the most vague, derisory statement I have heard in this House for a long time.</P>
    <P>We cannot accept the amendment for two reasons. First, it postpones until 1 December something that should have been addressed a year ago and, second, the commitments that were given then have not been acted on. How do we know that the commitments in the amendment will be acted on? An all-party committee backed up by an expert group has been promised. However, it may well not be established.</P>
    <P>The amendment states there are already nine legislative proposals before us. We are the experts and we are members of a legislative body which can do a decent job in processing this legislation on Committee Stage. The public want us to get moving on this legislation and not put it on the long finger. We should take up our responsibilities as public representatives, demonstrate that our profession is above reproach and not sit on the fence any longer.</P>
    <P>This Bill is one plank to shore up democracy. We, as elected representatives, are saying that our house has not been in order but we have specific measures, which undoubtedly can be improved upon, to address area which requires regulation. The legislation provides a specific framework which should be acted on immediately.</P>
