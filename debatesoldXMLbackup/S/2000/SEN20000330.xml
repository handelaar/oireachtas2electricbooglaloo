      <P>I have notice from Senator Ridge that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to address the discrimination against twins by equalising the monthly child benefit for twins with those of multiple births.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to retain the ban on below cost selling.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator John Cregan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to make a statement on the KPMG report reviewing the operations and structures of the seaports in the Shannon estuary.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline his proposals for the extension of CCTV to areas in Dublin, in particular the Dún Laoghaire area, in view of the many demands from local and business interests following previous commitments given.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senators Ridge's and Finneran's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Cregan and Cosgrave may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1 and 2. No. 1 is Committee and Remaining Stages of the National Minimum Wage Bill, 2000. No. 2 is an earlier signature motion to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 1. Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>An issue which is consuming the entire country is the transport chaos in the capital and a large part of the country. We have nothing useful to say about it this morning. We can only repeat the exhortations that were made here yesterday and urge that existing channels are used, as a matter of urgency, to try to resolve this dispute. There are bigger, deeper issues and the Leader promised to return to them in a full structured debate in the near future.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a question about the work being done by the constitutional review group which produced a number of important reports. One of them is the recent study of the Irish text of the Constitution which is one of the most important documents to emerge and has important long-term consequences. Will the Leader arrange to have a debate on the various reports made by the group? Its reports touch upon the restructuring of the courts, the future of this House and the electoral system which are all matters of great importance.</P>
      <P>When I picked up the Order Paper today I felt an old familiar friend was gone. The Shannon River Council Bill, 1998, which was on the Order Paper for a long time is no longer there. In view of the unprecedented piece of parliamentary history here last night when a Bill was voted through Second and Committee Stages&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say is relevant to today's business. Last night was a sad piece of history. Many people who had spoken earlier with great passion about the need for that Bill did not get a chance to speak last night. Therefore, I propose we amend today's Order of Business and agree to take item 14, statements on Shannon River Council (Resumed). I also propose that this business last for one hour and that each speaker have ten minutes. The House deserves to hear the views of speakers, particularly those of Senator Dardis</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>When I checked the Order of Business this morning I found that there was nothing on it with which I could disagree. I felt, based on the logical decisions we took here last night, that if you agree with everything in a Bill then you should vote against it. I found myself in the position that I would have to vote against the Order of Business because I agreed with it. That is the type of logic that was thrust in our faces during the debacle on the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998. The Leader should be in disgrace about it. This type of leadership is less than we deserve. We cannot have trust and confidence in the way we do our business if, having reached agreement on something, it is not delivered. The Cathaoirleach will notice that I am not reopening last night's business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Senator is repeating some of the sentiments that were expressed last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, you could be right.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning has taken me out of a bind because I did not know how I would deal with finding myself in total agreement. He has found a way to give expression to that total agreement by proposing an amendment to the Order of Business and I am happy to second his proposal.</P>
      <P>As I have said before, there are many aspects to the transport strike. One serious aspect is that 500,000 trade unionists voted for a programme that will cover the next 33 months and any false moves could bring it tumbling down on our heads. It had better be made clear that the commitments given in that programme are the same as those given to all trade unionists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the Order of Business. I am also concerned about the earlier signature motion. The National Minimum Wage Bill, 2000, was in the Dáil for two months but it will only be here for two days, yet it must be signed by Saturday in order to come into operation. It is clear that there is no intention of giving this House the slightest opportunity to implement any amendments. If amendments were accepted in this House there would be no time for the Bill to be sent back to the other House and then returned here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serious questions have been raised about this Bill. Senator Quinn mentioned that entire families who run a business were exempt from its provisions. I have a number of serious technical <Col N="1356" /> amendments which deal with the constitutionality of the Bill because that issue was not addressed in the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will have an opportunity to deal with the detail of these amendments on Committee Stage today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour group is opposed to the Order of Business because of the earlier signature motion. It is not that we would not want it signed early but it is an insult to this House that the Minister should deal with this Bill in the space of two days without the slightest opportunity being given to make an amendment. Substantial amendments were before this House yesterday and I will table substantial amendments today. I ask the Leader to give ample opportunity to this House so that it can deal with the amendments and to allow, if necessary, for the Bill to be returned to the other House. That would mean that the House and this important legislation could be treated properly.</P>
      <P>I agree that item 14, statements on the Shannon River Council, should be taken today because the extraordinary debate that took place last night was a disgrace.</P>
      <P>The transportation chaos on our streets is due to low pay and long hours worked by people who do a very responsible job. Let us remember that that is at the core of this dispute. I would welcome a move towards industrial relations taking place during the coming week. All avenues, such as the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission, should be explored. I hope this matter will be resolved as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to a report from a judge yesterday in which he justifiably deplores the fact that a young girl who was not mentally ill had to be confined in secure accommodation for mental patients due to lack of proper accommodation. I have received, as I am sure other Senators have also, a communication from a family about the impact of an investigation of allegations on them of child abuse. Obviously I will not go into the details of the case but I am sure there is another side to it. It is tragic that the steps which must be taken to keep children secure can result in them being damaged in other ways. I have enormous sympathy for the social workers and other professionals who have to deal with these cases but it stems from inadequate resources and proper facilities. Perhaps the Leader of the House can arrange a debate on the provision of child care and ask the Minister for Health and Children to be present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader confirm if the debate in this House on the review of the role of the Seanad under the Constitution has been concluded? The reason I ask this is the chairman of the all-party committee for the review of the Constitution is preparing a draft White Paper <Col N="1357" /> which includes the matter already dealt with by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe in a previous report. I am anxious that the honour and dignity of this House would be fully recognised and protected. I spoke on this matter some time ago and wondered if the debate has been concluded. I understood the chairman, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was to address the House and, if he has not already done that &ndash; I doubt if he has &ndash; I urge him to do so.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to include the town of Dunmanway in his drive for decentralisation, for some aspect&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be guided by the Cathaoirleach. I call for a debate on the issue of immigration raised by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the need over the next five years for 200,000 people to enter this country to build up our workforce from either inside or outside the EU. This is worthy of debate. There was an incident where the council proposed to build a house for a needy family in my area. Despite putting this out for tender on two separate occasions, no builder was prepared to take on the work due to the lack of employees in the construction industry. The Tánaiste mentioned the construction industry as well as the lack of nurses. This is an issue worthy of debate and deserves special attention. Due to an insufficient workforce the vista facing us is appalling and we are unlikely to be able to deal with the situation over the next few years.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Costello's remarks on the earlier signature motion. For someone who attended this House last week and rather loudly and proudly proclaimed that her middle name was intervention &ndash; we were discussing CIE at the time &ndash; the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, has made a damn bad job of it. Can the Leader establish how the Minister proposes to continue to intervene and if she will do so fruitfully and successfully?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the only national public forum I have available to me to raise issues. In view of the antiquated and outdated legislation and regulation attaching the cord between Iarnród Éireann and the Department of Public Enterprise, will the Leader bring to the Minister's attention my concern regarding a fatal accident in Donamon, Roscommon, on Iarnród Éireann level crossings? As a public representative this is the only way I can raise the matter as it has been ruled out of order under regulation. I agree that the Cathaoirleach had no other option but it illustrates that &ndash; I think it is the 1932 legislation &ndash; is outdated and its sell by date is past. It is inappropriate that a Minister cannot address an issue of such importance and public concern under those regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Costello's amendment to the Order of Business on the earlier signature motion to the National Minimum Wage Bill. That matter and the issue of the Shannon River Council Bill are fundamental to how we do business in this House but also and more fundamentally to how the Government parties treat this House as regards legislation and how we are regarded. We attempt to fulfil our role as legislators but we are not allowed to do that. Regarding the manner in which the National Minimum Wage Bill is being treated, we have tabled technical amendments to bring to the Minister's attention fundamental errors in the legislation. When we have brought technical issues to the attention of any Minister, they have generally been accepted. However, in this case it means the Bill would have to go back to the other House. In our opinion and from the advice available to us, those fundamental errors&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of Senator Maurice Hayes about the lack of child care for problem cases. Could we have a debate on the reasons the Department has not put in place any structures to deal with such cases as the child who was repeatedly before Judge Peter Kelly's court and who is now detained in the Central Mental Hospital? She is a 17 year old disturbed girl. For five years we have been promised that something would be done to deal with such serious cases and nothing has been done. I never thought I would see the day when a child would be detained in the Central Mental Hospital. It is an extraordinary state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request by Senator Hayes for the Minister of State with responsibility for children to come to the House to debate the issue of children in need of accommodation who are before the courts.</P>
      <P>It is important that whatever agreement is reached with workers in CIE is within the context of the new national wage agreement. Given the seriousness of the situation, perhaps the Minister would come to the House to discuss the matter so that we could express our views and offer our help in resolving this national dispute which is causing much hardship and damage to industry at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Senator Hayes. He raised a most important issue, namely, the consistent lack of attention by the Government to something which happens on a regular basis. This teenager is not the first but is one in a continuous queue of young people who cannot avail of any services to help them. It is a shocking indictment of the system that a judge has to prod the Government to take action. We are meant to cherish our children equally. That 17 year old is still in the Central Mental Hospital. What future does she have to look forward to? I hope we will have a debate soon with the Minister for Health and Children and that he will tell us what he intends doing to address this issue once and for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter of some urgency related to East Timor from where the Taoiseach recently returned and where he was in touch with the President. I have the leading article from yesterday's <i>Jakarta Post.</i> At the time of the mayhem last year, 100,000 refugees from East Timor were evacuated into West Timor. They are still there. The Indonesian Government has given until tomorrow night for a decision to be made, otherwise it will stop feeding them. This issue is of dramatic urgency because, if it ceases feeding them tomorrow night, then there is the possibility of 100,000 deaths from starvation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach to act immediately and ask the Indonesian Government <Col N="1360" /> to delay this action of ceasing to feed the 100,000 East Timorese refugees in West Timor? The detail is contained in the leading article in yesterday's <i>Jakarta Post</i> which I will give to the Leader afterwards. It is an urgent matter. The European Presidency is now in the hands of Portugal which has an interest in this. There are a number of areas in which we could do something, but this is of dramatic urgency and I am anxious that something be done about it immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Hayes and commend him on raising that issue. All Members have been circulated with information in the past 48 hours relating to a matter within the ambit of the Eastern Health Board and in which the Minister would obviously would have some competence. I support Senator Hayes and others who referred to what appears to be an outrageous development regarding a family in the Dublin area; the family cannot be identified for legal reasons. This House has a right to raise matters of this import. Obviously there are two sides to the story and I support Senator Hayes's comment and request. Will the Leader take urgent note of what has been said and communicate with the Department of Health and Children? I have already inquired through the Minister's office as to the reality of the situation. If even half of what we have read is true, it is an outrageous indictment of any State or semi-State agency in the year 2000 that it acted in this manner. I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to expand on this but it was mainly to support Senator Hayes and his initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader let me or the House know why there is an unprecedented delay in the publication of the local government Bill? It was promised over a year ago and has not yet been brought before us. It will be a substantial Bill as it will take into account all legislation relating to local government since the founding of the State. Aspects of it created expectations on the part of local authority members which have not been met. The sooner the Bill is before the House the better, but I would like to know why there has been an extraordinary delay in its publication. I understood it would come before this House and there is no reason for it not being before us so that we could deal with it before the Easter recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sometimes inclined to be disorderly but I have never questioned the ruling of the Chair. However, I seek clarification on this occasion. Last week the Minister for Public Enterprise identified herself as the person who was sorting out the safety of the railways. She claimed credit for it and accepted responsibility for it. Are Ministers in this House subject to the same rules as the rest of us? If the Minister has accepted responsibility, I am at a loss to know <Col N="1361" /> why we cannot raise issues connected with that for which she has accepted responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It also happened yesterday where a Minister successfully breached the rules of the House. Ministers should remember that they are subject to the same Standing Orders as everyone else in the House.</P>
      <P>I join with colleagues in drawing attention to the horrific situation regarding disturbed children. There is no doubt that the problem is that the Department of Finance will not allow the Department of Health and Children to spend money in the area. The fundamental issue is that matters such as this are governed by the malevolent influence of the Department of Finance and the ideological clone who heads it politically. There are other areas of life where this issue arises.</P>
      <P>We all know that the telecommunications network is under great strain, both mobile and land line networks. The most fundamental infrastructural development we need is in telecommunications. It is the backbone of any e-commerce development and is one way we can divert development into the rest of the country and away from this overcrowded, overbuilt city which is choked with traffic. Despite that, the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill has been on the Order Paper for many months and the best the Leader can do is tell me when it is being introduced, which is a great deal of information. Why did the Government go to the trouble of placing a Bill of this importance on the Order Paper only to leave it there for eight months? I do not want to know when it will be introduced but why it has been delayed. It is the least the House can expect from the Leader.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach has conceded he was playing politics with the issues of immigration and refugees when he was in Australia.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to convey our congratulations to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, on his successful meeting with Commissioner Fischler on the conservation of the pelagic industry along the north European coast. He persuaded the Commissioner to look at the possibility of having observers on pelagic boats. Most of our fishing trawlers have been involved in conservation for a number of years. This move will improve the European fishing industry.</P>

      <P>I accept that. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to update us on the other matters he discussed yesterday with Commissioner Fischler.</P>
      <P>In view of the disturbing information emanating from the Saville inquiry after only three days, I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to advise us on whether Irish observers are present at the inquiry and to update us on the position. I read in today's newspaper that a solicitor, a partner of Rosemary Nelson, has been refused protection by the RUC. The Finucane family visited the Taoiseach recently and he is in favour of a separate inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Coogan's call for a debate on the local government Bill. When will the Minister for the Environment and Local Government publish the Bill? The local authority system is breaking down. Yesterday the Minister announced directives on toll roads and extra planning regulations. However, SPCs and county development strategy groups have not been put in place. The public is losing confidence in the Minister and the local government system because he has not introduced the local government Bill. Perhaps the House should have a debate on this pressing issue before the Bill is published.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello said they hoped a breakthrough would be achieved in the transport dispute. I hope that happens in hours rather than days. Everyone is working to ensure that workers get to and from their work. I congratulate taxi people who are working night and day to ensure that people get to work from 6 a.m. They may be getting a financial reward for it but their commitment is beyond the call of duty.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning proposed an amendment to the Order of Business which Senator O'Toole seconded. <i>The Irish Times</i> did not give a balanced report on the events here last week. The Minister came to the House yesterday evening and said that Waterways Ireland is a statutory body which became operative on 2 December 1999 and takes over responsibility for the navigation of the River Shannon on Saturday, 1 April 2000.</P>

We would be happy for the Leader to make that statement during the debate if he agrees to amend the <Col N="1363" /> Order of Business. He is abusing his position by having a debate on a subject which is not on the Order of Business. His attack on <i>The Irish Times</i> and on Jimmy Walsh is unfair. He is one of the most reliable, competent and honest reporters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 lists the people who are exempted from the terms of the Bill. It is very wide-ranging and broad. It exempts the entire family of an employer from the conditions of the Bill. This matter was very eloquently discussed by Senator Quinn during the Second Stage debate. He put very strong arguments for not treating members of a family different from other employees. The history of employment has shown that family members working in family businesses are very vulnerable to exploitation. We all know of very hard cases where members of a family, a brother, son or daughter or any of the categories mentioned have been subjected to exploitation in the past. Family members should be entitled to protection as citizens.</P>

    <P>One of the great benefits of this legislation is that it treats men and women equally. Traditionally women were the ones who suffered in that they were not paid as much as men for the same <Col N="1369" /> work. The minimum wage will now apply across the board. Likewise, this should apply across the board to men and women, irrespective of their relationship to the employer. Why should a blood relationship with the employer be a consideration in regard to people being left outside the terms of this legislation? </P>
    <P>I do not see any reason to include this section. The simplest thing to do would be to delete it. I do not know what lobbying was done by family businesses, whether anybody approached the Minister seeking the inclusion of a section of this nature or if the Minister has any statistics on the number of people affected by it but before she introduces an exemption of this nature from the benefits of the Bill, she should have all the information relevant to the people involved and the circumstances in which they may be affected and that the information is given to us before we give our approval to a provision of this nature. I suggest the Minister, even at this late stage, delete that section.</P>

      <P>While Senator Costello made a valid point, speaking as someone who grew up in a family business and who now works in it, the one thing about such a business is that family members may work for a rate less than other employees because it is part of their investment in the future of the business. It is important members of the family who manage and work in the business are left with a choice as to the rate of pay. If members of the family in management exploit those members working in the business, the National Minimum Wage Bill is not the instrument to stop that exploitation. I strongly suggest that the Minister does not consider deleting this important section.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. I, too, expressed my concern about the large number of people who were excluded. The Minister explained that under labour law it is usual to exclude family members. One must remember how easily people in a family can be exploited by other members. As I said, it will be women members of the family, in particular, who will be exploited. We are not saying they have to be paid a specific wage but the minimum wage. I suggest the Minister look at this again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank Senator Costello for raising this matter. I welcome the Bill but, in this particular case, I find myself almost acting in a manner which is against all my normal traditions. I, like Senator Cox, come from a family business and, therefore, I value greatly the benefits of the family business. It was mentioned yesterday that the growth in and the success story of the United States is the result of small, mainly family businesses. Therefore, we should do everything we can to encourage family businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I read what the Minister said on Report Stage in the Dáil and realised that this <Col N="1370" /> matter was debated there. I find myself on the side of the support there from the Socialist Party who made this same case. I make the case, however, from a different point of view and make two cases. I would like to see this Bill, when enacted, as solid good legislation. I am concerned about any legislation that goes through the Houses which perhaps has gaps. I would not be surprised if there were gaps in this legislation and if there was an objection to it in the future from the point of view of fairness.</P>
    <P>I gave an example on Second Stage of a bachelor running a business, a pub, shop, etc., in competition with a large family business. The bachelor suddenly finds the minimum wage legislation applies to him. I was stunned when I read the range of people to whom it does not apply &ndash; I think I counted 17. It includes the spouse, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepfather, stepmother, son, daughter, stepson, step daughter, grandson, grand-daughter, brother, sister, half brother and half sister. The list seemed to go on and on. I would not be surprised if there was a case to be made to the Competition Authority by that bachelor who could say it is unfair in business terms. That, however, is not the main point I wish to make.</P>
    <P>The fundamental flaw in this goes back to making an exception for such a wide range of employees who are members of the family. It goes back to the old concept which existed until the 1800s whereby people could own other people. I thought that when Abraham Lincoln, Wilberforce and the others got rid of slavery they got rid of that concept and that it would not come back. In recent years our eyes have been opened to what goes on in families, including physical and sexual abuse. We also know there has been exploitation in the past. While Senator Cox rightly made the case that family members may be underpaid because they have an investment in the future, I doubt if that stands up.</P>
    <P>In the majority of cases where family members are underpaid it is because it is cheap labour and they are bullied into this situation perhaps with promises that they will benefit at a future stage when the owner of the business passes on. When one looks at the range of people involved, one realises that this concept of someone owning someone else almost implies that because they own them, they can use them in their business and, therefore, they do not have to pay them even the minimum wage. The term I used yesterday in regard to spouses was &ldquo;chattels&rdquo;, a lovely old word. It treats people as things and that one can own things. This outdated idea of slavery that one can own people as well will almost be enforced in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look again at this section even at this late stage when the Bill has gone through the other House and is at a late stage in this House and cannot be easily to changed. We must put down a marker and say this is bad law and is not one we should enact. I imagine that a youngster, who is probably only 14 years of age <Col N="1371" /> now, may take this legislation to the High Court and say it is wrong and unfair and is almost akin to slavery. On that basis, I would not like to see a law being passed which will not stand up in the long term. I urge the Minister to rethink this section, recognise that it is too all embracing and find another method to overcome the problem of the family business which wants help in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I would hope no member of a family would be bullied and I know Senator Quinn would not do so because he is exemplary in his own business when it comes to his family. There is undoubtedly a large element of benefit-in-kind for a family member working a family business. This may only arise in extreme cases and I wonder if hard cases make bad law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose in this area, as in many others, it is not a black and white situation. There is, in life generally and at ministerial level when one is making decisions, a judgment call and a grey area, and this is one such area. If somebody does not pay a member of their family the minimum wage, they are committing a criminal offence and the criminal law would be intervening in what is essentially a family matter. The bachelor can have brothers, sisters, a mother or father in that it is not confined to married people and everybody has a family. I grew up in a family business on a farm where all the members of the family contributed and worked. At critical times everyone had to help out. I was fortunate to grow up in a happy family where I was under no duress. I accept there are situations where people can be exploited.</P>
      <P>This legislation is based on other labour legislation, including the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Organisation of Working Time Act, legislation on the protection of young persons, redundancy payments Acts and so on. We need to codify the law in respect of employment rights and other rights in labour law. The Attorney General is keen that we should codify all our laws so that one can pick up a book and read what the law is in a partiuclar area rather than having to check it from several sources. The sooner we do that in this area, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On balance and having taken advice, it is not desirable by way of criminal law to enter into what essentially is a family relationship. If we were to include family members, the law in this area would be unenforceable. I do not know how one could enforce it. Generally speaking, as Senator Cox said, family members are prepared, although perhaps not in 100% of cases, to help out at critical times, to work weekends, to work more than 48 hours a week, which is the maximum level stipulated in the Organisation of Working Time Act, to work bank holidays and not receive the additional premia that apply in other businesses for such work. They do that <Col N="1372" /> essentially because their working relationship is often based on the family relationship and perhaps on investment in the business.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, one of the major issues in family businesses has been a reluctance to take the necessary steps to broaden the capacity of those businesses. That is a separate agenda. Sometimes family businesses do not reach their potential because they remain family businesses and their members do not appreciate the wider potential of taking a different direction.</P>
    <P>On balance, these provisions do not fit into a black or white category. I could not put my hand on my heart and say that I could defend or oppose them vigorously. I would categorise them as a grey area.</P>
    <P>As Senator Quinn said, there are exceptions, but we should not exclude from what is normally a good practice a host of family members simply to provide for the exception. Even if we did that, I do not know how one could enforce the law in this area and make it a criminal offence for a person not to pay his or her sister or daughter the national minimum wage and how one could expect a sister or a daughter to give evidence in such a case.</P>
    <P>Other areas of the criminal law and cases where sexual or physical abuse has been perpetrated are a different category. We all know about the disturbing events that are coming to light. One cannot compare this situation with those unsavoury and unfortunate events. Therefore, I am not in a position to accede to Senator Costello's request.</P>
    <P>In relation to this Bill generally, many good ideas were put forward on Second and Committee Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas. I took on board a number of changes, of which the Senators are aware, because good arguments were made. I like to think I am open minded, but on balance in this regard I have decided in favour of retaining the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the moderate manner in which she handled this query. She said that on balance these provisions cannot be categorised as black or white but fit into a grey area. I like those words she used. While at first blush the provisions appear in order, perhaps we should make an exception in the case of this section. The more I think about it, the more I consider it will make bad law.</P>
      <P>I would not dare suggest there is a comparison between sexual and physical abuse and exploitation of family members in this area. When legislation on sexual and physical abuse was introduced, the case was probably made that it would be difficult to enforce in family situations. The Minister is making the same case when she says it would be difficult to enforce the law in this area. The fact that it would be difficult to enforce should not enable us to agree a section that would make bad law. On balance, I suggest this section would make bad law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similar provisions in other employment legis<Col N="1373" /> lation are also bad law. Such provisions regard people as chattels. The section almost provides that because family members are excluded from these provisions, it is in order to exploit them by underpaying them on the promise that in future they will become part owners of businesses. Similar promises were made to apprentices who lived upstairs in grocery shops for years. They were told to stick with the job and that one day they might become the manager. They were exploited.</P>
    <P>On balance, the Minister should delete this section. We should not provide for similar exceptions in other legislation as it is bad law and it will not stand up in the long term. On that basis, I support Senator Costello's urging that the Minister should consider deleting this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I support this legislation. The Minister said she had listened to good arguments in both Houses and that she was open minded, but she cannot be very open minded to accepting an amendment in this House, as there is no time for the Bill to be recommitted in the Dáil in respect of amendments made in the Seanad. While her mind may be open, time has not been provided for following the procedures to make changes to the Bill. The Minister might address why she came to this House at the eleventh hour to take this Stage of the Bill, thereby not giving an opportunity to introduce worthwhile amendments in respect of which the Bill could have been recommitted in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the legislation would be unenforceable in this area and that in terms of the section she has followed other legislative precedents. It is time to draw the line with various legislative precedents. Given that this legislation deals with a minimum enforceable wage, we should set the agenda rather than follow what might be questionable precedents.</P>
      <P>The wording of the section is bald in terms of the people who will be excluded from the provisions of the Bill. The relationship of the family members listed in the section with their employer, even though the employer is a family member, is a business one. As a business relationship it should be subject to the legislation. If, as a result of being treated in a family context, such family members stood to gain an interest in the business, the position might be different. The wording of the section is open and it affords no level of protection to the family members listed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators Quinn and Henry said, women are the most likely to be most exploited in family situations. The legislation has the benefit of being gender equitable in that every worker is entitled to the same minimum wage. It would be valuable if we could improve it by deleting this section or, if more time was available, tease it out by examining the difficulties experienced in family situations and inserting some level of protection for family members. Given that the wording of the <Col N="1374" /> section is bald, the only way we can address this matter is by deleting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for including it has been eloquently made by Senator Quinn and Senator Costello. While the Minister's analogy of the giving of evidence in sexual abuse cases cannot be in any way correlated with this matter, I remember when that legislation was being dealt with by the House and instances were outlined where children may have been required to give evidence against their fathers. However, it was necessary to provide protection in the most terrible cases. This legislation will only be needed in families where people are not getting anything. One frequently finds that people are not paid anything. There may be a family break up and people who worked in businesses for many years have nothing to show for all their effort.</P>
      <P>This is why I agree with Senator Quinn and Senator Costello that this section is the core area for ensuring protection is given to vulnerable people who are most likely to be paid very little, if anything. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Senator Cox are correct that people want to contribute to family businesses and that this can be good for the family and hopes for the future. However, at the same time, the Minister must be aware, as I am, of cases where people contributed for years but one family member came out on top and several others, usually women, did very poorly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if there is a happy situation where somebody is willing to work for less than £4.40 an hour, if family members are excluded, the employer will be breaking the law. One could say that it will not arise unless a complaint is made. Although a person was willing and agreeable to work under those circumstances at the time, if a complaint is made many months and years later, the person, in the context of another dispute, could decide to use the provisions of this legislation. As I said previously, it is not a black and white situation; it is a grey area.</P>
      <P>There is a need to consider some of these issues which have found their way into our labour law over a considerable period of time. This also applies to recent labour legislation, introduced by a different Government and different parties. The former Minister, Eithne Fitzgerald, introduced the Organisation of Working Time Act. I dealt with that legislation for my party at that time but I do not recall that this issue arose. However, I am sure it arose in the context of Committee Stage. I am sure the former Minister felt, as I do, that one would not go to the end of the world to defend it but, equally, I am not necessarily enthusiastic about changing it. It falls into a grey area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry is correct. It only becomes an issue where a complaint is made and somebody is <Col N="1375" /> being exploited. However, if the law states that everybody, including family members, must be paid £4.40 an hour, somebody who does not adhere to the law, even where a person is willing to work for less than that amount, is breaking it. The law does not provide that one can have private arrangements on the side. There may be an opt out for a year if one goes to the Labour Court, otherwise the law requires £4.40 an hour to be paid. One does not have the luxury of entering into a family arrangement. An employer who does so will break the law and commit a criminal offence. There is no escape route for the people most Senators would wish to protect.</P>
    <P>This aspect of the Bill and other legislation perhaps should be reviewed in the relatively near future in the context of some of the points that have been made and issues that have arisen. I have an open mind on that. As one takes legislation of this nature through the Houses of the Oireachtas, one hears arguments being forcefully made, particularly by people who are in business such as Senator Quinn. I accept Senator Cox has a different view but Senator Quinn is undoubtedly a pro-business person.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment did not reply to a question asked by Senator Costello. Senators who followed the legislation through the other House over a number of months are expressing a certain amount of frustration because there is a deadline on it. The Bill must be passed today and it is unlikely that amendments will be accepted. It is unlikely that we will do any more than rubber stamp it so there is a certain amount of frustration. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's comments are moderate and she said the issues should be reviewed on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She also mentioned a family member who is paid less than £4.40 an hour and promised that something will happen later. However, that also happens in non-family businesses. It can happen where a person is offered a job and is told that he or she will receive their reward in time. If an exception is to be made in that regard, exceptions in other areas should also be made. Those who opposed the idea of minimum wage legislation in the first place made that case, but it did not stand up. On balance, it should not stand up with regard to family members either. If it stands up in one area, it should stand in another also. The Tánaiste is hearing some of the frustration being experienced by Members who are talking about a Bill to which they are highly unlikely to effect <Col N="1376" /> any change and it is unlikely that she will accept amendments. Perhaps this frustration is evident in the comments of Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for not responding to that point and I also apologise to the House. I wish the situation was different and I regret that the Bill was not initiated in the Seanad. As Senators are aware, within a month of the Government taking office, the Minimum Wage Commission was established. I published its report in April 1998 and we agreed to implement the national hourly minimum wage. We then set about establishing an interdepartmental group to consider the issues which arose because it was not a case of simply introducing legislation. There was an ESRI impact study and the legislation was approved by the Cabinet in early December.</P>
      <P>The Bill could have been published then but the new round of negotiations was beginning at that time. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions felt strongly about the £4.40 rate the Government suggested should come into effect from 1 April. The rate is not provided for in the Bill because this is enabling legislation and that will be done by regulation. The initial rate is central to the debate. It was felt that a discussion should not start in the Oireachtas in the middle of pay negotiations, where this was a central issue. I said to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that if the employers and employees agreed to a higher rate than £4.40, I would not oppose it. In any event, they stuck with £4.40.</P>
      <P>Those negotiations were not concluded until the end of January and it was impossible to get dates in the other House. I wish I had initiated the legislation in the Seanad because, from a calendar point of view, we could have accepted amendments in both Houses. The agreement was, and we always said, that the minimum wage would be introduced from 1 April. The Government approved an earlier signature motion on Tuesday. Otherwise, the President would not be in a position to sign the Bill tomorrow. I apologise to the House because I strongly believe in parliamentary democracy. The Oireachtas should not be a rubber stamp for things that happen outside the Houses. However, as this formed a central part of the pay negotiations, it would have been very provocative to pursue a matter which we knew was central and important to workers and their representatives. This is why we ended up in a difficult situation.</P>
      <P>The other House took five hours more to deal with Committee Stage of this Bill than it did to deal with the Finance Bill although one could not compare the two in terms of complexity. However, the Members were probably making a point as well. I would have done so if I had been in Opposition. I understand the realities of politics. I apologise to the House because it is offensive. I wish the situation was different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is a desire on everybody's part <Col N="1377" /> to have the legislation introduced with effect from Saturday. As Senators are aware, the ESRI impact study suggests that 163,000 people will benefit. This appears to be an incredible number of people and in the greater Dublin area, it is probably impossible to find somebody, other than a home help, who is paid less than £4.40 an hour. Senator Ross takes the strong view that the market should always dictate in this situation, but I am not a free marketeer or an ideologue. If the market was perfect, there would be no need for regulation. I wish it was otherwise, but that is not the case. There is a need for regulation.</P>
    <P>If the market gave everybody a high wage, there would be no need for statutory minimum wage legislation. However, because the market does not do so, there is need to introduce this type of legislation to protect vulnerable categories of workers. Even the United States has minimum wage legislation, and has had it for a considerable number of years. Among the notices displayed by companies in the United States at the entrances to their places of business is a minimum wage notice which provides details on the rate of pay per hour they offer.</P>
    <P>We do not live in a perfect world and we do not have a perfect system of parliamentary democracy. I apologise again and I wish the position were different. It is my intention to initiate the next legislation with which I must deal, the company law enforcement Bill, in this House. I initiated the Cement Bill in this House and we have not yet had an opportunity to complete our deliberations on it in the Lower House. It seems that many months have passed since we discussed that Bill and repealed the existing and archaic legislation. Unfortunately, we have not had time to put the Bill through the Lower House.</P>
    <P>I hope to introduce and have enacted two items of legislation before the summer recess, namely, the company law enforcement Bill and the training Bill, and I hope to initiate the first of these in the Seanad. I am sure Senators will appreciate the difficulties I faced on this occasion and I hope they will accept my undertaking that the position will be reversed on the next occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's bona fides in relation to her commitment to parliamentary democracy are not in question. However, the fact remains that the Bill spent over two months in the Lower House while it will only spend two days in the Seanad and there is no possibility that it will be amended at this point. Instead of voting through a motion for earlier signature, would it not have been possible for the Seanad to continue its deliberations on the Bill past 1 April and its application could have been made retrospective? I cannot imagine that the President is anxious to spend Saturday signing Bills. I am sure she has other matters of national importance with which she must deal.</P>

      <P>If we had had the opportunity to tease out the legislation in the proper fashion, we might not have come to the conclusion that this section should be deleted. We might have suggested the introduction of certain protections for family members. That cannot be done now without a thorough teasing out of the implications. The Bill contains various caveats and conditions regarding those who will be affected by the Bill, how they will be affected and how its terms will apply.</P>
      <P>As stated earlier, the Minister's bald inclusion of a wide-ranging list of family members &ndash; these people will be treated not in terms of their being family members but in terms of their relationship to their employer &ndash; is not acceptable and the provision, if it is allowed to stand, will give rise to the exploitation of vulnerable people. We should have had the opportunity to deal with the legislation in a more flexible fashion and return it to the Lower House with amendments, if necessary. Would it not be possible to delay the early signature and apply the legislation retrospectively from 1 April?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the ideal way to proceed but, unfortunately, it is not constitutionally or legally possible to do so. I dealt with that matter on Committee and Report Stages in the Lower House. I wish to outline the contents of the written advice I received from the Attorney General's office in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General indicated why we could not make the legislation retrospective and further stated that such a burden would have to be justified on the overwhelming ground of the common good. He stated that the Supreme Court made it clear in the case of the Employment Equality Bill that the Government cannot simply pass on the costs of its social reforms to employers or indeed any section of the public. The Attorney General concluded that, in the absence of a compelling justification for such a measure it would appear that there would be considerable danger involved in making the minimum wage legislation retrospective and proceeded to state that he agreed with advice given orally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, making the legislation retrospective is not an option. I explored the possibility approximately one month ago because it appeared that we would not have completed our deliberations on the Bill. I took legal advice because that probably would have been the best <Col N="1379" /> case scenario, given the deadline involved. Unfortunately, it is not possible to make the Bill retrospective. If the Bill was not enacted by Saturday, the workers to whom it applies would not benefit <Col N="1380" /> until such time as it eventually came into force. I do not believe anyone would want that to happen.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment. Its effect would be to include as working time, time spent away from the place of work on stand-by at home or elsewhere. That is not reasonable. It would also include all forms of leave in the work place and various other absences. Time spent on stand-by at a place of work is included for the purposes of working hours. To deal with zero hour contract difficulties involving employees at home, they must be paid for at least 25% of their time when on stand-by at home, even if they are not called to work. It is reasonable to be paid the national hourly minimum wage if an employee is on stand-by at the place of work, but if employees are at home and are able to do all their other chores before being called to work that should not <Col N="1381" /> count for the purposes of computing the national hourly minimum wage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection 1(<i>a</i>), line 21, to delete &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 9(1)(<i>a</i>) provides that an employee &ldquo;shall keep a written record of his or her working hours&rdquo;. That is too onerous a responsibility to place on them. Many young employees are not very literate and they lack experience and skills. They can be careless and the imposition of a mandatory requirement to keep written records subject to a punishable sanction, a summary fine of £1,500, no matter how small the transgression, is to impose a very heavy responsibility backed up by a severe penalty. The substitution of &ldquo;may&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; seeks to alleviate the employee's responsibility in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept these amendments for a number of reasons. Of course this provision does not apply to all employees. It only applies to those employees who do not work in a controlled or supervised situation. In general, employees either clock-in or sign on or a supervisor or someone in charge verifies that they are at their place of work for the requisite number of hours. This provision covers employees who telework, work from home or work away from what would be normally regarded as a place of employment in the traditional sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employers have rights too and they must have a way to verify the hours worked by an employee. Originally the Bill contained the provision that a record of hours worked had to be produced within 72 hours. At the suggestion of the Opposition I deleted that and we included the words &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo;. That is a reasonable measure. There is always the assumption that employers rip people off. Honest employers must be able to verify hours worked and a written <Col N="1382" /> record is the only way they can establish that an employee is entitled to payment in respect of a particular number of hours. The hourly rate of £4.40 must be multiplied by whatever the figure is. I can see no other way around the verification process.</P>
    <P>As the Senator will know, the penalties only apply if a person knowingly gives false information or signs a false declaration. For example, a person might have worked only 50 hours but declare that they worked 100 hours. The penalties apply when a person is dishonest and knowingly does something wrong, not just for keeping a false record. The court must be satisfied that a person knowingly noted the wrong hours on verification documentation.</P>
    <P>I accept that many people in our society are illiterate and do not have basic reading and writing skills, but it could be argued that they would not know if they received £4.40 per hour because they do not know the value of a cheque or any payment they would get. If a person cannot do simple things like know how much they are paid or write down the figure 100 then they are unlikely to be in this type of working environment. The category of people Senator Costello talked about are unlikely to be in a teleworking environment or working away from a normal place of work. If such people did exist I have no doubt that family members or work colleagues would assist them when they need to file their verification records.</P>
    <P>This provision is reasonable. It protects employers and provides a means of verifying that hours were worked. It also provides some form of proof and would prevent someone from claiming a year later that they worked 100 hours the previous year who in reality worked 50 hours or claiming that they did not get the national minimum wage. If there was no provision for a verification document, or if it was voluntary and not mandatory, the employer would not be protected and they could not prove what was verified by the employee and that they paid them accordingly. If there is a dispute about it then the dispute will arise when the claim is being made and not many months later. After outlining all those circumstances I cannot accede to the Senator's amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 10, subsection (2), line 21, after <Col N="1383" />&ldquo;among&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, or between the Government and,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This technical amendment should be accepted on merit because it would improve the Bill. If it were accepted we could then refer it to the other House.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is sloppily drafted. Section 12(2) states: &ldquo;Where . . . . . there is . . .  a relevant agreement (&ldquo;national economic agreement&ldquo;) among economic and social interests in the State. . . . &rdquo;. We all know that you cannot make a national economic agreement among interests in the State. It can only be made with the Government and it can only be authorised by the Government. To present a national agreement in that sort of language is not anyone's definition of what has happened in relation to the social partnership. The social partnership which we have just concluded is one in which the Government has participated with the economic, trade union, business and farming interests. They have come together under the aegis of the Government to formulate a national economic agreement. To state that it is among economic and social interests in the State is incorrect. It is with the Government of the State.</P>
    <P>My amendment would put the record straight and provide for the current situation. Section 12(2) should read, &ldquo;Among or between the Government and economic and social interests in the State&rdquo; which would reflect the current statutory position. The Minister's provision is an inaccurate statement of the current situation. My amendment is a substantial technical amendment and it needs to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The State and the Government are not the same thing. There have been many debates here about the nation, the State and its people but I will not go into that. It is often assumed that what is in the interest of particular people is in the interest of the State or is of national interest but that is a false assumption. I can confirm that the phrase &ldquo;economic and social interests in the State&rdquo; includes the Government. I am not a lawyer, and neither is Senator Costello, but the parliamentary draftsman's office is quite certain that that is the case. In section 12(2) is states &ldquo;Where in the opinion of the Minister. . .  &ldquo; and the Minister is a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>Sometimes the law as drafted does not make a lot of sense to most of us, particularly in Ireland. It is simpler in many other jurisdictions and I wish it were so here. We had this debate on Committee Stage in the other House. The parliamentary draftsman is quite certain that this provision includes agreements made with the Government and that social and economic interests in the State also include the Government.</P>

      <P>This is another technical amendment. Section 12(3) is an another example of slipshod drafting. It states:</P>
      <P>If the Minister varies or rejects a recommendation under <i>subsection (2),</i> the Minister shall, as soon as practicable, make a statement to the Oireachtas giving his or her reasons for that variation or rejection.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not make statements to the Oireachtas. The Minister makes statements to the Houses of the Oireachtas or to one or other House of the Oireachtas. The Minister should not forget that the Oireachtas is composed of the Seanad, the Dáil and the Presidency. One does not go to the President with a recommendation of one sort or another every time a recommendation is varied or rejected. This is sloppy wording and the amendment should be returned to the other House.</P>

Perhaps I am wrong and the Minister may tell us this has been used for years and that &ldquo;to the Oireachtas&rdquo; means only one House. If so, I am still unhappy because it should refer to both Houses of the Oireachtas, otherwise a statement could be made in this House and the Lower House would hear nothing about it or <i>vice versa. </i>We may hear about it but only by chance. The Minister may say this is the way it has always been done, that it works and that legal advice has been received on it. There is a danger that one House could be left out.

      <P>I oppose this section because it refers to different rates of pay during the first two years of employment and on reaching the age of 18. My difficulty is that employment equality legislation provides that anybody between the ages of 18 and 65 should not be discriminated against in terms of employment, yet this is being done very specifically with the minimum wage. Under our legislation and Constitution people can vote at the age of 18 &ndash; they are considered to have reached full adulthood and should be treated accordingly. Unless this is acknowledged and we subscribe to the provisions of our employment equality legislation it is a form of exploitation of young people. I cannot see the need for the list of conditions and caveats in section 15 for those between the ages of 18 and 20 and the gradual introduction of the full minimum wage by the age of 20 is unnecessary. The Minister should disregard the section.</P>

      <P>The minimum wage commission recommended that for people in training there would be a three year run-in period of 75%, 80% and 90%. Our employment regulation order and the registered employment agreements made between parties recognise that experience counts for something. In the UK the minimum wage is not introduced until a person reaches the age of 22, although 18 year olds in the UK have the same rights as 18 year olds here. It is reasonable that there is a link with experience. One cannot say that someone who has considerable experience should earn the same wage as a new job entrant. In all the circumstances, what is being proposed is reasonable. Unfortunately, I cannot accept Senator Costello's amendment.</P>

      <P>On this occasion, for a change, I support the Minister and not Senator Costello. One of the major challenges which faces us as a nation, particularly with this legislation, is the danger of people being tempted not to complete their education or training. From that point of view the step the Minister has taken is to be congratulated. There can be serious problems for those who do not complete their education or training and are tempted to work at a young age. They are disadvantaged and it may be difficult for them to get out of the hard core of unemployment. Figures from the NESC report this week showed that we are not making great inroads into the hard core of long-term unemployment. Those people need to be protected by being encouraged to stay in education or training. From that point of view I support the Minister's stand on this.</P>

      <P>I realise what has been said and I agree that young people should remain in education and should be encouraged, supported and resourced to do so. My concern is that there would be a category of sub-minimum wage employment for those in their late teens, the 16 to 20 year olds, and that certain areas of, perhaps, the catering and fast food industries and some parts of the rag trade and so on would employ young people until they have to pay them a full minimum wage &ndash; there would be a turnover and these young people would be thrown back into the workplace without skills. There is a danger that some low skilled young people in their late teens could be exploited by what would be a new market in the sub-minimum wage payments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello seeks to move items from the reckonable to the non-reckonable pay components. As Senators are probably <Col N="1387" /> aware, I made a number of substantial amendments during the passage of the Bill through the other House. I took out four different items which were going to be included as reckonable pay. The Senator wants employers to provide board and lodgings and if they provide them as part of employment, it is reasonable that would be reckonable for the purposes of calculating the national minimum wage.</P>
      <P>Reasonable rates are being applied, particularly in the current environment in which we live. One can get board and lodgings in the region of £6.09 per day or £42 per week. It is not unreasonable that if an employer provides board and lodgings at £6.09 per day that £42 would be drawn from one's pay in the case of a full week. There are separate rates for board or lodgings only. These have been agreed in various joint labour committees or employment regulation orders as the rates that apply in the hotel and catering industry. The regulations specify that these rates would be applied generally where board and lodgings have been provided by an employer.</P>
      <P>In the other House, a Deputy raised the situation of a person who works in a hostel where they are provided with accommodation and asked if they would receive the national hourly minimum wage. The answer is yes, but if they are provided with board and lodgings, clearly that is reckonable. The rates for board and lodging are £6.09 per day or £42.63 per week, for board only it is £3.62 per day or £25.31 per week and for lodgings only it is £2.47 per day or £17.32 per week. Those are reasonable rates to deduct from the employee. If we do not allow for board and lodgings, those who are given them will no longer have them. That would be the consequence. There are not many people in Dublin or in any part of the country who could get board and lodgings for £42.63 per week, board only for £25.31 per week or lodgings for £17.32 per week, so that is reasonable.</P>
      <P>Other issues include a service charge paid through the payroll. Many employers choose to charge for service. It is generally the case but not always that, where more service is supplied, a service charge is applied to a bill and is included in the central payroll. It is a mandatory payment which customers must pay for the service. The employer pays it to the employees and it is part of the payroll cost. If people leave tips, whether on their credit cards or on the table, that is excluded from reckonable earnings. It is reasonable, given the practice which has built up in the catering industry, that the service charge would be included, as it is in many other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the shift premium, this is not a black and white area, but the shift premium is so much part and parcel of the rates of pay in so many sectors that it is not possible to exclude it at this point. There would be strong opposition from employers if we were to exclude it. This is one of <Col N="1388" /> the issues we could look at again when the monitoring committee examines the experience of this legislation. I have no doubt that, in time, it will probably move from reckonable to non-reckonable, but I am not in a position at present to accede to changing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The other major issue in this legislation is what are deemed to be reckonable and non-reckonable components. I know the Minister has made a number of concessions in the other House to various amendments tabled. However, questionable areas are still included as reckonable. There is also some confusion as to what is in each category. There seems to be an overlap in terms of what is allowed in each category.</P>
      <P>The shift premium is one of the major issues which needs to be addressed. The Minister said it might be examined again in future. Looking at the non-reckonable components, one area which is not reckonable is the unsocial hours premium. A shift by its nature brings about unsocial hours. Part of the reason for providing the additional premium for shift work is its unsocial nature. It is often around the clock, at odd hours and is not the normal nine to five or whatever. The premium is over and above the basic rate of pay.</P>
      <P>My view of the minimum wage is that it entails basic salary and that there is a reason for anything over and above that, such as bonuses, commissions, tips or premia. It is not a basic minimum. Shift work should not be a reckonable component because of the many issues involved, such as its unsocial nature and the family difficulties it causes. I listened to busmen during the week who are on little more than the minimum wage although they also earn a shift premium. They do shift work all the time and they spoke about having to work from 6 a.m. until midnight and working a number of shifts because their basic pay is terribly low and little more than the minimum rate and they need the shift rate and overtime.</P>
      <P>The piece rates, the incentive rates, commission and bonuses are additional to a basic rate. While they are productivity based, why should commission or bonuses be included in the context of a basic minimum rate? I do not understand. I can accept the fourth component &ndash; the monetary value of board and lodgings &ndash; because that can be substantial and is separate from and additional to a wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any service charge distributed to the employee through the payroll is subject to tax and PRSI and is included in that context. However, among the non-reckonable components is any amount distributed to the employee of tips or gratuities paid into a central fund managed by the employer and paid through the payroll. It is difficult to see what is the difference between the two. Once it goes into the central fund and is paid by the employer, it would be subject to the normal deductions in <Col N="1389" /> taxation. There is an element of confusion there. How does one distinguish and define &ldquo;service charge&rdquo; and not include tips or gratuities?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding productivity related payments, or piece and incentive rates as they are called, and commission and bonuses, which are productivity related, as Senator Costello may know, many people work from home in the textile industry, for example. Both employer and employee work at home and employees are paid per 50 jumpers or 100 tee shirts or whatever. The national minimum hourly rate must apply to those workers. Clearly, the employer and employee must transfer the productivity related manner in which they are paid at present into rates per hour. A specific number will have to be applied to each hour so that we are certain that each individual receives £4.40 per hour. There is no other way of doing it for that category of workers because they are not paid an hourly rate at present. They are paid on the basis of piecemeal, incentive or commission, as the case may be. If we did not include this provision as reckonable it could well be that workers in that category would have to do an enormous amount of work to earn the basic £4.40 national hourly minimum wage.</P>
      <P>Regarding the shift premium, as I said, this may move in time from reckonable to non-reckonable income. However, the Senator would be wrong to assume that all shift work involves night work. I know women in my constituency who work specific shifts to fit in with their family pattern and their children's requirements. That is the type of work they wish to do and they are paid accordingly. I accept some of the arguments the Senator makes about the premium, but I am not in a position to change it at present.</P>
      <P>The difference between tips and service charge is that tips are voluntary amounts of money which are left. One volunteers to leave a tip. The tradition of tipping is not great in Ireland. Speaking as someone who worked as a student in the United States for a number of years between 1971 and 1976, I lived for almost a year on the tips I made. I cannot remember how much I earned in regular pay, but it was minuscule and I was not that interested in it because it did not matter. The tips were where the big money was, as I thought then. I remember coming home in 1971 with £500 and I thought I was a millionaire because that was a great deal of money nearly 30 years ago. We do not have that tradition in Ireland, but it is improving. A tip is a voluntary amount of money one leaves on either one's credit card or on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some restaurants and employers in the hotel and catering industry &ndash; I am not certain it applies to any other sector &ndash; choose to impose service charges for the service they provide. One generally finds those restaurants have a high level of service, although it differs from place to place. <Col N="1390" /> Compulsory service charges are applied to generate a supplement towards the payment of staff. The staff in those cases are usually paid a lot better. Some people have argued that a tip should not be left if there is a compulsory service charge. Many people leave a tip on a voluntary basis, but a service charge is a formal way of payment in the hotel and catering sector. It is like a shift premium which I am not in a position to remove on this occasion. It may be an area we can review in the future depending on experience.</P>
    <P>There will be a monitoring committee which will closely monitor the Bill's impact in the first year of implementation. The Minister has power to make changes through regulation. We may make some changes. I have given an undertaking that the report of the monitoring committee will be laid in the Oireachtas Library and discussed if that is the wish of the Seanad or the other House. We will ensure that the House is kept well informed of what is happening at the monitoring committee so that people are aware of the impact of this legislation.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) refers to reckonable components and the fact that the Minister may, by regulation, add an item to or delete it from the Schedule.

      <P>This is a standard feature of legislation and it is done for practical reasons. As we know from the experience, it is not always easy to get Oireachtas time to make changes. Regulations can be annulled provided it is done within 21 sitting days of when they are made. Either House of the Oireachtas can initiate an annulment procedure. One can only make a fundamental change to the regulations after consultation with representatives of employers and employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a national agreement comes into effect, if there is a change or if it is felt desirable to move some of the reckonable matters into the non-reckonable category because of experience or new ways of coming to agreement between employees and employers, where it is agreed that these things should happen, then it is desirable to have a framework to make regulations without amending the primary legislation. There might be an agreement to move something from the reckonable to the non-reckonable category, but because of delays in the parliamentary timetable it might take a considerable length of time to put that into effect. If one simple change needs to be <Col N="1391" /> made to legislation, it is desirable not to have to introduce primary legislation but to use the regulation process.</P>
    <P>There are safeguards. The Minister has not been given a blank cheque. The power the Minister has been given can be overturned by the Oireachtas within 21 sitting days of the regulation being made. That is reasonable in all the circumstances.</P>

      <P>If an inspector has to carry out an investigation, it is reasonable that he or she should be able to look at the records over a three year period. If an employee made a complaint and a court action followed, it would be important to have the records. I understand this is a normal feature of employment rights legislation. Three years is probably too short rather than too long. Bank records are kept for longer periods, as we discovered recently. The keeping of records is becoming a feature of what is required of employers. There was a reluctance in some sectors to keep any records, to levy PRSI or to pay appropriate taxes. It is not an onerous burden on employers to keep basic records for a three year period. It is a reasonable provision.</P>

The purpose of subsection (2) is to avoid imposing on an employer who pays an employee well in excess of the national minimum hourly rate of pay an obligation to undertake an unnecessary regulatory burden. There is a reasonable cut-off point in the subsection whereby employees who are being paid up to 150% of the national minimum hourly rate of pay may not request a written statement from their employers. If the amendment were accepted, employers would have to provide a written statement on a request from workers who are paid well in excess of the national minimum hourly rate of pay. The purpose of such a wide-ranging obligation on all employers, almost 90% of whom are paying well above the national minimum wage, would not be consistent with the enforcement provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 16, lines 14 to 32, to delete subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is along the same lines. There is much red tape and procedural gobbledegook in the Bill. The legislation could have been a fraction of its size and I do not know from where all these caveats are coming. This section refers to a <Col N="1393" /> rights commissioner and states that a dispute cannot be referred unless an employee has done certain things. I do not see the need for all the paperwork required of an employee. If a dispute takes place it is obvious that one would have to go through all of the procedures. There is an entitlement to a rights commissioner and that is it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to delete section 24(2). Paragraph 24(2)(<i>a</i>) provides that a dispute may not be referred to or dealt with by a rights commissioner unless the employee has sought a written statement from the employer under section 23 and has obtained such a statement for the four weeks before the issuing of such a statement by the employer has elapsed.</P>
      <P>This provision is intended to prevent disputes which are not soundly based on the facts of the case from being referred to a rights commissioner. The obligation on an employee to comply with section 23, prior to referring a dispute to a rights commissioner, is considered reasonable by virtue of the purpose of section 23 which is, first, that the process should help to identify any underpayment of the employee's minimum entitlement and any such underpayment may then be paid by the employer on recognising and realising the underpayment. Second, the employee can make an informed judgment before referring a dispute to a rights commissioner. It is a two way process.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) also provides that the time limit for the referral of a dispute to a rights commissioner is to be within six months from the date the employee obtained the statement under section 23, or within six months from the latest date the statement was required to be issued to the employee by the employer under that section. The time limit may be extended to within 12 months at the discretion of the rights commissioner, depending on the circumstances of the case. This time limit is in keeping with other employment rights legislation, the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, being the most recent.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) is designed to avoid double jeopardy so that an employer is not subject to a rights commissioner investigation if they are, or have been, the subject of an investigation by an inspector under section 33 in relation to the same alleged underpayment of the employee's entitlement to remuneration in accordance with the Bill, or is being, or has been, prosecuted for an offence under section 34 in relation to the same alleged underpayment in accordance with the Bill.</P>
      <P>Such double jeopardy would be wasteful of the resources applied to detect breaches of the Bill. The choice is left to the employee to decide which method to use to refer a case to a rights commissioner or a complaint to an inspector if he or she believes that his or her employer has not paid the minimum payment required under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> Once the employee decides to pursue one route, the other route is closed to investigate the same alleged underpayment. We are giving employees an option which is not normally available. The legislation is very tight and the parameters and criteria are strict. One gets an option which one exercises. There is no dual option. There are two routes and choosing one means the other is not available. That is fair.</P>

      <P>This issue relates to the powers of the Labour Court in the giving of evidence. A similar provision in the Employment Equality Bill, 1997, was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. That is why I wonder about the constitutionality of the provision in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to delete section 28(5). The purpose of subsection (5) is to avoid the necessity of an officer of the Labour Court attending a court hearing to confirm factual information which can be provided by a written statement signed by the chairperson of the Labour Court. A similar provision is included in section 30 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, and in section 12 of the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>Legal advice has been sought and confirms that the provision is constitutional. The Supreme Court judgment in the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, does not reflect on this type of evidence which is of a factual nature, that is, that a person is required to attend a Labour Court hearing on a certain date, that a Labour Court hearing was held on that date and that the person did not attend, or, having attended, refused to give evidence. We are talking about a situation where factual information is being provided to the court and it is unnecessary for the legislation to make it mandatory for an officer of the court to attend when the information can be confirmed by the chairperson of the Labour Court, the highest officer of the court. There is no room for omission, discrimination or unfairness. All the information would be available and confirmed.</P>

      <P>This section concerns the institution of civil proceedings but I am concerned by the provision that &ldquo;the Minister may, in his or her absolute discretion, institute or refrain from instituting civil proceedings in the name of the employee&rdquo;. This again raises the issue of a Minister taking total responsibility and absolute discretion upon himself or herself. We thought we had done away with this kind of provision in favour of a Minister engaging in some kind of consultation. This provision smacks of absolute power corrupting absolutely. The Minister wants to be in complete control. Surely the Minister should consult about the matter. Would not be better to say &ldquo;the Minister may institute or refrain from instituting&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The section ensures the Minister has the choice to institute or not to institute civil legal proceedings in the name of an employee for the recovery of underpayments. Senator Costello, in agreeing the clause &ldquo;the Minister may institute&rdquo; seems to accept this point. The parliamentary draftsman has stated that to avoid any legal doubt, it is proper to include the phrase &ldquo;in his or her absolute discretion&rdquo;. From a democratic, constitutional and parliamentary point of view, it is very important to place the onus on the Minister of the day to take a decision and, therefore, absolute discretion rests with the Minister of the day rather than with the officer, Department, division or section which will deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>This provision allows the Oireachtas to question the Minister on an issue and to play a key role by doing so as distinct from a situation where, if absolute discretion was not available, it would be presumed that the officials acting on behalf of the Minister were using discretion without the Minister's knowledge.</P>

Section 47 (<i>a</i>)(ii) is merely a technical drafting matter to allow subparagraphs (12) and (13) to be inserted into section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984.

      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, your staff and this House for the tremendous co-operation in passing this historic legislation. In particular, I thank Senators Cox, Costello, Coghlan and Quinn and all others for their contributions to the debate.</P>
      <P>We would have liked to provide more time for discussion on this Bill, although it has been well debated. I would like to pay a special tribute to the officials of my Department who worked diligently and assiduously on this legislation with the Minister. I also thank the National Minimum Wage Commission and the many organisations who participated in the intensive consultative process which led to the introduction of this Bill &ndash; partnership in action aptly describes this process.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a balanced measure which achieves its objective of protecting vulnerable workers from exploitation but also ensures that the price for that protection is not job losses. It will result in tens of thousands of workers, particularly vulnerable groups such as women and young people, getting a pay rise which reflects our concern that they share in the economic benefits achieved over the past few years. The Government is honouring fully its commitment to introduce a national minimum wage. It marks an important step in recognising the contribution of the low paid to our economic development which combined with the tax adjustments coming into effect next week shows this Government's determination to not alone have a modern economy but to also have a caring society.</P>
      <P>This is an historic day which is a tribute to all those who have participated in enacting the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from the group Parents of Twins in Ireland and wish to draw the Minister's attention to the anomalies in the current payments for multiple births. A 100% increase in child benefit per child plus extra money for a third child brings the total amount to £230 per month. Parents with triplets have received double payments since 1965. Payments made to parents with twins have never equalised with that paid for triplets. The current monthly payment for twins, which is a multiple birth, is £103.50. Up to September 1998 twins were treated as two single births for child benefit purposes, something which I, as a mother, could never understand.</P>
      <P>Following a lengthy campaign by the Parents of Twins in Ireland group, a 50% extra increase for each twin was introduced in September 1998. When broken down that means that the twins of a triple birth receive child benefit payment at the rate of £138, a 100% extra payment for each child while twins receive benefit at the rate of £103.50, a 50% extra increase for each child. There is a difference of £34.50 for children who fall into the same category, which obviously refers to twins as a multiple birth and not two single births.</P>
      <P>The Parents of Twins in Ireland group describe this as blatant discrimination and feel that whether the birth consists of two, three or four babies, they are all multiple births and should be treated as such. They have been campaigning for the past ten years to have twins recognised as a multiple birth for child benefit purposes. It has been put to me that the only reason for not acceding to the request for equality of payments has been a lack of resources. I suggest that lack of resources no longer exists.</P>
      <P>In the interests of equality and social inclusion, I call on the Minister to equalise these payments in future legislation. The difference cannot be justified any longer. I put this case on behalf of parents with twins who have a very worthy case. I am anxious that the Minister accedes to their request and await his reply with interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ridge <Col N="1401" /> for raising this issue which I expected might have been raised during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill. I am pleased to have this opportunity to outline the supports provided to families under the child benefit scheme and, specifically, to address the question of the supports to families with twins and to families with multiple births of three or more children.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is currently payable in respect of all children up to age 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to 19 years of age who are in full-time education or who have a physical or mental disability.</P>
      <P>Prior to this Government coming into office, the position in relation to twins and multiple births of three or more children was as follows. Child benefit was payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children were born together. A birth grant of £300 was also payable in respect of triplets and a birth grant of £400 was payable in respect of quadruplets or more. Child benefit was payable at the normal rate in respect of twins. A special grant of £500 was also payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.</P>
      <P>Prior to the last election, a commitment was given by Fianna Fáil to increase the level of child benefit payable in respect of twins. This commitment was set out in a document produced by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods. In my first year in office I fulfilled that commitment when I introduced changes to the Social Welfare Acts to provide that the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins should now be set at 150% of the normal child benefit rate. This measure came into effect in September 1998 at a full year cost of £4.8 million.</P>
      <P>The organisation to which the Senator referred wrote to me in October 1997 asking me to fulfil the solemn commitment given by my party prior to the last election in its election manifesto, that is, to increase child benefit for twins by 50%. In December of that year, we fulfilled the commitment in the budget, which ultimately came into effect of September 1998. I have fulfilled the commitment prior to the election. I suppose eaten bread is soon forgotten and people are coming back, which I fully accept.</P>
      <P>I also decided to extend the £500 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, to include families with multiple births of three or more children. These improvements in the level of supports provided under child benefit schemes to families with twins and families with multiple births of three or more children are very significant in their own right. They must also be viewed, however, in the context of the very substantial improvements to the scheme generally in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> The 1999 budget, for example, provided for an additional investment in the child benefit scheme of over £40 million in a full year. From September 1999, the basic rates of child benefit were increased by £3 in respect of the first two children and £4 in respect of the third and subsequent child, bringing the rates up to £34.50 and £46.00 respectively.</P>
    <P>The 2000 budget provides for a full year investment of almost £106 million, an increase of £40 million on the previous year, with the lower rate set to increase by £8 per month and the higher rate by £10 per month with effect from September of this year. As a result, total investment in the child benefit scheme is being increased to £575 million per annum. These improvements will benefit all families with children, including families with twins.</P>
    <P>I am deeply committed to the continued development of the child benefit scheme for the benefit of all of the nation's children. Indeed, this is echoed in the agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness agreed with the social partners, which commits the Government to further substantial increases in the level of payments under the child benefit scheme, with a priority focus towards £100 per month for third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the question of introducing additional special measures to enhance the position of twins within the child benefit scheme will continue to be borne in mind. That much having being said, however, I emphasise that the fulfilment of these wider commitments under the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will be central to the future development of the child benefit scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for accepting this matter, the implications of which I know you understand. I also welcome the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. The matter calls for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to retain the ban on below cost selling in the grocery trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ban to which I refer is the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, which places a ban on below cost selling in the grocery trade. I understand the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will shortly receive a report from the Competition and Mergers Review Group which will recommend that the ban on below cost selling in the grocery trade should end. The review group has come to this conclusion without an in-depth study of the issues involved and without meeting representatives of retailers, suppliers or consumer groups. The review group was unable to show any adverse effect of the ban on below cost selling. Food prices have been less than the rate of inflation since the ban was intro<Col N="1403" /> duced in 1987. Retailers and suppliers are convinced that the ban on below cost selling has a significant beneficial effect.</P>
    <P>Unlike the Republic of Ireland, there has been no ban on below cost selling in Northern Ireland or in Britain. The lack of a ban on below cost selling has not resulted in cheaper prices for consumers. In Britain, it has been calculated that 42% of villages have no grocery shop. Imagine that situation in this country. It brought about a reduction in the number of competitors and, therefore, increased concentration in the market. This, in turn, brought about the need for an in-depth study of the supermarket trade.</P>
    <P>Recently, the UK Competition Commission has been examining the supermarket trade there. The commission announced it was considering a ban on below cost selling as one of a number of possible remedies to practices in the trade. A ban on below cost selling exists in Germany, France, Portugal, Belgium and in many other countries.</P>
    <P>In general, the opposition to the ban on below cost selling comes from economic theorists. The arguments put forward by some academics have been found to be flawed. Nearly all the participants in the grocery trade favour the retention of the ban. Some multiples consider it would advantageous for them to have the ban removed, and we know the reason. Consumer interests have not asked for the ban to be removed and the Director of Consumer Affairs has not found it anti-competitive or anti-consumer. It has not restricted entry to the market, as evidence by the arrival of Tesco, Iceland, Aldi, Lidl and perhaps Walmart. All of those have found that they can enter the market here.</P>
    <P>If the ban on below cost selling is removed, many independent retailers will cease to trade. This will bring about a reduction in the number of competitors in the market and, therefore, a reduction in competition. Suppliers will lose competitiveness because of below cost selling and they will face increasing buying power from a small number of multiples retailers. The removal of the ban in the grocery trade will have adverse consequences for off-licences, clothing, gardening, hardware, newsagents, toys, the sale of toiletries and other retailers. Consumers will suffer because of less competition and fewer choices of outlets. The closure of shops will have adverse social consequences.</P>
    <P>The ban on below cost selling has been in place since 1988 and no adverse effects have been found by those opposed to it. The ban is pro-competition and pro-consumer. I understand the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business has unanimously decided that the ban on below cost selling should be retained and we should heed that.</P>
    <P>I did a small survey in my constituency. From my investigation of the trade, I have come to the <Col N="1404" /> conclusion that 1,000 jobs are at risk in the constituency of Longford-Roscommon. It has been pointed out to me that in the five towns of Ballaghaderreen, Boyle, Castlerea, Roscommon and Carrick-on-Shannon 400 jobs are at stake. These are examples of what can happen in our towns and villages.</P>
    <P>I mentioned towns in only two counties. The lifting of the ban would have an enormous impact on the midlands, the west and on rural areas generally. If the ban was repealed, it would lead to the closure of local shops. It would have a disastrous effect on local suppliers and a serious adverse impact on local employment. The crunch would be that suppliers of local shops would also go out of business. In many cases the suppliers' businesses developed through the agricultural industry or through off farm employment. For many years the Government and the European Union encouraged farmers to avail of alternative employment opportunities. Many have done so and many of those suppliers are in business as a result of grants provided through various boards. If the ban on below cost selling was removed and the multinationals move in and effectively put the local shops out of business, the small suppliers will also go out of business.</P>
    <P>Customers would not gain significantly from the removal of the ban. If it was removed and the competition from local shops wiped out, the price of goods in the large multiples would increase. It is a case of the old story, put one's competitor out of business and then increase one's prices. The opposite cannot happen.  I do not understand why it is necessary to repeal the ban. During the time it has been in place, many multinationals have located here. If it was removed, they would cut their prices to a level which effectively would put local shops out of business and once that happens they would be able to dictate prices to their advantage.</P>
    <P>Many local shops have invested heavily in their premises. They have increased employment and provide a service second to none. It would be a poor day for this country if we enacted legislation or introduced a regulation that would favour multinationals and disown and exclude the people who provided a service to families in towns and villages down through the years. I recommend that the ban remains in place. That would be in the best interest of the independent grocery trade. The knock on effect of the removal of the ban would have far reaching repercussions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This is the hottest political issue that has come up for debate in either House of the Oireachtas this year and it will prove to be that before the year is out. This is only the start of that debate. The number of representations, letters and telephone calls I received on this matter during the past week is unbelievable. I understand that other Members of the Oireachtas and local representa<Col N="1405" /> tives have also been inundated with representations. This is the start of a campaign and it is one of which we should take cognisance. We should take note of what is happening across Europe in this area. We should not listen to what members of the Competition Authority or the mergers authority say on this issue, but consider what is in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on the subject raised by the Senator. I apologise that neither the Minister nor Minister of State is present to take this matter and I do so on their behalf. I also have been lobbied on this matter in my constituency. I have spoken to the Minister on it and given her the views of the constituents whom I represent in this respect.</P>
      <P>The ban on below lost selling is contained in the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, generally known as the groceries order. The order was made following the submission of a report by the then Restrictive Practices Commission, which had made certain recommendations pertaining to the elimination of restrictive practices and the establishment of fair trading rules in the groceries sector.</P>
      <P>This sector has been the subject of Restrictive Practices Orders since 1956. Previous orders regulating the sector were made in 1956, 1958, 1973 and 1981. Each of these orders was designed to regulate practices emerging in the sector which could be regarded as restrictive, anti-competitive or unfair.</P>
      <P>Enforcement of the order is the responsibility of the Director of Consumer Affairs. The order covers all grocery goods as well as intoxicating liquor and other household goods ordinarily sold in grocery shops. However, certain items &ndash; fresh fruit and vegetables, fresh and frozen meat and fish &ndash; are exempted from the below cost selling prohibition in the order.</P>
      <P>The order prohibits below cost selling, &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money, resale price maintenance and discriminatory treatment by suppliers. It also requires suppliers to publish the terms on which they are prepared to trade and requires retailers to comply with the published terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The groceries order is the only remnant of the corpus of restrictive practices legislation. All other orders under that legislation were repealed by the Competition Act, 1991. The intention was that the Competition Act would be the sole mechanism for tackling anti-competitive practices in all areas of the economy. When the possible repeal of the groceries order, along with other restrictive practices orders, was being considered, supporters of the order argued that, whereas the Director of Consumer Affairs enforced the order, the Competition Act made no provision for a public authority to enforce its provisions. Accordingly, a person adversely affected by a breach of competition legislation would be forced to initiate <Col N="1406" /> a private legal action to seek a remedy. This deficiency was remedied by the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, which provided for public enforcement of competition legislation by the Competition Authority and created the position of Director of Competition Enforcement to carry out investigations in respect to complaints or on his or her initiative.</P>
    <P>It seems to have been recognised that the retention of this one remnant of the restrictive practices legislation was something of an anomaly as the decision to do so was made subject to an ongoing review. Twice, in 1993 and 1995, the then Minister decided to continue the order in force but to maintain the review. In September 1996 the then Minister established the Competition and Mergers Review Group, under the chairmanship of Michael Collins, SC., to carry out a wide ranging review of the law on competition and mergers and it was decided to include a review of the groceries order in the group's terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The review group carried out extensive inquiries into the order in the course of which they retained DKM Consultants to carry out a study of the order and its effects. Last December, the group published a discussion document Proposals for Discussion in relation to the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 which contained a detailed analysis of the issues and suggested tentative conclusions. Submissions were invited from interested parties.</P>
    <P>The review group submitted its final report to the Minister earlier this month. The report contains 40 recommendations relating to competition and mergers law, certain recommendations of the Newspaper Commission and the groceries order. In relation to the groceries order, the group recommended that the groceries order be repealed; any legislation or regulation introduced in relation to the grocery trade should not include a ban on below cost selling; and some form of regulation should be introduced in relation to the grocery trade which would require retailers, in particular, to publish the terms on which they are prepared to trade with retailers, require retailers to honour the credit terms on which suppliers are prepared to trade with them, ban &ldquo;hello&rdquo; money and require retailers not to discriminate between classes of customers in respect of the products they sell.</P>
    <P>In effect, the group recommended that the prohibition on below cost selling should be repealed but that other aspects of the groceries order be retained. The recommended prohibition on retailers discriminating between classes of customers would be a new provision, the apparent purpose of which would be to enable small retailers to obtain supplies of a heavily discounted item from a multiple where the discounted price is lower than the price for which <Col N="1407" /> those retailers can obtain the same item from their regular suppliers.</P>
    <P>The Minister is currently examining the report and will indicate her response to the recommendations in due course. The groceries order raises complex issues and there is considerable debate among experts and interested parties as to its impact and effects. The Minister proposes to examine the report more fully and to make <Col N="1408" /> further comments on this matter within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Finneran for raising this issue for debate and his interesting contribution will provide a valuable input to the Minister's consideration of this matter.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 2.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 4 April 2000.</P>
