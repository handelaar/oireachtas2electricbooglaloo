      <P>I have notice from Senator Glynn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide the finance to install a sewerage scheme to serve the Robinstown area of Mullingar, County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 18, motion No. 19. No. 2, motion re the European Refugee Fund, is to be taken without debate and No. 3, Committee and Remaining Stages of the Electronic Commerce Bill, 2000, is to be taken today with business to be interrupted from 1 to 2 p.m. No. 4 is Second Stage of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill, 2000, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and all other contributions not to exceed 15 minutes. Item 18, motion No. 19, is to be taken from 6 to 8 p.m. and business is to be resumed thereafter if not previously concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is fine as far as I am concerned. I asked the Leader last week if the Government had any definite proposals to change the laws on libel and defamation. This has been mentioned by a number of Government Ministers as being part of the programme and the Leader was to come back to me with information. If he does not have that information today, can he inform me tomorrow of any proposals the Government may have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also seek a debate on the economy after the recess, as clearly there are certain warning signals at the moment such as the rate of inflation and other factors. It would be a tragedy if the delicate balance of forces which sustain the current economic boom were to be disrupted in any way and <Col N="102" /> it is important we have a full debate on the economy soon after the Easter recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning. It is very important we have a debate on the economy. I do not want to steal Senator Quinn's thunder, as he has been harping on about inflation for some time, and rightly so. There is a real danger with inflation in the economy and we are hearing nothing but soothing excuses from the Government on the issue. I would like more concrete reasons given in a debate.</P>
      <P>The Order of Business is a shambles. Yesterday afternoon Senator Norris proposed a sos coming up to 2 p.m. so that there could be talks between the parties about the Trinity Bill and some agreement could be reached. The Chair ruled him out of order on that issue and Senator Norris was suspended for proposing such a sos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris was suspended for not obeying the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair ruled the sos out of order. Subsequently, Senator Manning proposed a sos and it was allowed. It seems that this Bill has caused a great number of inconsistencies, not just in the rulings of this House but also&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to debate my ruling of yesterday, but I am not going to allow discussion in the House on it either. Senator Norris was disorderly and was called on to resume his seat. He refused to do so and had already made his contribution on Report Stage. The mover of the amendments was exercising his right to reply and I had no option but to act as I did. I will not debate the matter any further and I request Senator Ross not to debate it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsequently Senator Manning's request for a sos was in order, for some reason which I find difficult to understand. That is as may be. I understood when we got that sos that there would be a debate on the Bill today at 10.30. That was the understanding and that was the condition. That was the assurance the Leader gave us. What is going on? It has disappeared. Some of us who represent Dublin University are tired of this Bill being treated as a political football by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil between them. Dublin University is a great university&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross, the matter to which you are referring is item 1 on the Order Paper. It is a matter for the Leader of the House each morning on the Order of Business to propose business for the day. He has done so this morning. It is a matter for you if you are not happy with the Order of Business either to propose an amendment to the Order of Business, as proposed by the Leader of the House, or to vote <Col N="103" /> against it. I will not allow a long contribution such as this on the Order of Business. It is not in order to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There is unfinished business from yesterday and we were given an assurance by the Leader of the House that this would be debated today. He ignored this when proposing the Order of Business, without giving an explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>During yesterday's debate, Senator Dardis accused the authorities in Trinity College Dublin of malpractice. A Chathaoirligh, I want your ruling on whether &ldquo;malpractice&rdquo; is a word allowed in this House. Is it allowed to accuse people who are not Members of this House of malpractice or should Senator Dardis withdraw that allegation? Malpractice implies illegality, not just bad practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross, all my rulings on matters are made in the context in which they are raised. I will not make any comment on the question you have raised with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Malpractice is an implication of illegality by Senator Dardis towards the authorities of Trinity College, Dublin. Malpractice is an unacceptable word to this House because it implies illegality. It is important that Dublin University and other universities are not used as political footballs. For a long time we on these benches have objected to Dublin University having political nominees on its board, particularly in the debate on the Universities Act &ndash; as did Senator Dardis. However, it now appears it is perfectly acceptable for Senator Dardis's party&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House adjourned I raised the issue of the shambles this Order of Business is because of the Trinity Bill and the way the Dublin university is being treated. I also raised the issue that a private Bill had gone through a committee with recommendations and has now come to this House, but different amendments not agreed between the parties have now been proposed. It is unacceptable that a private Bill should be the subject of a political deal between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil.</P>

If he wishes to propose an amendment to the Order of Business, I ask him to do so or if there is any question he wishes to put to the Leader of the House on the Order of Business, I ask him to do so now. His contribution on the Order of Business should be relevant to today's Order of Business.

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the decision yesterday on the Trinity College Bill. My understanding is that the business we were dealing with yesterday was to be deferred until this morning, that it would be raised on the Order of Business and dealt with in that fashion. The Leader of the House, unfortunately, has chosen not to refer to it on the Order of Business but he should do so in line with what was decided yesterday. Perhaps we should give him the opportunity now to explain to us what he proposes to do. It is my contention&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello, the Order of Business will proceed in the normal way. When Senators who are offering on the Order of Business have raised their questions with the Leader of the House, the Leader will be called on to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely referring to the accuracy of what happened yesterday and what should have been on the Order of Business today. In that context and in relation to future legislation, I hope this is the last time private Bills of this or any other nature will come before this House. It is anti-democratic to introduce legislation in respect of which not all Members may contribute. What is the sense in having two Houses if neither can deal with legislation of this sort in a proper fashion?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the economy. Considerable difficulties have arisen as a result of the pressure being placed on the economy due to the housing crisis, the crisis in the health service and, a matter which many Members have highlighted in recent months, the worsening position in respect of inflation. Despite the Minister for Finance's glib remarks, our inflation rate of 5% is two and a half times the European average and the European Central Bank and the European Commission have warned the Government to get its house in order. It is time we considered this issue and investigated the effect the Minister's inflationary budget has had in terms of the low increases provided to widows, low income earners and others and the way it has endangered the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I request an urgent debate on transport, given that the Minister has made proposals to Cabinet in respect of the dismemberment of CIE and Dublin Bus, which has always been deprived of and denied a subsidy. It will now be open to private sector companies to apply for the new improved subsidies which will be supplied by the Government. The Minister's actions represent an attempt to deflect attention from the real transportation crisis which is affecting the city of Dublin. There is a need for an urgent debate on this <Col N="109" /> matter as soon as the House resumes its work after Easter.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on international war crimes? It is numbing when one considers that since 1945 an estimated 170 million people have been killed in armed conflicts and no one has been held criminally accountable for their deaths. There are those who ask how people can perpetrate such atrocities against fellow human beings and how this cycle of cruelty and barbarity can be allowed to continue. The only answer is that people know they will not be held accountable for their actions. I support Amnesty International's call for the establishment of a permanent international criminal court. The setting up of such a court is long overdue.</P>

      <P>I wish to object in the strongest way possible to the way we are being treated in respect of the Trinity Bill. I cannot understand the attitude adopted by the Government parties to the Bill. Tony Blair is meeting the Taoiseach in Dublin today. A number of Members represent people who have a vote in Northern Ireland or in other parts of the United Kingdom and I have already received telephone calls from individuals who want to know what the Government is trying to do in respect of Trinity College.</P>
      <P>I recall the former Minister of Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, being given a great deal of abuse by some of those who are now on the other side of the House when she introduced this legislation. It was stated that she was trying to interfere with the autonomy of Trinity College. Now, however, the Progressive Democrats have accused the college of malpractice and suggested that the ruling of the visitors is not correct. In 1995, the Progressive Democrats argued that Trinity College should be autonomous and that it should be protected&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek an explanation regarding the reason the college is being treated in this way. One of the Government parties previously stated that the college should retain its autonomy, particularly in view of the fact that it represents a constituency of people who live outside the <Col N="110" /> State. The college has made a huge effort in terms of what its president has described as &ldquo;bridge building&rdquo;. What is the Government trying to do to Trinity College?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to state that the progress of the Bill depends utterly on the availability of the Leas-Chathaoirleach to be present to conduct the Bill through the House. The Leas-Chathaoirleach, although he does not intervene in the debate, is charged with doing the job which would normally be done by a Minister.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Health and Children our concerns in relation to the lack of implementation of agreements reached with certain nursing grades? These agreements have not been honoured and this has caused a certain amount of stress. Will he also ask the Minister to settle, as soon as possible, the impending dispute by junior doctors in respect of the long hours they are obliged to work? These matters must be dealt with before industrial action is taken.</P>

      <P>I wish to call again for a debate on the provision of bilingual signs by local authorities and developers. There seems to be a practice, particularly on the part of developers, to provide signs which only give the English version of the names of housing estates. There is a need to regulate this area and introduce a policy in respect of the provision of bilingual signs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous occasion I called for a debate on the implementation of the Noxious Weeds Act. <Col N="111" /> Will the Leader invite the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to come before the House to debate the application and enforcement of the Act? There was a time when the Act was rigidly enforced but it appears to have fallen by the wayside. Some farmers are good at cutting back noxious weeds and there is no need to remind them of the dangers of ragwort.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Manning's request for a debate on the economy. It is frightening to realise that Ireland is top of the European inflation league table with a rate of 4.6% and climbing. This has completely eroded the position in society of the elderly, the people to whom we owe a great deal. These individuals are already badly treated and the ESRI recently reported that six out of ten elderly people live on £100 or less per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate about Trinity has generated an enormous amount of acrimony in the House which is most unusual. Part of the problem is that the Government side has imposed a whip. Is it not unprecedented that a whip should be imposed in relation to a private Bill?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Ó Murchú's call for an international criminal court. He does not appear to realise that almost two years ago the Government signed a treaty in Rome providing for the establishment of the court. However, in order to participate in the court it will be necessary for Ireland to ratify the treaty in domestic law. Whenever I have asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform why he has not prepared the relevant legislation he has shown a complete disinterest in, almost contempt for, the question.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the economy, a debate I have sought previously. It is not all bad news. Inflation is a matter of concern but a report published yesterday by a neutral organisation in Switzerland showed that Ireland is now the seventh most competitive nation in the world. That is a huge improvement on the 22nd place we held some time ago. Let us not look on this debate solely as a threat but as an opportunity to expand on some of the good news.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Trinity Bill, it should not be taken today in the absence of two Trinity College Senators. It would be the wrong time.</P>

He told us many times that it would be before the House prior to the Easter recess. He misled the House. If the delay is caused by the fact that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is dealing with Committee Stage of the Planning and Development Bill, there are two Ministers of State who are capable of bringing the Bill to the House, thus allowing us to proceed with legislation that has been due for over a year.</P>

      <P>I am glad a number of colleagues have raised human rights issues. The House has a proud tradition of making the public aware of human rights abuses throughout the world and I support the calls by Senator Ó Murchú and Senator Connor, the latter being my colleague on the foreign affairs committee. This is the week in which a new Chinese ambassador presented her credentials to the President, the UN withdrew its opposition to a US resolution condemning human rights abuses in China and it follows last week's meeting of the foreign affairs committee which heard a catalogue of horrendous oppression, torture and abuse of Chinese and non-Chinese citizens. Three students failed to return to an educational institution in this country after Christmas because they have been prevented from doing so. China needs the world more than the world needs China.

      <P>The debate is a little wider than just the international court of justice. Senator Connor will agree that until the United States gives legitimacy to an international court of justice there will not be effective action in that regard. I repeat a plea I made some weeks ago to the Leader in the context of the continuing sanctions against and bombing of Iraq. It is time the Minister for Foreign Affairs came to this House and explained Ireland's relationships with these countries and its policy in that regard. The Leader should request the Minister to come to the Seanad so Members can address not just the issues I have raised but also those raised by my colleagues.</P>

      <P>On many occasions in recent months I have asked about the progress of the teaching council Bill. I wish to put on record my welcome for the publication of the Bill today. It will be initiated in the Dáil and will come before the Seanad in due course. I also welcome the input of a succession of Ministers into the Bill, including Niamh Bhreathnach, Deputy Martin and the current Minister. It is a significant step forward and it is something the INTO and other teaching unions have sought for almost a quarter of a century. It will restore trust and confidence in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Trinity Bill, I am not sure about the process for dealing with private Bills. <Col N="114" /> It appears that a minor point is causing the row, at least it is a minor point to Members who are not involved. I am not attempting to demean the argument. Is it possible or is there a precedent for the House seeking independent legal advice on the point of law being argued? I do not expect the Chair to give me an immediate answer but perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might examine it. If there is a genuine legal problem, we could get our own legal advice and Members who are disinterested, as such, could look forward to its being resolved. I find myself rushing to Senator Ryan's side in this matter. I, too, never thought that after 13 years in the House I would feel the need to support Trinity College, but that is the case at present.</P>
    <P>With regard to inflation, wages and the economy, it should be stressed that the national agreement is predicated on low inflation, as are the arrangements on wages and the reviews. It is crucial that we discuss it and I appeal to the Leader to arrange such a debate. There is a great deal of misinformation but we need to look at annual inflation rather than monthly inflation. I listened to my colleague, Senator Quinn, refer to the importance of competitiveness. I agree, as anybody would, that we must remain competitive and productive. Irish workers are the most&mdash;</P>

While I do not blame the Leader for the Bill not appearing in this session, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government misled the House with regard to its publication date. Is he serious about publishing the Bill which has been promised on numerous occasions? Members of local authorities and others are awaiting its publication. I ask the Leader of the House to indicate clearly the position in relation to this important Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning inquired about changing the libel laws. I will come back to the Senator in the morning on the matter. Senators Manning, Ross, Dardis, Quinn, Costello, O'Toole, Burke and Coghlan called for a debate on the economy. Many Senators referred to the 4.6% inflation rate. While the inflation rate may be above European levels at present, we also have twice the growth rate of other European countries. It will be a pleasure for Members on the Government side to allow time for this debate and to discuss the achievements of the Government and the programme for Government in the coming years, particularly from 2000-06. It is a good time to be a Member of this House or the Dáil and to debate this issue. Senator O'Toole rightly pointed out the new agreement, which was signed by all parties a few weeks ago, is tied to low inflation.</P>

      <P>Senators Ó Murchú, Connor and Mooney called for a debate on international war crimes and the international criminal courts. I will allow time for this debate. Senator Jackman expressed concern about the nursing profession and the junior doctors dispute. I will pass on her views to the Minister and allow time for a debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senators Glynn and Farrell called for a debate on bilingual signs and a Government policy on the issue. I will pass on their views and allow time for a debate on the issue. The Senators also called for a debate on the Noxious Weeds Act. I will allow time for this debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan inquired about the telecommunications Bill. I spoke to my constituency colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, this morning on the matter and I understand the Bill will be introduced in the next session. The Minister will be in the House following the Order of Business if the Senator wishes to make further inquiries on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senators Coogan and Burke inquired about the local government Bill. I understand this was approved in Cabinet yesterday and will come to the House early in the next session. I hope the Bill will be initiated in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney called for a debate on foreign affairs issues. I have no difficulty making time available for this debate.</P>

      <P>This section provides that a contract should not be denied legal validity just because it was carried out by electronic means. It allows contracts to be agreed using electronic communication. While the term &ldquo;acceptance of an offer&rdquo; is used in the first line of subsection (2), &ldquo;acceptance of the contract&rdquo; is used subsequently in the subsection. This should also read &ldquo;acceptance of an offer&rdquo;. As such, the concept of &ldquo;acceptance of the contract&rdquo; does not exist in contract law; &ldquo;acceptance of the offer&rdquo; exists.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is specifically to determine when a contract is a contract in terms of electronic communication. While the section indicates the means of electronic communication that will form the contract, it does not specify when and at what point of time it is a contract. Postal contracts are formed when the letter is posted as distinct from when it is received, but because electronic communication is virtually instantaneous it would appear to be more appropriate to provide that a contract is formed at the point of receipt of the communication, rather than at the point when acceptance is communicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Senator's concerns and we have considered the matter in my Department. The section provides that a contract should not be denied legal validity simply because it was carried out by electronic means. It is not intended to interfere with existing law or with the formation of contract, nor is it intended in the Bill to establish new rules of contract law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the amendment was put down for good a reason. It appears to add certainty and <Col N="118" /> finality to the moment when a contract is concluded, however, it would effectively create a rule for off-line contracts that does not exist. Given that the aim of the Bill is to create the functional equivalence between on-line and off-line contracts and the on-line and off-line world, creating such new rules would not be desirable. It could have the potential to be damaging or difficult for consumers.</P>
    <P>The amendment raises the issue of time and place of dispatch and receipt of electronic communications. It is important, therefore, to have default rules in this regard. These are provided for in section 21. While I understand the Senator's concerns, the amendment would give an added edge to something when we are trying to provide functional equivalence between off-line and on-line business.</P>

      <P>A degree of certainty is important to give credibility to electronic contracts. This is a matter of huge debate in legal circles with regard to existing communications. If it is the Minister's legal recommendation that it would be best to leave the matter open I will accept it because the only function of the amendment is to assist in terms of giving credence to electronic communication as a viable and acceptable alternative method of forming contracts.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (1), line 13, to delete &ldquo;contents&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;sender&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 19(1) states: &ldquo;The contents of an electronic communication shall be presumed to be that of the person or public body by whom it purports to have been sent,. . . &rdquo;. There appears to be confusion here because the explanatory memorandum emphasises to whom it is to be attributable as distinct from the contents which are attributed. In view of this, the amendment emphasises the sender rather than the contents.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 is related to amendment No. 5 in this regard. Taking the two amendments together, section 19(1) would read: &ldquo;The sender of an electronic communication shall be presumed to be the person or public body by whom it purports to have been sent,. . . &rdquo;. The term &ldquo;sender&rdquo; would be subject to the qualification set out in section 19(2)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this deals with clarification, it does not solve the problem of ensuring that the sender is <Col N="119" /> the person who purports to send. That needs to be addressed, but as a start I believe it would be better to concentrate on the sender rather than the content of what is sent. These amendments would, therefore, offer a preferable form of words to that set out in the section, although it does not provide a watertight means of dealing with somebody who is fraudulently pretending to be the sender.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>These are interesting amendments and they raise an interesting debate about the section. As currently drafted, the section appears to create a presumption that the contents of an electronic communication are presumed to be accurate unless the opposite can be proved. The effect is to reverse the normal rule, that the relayer must prove authenticity if disputed. Given the fact that it is possible in certain circumstances to pretend to be somebody else on the Internet and also the fact that the content of an e-mail could in certain circumstances be altered by a third party, this presumption would be undesirable.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Costello for this amendment because it meant we had to consult with lawyers and other legislators. We need more time to address this issue. We are looking at what the UN model law suggests. We looked at the legislative proposals in the UK, which contained similar provisions but were dropped. The Australian legislation also included them but they were subsequently dropped. There is a need to ensure there is a correct legal framework to deal with this matter, but we have not had time to deal with it before this debate. I hope the House will agree to my proposal to introduce a similar amendment on Committee Stage in the other House. The Bill will then be reported back to this House when the matter can be discussed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)In criminal proceedings a document shall not be admissible under this section <Col N="120" /> where an original is available and the defendant requires its production.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to bring admissibility into line with existing practice in other legal proceedings. The normal procedure is that an original document is available and presented once a legal action is taken, especially where a criminal action is involved. The amendment does not specify which should be the original but that a document should not be admissible where an original is available and the defendant requires its production. It protects as much as possible against copies being used in important criminal proceedings, which is the norm under the existing process where paper is concerned. The original is always sought and it should also be presented for electronic transactions as this is a desirable norm. That would probably place an obligation that there should be some means of saving the original transaction. Obviously that would be desirable anyway from the point of view of the various parties to the contract.</P>
    <P>The amendment tries to bring the Bill into line as much as possible since it is enabling legislation, the thrust of which is to try to provide an alternative mechanism to that used in the paper world. Where proceedings arise in a criminal offence, the best practice available should be used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>The Bill allows for the prosecution of offences within the State, but there may be offences which are committed wholly or partly in the State or elsewhere which may impinge on transactions abroad. The purpose of the amendment is to cover fraud which may take place in the State but the effect of which may be felt outside the State.

In section 24 (<i>f</i>) the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is omitted.

      <P>This is similar to amendment No. 7 which dealt with obtaining original documentation and extending the application of the prosecution of offences. Best practice in investigative procedures stipulates that a promoted officer not below the rank of inspector and not just a member of the Garda Síochána can provide search warrants and that it is on the sworn information of such a person that a judge will usually make a decision.

However, the Senator has asked a much wider question in regard to the operation of organised gangs. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform would have a role to play in regard to criminal activity. During the Second Stage debate, we made it clear that this Bill was clearly intended to benefit business endeavours and we expressed a desire to keep the Bill simple, understandable and clear-cut. The Home Affairs Office in the UK and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform deal with pornography and the mafia-type operations to which the Senator referred. I am not being dismissive of the huge concerns which exist but my Department's remit in regard to this legislation was to make it clear-cut and straightforward.</P>

I totally accept the thrust of the Minister's comments but I wish to express my concern that some difficulties may arise in this area.

    <Title>Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend to this House the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill, 2000, which provides for the establishment, on a statutory basis, of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. As Irish society enjoys the benefits of a thriving economy and the Irish, as a people, feel a new and stronger sense of confidence, as Irish culture thrives at home and internationally and as Ireland participates as an equal partner with our European neighbours, it is difficult for many, and some do not want to do so, to recall our not so distant past and its failures. High among those failures is the abuse of some of the most vulnerable in our society &ndash; children com<Col N="126" /> mitted to institutions for their care and protection. That abuse occurred cannot be doubted and it has been determined by the criminal courts. We do not yet know with any certainty the extent, causes, circumstances and where responsibility for it should lie.</P>
      <P>The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill is intended to provide answers to those questions. More importantly, however, than that important objective is the objective of the commission to give those abused an opportunity to tell of that abuse in a dignified and sympathetic forum and to be heard by an experienced panel of people, specifically mandated by the representatives of the Irish people, the Houses of the Oireachtas, for that purpose.</P>
      <P>When the commission has reported and been wound up, that will not be the end of the matter. There will continue to be a need to help those injured by abuse, for Irish society to come to terms with a part of our past we may prefer to forget and a solemn duty on all to play their part in ensuring that never again can children be exposed to hurt as they have in the past.</P>
      <P>While a central element of the work of the commission will be to provide a forum for victims of abuse, it is essential that the commission has and is seen to have, a wider remit. That remit will include establishing all the circumstances relating to the operation of institutions covered by the Bill and their interaction with children and Irish society. It is necessary for a proper understanding of what occurred in institutions that they are placed as far as is practicable in the context of their time. This will involve reviewing the administrative and legislative framework within which industrial schools, reformatory schools and other institutions operated. It will involve appraisal of the systems of funding, supervision and regulation and is likely to involve consideration of the attitudes to children and child welfare predominant in Ireland during the period of the commission's inquiries.</P>
      <P>While abuse and poor conditions have lately received most attention, and quite rightly have been condemned, that is unlikely to be the full story of institutional care. Many children found a place of refuge and safety in hard times in orphanages, reformatories or industrial schools and were well cared for. The commission must be told this story too and those who dedicated much of their lives to the care and education of children must be encouraged to come forward to the commission, if we are to reach anything close to a full understanding of what went wrong where abuse did occur. The commission report must be both comprehensive and balanced in all of its aspects, and this legislation will provide for such a balanced report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the commission on an administrative basis has been done previously. In preparing this legislation, the Government has sought to ensure objectivity in determining the terms of reference and the powers needed. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, chaired <Col N="127" /> by the Honourable Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, was established by the Government on an administrative basis last May. The first task of this commission was to consider and make recommendations on broad terms of reference, as set out by the Government, and to recommend the powers it would need to fulfil such terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The commission set out its findings in two reports to the Government in September and October of last year. These reports have been published. The recommendations of the commission's reports have been accepted without reservation by the Government. This Bill closely follows the recommendations in the report. From the beginning, this commission has been independent of the Government and will continue to be so throughout its operation.</P>
    <P>The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, now to be established in law, will have three primary functions: first, to listen to victims of childhood abuse who want to recount their experiences to a sympathetic forum; second, to investigate fully all allegations of abuse made to it, except where the victim does not wish for an investigation; and third, to publish a report on its findings to the general public.</P>
    <P>In setting out the terms of reference for the commission, the Government placed no restrictions on the categories of abuse to be covered, either as regards the nature of abuse or the location at which it occurred. The commission recommended that all situations other than abuse in family settings be included in its remit. In the commission's view including abuse in families would potentially overwhelm cases of institutional abuse, but more importantly they felt that the kinds of issues which arise in abusive family situations are quite different from the issues arising in institutional abuse. They concluded that if abuse in families was included in the remit of the commission it could detrimentally affect the therapeutic benefit of the commission for victims of abuse in institutions. The commission has reached a reasonable conclusion in all the circumstances and the Government has acted on its recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Bill now covers the following categories of abuse &ndash; sexual abuse, defined in very broad terms, physical abuse, involving the negligent, wilful or reckless infliction of physical injury on a child, or failure to prevent such injury to a child, failure to care for a child which results in serious impairment of his or her physical or mental development or behaviour and any other act or failure to act which seriously injures a child. In the course of the debate in the other House, Members proposed that additional terms such as pain, distress and fear be specifically included in the definition of abuse. It is preferable that the Bill should be as broad and general as possible rather than seek to list each kind of abuse in detail. The latter course could result in limiting the scope of the commission, rather than <Col N="128" /> extending it as was the intention of the proposers of those amendments.</P>
    <P>Some concern was also expressed as to whether the terms of reference of the commission, as set out in the Bill, are sufficiently broad to meet all situations where abuse may have occurred. For example, abuse may have occurred while a child, although in the care of an institution, was not actually in the institution. Many children would, for example, have spent time working on farms. Another example cited was a situation where a child may have been abused by a person not directly employed by an institution but who had access to the institution. The Bill was amended to meet those concerns where there was any doubt.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of Members of this House, I want to clarify the position as it now stands. The Bill now provides for inquiring into abuse in the following circumstances: first, any abuse of a person resident in or attending an institution which occurred in the institution, whoever the abuser was &ndash; in other words, if the abuser was a visitor, a member of staff or any other person; second, abuse of a person outside the institution while the victim was resident in or attending the institution by a person involved in the operation of the institution or associated in any way with the institution.</P>
    <P>A key objective of this Bill is to provide for the needs of those who have suffered abuse in industrial schools, reformatory schools, orphanages and similar places. For too long they have encountered opposition, hostility and indifference and it is high time that this changed. The commission to be established under the Bill will, as its core function, provide those who have been silenced for so long with an opportunity to give their account to an experienced and sympathetic forum. This telling and listening function, which is the therapeutic function of the commission, is the function to which everything else should be subordinated.</P>
    <P>For some people, this therapeutic role will be all that they require of the commission, while others will also seek that their allegations be inquired into and perpetrators of abuse, where uncovered, be held accountable. In this case the therapeutic role will be complemented by an investigative role in the interests of establishing the truth and giving persons against whom allegations are made an opportunity to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the two strands can be accommodated, the Bill provides for two committees &ndash; the confidential committee, which will provide a forum where people can recount their experiences on an entirely confidential basis, and the investigation committee. The latter committee will be specifically mandated to carry out a thorough and comprehensive inquiry into allegations and to establish responsibility at the level of the individual abuser, the institution and the management and regulatory authorities. It is the Government's intention that the committee will have available to it the resources and all the legal pow<Col N="129" /> ers and protections it needs to do this. In particular the committee will have the kind of powers and protections which a court would have, including privilege for witnesses, compellability of witnesses, discovery of documents, taking evidence on oath and offences for failure to co-operate or for obstruction. This committee will also report to the commission.</P>
    <P>The commission has a duty to publish a report within two years of its establishment and an interim report within 12 months. Members in the Dáil requested the inclusion of a clause requiring an interim report within 12 months. The commission is free to produce any interim reports it wishes, but an interim report will be required within 12 months. The publication of this report, containing the findings and recommendations of the commission, is an essential part of the service which the commission can render to victims of abuse and to our society as a whole.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that the report contain recommendations and specific findings. The commission will make recommendations in their report on how the effects of abuse suffered by individuals might be alleviated. They will also make recommendations on how future abuse can be reduced and prevented and how children can be protected. Senators should note that in the matter of recommendations the Bill provides the commission with absolute discretion. There are no areas denied to it, administrative, legislative or otherwise. This approach is an essential ingredient of the independence of the commission. Having heard the evidence from people alleging abuse and those accused of abuse, from other former residents of institutions, from those employed in institutions and those involved in management, from Government Departments and other public bodies, from experts in such areas as child care, sociology, psychology or history and from witnesses with an international perspective, the commission is in the best possible position to decide where it should make conclusions and recommendations within the very broad parameters laid down in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the commission will be able to make specific findings of fact in its report. It will also be empowered to identify institutions in which abuse occurred and the people responsible and may make findings in regard to the role and responsibility of management and regulatory authorities in its report. However, the report will not make findings on any individual case as these are likely to be matters which are or will be the subject of civil or criminal proceedings. This is based upon the recommendations made to the Government by the commission in its report in October. The commission specifically requested that the issue be treated in this way.</P>
    <P>The power to name in a report that will be published individuals who the commission is satisfied have abused children is a significant power. The commission must have due regard to the rights of any person against whom allegations are made to his or her full entitlements to natural justice and <Col N="130" /> due process. Within that context of regard for constitutional rights, it is right and reasonable that the commission should have the powers to name institutions where abuse was committed, or individuals who either committed abuse or who were involved in the general management or operation of an institution where abuse occurred. Anything less would, in the words of the commission, be &ldquo;wholly anodyne&rdquo; and a serious breach of faith with those who will brave the trauma of recounting their experiences. It would also be a serious abdication of responsibility to the institutions and people who provided a considerable service to the children entrusted to their care and the community and would allow them to be tarred with the same brush as those responsible, directly or indirectly, for abuse.</P>
    <P>The commission will be entirely independent in carrying out its functions, a point specifically provided for in the Bill. Following on the recommendations in the commission's report on its terms of reference, the Bill provides for some key procedural issues and specifically requires the commission to bear in mind the difficulties posed for people in telling of abuse in childhood and imposes a duty on the commission to ensure that proceedings are conducted as informally as possible and that the atmosphere is sympathetic and understanding. These provisions are entirely consistent with the need to give victims a forum to tell of abuse and that in doing so they should not be exposed to the sometimes harsh and adversarial environment of a court.</P>
    <P>Related in part to this desire to avoid undue formality and an adversarial environment in the commission meetings are the provisions in the Bill which provide that the hearings of the confidential committee and those of the investigation committee relating to allegations of abuse be held in private. This approach was recommended by the commission primarily on the grounds of fairness to those against whom allegations are made. In addition, the making of specific allegations in a public forum would greatly increase the adversarial elements in the process at the expense of the listening and therapeutic elements. In response to views expressed in the other House, the Bill now specifically refers to the importance of the commission and its committees conducting their hearings in public to the greatest extent practicable. Such public hearings will form an essential part of informing the public of the wider context in which allegations of abuse will be made.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that a wide cross-section of people comes forward to the commission so that the final report can be as comprehensive as possible. In the case of former residents of institutions, in particular, many may have difficulty in covering the costs of coming to the commission. On top of the emotional stress which recounting events of the past might cause, this financial burden could be the last straw which makes them decide not to come to the commission. To help to alleviate this burden and <Col N="131" /> encourage as many people as possible to come forward to the commission, the Bill provides for the drawing up of a scheme of expenses for witnesses. Under the provisions relating to expenses I will also prepare a scheme relating to the issue of legal expenses.</P>
    <P>In principle, the Government accepts the view expressed in the commission's report on its terms of reference that an administrative scheme for legal expenses should be put in place. In devising a scheme under which legal fees will be paid, it will be necessary to strike a balance between the requirement of legal representation in some cases and the desirability of it in others, the therapeutic role of the commission and the objectives that the commission hearings be held as informally as possible. I have, during the course of Committee Stage debate on the Bill, published both the general and legal expenses scheme in draft form. Neither of these schemes will be finalised until after the enactment of the Bill and consultation with the commission. I am prepared to consider any reasonable proposals for amendments which are consistent with the objectives of the commission.</P>
    <P>Last May the Taoiseach on behalf of the State and all citizens of the State extended an apology from the Government to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene, to detect their pain and to come to their rescue. The measures then announced as the Government's response to childhood abuse were widely welcomed and eagerly anticipated. Almost a year has passed and despite the excellent work done by the commission and others the legislation which will activate one of the key Government measures has not yet been enacted. For those not familiar with the legislative process there is understandable impatience and even disillusionment that their concerns are not being taken seriously enough.</P>
    <P>I want to reassure such people that the Government is deadly earnest in its determination to give victims of abuse an opportunity to be heard and to establish what went wrong and why. I know that this House shares that objective. Accordingly, I trust that Members will appreciate why we are making every effort to pass this Bill before the recess. If we are unable to do so, the result will be further delay and further postponement of justice for those who have been abused. The sooner the commission can begin its work, the sooner the agony of waiting of the many people who want to give evidence to it can be ended.</P>
    <P>I thank Members of Seanad Éireann for their co-operation in taking this important Bill in the busy period before the Easter recess. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on the way in which the Bill has been presented. It is an urgent Bill and the Minister will not receive opposition from us. We will not delay the passage of the Bill <Col N="132" /> because we regard it as important. I compliment the Minister on his speech, which demonstrated a sensitivity towards the issues involved and the need to tackle them urgently and honestly but in a fair and humane way. Whatever criticisms I have will be made in the context of my total support for the principle and the greater part of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is being introduced at an interesting time in our development as a people. We all grew up at a time when many matters were not discussed. A priest leaving the priesthood was not spoken about, sometimes someone who left the seminary became a non-person for many years and a woman who became pregnant outside marriage was frequently banished, publicly excoriated and became a non-person. I recently came across a case of an old woman who died in County Kildare. She was a wealthy woman and was part of a large farming family. She had a child when she was 14 or 15 years, who was taken from her and never spoken about again. In her will she left some money to her daughter whom she had been unable to acknowledge in her lifetime.</P>
      <P>Homosexuality was not discussed. We made the lives of homosexuals difficult and reviled and made fun of them. We put such matters out of our minds and pretended they had not happened. We were not alone in this; it was true of most other countries. There is an Irish tendency, especially among media commentators, to see such incidents as unique to Ireland. However, the reality is that much the same events occurred in France, Italy, puritanical areas of Britain and other small communities. They were covered up, not discussed, and people were not capable of handling them in an open way.</P>
      <P>Of all the scandals that have emerged in recent years, the worst by far was the treatment of children in care. It gives nobody pleasure to say that. We must all acknowledge it happened. This Bill is a tangible recognition by the State and the Minister, on behalf of all of us, not just that these events occurred but that they must be acknowledged and made public and the State must make recompense in so far as it can be made. It would be foolish to think that this commission will solve all problems and we will wash our hands and go away when its work has been completed. We all know the reality is that the scars left on many of these people can never be healed. The memories and blighted lives of people who were never able to have the fullness of a decent, normal life, who were never able to establish a relationship afterwards, who lived their life in psychological fear and insecurity, wondering if this could happen again, are a result of what happened in many of these institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of its nature, the commission will examine what went wrong. However, there were also many good and selfless people in these institutions who worked hard, starved of funds, and found themselves in an inhumane and harsh regime which allowed them no scope. Many of the people working in these institutions probably <Col N="133" /> found their lives blighted by what they had to endure. It is important to maintain a sense of balance in what we are doing today. Nonetheless, at last the State is facing up to the scourge of child abuse.</P>
    <P>The Minister got the Bill and the commission broadly right. As far as possible, its hearings will be open and heard in public, which is important. However, the Minister is right that certain aspects must be confidential, at least until a conclusion has been arrived at. We do not want a series of cases where because of false or faulty recollections or mistaken memory, charges are made against people who could be blighted for the rest of their lives and may ultimately be shown to be innocent. This is a psychological matter where there may be faulty memory. The Minister is right to allow in the Bill scope for openness while also providing for confidentiality. I am sure the judge heading this commission will be the person best placed to decide which cases can be heard openly and which will have the benefit of confidentiality.</P>
    <P>I am also glad the Minister is allowing scope for the broadening of the commission's remit. We all know from our experience of tribunals and commissions that once they are established they take on a life of their own and issues not anticipated at the beginning may quickly arise. It is important to have this flexibility if other issues arise, as they will. The Minister has included this flexibility in the commission's terms of reference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break I talked about the broad aspects of the Bill and indicated my general warm welcome of it.</P>
      <P>I understand a meeting of the organisation of survivors of child abuse recently voted unanimously to veto co-operation with the commission as proposed. That may have changed, but I understand the obstacle to its participation is the Government's refusal to lift its exclusion of childhood victims of physical abuse from claiming civil damages under the new Statute of Limitations Bill. That Bill was hotly contested in this House and there were many divisions on it. Confining the extension of time to initiate a civil action for damages to child sexual abuse alone is discriminatory and unworkable. The reality is that many trailblazers, who were the people most determined to have their cases heard and who have been denied a hearing for so long, will not now have an opportunity to seek redress under the civil laws. The people who came forward in good faith and reported abuse to their legal representatives or the Garda and were told they were statute barred from pursuing their cases are again excluded because of the failure of the new legislation to exempt those who had previously reported such abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may have addressed those objections and I would like to hear the views of the <Col N="134" /> Minister of State on them. The restrictions in the Statute of Limitations Bill were discussed at length when that Bill went through this House and I do not intend to rehearse the arguments.</P>
    <P>With regard to expenses, the Minister was fair in what he said this morning. While Ms Justice Laffoy proposed specifically that legal representation should be provided by the State, through the Office of the Attorney General, for those who could not afford it, there is concern that this does not figure in the Bill. The legal support the Minister proposes is not continuous legal representation of victims as a group so that they can be present throughout the hearings when evidence is being taken, but rather that individuals would have access to a lawyer during the hearing of any rebuttal or questioning that occurs. How will that operate? Who will decide whether legal representation is appropriate? </P>
    <P>Another point, about which we need to be careful, that has caused concern is that the Bill envisages the use of staff seconded from the Department of Education and Science to act as the administration for the inquiry. I have no difficulty with that, as I am sure we all have the highest regard for the integrity, impartiality and competence of such people, but there is a feeling among the victim groups that this is the same Department that had responsibility for funding and regulating many of the institutions that will come under scrutiny in the inquiry. From the point of view of some of the people affected, this appears to be insensitive at the very least. They claim it may raise some issues in respect of which there may be a conflict of interest. They suggest other Departments should provide the support and funding for these organisations.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from a man whom I know to be of good character, who wrote on behalf of the victims of Donal Dunne. I do not intend to read it, as I am sure the Minister also received a copy of it. This man and his group strongly make that point, although I do not accept it. I will pass this letter to the Minister of State when I have spoken. I would like him to address some of the issues raised in it.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to understand at one level why the terms of reference of the commission do not contain an explicit reference to inquiring into the role of the State in the abuse that occurred. The State was a major player and most of those who will be affected by this legislation wonder why there is not a more explicit reference to the role played by the State in all of this.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that the Laffoy commission has not been asked to make recommendations on the necessary changes to current policies, legislation and practices, which would have arisen from its study of the situation. Provisions are needed to reduce the detention of children, to ensure that professional resources are available to children who need them and to ensure appropriate settings are available, particularly for those who are disturbed. It is scandalous that we witness on a weekly basis the courts taking a policy lead in try<Col N="135" /> ing to force the State to provide places for particular categories of disturbed young people and that the warnings, especially of Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, have not yet received public acknowledgement. I would be surprised if plans were not afoot to address the case he has made. It is disturbing that such a policy lead is continuing virtually on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>We need to ensure a visitors programmes is provided together with complaints mechanisms and that statutory regulatory supervision is applied equally to all institutions. A children's ombudsman needs to be established on a statutory basis together with whistleblowing procedures and a duty to report abuse. Common systems of regulation and inspection should be applied universally. A child complaints procedure and an advocacy service are needed for young people in residential care.</P>
    <P>In spite of our economic prosperity 500 children, on average, are waiting to be referred to a social worker because of allegations of physical, sexual or emotional abuse. In spite of signing the UN Conventions on the Rights of the Child in 1991, we have not incorporated provisions of the convention into our Constitution. There are a number of children incarcerated in a number of State institutions for such offences as non-school attendance, which is still termed a crime.</P>
    <P>The establishment of this commission marks an important point of maturing in our evolution as a people. We are able to face up to the horrific problems of child abuse that scarred so many lives in the past. It is important to remember this should be more than an historical exercise aimed at looking after the interest of those who were personally scarred. Enormous scars are still being inflicted on children across our community. We who speak here today and those charged with responsibility will be judged not so much by our passing of this legislation as by our capacity to face up not to historical problems but to the problems in our midst.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill. I congratulate the Minister on his approach. The Bill will have our full support.</P>

This is a societal issue that reflects what happened in our society dating back perhaps hundreds of years. I acknowledge the work of investigative journalists who brought this issue to the forefront. We are now living in an inclusive society in which there must be openness and transparency to bring these problems to the forefront and address them. I thank the Taoiseach also. I was glad he apologised to the nation for the pain inflicted on young people who had to endure such trauma in their lives and who internalised their problems because there were no facilities available to them.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> The Bill is timely in that the commission, which has been working in an administrative capacity, will now be put on a statutory footing, and I congratulate Ms Justice Mary Laffoy for steering it in that direction. The Bill is wide-ranging and covers many categories of abuse, including physical, sexual and other abuse. That is important because very often abuse is only noticeable to the person inflicting it. Abuse can also take the form of a certain type of bullying or personality clashes between a teacher and a child or even between parents and a child. From my experience as a teacher and a counsellor in second level education, I know that this type of abuse occurs not only in reformatory schools and institutions, it exists in all walks of life. I congratulate the teaching staff who identify abuse, be it in primary or second level schools, where such abuse takes place.</P>
    <P>People who have suffered abuse must be treated in a very sensitive manner. Abuse was not often highlighted by those in management positions who were aware that it was taking place in their midst. They decided to sweep it under the carpet in the hope that it would go away and that the child would forget about it. That was the way it was dealt with in the past few decades, but it is wonderful that we are now giving an opportunity to those who have been abused to come forward and relate their cases.</P>
    <P>The commission will have three functions. It will listen to victims, investigate all allegations and publish a report. It is vitally important that those who are chosen to be members of the confidential committee, which will listen to the victims, have the necessary skills to enable them to create an atmosphere in which people can relate their cases. That will involve many hours of listening and a lot of patience. They will have to be able to reflect on what the people are recounting as well as encourage them to open up even further in terms of what they experienced. That will require a special skill on the part of those nominated to the confidential committee because they will be dealing with young children and adults who have internalised a great deal of negative emotion. They must be given the opportunity to relate their cases in comfortable surroundings and they must be made feel that we are on their side, because we have not been on their side. Nobody has been on their side. They are loners. The people on the confidential committee will have to be first-class therapists and counsellors. They will have to have an understanding and a warmth about them, and be able to listen. Not many people can listen these days. We are all talkers. Even those who are counsellors tend to talk too much. The members of this committee need to have a listening skill so that they can create a comfortable atmosphere in which victims can relate their cases.</P>
    <P>A different type of person will be needed for the investigation committee, which will identify the perpetrators of abuse. It will be a tedious operation to bring the matter to its full conclusion <Col N="137" /> and publish a report. I welcome the fact that the committee's findings and report will be available to be analysed by all of us. That is the best way forward. The Bill will result in the questioning of the management of institutes and families who have not shown responsibility for their children. Measures will have to be brought forward in that regard and the Bill will make those recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is important for us to recognise that we failed in the past in that we did not intervene when we should have intervened. We did not acknowledge that this pain was being inflicted on young people, nor did we acknowledge that the culprits were allowed to carry out these atrocities. We brushed it all under the carpet and hoped that it would go away. It must be remembered that these people will never completely recover. It will take a great deal of counselling to get them to accept their pain, understand the reason it happened and build up self-esteem so that they can begin to live their lives again.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the Bill. We are now an inclusive society but until we acknowledge what happened in the past, we cannot move on. We have a duty to the next generation not to run away from our past. We must confront our problems and the reason they occurred, and we need help to do that. There are many fine people in our society who are very vulnerable because of what happened to them in the past, and this debate gives us an opportunity to say &ldquo;no more&rdquo;. We all accept that abuse occurred in the past but it will occur in the future also. We are now living in an open and transparent society and we must help those who have been abused.</P>
    <P>We need skilled staff to ensure that the institutions they work with have a proper administration in place to deal with problems, to acknowledge that the problems exist and to take responsibility for their behaviour in any given case. I blame the management of institutions, schools and centres which cared for young children. Unless those in management positions are trained to understand the emotions of young people, these problems will recur. We must have the necessary resources. I am not just talking about financial resources, which is one aspect of dealing with the problem. This problem involves people and those employed in management positions, and those who look after children must be caring individuals. Children must be given proper care and adequate personnel resources must be allocated to ensure that this happens.</P>
    <P>I had understood that this Bill came under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children but I discovered this morning that it was actually proper to the Department of Education and Science. In that context, there is a danger that we could fall between two stools. I accept that certain aspects of this matter relate to education but, as a counsellor, I dealt with problems of abuse and I was often obliged to seek help from those involved in the health services. There should be no question of our falling between the two stools <Col N="138" /> of the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children. A co-ordinated plan must be put in place to ensure that, regardless of the way the legislation is administered following its enactment, people may seek help from either Department if necessary.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have inquired whether this matter is proper to the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Health and Children. In order to implement the system established as a result of the enactment of this legislation, there will be a need to ensure that victims of abuse have easy access to the right people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the legislation promotes an inclusive, open and transparent society. The establishment of the commission on a statutory basis will weed out the awful blight of abuse which has affected society in the past and will affect it in the future. By placing the commission on a statutory footing we are saying that we will take no more and that, from this point on, the necessary structures will be put in place to deal with the problem of abuse.</P>
    <P>The public must be made aware of that fact because there is not much point in our discussing the Bill in detail while those we represent do not understand its provisions. It is important that members of the public, boards of management in schools and those who deal with young children or adolescents are aware that a mechanism is being put in place which will afford protection to the victims of abuse. If an incident of abuse or some similar offence takes place in the future it will be dealt with by the confidential committee or the investigative committee, either of which can then make a report.</P>
    <P>I have covered the major points but I must again stress the importance of employing staff who possess the necessary therapeutic or counselling skills and who are in a position to understand people's problems. It is not a case of providing proper administrative structures or of seeing this matter in purely clinical terms. Not many people are skilled enough to work as counsellors. Those who provide counselling are a rare breed and we face a major challenge in terms of ensuring that we attract the right kind of people to the profession.</P>
    <P>If we do not attract the right kind of individual, victims will only attend one counselling session and refuse to return perhaps because of a personality clash with their counsellor. I am aware of many people who attended two or three counselling sessions but who gave up because they did not like the person with whom they were dealing. We must ensure that we attract the right kind of people to become counsellors.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. The fact that we are debating it means that we are moving forward and taking a further step towards the establishment of an inclusive society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. As Senator Ormonde stated, we must hang our heads in shame when we contemplate what happened to <Col N="139" /> young people over a lengthy period. Thankfully, however, the carpet under which everything was swept has been pulled back and the truth has been laid bare, mainly as a result of good investigative journalism. While we do not know all the details, this legislation will help to bring them into the open.</P>
      <P>In May last year the Taoiseach made a public apology on behalf of the State to victims of abuse in industrial schools. As part of the process of atonement, the Minister for Education and Science drafted this Bill to establish a commission to inquire into child abuse on a statutory footing which will consider, in depth, the issues involved and report to the Government and the public on its findings.</P>
      <P>The commission was first established in June last year on an administrative basis. Under the chairmanship of Justice Mary Laffoy the original broad terms of reference were as follows: to afford victims of abuse in childhood an opportunity to tell of the abuse they suffered to a sympathetic and experienced forum; to establish as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions and other places during the period from 1940 to the present; and to compile and publish a report on the activities and findings of the commission, containing recommendations on actions to address the continuing effects of the abuse and actions to be taken to safeguard children from abuse in the future.</P>
      <P>The commission was asked to consider these terms of reference, recommend any changes it considered necessary and outline the powers it would need. It submitted two reports in September and October of last year and the Government published this legislation, which is based on those reports, earlier this year. At the same time, it published the reports of the commission. The Government fully accepts those reports and the legislation has been drafted so as to give effect to the commission's recommendations. While preparing the legislation, the Minister and his officials consulted victims and the groups which represent them to ensure that it meets their needs.</P>
      <P>The Bill has three main aims, one of which is to provide victims with the opportunity to tell their story in total confidence. As Senator Ormonde stated, this is particularly important and the confidentiality aspect is vital. Another aim is to investigate instances where victims wish such investigations to occur, consider stories of abuse and prepare a report on this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the central points victims made during the process of consultation on the Bill was the need for the commission to be available, in a completely confidential manner, to listen to the stories of victims. Many victims have faced circumstances where they found little willingness among people at many levels to listen to their stories about the abuse they suffered. The ability to be able to recount an experience of abuse in a <Col N="140" /> sympathetic environment is an essential element for victims in helping them come to terms with that abuse. The need for such an opportunity was identified by victims of abuse as a crucial element of any structure to be established. The establishment of this commission will meet this need.</P>
    <P>The commission is broken down into two separate committees, the first of which is the confidential committee. This committee will be available to victims who simply wish to tell their stories but who do not wish to take matters further. The process of investigation may be stressful and time consuming. Many victims may not wish to become involved in the process at all but the confidential committee has been designed to take account of the needs of victims at all times.</P>
    <P>It is also important that victims have an opportunity, where they wish, to initiate an investigative process to consider their stories of abuse in greater detail. The investigative committee has been designed with a particular role in mind and it will have specific powers and duties to investigate the issues that arise as victims recount their stories. The legislation places a duty on the commission to carry out a thorough and comprehensive inquiry into allegations and establish responsibility at the level of individual abuse and also at institutional, managerial and regulatory authority level.</P>
    <P>These are important and wide ranging functions and the Minister has made specific provision for them. The Bill is structured to provide the investigative committee with the powers and protections of the High Court. This gives the committee the necessary power to carry out its investigations in a full and thorough manner.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides the committee with a range of important powers. The Bill takes into account the seriousness of the issue, which is basically child abuse. In considering this issue, it is imperative that the investigative committee is allowed to perform its functions as effectively as possible. Without these powers the committee would be severely hampered in its ability to consider issues to the appropriate level and our ability to understand and assess the issues involved in these cases of abuse would be correspondingly reduced.</P>
    <P>The final function of the commission is to prepare a report on its work. This report will play a crucial role in our understanding and response to the issue. First, it is important to note that the legislation is explicit that the report must be made available to the general public. This is a key principle to facilitate widespread understanding of the issues involved in these cases. Second, the Minister has asked the commission to consider certain specific matters. These include recommendations to ensure the abuse of children in any institution will be prevented in the future. This is a most important function which will serve to assist in making policy with regard to the protection of children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> A further important matter to which the commission will devote consideration is addressing the damage done to victims of abuse. It is vital that this be considered. From its constant interaction and discussions with the victims, the commission will be best placed to make recommendations on this. It is important to remember that these recommendations will be made public along with the rest of the report.</P>
    <P>The report of the commission will also report on incidences of abuse in institutions and, where the commission believes it appropriate, will be able to name individuals who committed abuse. It will go further, however. It is the Minister's intention that it will, in so far as is possible, present a general picture to show how Irish society treated the care of children over the years and examine the attitudes to children who were placed in care.</P>
    <P>As well as the obvious weaknesses, the report can also list any strengths of the system. In particular, it is appropriate that where individuals have given much of their lives to the care of children, this contribution should be noted. Indeed, there were many people who devoted their lives to this and did an extremely good job. That should never be forgotten.</P>
    <P>These are far reaching powers. The ability to name an individual in a report being made available to the public is something the commission will have to consider carefully. It will have to weigh up the evidence against any individual before making this decision. However, where the commission decides that it is justified, it is important that it has the right to name individuals. We must always remember the aim of the Bill, namely, to inquire into the abuse of children. The seriousness of this issue for society requires that we take fundamental action. The provisions of the Bill are designed to do that. They will provide the commission with appropriate and reasonable powers to investigate child abuse and report its findings.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde was correct to point out the importance of setting up the listening committee in a way that people will have the confidence to tell their story. It is particularly important that they are not prevented from availing of this opportunity. One obstacle might be the costs involved because there will be substantial costs in some cases. I welcome the fact that provisions have been made by the Minister for Finance to help in this regard. It is important that if victims feel these provisions are inadequate, their concerns will be addressed. No barrier must be put in the way of their coming forward to tell their story in confidence and with trust that they will be given a serious hearing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It will go a long way towards healing some of the awful wounds inflicted. Let us hope we will never see the like again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the comprehensive overview given by the Minister. The <Col N="142" /> Bill offers an opportunity to victims to have their cases heard and to the State to face up to its responsibility. I also welcome the fact that the Taoiseach acknowledged the extent of the abuse which occurred and apologised for it last year.</P>
      <P>The commission has three key functions. The first is to listen to victims of childhood abuse who wish to recount their experiences to a sympathetic forum. In that regard, the healing function of the commission is vital and is the kernel of the Bill. As the Minister said, &ldquo;This telling and listening function, which is the therapeutic function of the commission, is the function to which everything else should be subordinated.&rdquo;  Those who suffered, whether in reformatory schools, industrial schools, orphanages and other places, were in the care of people who were in positions of great trust where care should have been at the core of their work. It is hard for us to imagine that, God forgive me, there were such savages and misfits in those institutions who inflicted so much pain, hurt and hardship on so many people, many of whom are only now coming forward after years of silence.</P>
      <P>The second function is to investigate all allegations of abuse made to it, except where the victim does not wish for an investigation to take place. The third function is to publish a report on its findings for the general public. Ms Justice Laffoy is an excellent chairperson. She has commitment and will, no doubt, be fair to all concerned. The Bill must be fair and conscious of constitutional rights.</P>
      <P>One of my concerns is the definition of evidence in the interpretation section. The definition includes &ldquo;the expression of belief, opinion or intention&rdquo;. Evidence as defined by Henry Murdoch in a dictionary of Irish law is the testimony of witnesses and the production of documents and things which may be used for the purpose of proof in legal proceedings. The law of evidence comprises the rules which govern the presentation of facts and proof in proceedings before a court. Evidence may be direct or circumstantial. Direct evidence is evidence of a fact in issue. It may be the statement of someone who observed with his senses. Circumstantial evidence is evidence of a fact relevant to the fact in issue. It is evidence from which the fact in issue may be inferred.</P>
      <P>When adducing evidence there is a standard and burden of proof to be established. The standard of proof in a tribunal of inquiry is usually the civil standard, that is, on the balance of probabilities. Whatever facts the chairperson accepts must be grounded on good evidence, that is, primary, direct or documentary evidence in the traditional legal sense. If facts are to be grounded on circumstantial evidence, this evidence should be corroborated. It is worrying that evidence is so broadly defined in the interpretation section of the Bill. It is hard to think that a chairperson could ground a fact on opinion or belief. The definition of evidence, therefore, should be amended or it should not be defined at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> The issues which must be clarified include expenses for witnesses, costs for the parties, costs of representation and so on. It is important to establish an ombudsman for children. The commitment to set up a counselling service for victims is crucial. The Minister should draw up a document which is clear on how this will be done. Subject to these requirements, I am pleased to support the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the legislation to establish a commission to investigate child abuse, which is timely. Child abuse is one of the black marks in Irish society and has created great difficulties for all of us. This problem must be examined and dealt with in a fair and understanding manner. It is also timely that the Government, on behalf of the people, has apologised for what took place in this regard. If one ties this in with recent statements by the Catholic Church seeking forgiveness from the Irish people and from God for the wrongdoing and hardship caused, it is an appropriate time to deal with the issue and to set up the commission.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the commission is to deal with the problem of physical and sexual abuse against young people in institutions and elsewhere. This issue must be considered in a fair and reasonable manner. The setting up of the commission will enable those who have been affected in the past to feel comfortable to participate in the investigations which will take place. The Bill goes a long way towards allowing this to happen.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that section 24 caters for advisers and researchers to help the commission in the performance of its functions. This may help institutions which have had major difficulties in dealing with the issue of abuse. These institutions are going through a transformation in trying to avoid anything like this happening in the future. However, many religious institutions have made a great contribution to society, particularly to young people. They looked after people where the State failed to provide the necessary resources to do so in the past. In the past large families were looked after in industrial schools. In fairness, the only places that cared for people when their parents were not available to look after them were the religious institutions. This was a great responsibility which was supported by the State. This became clear in some of the television documentaries outlining the problems that existed. It is important that the commission investigate successfully the institutions responsible for the abuse, be they church, religious or State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 guarantees the confidentiality of the committee. This will make participants feel confident that they are being dealt with in a proper manner. Section 34 restricts the Freedom of Information Act. I welcome this because it is a very sensitive issue and of great personal importance to those concerned. It is important to ensure <Col N="144" /> the participants that the matter will be dealt with in a sensitive manner.</P>
    <P>The commission has sufficient power to ask participants to give information on oath in order to obtain a true reflection of what happened at the time. When the report is published, the State will have to try to deal with the therapeutic and healing issues for these people. The State will have to make it clear that it is conscious of the hurt imposed on these people. We have a responsibility to try to undo some of the damage caused to people and avoid anything like this happening in the future. We must consider the issue in its entirety.</P>
    <P>It is important that the commission obtains all the evidence in relation to this abuse so that the public can have trust in the investigation. There is political agreement in relation to the establishment and bona fides of the commission to investigate this important matter. I welcome the legislation to set up the commission and wish it every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No one should say anything in a situation such as this without giving it careful consideration. I do not wish to cavil or argue with my colleagues because we all feel the same. It is very painful for an Irish Catholic to have to stand up in a House of the Oireachtas and say he welcomes legislation such as this. It is a profound admission of the degree to which the deep religious faith of the Irish people motivated them that they put their trust in people whom they believed to be better than themselves. Some 60 years later we must look at a level of abuse, most of which took place in institutions, including religious institutions. Because of the Roman Catholic Church's determination to be in control, many of these institutions were run in a Catholic ethos under the control of instruments or agents of the majority church, of which I am still a somewhat battered but unbowed internal critic. It is a very painful thing.</P>
      <P>I fully accept the sincerity of the apologies given. I have always believed that much of the work of church bodies and agencies was good, necessary and fortuitous because the state of services for our children would have been horrendous without them. However, that does not get away from what happened. It is disingenuous to say that similar patterns occurred around the world because as children we were brought up to believe that we were better here, that we were not &ldquo;pagan England&rdquo; where horrible things happened to people, where people did horrible things and where people fell into horrible temptation when they went there. They even stopped going to Mass on Sundays &ndash; almost a definition of horror.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real pain for our society and culture is that we were not better and because we claimed to be better we were worse. We know children have been abused, but they have been abused through history. Tragically, there has always been a trait in humanity which regarded children as a legit<Col N="145" /> imate source of sexual gratification and another trait which saw the capacity or the right to discipline children, broadly defined, as a necessary part of authority. It was horrible. We have not reached the end of it yet, nor will we for a while because there is hardly an adult in Ireland who does not have a memory &ndash; I am 53 years of age &ndash; that causes them to feel more than a little emotional.</P>
    <P>The function of the commission and the degree to which there is an effort to make it sensitive is most welcome. Nevertheless it will be painful. I have read the file of correspondence I and my party colleagues received. I am sure other Members received similar correspondence.</P>
    <P>The most frightening aspect of the correspondence sent to the commission, copies of which were distributed to politicians, is the fear people have after perhaps 60 years. There is the fear that somebody in these institutions might still have some influence and the fear of seconded officials of the Department of Education and Science. I am sure it is unfair, but it must be remembered that these were people who were not believed. They discovered that to speak up was to invite further abuse. This was a culture in which to suggest that adults, and especially religious people, would do such things was to leave the child accused of evil doing and evil thinking. That is why many people escaped from the country. It is why much of the correspondence many people have received is concerned with the composition of the commission, the individual members and staffing. It is not because I distrust the people involved, it is because the victims of abuse have learnt to distrust everybody.</P>
    <P>The intention is to be as sensitive as possible, but a little more than that is required. Many Members referred to the question of costs. To add even a flicker of a suggestion to people's worries and fears, by leaving them with the possibility that they will be under or poorly represented or poorly defended because they cannot afford the best, is to fail to understand the depths of their fear. That is why the cost aspect is important.</P>
    <P>If it is managed sensitively and well, the pain people will suffer will be part of a healing process for them and perhaps for society. I hope out of it will come justice, in the best sense of the word. I do not mean vengeance. I never subscribed to the retribution view of justice. I have no desire, and never have had, to see old men or women in jail for things they did in their twenties. It is not part of the ethos of crime and punishment in which I believe, but I believe it is possible to have justice without vengeance.</P>
    <P>I hope we will learn from this. The first thing that needs to be learnt is not that we did not run our institutions well, nor that people with peculiar, perverted sexual urges drifted into them, but that unaccountable power is always abused. There is no institution in human history of which I am aware where human beings are given power over others &ndash; whether they be adults over adults, <Col N="146" /> adults over children or children over younger children &ndash; which is not abused if it is not held accountable and transparent. It is always abused because that is part of our nature. It is why, for thousands of years, humanity has struggled with systems of authority.</P>
    <P>The more we have struggled the more we have moved towards democracy, the most revolutionary concept of all. It is one with which, regrettably, the church of which I am a member has considerable difficulty. It had difficulty with it at the outset but ultimately came to terms with it, but it continues vigorously to resist any notions of democracy within its own institutions. Democracy is the only system that keeps power under some kind of control, otherwise it will be abused.</P>
    <P>I am 53 years of age, so I was alive when the atmosphere surrounding this ethos was prevalent. We all want to pretend that the phrase, &ldquo;Spare the rod and spoil the child&rdquo;, was never said. It was the accepted wisdom of society until approximately ten years ago that not only was it necessary but good to physically punish children. I am not a crusader against corporal punishment &ndash; I do not believe that anybody who has brought up children believes in absolutes any more &ndash; but the phrase &ldquo;Spare the rod and spoil the child&rdquo; is regrettably a biblical phrase. It is not merely a part of folk wisdom. I invite people to explain what it now means. It meant a licence to beat children. While I do not support the campaign by the ISPCC to penalise or criminalise every slap to a child, because that would make the job of parenting even more difficult, the value that phrase contained must be acknowledged. Another common phrase was, &ldquo;Children should be seen and not heard&rdquo;. They were seen and were not heard, and because they were not heard everybody ignored what happened.</P>
    <P>Corporal punishment persisted in institutions which should have known better. I know that many of the boarding schools run by religious orders, long after they stopped using corporal punishment for academic matters because the State said they could not, still used corporal punishment to deal with disciplinary matters. This meant a person unconnected with a child but who was <i>in loco parentis</i> believed it was both right and proper to inflict physical punishment on someone else's child. That takes a particular mentality, and the old line &ldquo;It hurts me more than it hurts you&rdquo; is no excuse. The decision and acceptance that a person has the right to inflict pain as punishment on a child because he or she is in authority over that child is a dubious decision which implies dubious values on the part of the person who accepts it. That happened until early in the last decade at least. It was not something which happened 90 or 60 years ago. People believed they had the right to do that.</P>
    <P>It is worth saying explicitly that what happened occurred in what used to be called &ldquo;the good old days&rdquo;. It is difficult for many people in Ireland today, be they churchgoers or not, to listen with <Col N="147" /> equanimity to lamentations of the fact that morality has broken down in Ireland. Morality had broken down in respect of a large number of children at a time when we were supposed to be in the good old days when everyone behaved properly. The truth is that nothing of what we now know would ever have emerged if the power of the Roman Catholic Church had not begun to be diminished. We would still not have heard any of it because that was the nature of society. I hasten to add that being a member of the church or a religious is not necessarily a connection with child abuse. Rather, that institution had a level of unaccountable power which permeated everything.</P>
    <P>I remember in second class in school, which is 44 or 45 years ago, a Christian Brother who so terrified me that I can still remember him perfectly now. I was the best in the class academically and I was a well behaved child&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and I was still terrified. I am still the best in the class but I am no longer well behaved. The Cathaoirleach could give evidence on that. If there were an inquiry, he would have to give evidence to that effect.</P>
      <P>In third class I remember people being paraded for religious examination or catechism as we called it. The first time a pupil failed a question, he or she received two slaps. The second time it was four slaps and the third, six slaps. All this was in the name of religion. I remember boys in my class, who everyone would recognise now as mentally handicapped or slow learners, being humiliated for the entertainment of the rest of us. I remember a lay teacher called the &ldquo;spitting sheriff&rdquo; who terrified everyone. Fortunately for me, he did not teach me. I remember in secondary school being beaten around the head with closed fists by a Christian Brother, and this was a school in which my father taught. Everyone remembers such events and that was the prevailing ethos.</P>
      <P>We should never lament the departure of the good old days. In that regard we are better off now than we ever were. Despite our faults, problems, social issues and collapses of morality, we are better off. According to those whose institutions concealed this behaviour, there is, allegedly, a collapse in morality. There is a story about a certain Des Traynor, who is now deceased, lamenting the decline in morality in Ireland in the 1980s which is an interesting commentary on definitions of morality.</P>

    <P>What are we to make of the touching representations in the interests of natural justice which many of us received from church and church-related bodies? I believe in natural justice. It is a concept which civil society developed in the teeth of resistance from the institutional church, which the institutional church still does not practise in its own fora and which it ignores when it dismisses people. If one reads the equality legislation or the Education Act, one can see that the <Col N="148" /> church still claims the right to dismiss people without proper accountability, which we need desperately. We should be wary of that.</P>
    <P>We should remember that two members of the staff of Maynooth college were sacked because their lordships did not approve of their opinions. I believe in natural justice and that no person should be harmed because of a false allegation about child abuse. However, natural justice is a concept which was developed in civil society in the teeth of a belief that divine inspiration was a better way to organise society. Divine inspiration did not work. Our much lamented secularised society is a good deal better.</P>
    <P>There is more to this than looking back. It becomes a useless exercise if, in 40 years' time we discover another scandal which was happening at this time and which we ignored. I will give a good and explicit example. Goldenbridge has often been mentioned and I am sure every photographer attached to Dublin newspapers and others have gone there to get a good graphic. I know the television cameras have been there. To get to Goldenbridge, one must walk through St. Michael's estate in which there are hundreds of children whose futures are guaranteed to be disastrous because society has placed them in the most appalling housing.</P>
    <P>I have not yet read a single journalist fulminating about what happened 60 years ago who even noticed the place as they moved around it. It is bleak, frightening and the worst possible place in which human beings could be asked to live, and it has been allowed to become like that by the State. The children who live there have no hope, yet no one notices. It will only be in 30 years' time when people will notice these children and what was done to them. Some 25% of children live in poverty. That might have been excusable when we had no money but it is not excusable now. One of the excuses for much of the institutional neglect has been the shortage of money.</P>
    <P>No one has said explicitly whether salaries were paid to the staff of these institutions as they were paid to the religious in primary and secondary schools. If salaries were paid, what happened to them, because these people had vows of poverty? Were they paid salaries to run institutions or were they charitable institutions? How could people be confined to charitable institutions?</P>
    <P>I am still not certain that the abuse suffered by children who were fostered from institutions is covered by the Bill. This fostering was commonplace up to 25 years ago. I am not happy that the definition of a child is the modern one of anyone under 18 because, when most of this abuse occurred, the age of majority was 21. I do not see why people who were not treated as adults until they were 21 should be prevented from being able to tell the stories of what happened to them when they were over 18. In 1950, an 18 year old was not regarded as capable of having a vote, signing a contract etc. Why confine the Bill's provisions to people under 18 years of age? Why not leave <Col N="149" /> the age at 21 years, the age stipulated in the Constitution at that time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to all the Senators who participated in this debate in which I have a very personal interest. I had the privilege of bringing the Child Care Bill through the House in 1990, the first such Bill in the history of the State to go before a committee of the House. Deliberations on the Bill lasted for 15 months, as a result of which legislation was put in place which has served the State well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister even accepted Seanad amendments after the 15 months of deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, some of those amendments comprised part of the legislation which was enacted when the President signed the Bill and they have been used to good effect. We are now engaged in a post-adjudication process on the environment of the day and the crises which came to light since that legislation was introduced.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for their courtesy in giving this Bill prompt attention. That is an appropriate and welcome recognition that the issue of child abuse is one of grave concern to this House and the Oireachtas as a whole and that we can and must make all possible efforts to prevent such abuse ever occurring again. That theme strongly permeated the various contributions made during the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>We must accept the regrettable fact that child abuse has occurred in our society. The Taoiseach's apology last May started that process and this legislation will assist us in continuing along that path. The commission's report will reveal much of what was hidden about Irish society's attitude to children in the past. Senator Manning alluded to the hidden aspect of abuse. I agree with his comment that child abuse is not merely an Irish problem and has occurred in many countries throughout the world. Of course, as Senator Ryan pointed out, that is no excuse. Child abuse has occurred in our society and our task as a modern Legislature is to put in place the political parameters and regulatory regime to ensure this will not happen again. We differed perhaps in that we were slower to speak about the problem of child abuse but we are doing so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found Members' comments informative and useful. I would like to respond to some of the issues raised during the debate and clarify some misunderstandings about the Bill's purpose and the role of the commission. A group opposed to the Government's stance on the Statute of Limitations proposed to veto the commission. The commission and the statute are separate and distinct entities and it is unfortunate that they were linked in this way. The position adopted by the group in question is far from being the position of victims generally. We hope that nobody will be discouraged from coming forward to the commission by the improper linkage with civil liti<Col N="150" /> gation. The commission will be open to all victims of abuse and no time limitation applies.</P>
    <P>A request was made that the Minister would consider continuous legal representation for victims. The scheme for legal expenses is in draft form and the Minister indicated earlier that he would consider all reasonable proposals to amend it. The Minister indicated in the Dáil that he accepted in principle that some legal representation should be available on a continuous basis for victims as a group. If we are to have individual litigation and representation, there will be a dissipation of the consensus required to deal with this issue. Consequently, equitable treatment demands that victims as a group would be properly represented.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that staff should not be seconded to the commission secretariat from the Department of Education and Science. The staff in question will fulfil a purely administrative secretarial role and will not have a role in conducting inquiries, reaching conclusions or making recommendations. The current staff of the commission have been seconded from the Department of Education and Science and to change horses in mid-stream could greatly damage and delay the commission's work. I am satisfied that the commission, as a body of professional people chaired by a High Court judge, will ensure that no conflict of interest will arise. Having served in nine Departments, I know that the linkage with the Oireachtas, represented by a Minister as the political head of a Department who can avail of assistance, advice and guidance from a team of civil servants charged with particular responsibilities in a particular unit, is very important and should be maintained. In that way, any Oireachtas Member would have the right to question the Minister at any time and the Minister could obtain the information directly from the commission or any other organisation carrying out an inquiry in which the State has an involvement. In the interests of accuracy and fairness, it is important that that link is maintained.</P>
    <P>In response to the comment that no reference is made to State bodies in the Bill, it was always the intention that public bodies would be investigated by the commission in regard to their role in and responsibility for the abuse of children. To put the matter beyond doubt, section 1(3) was inserted on Committee Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that the commission should make recommendations on current child care practices. Both the Minister and the Department are in agreement on that and I am satisfied that the commission's terms of reference are sufficiently widely drawn to allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>A query was raised in regard to the definition of &ldquo;evidence&rdquo;. A definition of the term is already used in legislation. The significance of the references to belief, opinion or intention in this Bill is that the commission will need to hear a wide range of views if it is to place abuse in institutions in the context of the time at which the abuse occurred. This in no way diminishes the require<Col N="151" /> ment in law that facts must be established on the balance of probability before the commission can make a finding. That is only fair.</P>
    <P>I again thank Members for their courtesy during this debate and for their contributions on the Bill. We look forward to clarifying any outstanding issues during Committee Stage debate. We, as legislators, have a solemn duty under the Constitution to have equal regard for all the nation's citizens. It is clear that for many years the rights of some people in the most vulnerable sector of our society were disregarded over a sustained period of time. This was a shameful episode in our history and while this legislation will not undo that shame, it will offer a sympathetic platform for those who suffered such abuse. It will provide a means to investigate specific allegations of abuse and to make findings in regard to those allegations.</P>
    <P>The legislation, through the commission's report, will provide Irish society with an insight into and an understanding of the abuses of children which were committed in the past and it will make recommendations to ensure that such abuses will not occur in future. The commission's report will enable us to be fair and objective, plan for the future and ensure we protect the nation's children for all time. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Title>Privatisation of Driving Tests: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, mindful of the continuing failure to cope with the backlog of driving tests, calls on the Government to privatise this function before 1 October 2000, and to <Col N="152" /> impose on the agency, so created, a series of strict performance measures.</P>
    <P>I express to the House my deep appreciation that the House delayed this motion for me to reach here on time. I ran into very serious traffic jams for which I cannot blame provisional drivers, much as I would like to. It would have strengthened my case. I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to debate this matter.</P>
    <P>It is one of the ironies of politics that the nastiest jobs go to the nicest people. One of the people in this Government for whom I feel sorry is the Minister with responsibility for the issue of Sellafield who must go through the motions of playing to the gallery without doing it so loudly that the people in London might notice. Similarly, I have immense sympathy for the Minister responsible for driving tests on whom the task has been foisted, as he knows all too well, of defending the indefensible. The Minister is not only one of the nicest people in Irish politics, he is also a person of immense political and ministerial experience and is well able to carry out such chores as this with magisterial indifference. He is a past master in sticking to his brief while at the same time leaving no one in any doubt of his disdain for it. This evening I invite him to live a little more dangerously and to move into what I would call uncharted territory. This is a territory into which few in political life dare to venture. It is a place where someone admits that they got it wrong and must do it differently.</P>
    <P>We are here to discuss the scandal of driving tests. Compared to some of the other matters going on around us as lately as this evening, it is perhaps only a mini-scandal but a scandal nonetheless because motor cars are dangerous objects. In this country alone, they kill close on 500 people every year, far more than were ever killed in Northern Ireland, even at the height of the troubles. It is recognised worldwide that the responsibility of driving a car is not to be taken lightly. That is why we have licensing regimes. We do not tell people, willy-nilly, that they can buy a car, go ahead and drive it. Rightly, we tell them they can have a car but that they must prove they can drive it safely and then they will be let loose on our roads. That in a nutshell is the theory of licensing to which we all subscribe &ndash; the right to drive a car depends on being able to prove that one is able to do so.</P>
    <P>So much for the theory &ndash; what about the practice? Thanks to the failure of the system under the Minister's control, nearly 400,000 people driving cars have either not taken the driving test or have taken the test and failed it. A total of 400,000 people is not a trivial number. As a proportion of the total driving population, it is highly significant. It means that as you drive along, two out of every ten drivers you meet have never passed the test.</P>
    <P>One of the red herrings waved at us later will be that there is no evidence that these 400,000 are <Col N="153" /> a safety hazard on the roads. That is like saying there is no evidence that smoking is bad for you. If we really believed that 400,000 unqualified drivers were no danger, we would save a lot of trouble and money by abolishing driving licences altogether. That is the logical conclusion of arguing that those unqualified drivers do not matter. No one, having thought about it, would be very happy taking that route. Currently, there are over 90,000 people waiting for a driving test. The Minister of State will give us the exact figure down to the last decimal point. The average waiting time for these people is eight months. You can get a hip replacement quicker than a driving test but at least once you receive a new hip, you have it, but if you take a driving test, you may come out of it unqualified.</P>
    <P>Roughly half of the people who sit driving tests fail them. This means they have to go through the process again. That is not the Minister's fault but it throws the total failure of the system into greater relief, because the people who fail the test and start the process have to go to the end of the queue and start the process over again. It is crazy that one can drive on a provisional licence for up to five years. The fact that one can no longer do it for the rest of one's life has been presented as progress, a step in the right direction, but I prefer to see it as a confession of failure. There is a ritual associated with this problem, part of which, no doubt, will be enacted again here. In both Houses of the Oireachtas, debates on this subject are quite common but part of the ritual is that the Minister presents a whole clatter of statistics aimed at defending the indefensible. Part of this sob story is to show how the demand for driving tests has increased during the 1990s, which is clearly a fact, and I am sure we will hear about it. It is also a fact that the driving licence system failed to respond adequately to that change.</P>
    <P>The next part is how an adequate response to the problem was thwarted by the big, bad trade unions who held the Department up to ransom for years when it wanted to expand the service. Whatever the rights and wrongs of that encounter, there was a serious industrial relations problem and failure in the driving test system. All that is now in the past and now we emerge into the sunny uplands. The number of testers has been increased by over 50% and wonderful productivity agreements have been entered into. The upshot now is that there are 101 driving testers whom the Minister will have us believe are capable of doing 200,000 tests a year. Let us leave aside the fact that in the United Kingdom, where they are no slouches on the issue of road safety, they would expect only about half that number of tests from 100 testers.</P>
    <P>Let us give the Minister's system the benefit of the doubt and say perhaps it is possible. What is the light at the end of the tunnel that the Minister is promising? By the end of the year the average wait will be down to ten weeks. The Minister, as <Col N="154" /> part of this hallowed ritual through which we are going this evening, will attempt to suggest, with a straight face, that a ten week delay is perfection. Compared to eight months it is a huge improvement but is it the height of our ambitions? Such a standard of service is quite ridiculous. Let us cut to the chase. When we sweep away all the excuses, all the waves of statistics, the fact remains that the present system has utterly failed.</P>
    <P>That is why I am saying that we should consider privatising it. We have already privatised the national car test so there can be no ideological objection to it. I have no ideological view on this. Let us see if it works and go with it. If something does not work, let us try something else. No one could argue that the present driving test system works. It has failed the nation utterly and instead of listening to a further litany of excuses and giving the Minister yet another ration of time to purge his contempt, we should say instead that enough is enough. The time has come to try something else. Let us see if there is another way. We should either privatise the system completely, like the car testing system, or we should set up a State agency like the Driving Standards Agency in Britain, which is under the State umbrella but which must also adhere to the most stringent performance criteria and guarantees.</P>
    <P>The time has come for action rather than more talk and I suggest this evening should be the start of doing something differently. It is our opportunity to do so. The present system has worked, but let us see if there is a better system. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I am doing so because some of the motion's supporters are excluded from the House because of principles they adhere to.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to second the motion and to re-enter this debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who was here for the last debate on this matter, less than 12 months ago. Senator Quinn was very complimentary to him and I would be the same, but the Minister of State has failed dismally in this matter. Though he may find excuses, I can point to at least one fact. On 12 August 1998 a national newspaper carried the headline: &ldquo;Waiting times for tests to be cut to ten weeks.&rdquo;  However, two years later, on 19 April 2000, the same newspaper carried the headline: &ldquo;Waiting list for driving test up to 50 weeks.&rdquo;  That is the same newspaper, but those are two different facts. We were supposed to have a ten week period at the end of last year, but now some areas have waiting periods of 50 weeks. This is failure and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State can point to the increased number of cars on the road in recent years, but he should have taken that into account when making a commitment to reduce the waiting time to ten weeks; it was going to happen anyhow. In 1996 64,000 cars were sold, while 86,000 were sold <Col N="155" /> in 1998. In the first quarter of this year alone approximately 120,000 have been sold. These figures were always going to increase.</P>
    <P>A public-private partnership in this area has been suggested and that is how I see this issue. The Minister of State said in the Dáil that he could see the theory aspect of this issue being hived off to a public-private partnership. I know there is a move in that direction regarding the NRA and toll roads, so why not in this area also? I see no reason it cannot be done. There is no doubt that the pressure for driving tests will continue into the future. The economy is supposed to grow for the next ten years and we will have to find a resolution to this. If one cannot be found within the resources we are using at present, then it will have to be found some other way.</P>
    <P>I have raised in the past the issue of doing the test through virtual reality computerisation and the Department of the Environment and Local Government has investigated this method's possibilities, though no report ever came out as a result. This would be initially expensive but would be possible with a public-private partnership. The technology is available to do so and those taking such a test would be better qualified as drivers than those taking the test on the road. An individual taking the road test gets into his or her car on a sunny day with light traffic and the test is easy. It might be hard now to find somewhere with light traffic, so the person would be driving very slowly, making it impossible to tell if he or she is a good or bad driver. However, their driving might be adequate to pass the test. That is a test for a short time under certain limited conditions.</P>
    <P>A test involving virtual reality would entail the individual sitting into a machine such as those used to train airline pilots. The machine can present varying circumstances and situations, such as oil or wetness or other hazardous road conditions. One would be guaranteed that an individual would have a much better test than those carried out on the road. Learner drivers often do not know the width of their car and often learn the width by hitting the car off something. This has been proven scientifically. Using the virtual reality method, it would be possible for them to learn the width of the car without endangering themselves or anyone else.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn is right in saying we have failed miserably to meet the demand for driving tests. I have a daughter who is waiting for a test and I know of a young man who is waiting for a test to get full-time employment. Taken together with insurance and vehicle purchase costs, this is putting pressure on young people at the wrong time; they are under sufficient pressure already.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State must now use imagination and take a leap of faith to implement the <Col N="156" /> motion's proposals. I compliment Senator Quinn on his motion and commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm bheith anseo arís ar an ócáid seo chun labhairt faoi na deacrachtaí atá againn ó thaobh an teastas tiománaíocht agus táim buíoch do na Seanadóirí as ucht an seans a thugann san dom chuid den scéal a mhíniú. Nílim fhéin sásta, seachas éinne eile, go mion go bhfuil daoine ag fanacht chomh fada san chun an scrúdú san a dhéanamh. Tá sé ar intinn agam gan a chur suas leis seo mórán achair eile mar tá sé ag cur isteach go mór ar chúrsaí pearsanta &ndash; tá daoine ag fanacht &ndash; agus tá sé ag cur isteach ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta chomh maith. Is an-drochchuí ina bhfuil an scéal seo, go bhfuil liosta chomh fada sin agus go mbíonn ar daoine fanacht ró-fhada chun dul faoin scrúdú.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to Senators for raising this issue and for giving me an opportunity to explain the progress that has been made in improving the delivery of a driving test service in the face of a continuing and unprecedented high level of demand for the service. No matter how one criticises this unsatisfactory situation, we must recognise we are living in extraordinary times. There is huge growth in demand for certain services &ndash; housing is one and driving tests are another. This is a reflection of the growth of the economy and these are problems that, in a way, we should be glad to confront. In other times we had problems arising from lack of employment and emigration and our economy suffered as a result. Demand is one of the major factors involved in the unsatisfactory situation regarding driving tests. I will refer to the other factors before I conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years, the number of applications for driving tests has seen considerable fluctuations. Applications on hand had risen to some 67,000 by 1990, and waiting periods were comparable to those reached in 1998. During 1992, waiting periods were reduced to the order of ten to 12 weeks, with a backlog of under 30,000 applications. This is the customer quality standard which my Department has now set itself and to which we are determined to return as quickly as possible. Senator Quinn seemed to ridicule this, but in the present circumstances to reduce the waiting per<Col N="157" /> iod to ten or 12 weeks would be a major achievement. I am not saying I am happy with this because I would like to see it reduced a great deal more. I would prefer someone being able to get a test within four weeks. However, I am a realist and I recognise that in the present circumstances to achieve a waiting period of ten to 12 weeks would be a major improvement.</P>
    <P>The current waiting time problem started in 1996 when greatly increased numbers of driving test applications were made to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, partly, at least, in response to tighter regulations about the renewal of provisional driving licences. In 1996, applications rose 20% over 1995. However, in 1997, the rate of increase in test applications abated considerably. It was not until 1998 that the trend towards greatly increased driver test demand became fully established and the link between this demand and the buoyant Irish economy asserted itself inescapably. In 1998, there was an increase of 23% over 1997, resulting in an all time record of 146,506 test applications. This trend continued in 1999, which saw the previous record being broken, when a total of 153,389 applications were received. This is an increase of 5% on 1998 and 45% on 1995. Indications so far this year are that we are likely to reach about 170,000 applications this year. If this projection proves accurate, it represents an 11% increase on the record intake in 1999.</P>
    <P>Despite this unprecedented rise in demand, the waiting times for driving tests have improved considerably, with the average waiting time falling from 33 to 26 weeks, while the longest anyone has to wait for a test has fallen from an average of 41 weeks to 29 weeks. The present backlog of driving test applications is some 91,000, down from the high of 102,000 in 1999, but slightly up on the starting figures for 2000.</P>
    <P>Improvements to the service in 1999 were achieved by increasing the numbers and productivity of the driver testers. Very significant additional resources have been allocated to the driver testing service, which now numbers 100 testers, compared to 66 in 1998. The recruitment of additional testers, both permanent and contract, followed the holding of a competition by the Civil Service Commission and lengthy negotiations with the driver testers' union, to agree greater productivity and the recruitment of contract testers. Additional staff and productivity, together with Saturday working, has increased the testing capacity of the service by over 90,000 tests annually.</P>
    <P>Access to the service has also been improved through the provision of two new test centres in Tallaght and Raheny. In response to the upsurge in demand in the current year, the Department is taking steps for the immediate employment of retired testers and the recruitment of further testers from the Civil Service Commission panel. We are also seeking to negotiate a bonus scheme with <Col N="158" /> existing testers with a view to maximising their productivity. These measures should bring us close to meeting our target of ten weeks maximum waiting time for an appointment by the end of this year, despite the strongly rising demand.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that where an individual requires a test for urgent reasons, they will be facilitated as far as possible. During the most recent period for which figures are available, 38% of applicants were tested within 15 weeks. If Senator Coogan knows of someone whose employment prospects are affected because they have to wait for a driving test, that person should make that known to the Department. As I have said on numerous occasions and as most Members of the Oireachtas are aware, we will always seek to accommodate such a person where they can genuinely show employment is being denied to them if they do not have their driving test. We have honoured this commitment, as can be seen by the figure of 38% of applicants being tested within 15 weeks.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need to provide a testing service which can offer tests within a reasonable period of time and I assure the Seanad that both I and my Department will take the measures necessary to ensure that a quality service is provided. I am determined to bring progressive and substantial improvement to the quality of the driving test service provided to the public and in particular to end present excessive and unacceptable waiting times.</P>
    <P>The driver testing service has been examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who has prepared a value for money report on the service which has been submitted to the Department and will shortly be presented to the Oireachtas. The report makes some useful recommendations that are capable of being addressed within the existing organisational structure of the service. It identifies three main areas where change is needed in order to improve the service. These relate to uniformity in the standard of the driving test, waiting times and the supply of driving tests, and the cost of providing the service. The report also identifies the broader issue of the lack of responsiveness of the service in the face of rapidly rising demand.</P>
    <P>I intend that this report will shortly be presented to the Oireachtas, together with a considered response on my part. I assure Senators that this response will take account of the need to make the service more responsive to customers' needs and will address the need to ensure that the testing service will, in the future, be able to respond to fluctuations in demand and deliver a quality service to the public. Improving the responsiveness of the service will include the need to consider how to improve the delivery of the service and in this context alternative methods of delivery would have to be considered. Such methods could include a restructuring of the <Col N="159" /> existing service, the establishment of an independent agency or even the outsourcing of the service to the private sector. I have an open mind on these issues which will require careful consideration. As Senator Coogan mentioned, my preference and that of my party is that this service be privatised.</P>
    <P>The parameters for the driving test now reflect the high standards laid down in EU directives which facilitates the recognition of Irish driving licences in the EU and internationally. The driving test must determine whether an applicant is competent to drive a vehicle safely and with due regard for the safety and convenience of other persons. The role of driver testing in ensuring that drivers reach an acceptable level of competence is important in the context of road safety. The issue of driver competence is emphasised in the Government's road safety strategy, a subject to which I will return later.</P>
    <P>A related issue that is often raised in the context of road safety and the waiting period for driving tests is the number of provisional licence holders on the roads, which was mentioned by the proposer of this motion. Some misconceptions exist in relation to the number of persons driving on provisional driving licences and also in relation to the arrangement governing the number of provisional licences which a person may obtain. I take this opportunity to set the record straight.</P>
    <P>In relation to the number of provisional licences a person may obtain for any particular category of vehicle, there is no limit. The first two licences are each valid for a period of two years. However, in order to be entitled to a third or subsequent provisional licence for any particular category of vehicle, a person must have undergone a driving test for that category within the preceding two years or, failing that, have a driving test appointment arranged, in which case the provisional licence is granted for one year only.</P>
    <P>Another misconception is that the estimated 380,000 provisional licence holders are driving around without having ever undergone the driving test. This is not the case. In 1999, approximately 37% of applicants were undergoing the test for at least the second time. The overall pass rate for driving tests in 1999 was 59%, nearly 60%, and the pass rates for first time and non-first time applicants were of a similar order. The figure in the UK is 46%.</P>
    <P>A related concern is the accompaniment of learner drivers by qualified drivers. Provisional licence holders are required by law to be accompanied by a driver qualified to drive the vehicle being driven, except where the driver holds a second provisional driving licence to drive cars, or is the holder of a provisional licence to drive motorcycles or tractors or work vehicles. A car learner driver is only exempt from being accompanied <Col N="160" /> during the currency of a second provisional licence, which is valid for two years.</P>
    <P>The intention behind the exemption provision on being accompanied is that learner drivers are required to have at least two years' driving experience accompanied by qualified drivers before being permitted to drive unaccompanied. They are deemed to have sufficient previous experience accompanied by qualified drivers to be allowed drive unaccompanied during the validity of the second provisional licence. The fact that they are required to be accompanied on a third or subsequent provisional licence is an incentive to pass the driving test during the currency of the second provisional licence if they wish to remain driving unaccompanied. Notwithstanding the fact that many provisional licence holders will have undergone the test, we recognise that the number of Irish drivers relying on provisional licences is too high. We are determined to reduce this proportion significantly.</P>
    <P>The Government is in the process of introducing a theoretical test of knowledge in addition to the practical driving test. The test will cover the rules of the road, risk perception, hazard awareness and good driving behaviour. The operation of the theory test will be contracted out to a private company as a private public partnership project. Success at the theory test will be a prerequisite for obtaining a first provisional driving licence and will ensure that provisional licence holders have an adequate knowledge of the rules of the road before being allowed to drive on the road. It is envisaged that the test will be an information technology based system, that is, carried out through a computer based medium with multiple choice questions on a computer screen. Tenders have recently been invited and it is expected that the contract for the operation of the test will be awarded in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The Government's road safety strategy sets out to make a measurable impact on road deaths and injuries in Ireland over its five year term. The strategy's primary target is to achieve at least a 20% reduction in deaths and serious injuries by 2002 relative to 1997. This target will be achieved through a concerted effort in the three key areas of speeding, alcohol use and seat belt wearing and the implementation of a range of measures designed to improve human behaviour and to make our vehicles and roads safer. We are about to commence the use of fixed cameras on some of our major motorways. Therefore, drivers had better be careful.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the Government road safety strategy there have been substantial improvements in terms of accident reduction; 3% fewer people died on the roads in 1998 than in 1997, 12% fewer people were seriously injured in 1998 than in 1997. This represents the lowest number of serious injuries for the last decade and constitutes significant progress towards the five year target in the Government's strategy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> More recent data from the Garda Síochána indicate that there were 413 road deaths in 1999 compared with 458 in 1998. This would represent a reduction of some 13% in road deaths relative to 1997 in the second full year of operation of the Government's road safety strategy.</P>
    <P>There has also been substantial progress in the implementation of the measures set out in the strategy designed to help achieve the main targets of reducing road deaths and serious injuries. That is evidenced by the number of fines issued for drink driving, for driving without wearing a seat belt and for speeding. There has been an enormous increase in the detection rate and the enforcement levels by the Garda. I thank them for their extremely good co-operation and police work in this area.</P>
    <P>International research establishes that human action is a contributory factor in more than 90% of road accidents. The road safety strategy accordingly emphasises policies and measures aimed at improving road user behaviour and establishing a culture of road use that is both precautionary and pro-active in relation to road safety. The strategy also aligns itself with road safety plans from other countries in recognising that the modification of human behaviour in the areas of speed, alcohol use and seat belt wearing holds the greatest and most immediate potential for realising road safety gains.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy proposes improvements in driver training and testing as well as in educational programmes as complements to its primary counter-measures in relation to speeding, alcohol use and seat belt wearing. I recently announced proposals for improving the quality control and regulation of driving instruction. These include the recognition of certain private approved bodies, which would operate to quality standards and train or assess and register driving instructors. Registration with such approved bodies would exempt an individual driving instructor from the otherwise general obligation to undergo, from 1 January 2000 &ndash; I think that should be from 1 January 2002 &ndash; a competency test of their ability to instruct.</P>
    <P>I recently announced an initiative by the Irish Motorcycle Action Group, MAG, to establish a network of motorcycle instructors. Funding will be advanced to the Irish Rider Training Association, which has been established under the auspices of MAG, to enable it to carry out this task. There is a commitment in the road safety strategy to address the issue of initial practical training for motorcyclists before they go on the public road. The establishment of the Irish Rider Training Association responds to this concern. It is envisaged that the IRTA will assess and train potential instructors who will then be available to deliver instruction in their local areas. I look forward to a reduction in motorcycle fatalities as a result of the greater availability of trained motorcycle instructors and urge all motorcyclists, particularly <Col N="162" /> novice riders, to avail of the training service that will be available from the IRTA in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I am acutely aware of the widespread concern about long waiting periods for driving tests. While we still manage to provide reasonably timely tests for urgent cases, my Department recognises that a much better service is required for our customers as a matter of course. We have already committed extensive additional resources to the driver testing service and we will work to restore it to a high and guaranteed quality standard as quickly as possible and make the service more responsive to customer needs.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the other House the industrial relations problems &ndash; this was reflected in some of Senator Quinn's comments &ndash; that have bedevilled this area of employment in the public sector, the employment of driver testers and the extraordinary lines of demarcation of work practices that have come into use. The length of time it took my officials to negotiate with the union representing the driver testers was extraordinary. In mentioning this I am open to the accusation that I am pointing the finger or laying the blame somewhere else.</P>
    <P>It is important that Senators should be aware of this situation. It is also important that driver testers should be aware that on a number of occasions I have been taken to task by my colleagues in the Dáil and in the Seanad about the unsatisfactory position regarding driver testers and the length of time people have to wait to take their driving test. I am aware of the problems in this area. I cannot simply employ the number of additional testers I require, with the approval of the Minister for Finance which I would have, and deploy them in the appropriate centres to ensure that we can give the public the service they deserve and Members of this House are rightly seeking.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that the kind of review I am considering will include serious consideration of the other alternatives I mentioned. It is not a pleasant task to make forecasts as to the reduction that can be achieved in a year and discover at the end of the year that we did not achieve that level of reduction. That is partly due to the extraordinary increase in demand, but that is not the sole reason we are not able to get on top of this issue. There are other factors in the industrial relations area that up to now have been a serious issue. I have been tolerant and patient in dealing with this issue, as have my officials who have been operating on behalf of the Government in these negotiations. I accept that this House and the other House are looking for another way to solve this problem, and I will give that serious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State had been more precise about the demarcations, etc. The truth is that each tester in his Department, and they are largely established civil servants, is cur<Col N="163" /> rently doing nine tests per day, which is above the European norm. Whatever the cause of the Minister's problems, it is not because the people will not do the job. It is a cheap shot to imply at the end of a long speech that the workforce is the cause of the problem. It is an even cheaper shot, and intellectually indefensible, to believe that to convert it into some sort of quasi-private single agency would transform all these problems. That would leave the Minister with over 100 established civil servants with nothing to do, whom he cannot and will not sack, and the agency will have to recruit more people.</P>
      <P>The current salary of a driver tester is somewhere between £15,500 and £21,500 per year. I do not know what the overheads of the Minister's Department are in this regard but I do know that there is only one chief instructor and there are only six supervisors, so the overheads are outside that. I know the accommodation most of them use is hopelessly inadequate and that training is virtually non-existent once they are on the job. None of us is perfect but the reason Ministers get paid four times as much as driving instructors is because they are responsible for their areas, and it is always the first bolt of inadequate managers to blame their workforce.</P>
      <P>The fundamental problem is that somewhere in this country there is a body of opinion which still has difficulty getting used to the fact that we are not the country we were ten years ago. It was inevitable that if we had a 60% growth in the number of people at work, there would be a spectacular growth in the number of cars, but it took us until the year 2000 to figure out that that meant we needed better roads and public transport. It is taking us the same length of time to figure out that we have a problem, which needs to be addressed, with the way we train and test our drivers and improve road safety.</P>
      <P>The best piece of news in the Minister's contribution is the 19% drop in road fatalities between 1998 and 1999. That is a considerable achievement, given the increased number of cars on the roads, and is an indication of what can be done when resources are allocated to a particular area. When the Garda authorities were allocated resources to enforce drink driving, seat belt and speeding laws, the consequences were clear. Even with the extraordinary number of young drivers, which is a fact of life because of the growth in the workforce, the number of road fatalities has stabilised and indeed reduced. We should all be delighted with that achievement because we have spent too many days in this House talking about a catalogue of horrors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no excuse to turn on the testers. We need to expand their numbers, but it should not be part of a driver tester's job to work on Saturdays. It is a peculiar definition of work practice or restrictive practices to tell people that the job has changed, and therefore they must work on Satur<Col N="164" /> days. That is not fair, regardless of whether it is in the supermarket business or in the public service. There is a civilised world all around us &ndash; according to the competitiveness league referred to in an article in today's <i>Irish Independent,</i> they are countries such as the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands which believe that people are entitled to shorter working hours and longer holidays. That is what they call the civilised side of affluence. Our view of affluence is that it means we give people more money but we take away from them the sort of security and time in which to enjoy the increased affluence. Let us not turn on people who resist requests to scuttle the lifestyle they have enjoyed in the interests of some peculiar concept of efficiency. Let us deal with the fundamental problem, which is that those who were given the job of planning, managing and organising this area failed to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that provisional licence holders are required by law to be accompanied by a driver qualified to drive the vehicle being driven, except where the driver holds a second provisional driving licence. He said that was to ensure that the provisional driver would be accompanied for at least two years, but there is no reason for them even to get into a car in the first two years. The reason for that is to reduce the demand for tests. If people had to do a driving test before they got the second provisional licence, the demand would have increased. It is disingenuous to include some sort of road safety motive into what was an administrative convenience. The thought was that they could probably deal with the numbers if they let them slip until the third provisional licence. The idea was that for the first application, the rules would remain as they are, they would be changed for the second and for the third, they would put pressure on people to apply to do a test. It was wrong to pretend that was motivated by some idea of skill and training when there is no reason for anybody to even step inside a car.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the requirement that people must apply for a driving test before they can get a third licence is no guarantee that in the previous four years those people even stepped inside a car because there is no regulation on driving instruction, which is privatised and competitive, and I gather from the Minister that will not be introduced for another few years. There is a well documented case of an individual who was sending people in to do tests for public service vehicles and the individual who was training them subsequently appeared at a driving test centre to get his own full licence, having been masquerading as an instructor for some time before that.</P>
    <P>The real problem is that nobody wanted to deal with this issue properly and in an organised fashion. Much of what we are doing now is being done because the European Union told us that if we do not tighten up this area and operate it properly, Irish driving licences will not be recog<Col N="165" /> nised as valid in the rest of the EU because we will be so far out of step with it. There are civilised countries throughout Europe which have recognised that people have to be taught to drive properly and it cannot be hit and miss. That means that driving schools have to be properly regulated and run only by people who are competent and capable of doing the job properly.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Senator Quinn wants to do with the privatised service.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn and I will discuss the issue again. I am far from persuaded by the arguments about the efficiencies of the private sector. Incidentally, I am a little disturbed that the Department should have access to a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General before the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is a bit peculiar because the Comptroller and Auditor General essentially reports to the Committee of Public Accounts, which then investigates his findings.</P>
      <P>If someone can convince me, on the basis of an objective and independent evaluation, that privatisation is inherently more efficient, I will become quite keen on the idea. However, I have found no evidence to support claims in favour of privatisation and everything I have ever read about it is selective and driven by a particular agenda. A classic example of this is the report on Aer Rianta which is full of ideological assumptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was debated on a previous occasion when the Minister of State indicated the difficulties he is encountering in trying to provide a service commensurate with the requirements of the public. Statistics illustrate the difficulty involved in providing such a service. As the Minister of State indicated, there were 67,000 applications on hand in 1990 but, due to efforts made at that time, by 1992 there were only 30,000 people on the waiting list who were only obliged to wait ten to 12 weeks before being tested. This shows that progress can be made in this area.</P>
      <P>Ireland's population has grown considerably in the past ten years and the number of cars on our roads has also increased. Young people are becoming more and more part of the consumer society and one of the first indications that they are maturing is their desire to drive and own their own cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that there were 146,000 test applications in 1998 and 153,000 in 1999 and he estimated that there will be 170,000 this year. A commitment must be made to provide tests for the people who made these applications and the Minister of State said that efforts have been made in that regard. On the last occasion we debated this issue he indicated that <Col N="166" /> the number of driving instructors was to be increased by 16 but, subsequently, it rose by 35 which means that there has been a 50% increase in the number of driving instructors. The Minister of State also stated on that occasion that he had encountered difficulties in negotiations with the relevant union to bring about this increase.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that any public service provided by the State should be of a satisfactory quality. If it is not and if a private company could provide a better service we should investigate the possibility of privatisation. Unlike Senator Ryan, I do not see this as an ideological argument. It is a matter of pragmatism which revolves around how to deliver the best service at the best price. That is the way business operates and the Government should employ the same methods.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn's contribution appeared to contain a subliminal message that delays in granting driving tests to the large number of people awaiting them was, in some way, a huge contributory factor to road accidents. I do not know if that is the case. However, on the previous occasion we debated this matter the Minister of State indicated that the Garda had stated that while those under 25 years of age were involved in 36% of accidents, there was no evidence to suggest that provisional licence holders were more responsible for causing accidents than any other group of motorists.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to reconcile those figures because one would assume that most provisional licence holders are in the lower age bracket. Therefore, one would need to have access to the full statistics. It is peculiar that we do not have precise statistics. Someone should compile statistics in relation to provisional licence holders and the number of accidents in which they are involved. We should not try to extrapolate from the figures in order to guess whether they are a factor. Perhaps the Minister and the Department could take this matter up with the Central Statistics Office to see if such statistics could be compiled.</P>
    <P>Many provisional licence holders drive infrequently. Often these people seek to delay taking their test and they encounter difficulties when their second provisional licence lapses. At that stage, they do not have the necessary driving experience which would equip them to pass the test. Perhaps the Department could examine this matter. My daughter, Angela, holds a provisional licence but she drives infrequently. I can see her running into difficulties when her second licence expires because she is not equipped to drive. She will only drive occasionally when she is accompanied either by her mother or me. There are many people who fall into this category and I wonder if a distinction could be made in respect of them. These people add to the numbers on waiting lists for driving tests but their presence is not indicative of the real need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> I concur with the Minister of State's comments in response to Senator Coogan's remarks. The Department has a facility which it is very disposed to utilising to assist applicants for jobs who require full driving licences in order to obtain employment. This system works well and it is important that it is in place. It may not matter to many people who apply for driving licences whether they are tested in three or six months. However, there is a category of people to whom having a full driving licence is absolutely crucial from a career point of view.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State that, in the absence of statistics to the contrary, a distinction must be made between safety and the backlog of driving tests. Speeding, drink driving and failure to wear seatbelts have always been flagged as the three main contributory factors in road accidents. It is a matter of improving enforcement and detection levels in respect of these factors. The introduction of television cameras and increased levels of policing on our roads by the Garda will help in this regard. The gardaí are to be complimented for their work in this area and their increased presence on our roads will, hopefully, lead to a downturn in fatalities.</P>
    <P>I wish to respond to Senator Ryan who made a disingenuous point. In my opinion, the Minister of State clearly indicated that he was dissatisfied with the quality of the service being provided to the public at large. He stated that the increase in the number of those applying for driving tests was one factor in the delays being caused. Obviously, another factor is the difficulty in increasing the number of driving testers because of difficulties which have arisen in negotiations with the unions.</P>
    <P>If the public service unions do not adopt a more enlightened approach to such negotiations, the number of people employed in the public service will decrease. SPCs in county council areas are one example of this. Their implementation has been delayed for 18 months as a result of union difficulties. A decision was made by the Government and endorsed by councils throughout the country but it cannot be implemented because people in senior management positions in the relevant representative body have taken issue with it.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that we introduce a system which will allow us to deal with the increased numbers of those applying for driving tests. Demand has increased and, while the Minister has at his disposal 100,000 driving instructors throughout the country, I welcome the decision to engage retired testers to help reduce the waiting lists. I am glad an initiative has been introduced to regulate the affairs of driving instructors. The quality of driving instruction on offer determines the pass ratio which, at 59%, is too low. Driving instructors could be employed on a short-term basis as testers at times when the number of people applying for tests reaches levels <Col N="168" /> which require urgent attention. I hope the initiatives to which the Minister of State referred will be pursued further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to participate in this debate. The motion is timely. Driving tests have become an issue in recent years, particularly in recent months.</P>
      <P>There is great concern at the delays in providing driving tests. It is causing much hardship. Returning emigrants who have spent many years abroad, having left these shores at an early age, find they have no driving licence. They are obliged to seek a provisional licence and then apply for the driving test. The consequent delays mean that people who are offered jobs cannot take them up because they do not have a full driving licence. Constituents regularly come to politicians' clinics inquiring about cancellations. Many politicians will confirm that this happens on a weekly basis.</P>
      <P>We are sometimes critical of the staff in Government Departments but it must be said that the staff in the driving test office are courteous and try their best to help. It was a noticeable and welcome feature when I made representations to those offices.</P>
      <P>I often ponder the issue of training drivers and preparing them for the roads. The number of cars has increased enormously and the quality of the roads has greatly improved. As a result people are speeding far more often and the roads have become more dangerous. A great deal of expertise is now required to be a competent driver.</P>
      <P>I often wonder why driving is not a subject in school. The best time to train young people is when they are attending school. This is something we should consider for the future. Lives are being lost on the roads every day and people tend to blame young people and their speeding. It is time to take a close look at the proper training of car drivers, particularly young drivers, and serious consideration should be given to including it in the school curriculum. Driving a vehicle, whether it is a truck, car or tractor, is part of everybody's life. There are many lives at risk but the difference between a good, mediocre and bad driver can be vast.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan spoke in favour of a public private partnership arrangement rather than the complete privatisation suggested by Senator Quinn. I support Senator Quinn because something must be done to improve matters. The current situation and the consequent delays are unacceptable. Indeed, there are discrepancies between counties and centres. Everybody has heard people say: &ldquo;I will go to a different centre and I will pass it.&rdquo;  That is not good enough and it must be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I will support whatever is required to improve the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The driving testing service has <Col N="169" /> faced many challenges over recent years. The years 1998 and 1999 saw successive record numbers of applications for tests with 146,503 and 153,389 applications respectively. The trend so far suggests that these figures will be surpassed this year.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on how he is dealing with the backlog. The Department recruited 35 testers during 1998-1999. This increased testing capacity by over 90,000 tests annually. The Department has also negotiated certain productivity measures to increase overall capacity. Current testing capacity is approximately 200,000 and the Department is committed to recruiting additional testers to meet the target waiting time of ten weeks. If the waiting time were reduced even to 15 weeks it would be a huge improvement. Despite the ever increasing level of applications, the average waiting time has been reduced from 33 to 26 weeks.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are in place to test applicants who require an urgent test at short notice for employment purposes. The Minister referred to this. It is a considerate development. There are currently almost 91,000 applications on hand but 15,800 of the applicants have indicated that they are not immediately available to undertake a test. Although the figures look bad, the situation is not as bad as it appears. If the Department recruits additional testers this year, the waiting list can be reduced dramatically. I hope this will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the House is having a debate on driving tests and the lack of centres throughout the country. The Minister of State said that the Government is in the process of introducing a theoretical test in addition to a practical driving test, which I sought many years ago. This has been in operation in the United States and many other countries for a number of years. People can seek a provisional licence which is handed out over the counter. In most cases people just glance at a book but they do not have a real knowledge of the rules of the road. To obtain a provisional licence in other countries, one must pass a test on the rules of the road, together with an eye test and so on. When one is called to do a driving test, one must undergo a driving test only, not a test on the rules of the road and so on. One can then concentrate on the driving test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in this country are at a disadvantage on the day of the test because they may be confused if they have to concentrate on doing a test on the rules of the road. This may result in their taking their eye off the ball and making a slight mistake such as hitting the kerb when parking the car or doing a three point turn. They may then have to repeat the test. I am surprised at the numbers of people who fail the test, even though the Minister of State said earlier that more people pass the test on the first occasion in this country than in the UK. I believe the new test being introduced in <Col N="170" /> the autumn will reduce the failure rate to approximately 25%.</P>
    <P>Many are critical of young people driving with provisional licences. Young people nowadays are very confident and should be complimented on their driving ability. While people may complain about the numbers waiting to do the driving test, I am pleased so many are applying to do so. This indicates that the economy is going forward. There was a time when 25,000 and 30,000 people coming out of third level education took the first boat or plane out of the country and did the test in other countries. These people were taken out of the system. However, all these people are now in the system which is good for the country. I am pleased the Minister of State has introduced regulations to privatise the testing and to bring back people who were formerly involved in the business. This is the way forward. </P>
    <P>The Minister of State quoted statistics which show that the number of road deaths are decreasing. Many were critical of the NCT when it was introduced because they thought it was too severe. I disagree with this because if a car is not roadworthy it should not be on the road. Cars that are not roadworthy cause many accidents and I am pleased people are buying better quality cars.</P>
    <P>There is a regulation whereby one can exchange a UK licence for an Irish driving licence. If one travels to the United States with an Irish driving licence, one can convert that into a US driving licence without difficulty. On the other hand, if one has an American driving licence and wishes to take up residence in this country, one cannot convert their US licence into an Irish driver's licence. This is unfair and something the Minister of State should consider.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate and compliment Senator Quinn on tabling the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate. The number of drivers has increased dramatically in the past ten years. One can witness this increase on any given day, one of the main reasons for which is the number of young people taking up driving. As a consequence, there are obvious problems for young people trying to obtain full licences. Testing is one of the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State outlined in his speech the efforts being made to deal with the backlog of driving tests, which by any standards is a very large number and must be dealt with. While in general I support the concept of the motion to privatise driving tests for drivers with provisional licences, this must be taken step by step. There must be a coherent development in the quality of drivers. I welcome the requirement for drivers with provisional licences to take a written test in order to obtain a full driver's licence. When I began driving many years ago, there were not the large numbers of vehicles on the roads that there <Col N="171" /> are today. Beginning to drive today is much more intimidating than it was 20 years ago, or even ten years ago, therefore, the concept of a written test is a very good one.</P>
    <P>No doubt there is a need to reduce the timescale between applying for a test and taking the test. Privatisation over a period could lead to a considerable reduction in the waiting time. I acknowledge the Minister of State has introduced considerable improvements which have led to a far greater number of tests taking place. However, the improvements do not seem to be keeping pace with the numbers requiring the tests. This is probably partly due to the Celtic tiger economy.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely referred to the quality of cars on our roads. There is no question that the quality of cars is improving on an ongoing basis following the introduction of the national car testing scheme. As I travelled on the motorway this morning I witnessed the engine of a car blow. I have not seen that happen for a long time. There has been a great improvement in the quality of cars on the roads and the national car testing scheme will ensure this remains the case.</P>
    <P>Given the introduction of transition year in the education system, there is a great opportunity to educate young people of 15, 16 and 17 years of age in the whole concept of driving. In the future most people will drive cars and there is an opportunity during transition year to educate young people on the rules of the road and so on. Perhaps centres could be set up throughout the country where people could do a driving course in a controlled environment before going on the roads. These opportunities should be considered.</P>
    <P>Those failing the test can drive away provided they are accompanied by a fully licensed driver. That should not be allowed because if somebody has failed a test, for whatever reason, they are not deemed competent to drive a car without a supervised driver beside them. Some people continue to drive on their fourth, fifth and sixth licence. This aspect needs to be assessed in greater detail.</P>
    <P>Privatisation is the way to proceed. If we are properly to address the issue of the quality of drivers, we need to investigate if there is a need for fully licensed drivers to undergo further testing after a number of years. It may be unpalatable, but drivers can get into bad driving habits. It might be no harm to introduce a system to check and ensure that our driving is up to standard before we go on the roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the speakers for their contributions. I am not sure about Senator Gibbons's last suggestion. I do not fancy having to take a test. I never passed a test because I obtained my licence at a time when it was not required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was a good debate from which I learnt much. I also learnt much from the Minster of <Col N="172" /> State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy. His statistics indicating that the 33 week waiting list has been reduced to 26 weeks is hardly a cause of pride. There have been 170,000 applications this year, an increase of 45% on four years ago. I understand the problems here.</P>
    <P>I was most surprised by the failure rate. Some 59% of those doing the test pass on the first occasion. It means that 41% fail. It reminds me of the joke posed by the question: &ldquo;Can you prove you are sane?&rdquo; and answered by: &ldquo;You cannot? I have a certificate to prove I am sane because I got it from the mental hospital when I was released.&rdquo;  Here, 41% of drivers have proved they cannot drive properly, yet they continue to drive on the roads. That worries me.</P>
    <P>However, I was impressed by the Minster of State, Deputy Molloy. His heart is in the right place, but he defended the indefensible. He referred to the extraordinary increase in demand as if he wanted us to sympathise with him because he was doing his best. He knows the answer is marketplace, which would anticipate this increase in demand.</P>
    <P>I do not have a hang-up about the marketplace being the right solution. Senator Coogan referred to the possibility of a public-private sector partnership. Something must be done and the marketplace is one way in which demand can be anticipated. If we had adhered to the old system for telephones in the 1970s, it could not have handled the changes in that area. If we had left the airline business in the hands of one or two State owned carriers we could not have anticipated the number of people travelling by air.</P>
    <P>I will not oppose the amendment. It is actions that count. Approximately 500 people are killed on our roads every year and approximately 400,000 unqualified people drive on them. If we believe driver performance is an issue in road safety &ndash; as we must &ndash; then nobody could defend our system in absolute terms. They might defend it on the basis that it is the best way of dealing with problems as they stand, but nobody could claim that we could continue with it on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>The present system will never give us an acceptable result. There is another way. While we can talk about the way things were in the past, how they have been improved and the excuses for the present difficulties, we need to ask if we have confidence that this system can deliver what the country is entitled to expect in the immediate future. Regrettably, it cannot.</P>
    <P>The facts force us to only one conclusion. We must find another way, whatever it is. It is not difficult. We do not have to make it up. It is there for us to copy and it can be done in the private sector or by a public-private sector partnership. It could also be done by a public sector agency that is bounded and tightly controlled by performance targets. Whatever way we favour, it <Col N="173" /> could be up and running within months. It is not difficult &ndash; it is not rocket science. We can solve the problem almost immediately. Why do we not do so? I will take that question with me when I drive home tonight. I hope I drive very safely and that I do no bump into some of the 41% of drivers who failed their test but are permitted to continue to drive.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's heart is in the right place. He has shown it in the way he has tackled the taxi problem. This is his opportunity to grasp this issue and resolve it immediately. Two of my colleagues had apparently other things to do and were not available to second the motion. I appreciate the support of the Fine Gael bench and I thank Senator Coogan for seconding it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for attending the House to take this Adjournment matter, which calls on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide a sewerage scheme of the Robinstown area of Mullingar. This area is on the periphery of Mullingar and is adjacent to the new Mullingar bypass. It has implications for the development of the area on the north side of the town.</P>
      <P>The matter is concerned with the surface water and foul drainage for Robinstown and the impact of surface water discharge to the River Brosna, which flows through the town. There is a real possibility of flooding, which occurred on two occasions in the past 20 years and caused major damage.</P>
      <P>The issue also concerns the overall sewerage network and its capacity to extend beyond the current service area. We have a combined system in parts of the town where the surface water and the foul sewer flow into the one system. In other parts of the town the storm gullies overflow and this water flows into the Brosna and into Lough Ennell. This is something we want to prevent at all costs. The situation does not allow for development in the Robinstown area and will hinder the overall enactment of the Robinstown action plan which has been considered and will be considered further by Westmeath County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall area concerned is very large and is situated between the Castlepollard and Delvin roads. Westmeath County Council wishes to con<Col N="174" /> duct a survey of the town and its environs. Funding will have to be provided by the Department of the Environment and Local Government for this study. Furthermore, one of the oldest local authority schemes in the town is in the Robinstown area. Much of the development which has taken place to date is serviced by septic tanks, although some houses, such as those in Sherwood Park, an estate in the locality, have been serviced by the main trunk sewer. The water table in the area is especially high.</P>
    <P>To complement housing and industrial development, it is imperative that money be provided for the study to which I have referred and for a sewerage scheme which, I hope, will come about in the fullness of time. I hope the Minister of State will have good news when he responds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Glynn for raising this matter. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The provision of modern environmental infrastructure to support our economic objectives is a high priority of the Government. This has been and continues to be well demonstrated by the huge level of investment in water and sanitary services throughout the country. In 1999 spending reached £275 million. This represented an increase of 50% over 1998 and double the 1996 figure and was by far the highest ever annual provision for water services infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The prospects for future investment are equally positive. Under the new national development plan almost £3 billion has been earmarked for the provision of new and upgraded water supply and waste water treatment projects between now and 2006. This is a threefold increase on the total spend under the 1994-99 plan. The Minister will shortly announce details of the water services investment programme for the period 2000-02 which will set the Government's medium-term strategy for addressing the infrastructural needs of our still growing economy.</P>
      <P>County Westmeath has benefited substantially from higher spending on water services in recent years. Improved services for the towns of Moate and Tyrrellspass have recently been completed while schemes are in progress in Athlone and Mullingar. As part of the Government's serviced land initiative, proposals in respect of Kinnegad, Coosan and an extension to the drainage area adjacent to Mullingar have been approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Robinstown, a brief for the extension of the Mullingar sewerage scheme to include this area was drawn up by the council and submitted to the Department in 1999. At that stage the scheme fell to be reassessed by the council as part of the review of capital needs which the Department asked each local authority to carry out to <Col N="175" /> assist in the preparation of the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006.</P>
    <P>While the Robinstown proposal was included in the assessment of needs subsequently prepared by Westmeath County Council, unfortunately the assessment failed to assign relative priorities to individual schemes as had been requested by the Department. Decisions on allocating capital funding to the county under the three year water ser<Col N="176" /> vices investment programme to be announced shortly will, therefore, have to be taken without the benefit of the council having identified its priorities. Nonetheless, Senator Glynn's comments will be taken into account in making further decisions on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 19 April 2000.</P>
