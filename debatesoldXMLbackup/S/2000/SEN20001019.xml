      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed Order of Business is No. 3, statements on the White Paper on Rural Development (resumed). When we last discussed this on 9 March the time agreed was ten minutes for spokespersons and eight minutes for others. I am prepared to review that if required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government lost the plot in the way it orders business in the House? Today's business is derisory. Almost everybody on my side of the House who wants to speak on No. 3 has spoken already, so they are barred from speaking again. We have no speakers to offer. Four or five Members from the Fine Gael Party have spoken, including all our spokespersons. We may have one speaker today.</P>
      <P>This is a contemptible way to organise business. What is happening? A Chathaoirligh, I do not think it is right that Dáil broadcasts should be relayed on the television monitor during the Order of Business, much as I admire looking at the Tánaiste.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a simple request to the Deputy Leader on the Order of Business yesterday and to the Leader on the previous day. I <Col N="238" /> asked that the old practice be restored whereby Members on the Opposition benches would be given a couple of weeks notice of likely impending business. This was done in the past. It is a modest request to enable Members order their own business. On the first day the Leader replied with a bluster on what a great Government he led, which is the job of the Taoiseach as far as I know, and yesterday the Deputy Leader, almost vying to out-bluster the Leader, responded in much the same way.</P>
      <P>It is a simple request. We would like to know, as far as possible in advance, what business is planned so that we can organise our business. I remind the Deputy Leader that the business of the House is done largely through co-operation. If the Opposition cannot get that simple type of co-operation we will have to look at the way we co-operate with the Government.</P>
      <P>Given that so little business is proposed today, could Government time be provided to hold a debate on the words of Mr. Justice Kelly yesterday, when he indicated he is about to cite three Ministers for contempt? It is a scandal that this situation, where the State cannot provide secure accommodation for a disturbed young child, and which has been ongoing for months, has not been resolved. What is happening? We have a right to know. I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange for the Minister responsible to attend the House today, not the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, who is sent out to bat &ndash; she does it well &ndash; on these difficult occasions. We have the time to debate this very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordering of business has been raised by my group over the last week. It is understandable when the House returns that there is difficulty in ordering business, but the business proposed for today does not amount to a day's sitting. It is inappropriate.</P>
      <P>On No. 3 I suggest that speakers have 15 minutes. I also suggest we take another item. Members have asked for debates on various matters. There was a recent commitment to hold a debate on education. We have sought a further debate on the Shannon River Council. There has also been a request for a debate on drugs policy. Many items could have been added to today's business. We should consider doing that.</P>
      <P>Yesterday on the Order of Business I raised a matter involving the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am glad that, following a report of the proceedings in the House yesterday, he has somewhat moved back his position and has played the oldest trick in the politician's book of blaming the media for incorrectly reporting him and then blaming me for misinterpreting him. One way or another the fact that he has backed off to some extent is welcome but I hope he has learned the lesson that consultation is the best way of doing business. I will take up with him and with Government the question of the lack of consultation in a partnership context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a number of debates on the ques<Col N="239" /> tion of housing and we have seen the impact of the various Bacon reports. There is a view that some change is taking place in the housing market and we now need to examine the details of that. There are aspects of the whole housing area that we need to examine, and one in particular which many people will understand. People who buy houses often have to get support in the repayments and that can mean that their friends or others have to share the house with them but in doing that, under the third Bacon report they lose the improvement in the stamp duty. That is an example of one of the smaller aspects that came out of the Bacon report but it is important that we examine it. It is a progressive and positive measure and we need to determine if we need to change it in various ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification from the Deputy Leader in relation to motions Nos. 1 and 2 on the Order Paper. Are they being pursued today or are we talking purely about No. 3?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with what Senator Manning said. This is an outrageous Order of Business. We are resuming a debate in which many speakers have already spoken, and that is the entire business for today. I am not sure if Senator Manning has actually proposed that we amend the Order of Business but if he has not, I propose that we have a debate on the question of young children at risk who are coming before the courts, one of the scandals of our society. It is unprecedented that a judge has had to cite three Cabinet Ministers for contempt. These Ministers could go to prison, be fined or have the assets of their Departments seized because of failure to carry out their duties.</P>
      <P>This House should take the opportunity, as time is available today, to debate that issue and broaden it to include not just the one individual but all the young offenders coming before the courts who are at risk and for whom appropriate places are not being found. That is a serious issue and it would also connect with the request from Senator O'Toole for a debate on housing because it is related to homelessness. Most of those young people at risk end up homeless on our streets. In that context I propose that we amend the Order of Business to have a debate on those matters today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy Leader for an early debate on the scandal surrounding the moneys allocated by the European Union to the Third World. It emerged recently that 20 billion <Col N="240" /> ecus were allocated but have not been spent and the Commissioner in charge of development has come out with the amazing statement that these moneys will be spent before 2007. This money should be spent now. It was allocated over the past two or three years to the poorest countries in the world and the EU is saying it will put the matter right before 2007. I am concerned that moneys allocated in the year 2000 will not be spent until the year 2020. The poorest countries in the world are suffering. This money is in the EU budget and, unfortunately, much of it will be spent on addressing the problems in eastern Europe and in non-Third World countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends which side one is on. The Senators opposite can do away with Standing Orders. I want to do away with Standing Orders to address certain points as well.</P>
      <P>I want to raise what I consider to be a serious matter. There was a train crash in Britain the day before yesterday and Sky News spent about an hour and a half continuously suggesting that the crash was the work of Irish terrorists. I have no time for terrorists of any description but there was much hype surrounding this accident on the part of the media, and in particular by Sky News, in that it implied that the crash was or could have been caused by Irish terrorists. The media should show some responsibility in this regard. In the past weeks, the print media reporting of an incident in Kilkenny was an absolute scandal. The media has as much responsibility for the way it reports items as we have in the way we debate them.</P>
      <P>The 88th Battalion is heading off this weekend to join UNIFIL, perhaps the final contingent from Ireland to do so. These are 173 young people, from the age of 18 upwards, who have never travelled outside Ireland. The troops who have served with UNIFIL in the Lebanon for many years have done Ireland proud and if this is to be the last battalion to go out there, which hopefully signals an end to the problems in Lebanon, this House should commend the contribution the Irish Army has made to UNIFIL over the years and wish these young men and women well during their six months tour of duty in Lebanon. There are quite a number of women among them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Members may not be aware that today is International Credit Union Day. If time could be found in the weeks ahead, could we have a discussion on the credit union movement? It is over 40 years since it was founded. There are over 500 offices nationwide, it employs over 1,000 staff and it has nearly two million members. I ask the Deputy Leader to provide for a short debate in the weeks ahead on an institution which has been integral to small savers in particular.</P>
      <P>Second, I ask for a debate on aspects of the insurance industry. I have called for such a debate in the past. Following the Insurance Ombudsman's report and other matters, perhaps a short debate could be arranged.</P>
      <P>Third, I support what our leader, Senator Manning, and Senator Costello said about the judgment yesterday. Without going into the specifics, it is clear that a major problem exists. There is also a major problem in relation to the question of detention. There is another individual who has escaped on more than 50 occasions because there does not seem to be adequate care. This person has escaped at will and has caused problems and committed further crimes.</P>
      <P>I call for a debate also on aspects of detention centres and the prison service because, during the summer, one individual decided to take a driving lesson and did not return. Another individual in the Dundrum area headed off on his scooter with half his house behind him and did not return. It is important that this matter be dealt with and I formally second the proposal from Senator Costello.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Cosgrave's last suggestion about a debate on children who have such serious problems. I ask the Deputy Leader to ensure that when the Minister comes into the House, as well as looking at the serious situation regarding these individual children, he will address the problem of the shortage of probation officers and the lack of urgently needed reports from them on children who are before the courts. This leads to serious delays in some court cases involving children and indeed some cases being abandoned. If an early response was made in child care cases, we might not have to deal with these very serious cases that have been mentioned.</P>

      <P>Today a prominent social worker referred to a time bomb facing Irish society and referred to it as one of the greatest social evils facing our people. It seems thousands of elderly people are being physically, emotionally and financially abused. This is a serious problem, given that some of the sick and infirm are exploited by children, relatives, friends and spouses. Like children who are abused, elderly people in a similar situation are helpless and vulnerable. Their silent suffering is a cry for help and assistance from legislators. There is even a strong argument for providing dedicated refuge centres for such people. In light of this report, which <Col N="242" /> should not be ignored, it is important the Deputy Leader should arrange as a matter of urgency for a debate on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>From the many calls for debates by Members, it is evident the business ordered for today is not good enough. I am sure many people are interested in rural development, but there are many topical serious issues that are literally matters of life and death. I called yesterday for a debate on health and I reiterate that request. I do not know why we could not have such a debate today. I am talking about preventative measures, specifically related to women's health in the area of cancer. I call on the Deputy Leader again to ask the Leader to listen to the topics on which Members are requesting debates rather than simply tabling an item that has been on the Order Paper for months and months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Many arguments were put forward as to why there is a shortage of houses in the greater Dublin area. A key factor hampering the supply of houses is the lack of staff in local authorities to speed up the planning process. When action plans are prepared, staff are not available to process them. I support my colleague, Senator Farrell, on the manner in which An Bord Pleanála stymies the planning process. A debate on the shortage of houses and the housing situation was called for this morning. Added to that is the manner in which the provisions of the new planning legislation can be implemented. Given that much doubt surrounds this area, this is an appropriate Chamber for a full debate on planning and the housing shortage in the greater Dublin area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support fully the points made by Senator Manning and others regarding the business as ordered. I fail to understand how the Government side cannot indicate the business that is likely &ndash; it need not be definitive &ndash; in the period ahead. By failing to do so, the Government is treating the House very discourteously. It is giving the House and its Members the mushroom treatment. The Leader is meant to be a conduit between this House and the Government. I am slow to suggest it, but I wonder aloud if the Government is giving the Leader the mushroom treatment. In any event, it is not good enough.</P>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader consider giving Government time to debate a topical item, No. 17, motion 7, expressing support for the retention of the groceries order, an order which has been under review for a considerable period. It might be considered suitable for debate. I listened with great interest to the Tánaiste speak on the subject in the other House last week and she might be asked to come to this House and discuss it with us. The taking of that motion should be given consideration.</P>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader indicate when the Insurance Bill will be before this House, given that it has passed all Stages in the other House? </P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator O'Toole for a debate on education. While I recognise the great strides that have been made by the Minister for Education and Science in funding for children with autism, we are failing in our responsibility to children with other special needs. We do not have enough structures in place to support the desire of many children with special needs and their families for such children to enter mainstream education. We need more assessments, psychologists, remedial teachers and resource teachers. I would like the Minister for Education and Science to discuss this issue, as a matter of urgency, in this House with the objective of ensuring that more and more children with special needs enter mainstream education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree strongly with the approach taken by Senator Manning to the Order of Business and compliment him on the balanced and serious way in which he dealt with this matter. We can clearly see the degree of urgency about this debate, on which apparently we will spend the entire day, in the fact that it is a hangover from March. Many Members have made their views known. In the past I have spoken on rural issues and I have been derided because of my Dublin 1 address. However, far be it from me to carp. I am not a member of the Opposition; I am a loyal Independent and, as such, I believe in a constructive approach to the work of this House.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to be helpful since there is obviously going to be a considerable amount of time left over today, I suggest we make a clear, precise and definite change to the Order of Business. I propose that instead of the business proposed by the Government, which is flatulent in the extreme, we take the No. 17, motion 19, &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls for a radical review of the funding of political parties and public life in Ireland, a review of the role and regulation of political lobbyists and a review of the ethical standards which should underpin and regulate public life in Ireland.&rdquo;  That motion is in the name of all the party leaders. It is an all-party motion.</P>
      <P>It is a serious issue. I think we can all agree that if we support this all-party motion, let us unanimously vote to alter the Order of Business to take this important all-party motion against which I am quite certain the Government would not have the effrontery to vote.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Deputy Leader bring to the attention of the Tánaiste the varying and high prices of petrol and diesel throughout the country? The price <Col N="244" /> of green diesel has increased by 65% since May 1999 compared to the price of white diesel which has increased by 45%.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader bring to the attention of Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, the position on the imminent announcement by Enterprise Oil regarding the Corrib gas field and by An Bord Gáis regarding the link up with the national grid? Will he ask the Minister what arrangements, if any, the Department will make to finance the necessary spurs from the pipeline to the major towns in the west, particularly in County Mayo? In Mayo alone, there are four major towns within a 15 mile radius of the major pipeline, but Enterprise Oil, being a commercial operation, will not finance those spurs, which are needed.</P>
      <P>A debate on rural development is ordered for today. Such development could be given a boost if those spur lines were financed. That is badly needed by industry in the west and if we are to attract the multinationals. Given that Enterprise Oil will not put in the spur lines, the Government will have to do it. I request the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister his intentions in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ó Murchú's call for a debate on the elderly. Many elderly people are afraid to go out during the day because they have been robbed in broad daylight. We need to debate this and to establish that many bank robberies and robberies from the elderly are committed by people travelling a distance to do so. It is time we had an identity card system so that when gardaí pull a car or van over they can ascertain the occupants' identities. If a crime is committed later the gardaí would know who had travelled that road. At present they cannot do that. Desperate ailments need desperate treatment.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Lanigan's call for a debate on the media. During the summer a young man committed suicide allegedly because of the amount of adverse publicity he got. If that could be attributed to a politician he or she would be dragged over the coals. It is time for a regulatory body to ensure people get justice, as some headlines are scandalous, referring to &ldquo;dying people&rdquo;, for instance, and using nicknames.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Norris's proposal. Senator Lanigan's comments on rail safety and the recent rail accident at Hatfield in England should remind us of rail safety in Ireland. Many Members have expressed interest in that topic. Since we last debated this matter there has been a lot of work done on track renewal in Ireland, which is welcome, but there are probably hundreds of miles of substandard track in the rail system which is itself at risk. Although it has not been confirmed officially, we understand that the Hatfield accident was a result of track failure and the last rail accident in Ireland, with which the Chair and I are familiar, was also the result of track failure, though it did not have the same consequences as the Hatfield accident.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise should give us an update on track renewal in Ireland and on how much of the existing track is at risk and needs renewal. That is very important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Members who called for a debate on detention facilities for young offenders, particularly in the light of yesterday's events. However, we should have a realistic debate and take all sides of the discussion on board, particularly the legitimate concerns of the communities in which these places of detention are located. In certain areas there is concern about community representation on the boards of management of these centres and whether such representation is a mere exercise in tokenism. Unfortunately, the indicators are that that is the case. When these places were set up, the idea of significant community representation on the boards of management was an excellent one, but it would appear that such representation has amounted to nothing more than an exercise in tokenism. I support the call for a debate, but I ask that this matter be given full consideration. We cannot have another example of the NIMBY syndrome &ndash; there is enough of that in the country already.</P>

      <P>Regarding the shortage of staff in the public service, I draw particular attention to the shortage of staff in the health service. At a time when health boards are recruiting nurses throughout the world, Irish girls cannot get into nursing because of the points system. The amount of disappointed girls every September is growing year by year. Many of them come to my clinic and are deeply disappointed they cannot get into nursing. It is a profession many such girls would like to get into and the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Education and Science &ndash; whoever is responsible &ndash; should address the House on this important matter.</P>

      <P>It amazes me how the Houses of the Oireachtas order their business. We always start a new session at a snail's pace and then at the end of the session we are inundated with legislation. For example, on the last day of the <Col N="246" /> last session three Bills passed all Stages. That is not a good way to order business.</P>
      <P>I seek a debate on the ESRI report published this morning. The report shows that private patients are getting a substantial number of beds in public hospitals and as a result, public patients are waiting longer for elective surgery. I seek a debate on the report and on waiting lists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>This may take some time. I understand Senator Manning's frustration. I experienced the same when on that side of the House. I am anxious we do everything we can to ensure the House runs smoothly, so I suggest the Whips meet after the Order of Business to agree a way forward on this issue.</P>
      <P>It has been common practice, irrespective of who is in Government, for the Whip's notice to be sent out during the week and in most instances the notice given is no longer than that. That is not to say that something could not be done to indicate what is coming down the line. The Chair would agree that it would not be appropriate to order business on the hoof, so to speak. We try to respond to requests for debates, but it takes time to get Ministers. I do not use that as an excuse, as they should be here for those debates, but it would be quite impossible to accommodate a debate requested on the Order of Business of the same day. That is the reality.</P>
      <P>Regarding today's business, I regard the White Paper on Rural Development as being an important document. It is very important to a large number of people and it is worth pointing out that when this was last debated there was nobody here from the Labour Party and Independent benches and two Fine Gael Senators contributed. There are still Government Members who wish to contribute and it is appropriate that this important subject be discussed today.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the issue of the impact of the Bacon report on housing. Some of the benefits appear to be coming through and it would be appropriate to debate that in the near future. Senator Costello made a similar request.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, O'Toole, Cosgrave, Henry, Glennon and others raised the issue of child care, but the reality is that this matter is up for mention in the High Court today. The Chair would accept that it is probably not appropriate to debate it today, although that is not to say that the issues arising from it are not very grave and that they should not be discussed here. However, this may not be the appropriate time to discuss those issues. There were calls yesterday for a debate on aspects of the health service and I reiterate that I will do everything possible to ensure the debate is held and that this matter is discussed within its ambit.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="247" /> In regard to the tragic case which arose yesterday, it was interesting that Fr. Peter McVerry stated on radio this morning that it was the result of 20 years of neglect and that it would be impossible for any Minister to pull a rabbit out of a hat at a moment's notice. Having said that, a suitable house was found for the person in question at a cost of £250,000. Eight dedicated staff were provided, as were counselling, therapy and education services. Anything the health board has sought in this case has been provided. The Minister stated this morning that in regard to securing a safe place for the child in the short term, departmental officials have confirmed to the health board that she will be cared for on an emergency basis when she is found. As this matter is currently before the courts, it might be preferable to discuss it at a later date, but in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the matter of EU development aid and I agree with his comments. Media reports of the recent rail accident indicated that terrorists or vandals could be involved but it turned out to be a case of rail failure. Speculation which is not backed up by facts is merely irresponsible journalism. I join the Senator in congratulating the UNIFIL 88th Battalion. We have discussed Army issues in this House on many occasions and have expressed our gratitude and pride in regard to the manner in which its members conduct themselves overseas on peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave raised the matter of the International Credit Union Day. Senators have often congratulated the credit unions on the service they provide to their two million members. I am sure the Minister for Finance would be delighted to come into the House to discuss this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cosgrave also raised the issue of the insurance ombudsman.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry referred to the shortage of probation officers. A debate on this matter might be more appropriate to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, rather than Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Senators Ó Murchú, Callanan and Farrell made a very strong case in regard to the abuse of vulnerable elderly people. This is an appalling and hidden problem. Elderly people are not in a position to defend themselves and I agree with Senator Ó Murchú's description of a &ldquo;time bomb&rdquo;. This matter should be discussed, possibly within the context of the health debate. Senator Cox raised the issue of autism and that, too, could be discussed during the debate on health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ormonde referred to staffing in Bord Pleanála. This problem impinges on the Bacon Report and could be dealt with in that context. Delays in the planning process do not help to pro<Col N="248" /> vide a supply of affordable housing to young people who are trying to buy their first homes.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan referred to the groceries order. I understand a decision on this is due in the near future. Like him, I am hoping the order will be retained as its abolition would have serious implications for small rural shops, towns and villages. I am aware that certain people hold a contrary opinion.</P>
    <P>I have stated that the insurance Bill is ordered for next week. I hope the Cathaoirleach will excuse me for being pedantic but there is no No. 19 on the Order Paper. There is, however, a motion No. 19 under No. 17.</P>

      <P>I am always anxious to assist Senator Norris but regret that I cannot accept his amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Callanan raised the important issue of diesel prices. Senator Caffrey referred to the Minister of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Corrib Field. This issue could perhaps be dealt with as an Adjournment matter. I note that there are not any motions on the Adjournment today. I am not saying this issue does not have a wider national context but the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources was present in the House yesterday and, given his flexibility, it would have been possible to make those points to him.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the issue of the media which was also raised by Senator Farrell. Senator Connor referred to rail infrastructure and track quality and I will bring those matters to the attention of the Minister for Public Enterprise. We have discussed this matter in the past-&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with Senators Doyle and Manning that it is unsatisfactory to have to deal with a plethora of legislation at the end of a session. We should have sufficient time to examine and debate legislation properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the ESRI report on public beds in hospitals and the fact that private patients are being subsidised, I am aware it is part of the Government's objective that the State should recover costs. That was why the report was commissioned, although it is likely to result in increases in BUPA and VHI premia. The objec<Col N="249" /> tive is to introduce the increases slowly over a five year period in order to bring us into line.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF" hpid="Mr. Ó Fearghail Mr. Ó Fearghail">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>Aontaím leis an gCathaoirleach agus cuirim fáilte fial roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I compliment him and the Government on the work that they have done since taking office. I also compliment them on the work that has been undertaken in the area of rural development since the debate commenced on 9 March last. Despite some of the inferences that might have <Col N="251" /> been made and some comments on the Order of Business, it is fair to say that every Member accepts the integral importance of the area of rural development to the political agenda.</P>
    <P>The objective of any rural development plan must be to achieve a rural Ireland that has vibrant, thriving and sustainable communities which are attractive to live and work in. Achieving this involves a reversal of the trends of the past which has seen the flight from the land, a decline in the rural population and a massive migration towards the greater Dublin area in a population trend reminiscent of what happened in some Third World countries.</P>
    <P>The Government's White Paper was initially underpinned by a very positive process of consultation. The institutional arrangements which were promised are now in place. The existence of an interdepartmental committee and a Cabinet sub-committee chaired by the Taoiseach are evidence of the high political priority given by the Government to the challenge of rural development.</P>
    <P>Since this issue was discussed in the House in March the National Rural Development Forum has been established with appropriate terms of reference. They are to debate current issues relating to rural development, to review the impact of current programmes on rural development and to identify and recommend suitable policy responses to rural development problems.</P>
    <P>More than 90 agencies and groups with a remit in the area have been invited to participate in this forum making it one of the most substantial and broad based fora ever established here. The IFA nominated its president, Mr. Tom Parlon, and the ICMSA nominated its president, Mr. Pat O'Rourke, to mention just two. The existence of such a broad based, high powered forum guarantees that rural development will continue to remain on the top of the agenda for this and future Governments.</P>
    <P>Through the national development plan the commitments on rural development will be delivered. It is heartening to know that this plan was prepared on the basis of the requirement for rural proofing which is now a factor in all Government initiatives. The Government is committed to providing, within a strategic framework under the plan, a programme of investment in infrastructure &ndash; including roads, rail, sewerage, water, telecommunications and transport &ndash; promoting sustainable growth and maintaining the rural population. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this commitment. Without significant investment of the order envisaged by the Government, not least in the basic areas of water and sewerage treatment systems, rural development would remain no more than a pipe dream.</P>
    <P>We live in a communications age and there has been much discussion about the benefits of working from home, technological developments and the potential offered by teleworking, for example, to those living in rural areas. Such initiatives are unlikely to be undertaken, however, in areas <Col N="252" /> where the basic water and sewerage services are either inadequate or non-existent.</P>
    <P>The success of the Government's plans for rural development will depend in no small measure on the work of the county development boards which are charged with the challenge of integrating development policies at county level. The end result of their efforts must be the availability of quality services in rural areas. In this regard, I urge that local authority members and the chairmen of the SPCs &ndash; the local authorities' nominees to the county development boards &ndash; take a lead role in the deliberations of the county development boards to ensure that the boards can be successfully driven towards achieving their goals.</P>
    <P>The role of local authorities in rural development cannot be underestimated. There is no doubt that Government investment is needed to stimulate activity in rural areas. However, the means to ensure balanced development at county level can be best achieved through the medium of county development plans. In my county, for example, there has been phenomenal growth, centred mostly in its north-eastern part. This trend was well advanced before the arrival in the area of Intel and Hewlett Packard and it has intensified in the interim.</P>
    <P>The current county development plan in Kildare aims to encourage development towards the centre, the west and the south of the county and has, as its core objective, the distribution of two thirds of further population growth towards these areas. To achieve this policy, the smaller towns, villages and settlements will have to be developed in a sensitive and sustainable manner. If our strategy in Kildare works &ndash; there are indications that it is beginning to &ndash; it could be a model for other counties to follow.</P>
    <P>Much has rightly been made of the Government's announcement in last year's budget of a major decentralisation programme involving upwards of 10,000 civil and public servants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that submissions or representations have been made in respect of 120 urban centres throughout the country, the support for this proposal is obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance, a Kildare man, on adopting a careful and consultative approach to this process. It is most appropriate that, in addition to considering submissions received, he should also take on board the views of civil service management and civil and public service unions. In reaching his conclusions, I hope he does not forget his home county and that the submissions made in respect of Athy, among other places, will be considered. For many years we have advocated the idea that the Curragh Camp would make an ideal headquarters for the Department of Defence. Perhaps the mandarins <Col N="253" /> in Parkgate Street might not be reluctant to move their operations to that location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the debate on decentralisation, it might not be any harm to consider whether such a policy could be implemented at county level. I put this forward as a suggestion rather than as a definitive proposal. Is it not the case that many county towns are like Dublin in microcosm? For example, Naas is home to the headquarters of Kildare County Council which is developing a new corporate office at a cost of approximately £12 million, the county hospital which, thanks to Government subvention of the order of £42 million, is undertaking a major development plan, the county post office, Naas Urban District Council, the administrative headquarters of the Kildare County VEC, the Circuit Court offices, the South Western Area Health Board offices, the headquarters of Teagasc and a driver test centre, to mention but a few. I suspect that a similar concentration of services exists in many other county towns and this is something that might be usefully investigated and considered at local level. The establishment of one stop shops and area offices or the decentralisation, within counties, of some of these offices should be examined.</P>
      <P>The publication by the Government of its White Paper on Adult Education in an era of lifelong learning is to be welcomed in the context of this debate. We will, no doubt, have an opportunity to discuss that document in the House at a later date. However, I emphasise the need to maximise the access of rural people to education and training. Much more needs to be done to promote the concept of out-reach centres and there should be closer co-operation between the institutes of technology and the vocational education committees to this end. Many of us, through our roles in local authorities, have a function at both institute of technology and VEC level.</P>
      <P>Last, but by no means least, I wish to deal with the issue of agriculture. When I joined the major Government party in the late 1970s, I was attracted, among other things, by its objective of maintaining as many families as practicable on the land. That objective is clearly demonstrated and remains a central plank of Government policy in the area of rural development. The Government has put in place positive initiatives to encourage alternative farm enterprise and, through second chance education and training, opportunities are being made available to allow small holders secure sustainable off-farm income while continuing to successfully manage their farm enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the success of the Government in redressing the crisis which has beset the beef sector. I welcome the improvements which have been achieved in this sector due to the marketing drive and other initiatives undertaken by the <Col N="254" /> Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Given the paramount importance of the beef sector to rural Ireland and to the economy as a whole, we must recognise the major significance of the Government's achievements in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the White Paper, taken together with the investment commitment in the national development plan and the introduction in due course of the Government's forthcoming national spatial strategy, will guarantee a bright and secure future for rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, a man of friendly disposition who always has a ready smile. I recognise that his heart is in the right place and I am glad he occupies his current position because this matter is vital to the future of the country. There are many imbalances to be redressed and I wish the Minister of State well in that regard. I read the contribution he made on 9 March last and the ideals he outlined are extremely worthy and highly laudable. I recognise that an inter-departmental committee and Cabinet sub-committee have been put in place. As Senator Ó Fearghail stated, 90 groups are involved in helping to shape future policy in this area.</P>
      <P>I wish everyone well who is involved in the area of rural development, a subject about which I feel deeply. Senator Ó Fearghail stated that maintaining a maximum number of families on the land was one of the reasons which prompted him to join his party. Regardless of party loyalties, everyone feels deeply about this matter.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope that the vision the Minister of State outlined in his contribution on 9 March is translated into practice and becomes a tangible reality. Time is of the essence in that regard. The regeneration of rural areas and village life is vital for the future of this country. People, even those who live in our cities, agree that rural Ireland is an essential part of our identity. Therefore we all have a vested interest in its success. I hope that, through the good policies which will emanate from these bodies, we can breathe new life into rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Coming from south Kerry, I am particularly concerned about the Gaeltacht regions of Corca Dhuibhne and Uíbh Ráthach. Because of their remoteness and peripherality these areas have suffered more than any other part of rural Ireland. We recognise the infrastructural problem of serving remote rural areas &ndash; transport is a great difficulty &ndash; and especially Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>We must do more than pay lip service to the ideals of maintaining, developing and enhancing rural communities. New and effective policies are essential. I hope the Minister of State, with the supports available to him in his Department and with the other bodies now in place, will give the required leadership and steer us to a brighter future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> Agriculture was the backbone of our economy in the past but this is not so today. However, new and exciting things can happen in rural Ireland and good livelihoods can be earned without further depopulating the land. Employment opportunities have become focused in the larger urban areas but, given the advances in technology, many people desire a rural way of life and are anxious to work from home.</P>
    <P>Planning presents a great difficulty. I am as concerned an anyone about the protection and enhancement of the environment but increasingly planning applications for single rural dwellings for an applicant's own use are being frustrated. It is often not possible for an entire family to live off the land and many farmers wish to provide sites for their sons and daughters who are working in neighbouring towns. While sites in towns might cost between £50,000 and £70,000, a young person might be offered a site on his father's small holding. Such people are being frustrated in their efforts to obtain planning permission because planning regulations are becoming more and more restrictive. Such problems come to the attention of all public representatives and, regardless of our affiliations, we all feel for the people involved. I believe all public representatives would support the policy of allowing people to live in their home place and to raise a family in the vicinity of their parents' house or the home of a brother or sister. That would be a damn good policy.</P>
    <P>Without damaging the beauty of the countryside, the Department of the Environmnent and Local Government must find a way, perhaps through a ministerial directive, to implement such a policy. Too many planning officers are taking an easy way out by finding some point on which to refuse planning applications. I am not calling for a policy of ribbon development, merely of allowing people to live in the place where they grew up and commute to work in a nearby town or work from home.</P>
    <P>I have heard and read criticism of white painted houses sticking out like sore thumbs in rural areas. There may be such instances. I recommend the introduction of a small grant to allow for those problems to be corrected and enable those buildings to blend with the landscape.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Leas-Chathaoileach, I always said you were a decent man. I commend <Col N="256" /> to the Government this idea of a small grant to allow people to stone-face such dwellings.</P>
      <P>An enlightened approach to rural development must involve sustainable economic growth. The villages of rural Ireland have lost Garda stations, post offices and banks and I fear that we might also lose small village food shops. This has happened in Britain because of policies which were allowed there for so long. Planning policy guidelines are now being used in Britain in an effort to correct this situation. In this country we are fortunate in having a ministerial directive on this matter. More than 43% of British villages no longer have a food shop. Thank God that has not yet happened here but we must be watchful. I compliment the Tánaiste who appears to have come to accept the argument that fewer shops means less choice, less competition and a futher decline for rural areas. We must protect the villages of rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>I thought I would have had time to deal with matters such as e-mailing, cheap video conferencing and teleworking. In my own county, Fexco is located in the town of Killorglin and Rosenbluth is located in the countryside. Both companies have employees working from their homes. We have a young well-educated workforce who want to live on the land, particularly if they are offered sites for homes. All public representatives are fighting cases with planning authorities on behalf of such young people. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should do something to make things easier for them, without damaging the environment in any way. If the owner of a holding of 30 or 40 acres wishes to offer a son or daughter a site, it should be possible for a planning officer to choose and recommend a suitable location. This could be done without making a new entrance or exit but merely by adding a spur to an existing entrance. Planners appear to be too ready to take an easy way out. Not enough constructive dialogue is taking place. It is the job of politicians to encourage such dialogue and to ensure that it takes place. I do not think I am straying from the subject matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to say a few words about rural development. Every day in the media we hear about the problems of traffic, the cost of housing and child care in urban areas, particularly in Dublin. If our aim and policy is to provide for sustainable rural development, we could solve some of these problems by encouraging people to remain in rural areas where they want to live near their families and communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> I come from what is considered a rural area and agree with Senator Coghlan who referred to the constant problem of family members being refused planning permission on their own farmland at a time when we are seeking to prevent rural depopulation. There is no written rule that only one or two planning applications will be granted. Whenever the matter is raised with planning officers the ultimate answer is that it amounts to urban development in a rural area. I cannot see what the problem is in building two houses on a particular farm. As a consequence of the refusal of planning permission, family members who are in a position to build a home on their own site within a reasonable price range are being forced to move to urban areas which are already overpopulated and where houses are twice the price. It is a vicious circle and a catch-22 situation.</P>
    <P>To ensure sustainable rural development there is a need to provide services &ndash; financial, social and health. Those living in rural areas are just as entitled to access such services as those living in urban areas. There is a constant threat that financial institutions will move from smaller towns. There is also a constant threat to our postal services, a matter which raises its ugly head every few months. The process of reducing the number of Garda stations has already commenced. Each of these is an important facet of any rural community and I hope we can arrest their decline.</P>
    <P>In March Senator Chambers, my party's spokesperson on rural development in the Seanad, proposed to the Minister for Finance that any excess moneys recouped from financial institutions as a result of various inquiries, including the DIRT inquiry, should be reinvested in the rural communities from which the financial institutions concerned have moved in order to improve the available services and facilities. I fully support this proposal.</P>
    <P>There is constant reference in my home county to the need for infrastructure. Monaghan is probably the only county where the major towns on the primary routes have not been bypassed. It used to take two hours to travel from Monaghan to Dublin. It now takes two and three quarters hours. Is this progress? It is our hope that we will eventually reach the stage where our major towns will be bypassed, given that indigenous industries in Cavan and Monaghan are entirely dependent on the road network, which is not always up to standard. We have not a train service. There is also a number of what would be considered heavy industries, mainly involved in furniture production, which, although based along narrow country roads, are thriving. Furniture produced in Monaghan is widely available in Dublin. Although under threat, these industries have survived on their own initiative. There is a need to encourage the development of further indigenous industries in counties such as mine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> The Good Friday Agreement, for which we are all particularly grateful, presents opportunities for economic cross-Border development. An east-west road link would be a great asset to Cavan and Monaghan and offer enormous potential for such development. Such a link has not been provided for in the national development plan. It takes about one and a half hours to travel to Belfast port and airport and about two and a half hours to Dublin. There should be a main artery running from either Belfast to Galway or from Dundalk to Sligo. While there has been talk about the development of regional centres in the west, possibly in Athlone or Sligo, there is a need for an east-west link. I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices to ensure such a link in included in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>I agree with those Senators who raised the issue of telecommunications. It is becoming more and more necessary to provide such infrastructure. Fibre optic cable is in place as far as Ardee in County Louth and it is our hope that in time it will be extended as far as Cavan. Once more, however, Monaghan will be bypassed. Without such infrastructure, it will be impossible to attract industry. It will have to be provided in all parts of the country if we are to promote regional development. Cavan and Monaghan form part of the famous BMW &ndash; Border, midlands and western &ndash; region. I, therefore, appeal to the Minister of State to ensure such infrastructure is provided in or extended to my county. I have no doubt that my colleagues from Donegal will also be looking to have it provided or extended there. Currently one only hears about job losses in the two counties concerned.</P>
    <P>There is another important aspect, that is, foreign industries are attracted to those areas in which third level institutes are located. There are some third level and post-leaving certificate courses available in my county. The Minister for Education and Science has announced that it is his policy to develop regional outreach third level education centres and I am aware that Monaghan has been included in the list.</P>
    <P>Monaghan has the lowest level of participation in third level colleges, which seems unreasonable. A possible reason is the number of industries which we had through the years which offered the attraction of money at a time when jobs were quite scarce. Jobs were available in our food industries which were attractive to many young people who are still working as unskilled labourers. The incidence of third level education, which appears to be the greatest requirement, is very low. I have no doubt that if the outreach centres were available people would be attracted to attend third level.</P>
    <P>The provision of employment in an area ensures that well educated and qualified people will not move to other parts of the country. People working abroad or in larger urban areas say they would like to move back to a smaller urban area or at least to their own home county. Providing education at local level would encour<Col N="259" /> age people to remain and to give of their expertise and qualifications to develop their own rural communities.</P>
    <P>The most important thing is quality of life. We all hear about the problems of family life, with two people having to work to pay a mortgage. We are constantly talking about regenerating rural communities and there are small ways in which we can do so, including in the provision of educational, health and infrastructural facilities. As part of our long-term strategy we should have the aim of addressing those matters. We want to keep people in their own areas and communities where they have a valuable contribution to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The one issue raised on all sides of the House, both during the previous discussion and again today, was planning permissions in rural areas. The Minister of State has had a particular interest in this, even prior to his appointment as Minister. Countless people came to me during the summer saying the local council turned down applications for planning permission. These people wanted to live in their own area, but were told their applications were refused because the proposed site was on a road which was too remote, etc. &ndash; nothing was said about ribbon development. I do not know if a Government directive is necessary, but we must take this matter seriously. Something must be done because local authorities are simply not abiding by the wishes of the Minister of State or Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate. As Members are aware, the White Paper is being implemented in many areas. The Cabinet sub-committee has been set up and rural proofing has been established in every Department, all of which we see as essential.</P>
      <P>Rural planning was raised by Senators Hayes, Coghlan and Leonard. Nothing breaks my heart more than hearing of people who cannot live on their own land or build on their own farm. It is ridiculous that a farming family has to build somewhere other than on their own land. The parish is the basis of all areas. We have opened up the schools system and now allow two teachers for 12 pupils. This was an essential development in terms of keeping people in rural communities in the area which they knew. The alternative was to bus pupils to a larger centre or village, thereby losing the social connections, traditions and history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an increasing number of constituents coming to me who have been refused planning permission. Planning officers point to ribbon development. We already have the ridiculous situation in Dublin where it takes one hour to drive seven miles. In rural areas people are travelling 40 or 50 miles to work &ndash; rural people do not see this as a problem as they can do 50 miles in an <Col N="260" /> hour. Councillors at local level decide draft policy for their areas. It is time for councillors to be very strong when the draft development plan is being decided upon and to ensure they are not hoodwinked by officials who talk about rural or ribbon development.</P>
    <P>We must build 50,000 houses this year, of which 10,000 could be built immediately in rural areas. In rural areas people do not necessarily use a builder &ndash; the old meitheal system kicks in whereby friends help out and payment is made in different ways. If we do not allow such building children will not know their own parish or townland. It concerns the social history of areas, because we can never replace the indigenous people of a parish. I have a deep concern in this context.</P>
    <P>I urge that Members of this House, who have so much contact with councillors throughout the country, not purely for the purpose of being re-elected, to discuss this issue with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">

      <P>Is this part of the Minister's social inclusion policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. There was a time when I thought a certain interest of the Leas-Chathaoirleach was confined to the Dublin region, but am glad that last Saturday he disproved that in the country.</P>
      <P>We are working at many aspects in this regard, particularly rural tourism. We must ask whether rural tourism is an experience or a product and find a balance. We have provided £100,000 to Bord Fáilte to examine the development of rural tourism. Nobody comes to Ireland for sunstroke &ndash; I am not aware of anybody ever dying in Ireland from sunstroke &ndash; but they come for the experience and the products which are available. We have such products in vast abundance in rural areas, with farms which can be walked, hills which can be climbed and activities related to a healthier lifestyle which people enjoy. The fastest growing activity in the world is walking because people are becoming more health conscious, particularly people from large European cities who are fascinated by the vast areas here where people can walk and enjoy fresh air and a good lifestyle. It will be an essential product of rural areas and farming communities.</P>
      <P>We have lost about 3,500 farmers in the past three years and it is estimated that roughly in the region of 30,000 and 40,000 commercial farmers will remain within the next number of years. We want farmers to stay on the land and take up part-time jobs. That is why we introduced schemes such as REPS, which will be re-introduced on 1 November by the Minister. We want to ensure payments are made to help farmers to farm in an environmentally friendly way so that they can make a nice income for themselves and also have a job outside farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Leonard mentioned fibre optics, which is hugely important. The Government is investing £120 million in a multi-fibre system to extend it <Col N="261" /> to rural areas. That will achieve a 20 times faster connection with the Internet. More importantly, it has the capacity to take millions of calls per hour. We see this as essential. People who get basic training in computers, who start with a basic EDL, can improve their skills. They can work from home for as long as they like, for whom they like and when they like. That is an important freedom, especially for a woman in a farmhouse if she engages in part-time farming. We consider it to be an essential ingredient in the income of the farm.</P>
    <P>I must praise the Leader companies throughout the country. They have used community halls and laptop computers to train people. Such programmes usually start off with a bit of fun involving, say, nine or ten women. The interest then takes over and the women become involved leading to competition between them. Many have taken up good jobs.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes and I are from different eras. I do not accuse him of being my age, but I was around when the car radios changed to digital. I thought I would be stuck with the 252 wavelength, which is Atlantic Radio. However, I eventually mastered the digital radio and I have even mastered the computer.</P>
    <P>Computer technology allows people to work when they want. Senator Coghlan spoke about the impact in his constituency. It is a world-wide development. For example, one can place a bet on a race in Gibraltar by using an international system through the Internet.</P>
    <P>These developments are also happening in Ireland. People are coming into the country to use our telephone and computer systems. There is a businessman in Clonmel who is generating tremendous work and he is constantly looking for people to work for him. We need increasing numbers of trained people.</P>
    <P>One of our biggest problems in rural areas is the lack of confidence of women to proceed with projects. They all have the ability. They present a huge resource of untapped wealth and knowledge. We must try and break down their lack of confidence and get increasing numbers to join the workforce. They can work for anybody located anywhere throughout the country and abroad. Firms from America are constantly looking for work to be done here overnight, for example on insurance claims, to be ready for their offices the next morning. The time lags fuel this demand.</P>
    <P>There has been a sharp decline in poverty in rural areas since the mid 1990s. A Cabinet sub-committee is looking at social inclusion and that will include a transport policy. The local county enterprise boards will be asked to undertake an assessment of the transport needs of each county. School buses lie idle for three months of the year and for five to ten hours a day. In Feakle, County Clare, a house calls system was developed. For example, a school bus, having delivered children to school, leaves Feakle on a Thursday morning at 9.15 a.m. and brings people to Ennis. All those on social welfare benefits or the State pension can <Col N="262" /> travel free. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will pay. Other travellers pay a maximum of £5 return. They have a four hour stay in Ennis. A hackney would cost £18 to carry passengers the same distance and will not wait three or four hours. The service gives people a chance to do the business they want, whether it is taxing the car, approaching the local authority about their rent or whatever else.</P>
    <P>Although the buses may not be of the best quality, the school buses in rural Ireland are an essential asset which should be used. Other systems have been looked at, including community buses which can do work for the less able people. They can bring them to day care centres and so on.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children is considering how to locate health clinics in rural areas, where a lot of day care facilities can be provided. These are beneficial because not only do they provide preventative medicine, they enable people to socialise when getting their hair washed or their nails cut. They are simple things, but they give people a sense of belonging.</P>
    <P>We need people who work in rural areas to remain there. A lot of industry could move to such areas where they would have at their disposal a ready made workforce. None have proven themselves better than those from farming communities who earn a wage from a job rather than a twice yearly payment. They appreciate such work far more than those who have been used to it all their lives. Farmers from my county travel to Limerick to work for Dell Computers. It involves a huge social change for them and, more importantly, a change in mindset that enables them to farm at home, work in Dell and bring home good money every week. It enables them to farm to a high standard and get a higher price for their animals.</P>
    <P>I can advise Senator Chambers that the Western Development Commission funding has been passed since I last addressed the House on this issue. Funding has been allocated and three or four projects have been passed. The commission has £5 million for five years to invest in industry, by taking a share in it or by providing it with a cheap loan. There will always be the small indigenous industry that falls between the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the others. This is a niche market, which will be helpful.</P>
    <P>Many of the areas we are working on in Government require the co-ordination of more than one Department. It is understandably difficult to get the necessary co-operation at times because each Department has a power base which insists on being responsible for some projects. My Department does not mind who announces programmes as long as there is movement on the issues. The Taoiseach has taken a personal interest in this and, by chairing meetings, especially in the social inclusion area, he has ensured that policy will be moved forward.</P>
    <P>We see good prospects for rural Ireland. However, I must emphasise the importance of <Col N="263" /> planning. It is for local authority members in their areas to decide upon and ensure that they introduce policies not to blight the countryside with houses, but to allow for sensible planning. For example, a common complaint is the narrowness of roads, which will later require servicing. Why not insist that houses be built back ten feet from the roadside and that ditches be rebuilt? Why not insist that a light be erected outside the house, and that a tarmacadam surface be laid on the road outside to ensure it meets a certain standard and that there is a lay-by to enable those passing by to pull in? Such measures save local authorities from future demands while making the road safer.</P>
    <P>These measures are essential to keeping indigenous people in rural areas. It is crazy not to implement them. I am reminded of a story involving two people living in a farming community. <Col N="264" /> One said to the other, &ldquo;I am shocked you sold a site&rdquo;&ndash; that would be the old farming way. He went on, &ldquo;Your father would turn in his grave if he knew you sold the site.&rdquo;  The other fellow responded quickly, &ldquo;Yes, he will take a second turn when he hears what I got for it.&rdquo;  People living on the land can only share in the Celtic tiger by selling a site and bringing another person into their community. Above all, it enables them to make further progress on buildings without borrowing.</P>
