      <P>I have notice from Senator John Cregan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to appoint a resource teacher to Kilcolman national school, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 2, motion re Offences Against the State Act, 1998, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and all other Senators not to exceed seven minutes; No. 3, Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; all Stages, with contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 4, Statute Law (Restatement) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Report and Final Stages; and No. 5, Statements on Water Quality, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader indicate as soon as possible what business he hopes will be taken between now and the end of the session and when the session will end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 4 not be taken today. I do so for a specific reason. When this Bill was debated last week an amendment tabled by me was accepted <Col N="1274" /> and had the support of all sides which proposed the setting up of a special Oireachtas committee to examine all restated Bills before they would come into effect. There was a very clear acceptance of the principle by the Government and a clear commitment was given that an amendment would be tabled by the Government on Report Stage. All those here were very clear about that.</P>
    <P>We now have the list of Government amendments and this amendment is not on it. There is a watered down substitution that would allow all proposals to lie in the Library for 21 days before being enacted. This is totally inadequate and goes against the spirit of what was clearly and unequivocally accepted last week. No. 4 requires only a short debate but I am proposing that it should not be taken today so that it can be sorted out before coming back to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Manning's amendment as that was also my understanding of the position. Will the Leader accept that position? We did not have an agreement and Senator Manning's proposal is correct.</P>
      <P>The Leader should be aware of the concern of Members on the rising rate of inflation, the requests for a debate on this issue and the fact that there is a need for such a debate. People are waking up to the fact that increases in their pensions, social welfare payments and wages under the national agreement will be eroded by the time they receive them. This problem will pull the rug from under social partnership. We should ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, or some other member of Government to come into the House and indicate how the Government proposes to deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>In asking for a Minister to come into the House, I point out to the Leader that the Government is a signatory to the PPF which imposes requirements on all parties. The requirement on Government is that it pursue fiscal policies which ensure low inflation. If the Government refuses to deal with this problem, it is dismantling the agreement. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance or some other member of Government to come into the House to explain Government policy on this issue as many pensioners, workers and social welfare recipients are worried about the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole's comments. This is the third or fourth week in a row in which the major issue of inflation has been raised in the House but we still have not received a firm date for when the matter will be addressed. I hope the Leader has some news for us because last week Senator Dardis was unable to give the House a firm date as to when the Taoiseach, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade or Employment or the Minister for Finance would come into the House to discuss these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union summit at the weekend highlighted the fact that Ireland's inflation rate is three times the EU rate and that our partners are <Col N="1275" /> concerned about this situation. The Taoiseach promised to do something about inflation at some point in the future. He is talking about alcohol and cigarettes but the Minister for Finance is not talking about anything and says he will not intervene as inflation will fall at some point in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Senator much time. We cannot debate the matter now. The Senator can make a case for a debate and he has done so very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made the case on numerous occasions but we are not getting any response. There are only two weeks to the summer recess and we need to debate this issue now. We cannot wait until the autumn, but there is no urgency on the Government side to hold such a debate. Senator O'Toole pointed out that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness requires this matter to be dealt with and there will be trade union meetings. The least Members of the Oireachtas can expect is that a Government Minister will come into the House to explain its thinking on this matter.</P>
      <P>It is seldom I congratulate the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, but I do so for his decision to impose a levy on plastic bags. These are belated congratulations, but this is a great idea. Opposition Senators have called for such a levy and this is the first positive step taken by the Department. I hope it will show leadership and that the £120 million which is expected to be raised by the levy will be spent on a waste management and litter plan. We have been waiting three years for such a plan so let us hope this is the first of many necessary steps required to implement a decent waste management and litter plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Costello in welcoming the 10p levy on plastic bags. All Senators have called for this measure during debates on the environment. I welcome its introduction by the Minister. Many people talked about it but he did it. I hope it will have the desired beneficial effect and that the proliferation of plastic bags around the countryside and in our waterways will be, if not eliminated, at least greatly reduced. I remain fascinated that when I buy my newspaper from my local shop, in an effort to be helpful I am always offered a plastic bag, which is always declined. It is offered for the best possible reasons but it has a knock-on effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to No. 4, the Statute Law (Restatement) Bill, 2000, I have some sympathy with what Senator Manning said. There was widespread agreement that a system should be put in place which would ensure parliamentary scrutiny of that which will arise from the Bill. I did not say that Senator Manning's way of doing so was the only way and an alternative method is proposed in the amendment. It remains to be seen <Col N="1276" /> whether that is sufficient. Perhaps the matter could be looked at again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the grave issue of the rail strike. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House to tell us what she proposes to do? I appreciate she cannot intervene directly. We are at the ridiculous stage where the union is registered but not recognised. It can deal with nobody and <i>vice versa.</i> Are we to wait for weeks of disruption during the summer which will affect rail users and tourists who are being treated dreadfully? I appreciate it is not the fault of Iarnród Éireann. Surely it is time to bring in an independent mediator because the problem will recur. There is no way in which even the Minister can speak directly to these people. Will she come to the House to tell us what she will do for the walking public, as we will be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>An aspect of the Iarnród Éireann strike needs some explanation. It appears that the workers in the registered trade union who do not have negotiating rights are locked out. This is aggravating the dispute which may harden the position of both sides. I do not wish to enter into the debate between Iarnród Éireann and its trade unions. However, the dispute is being fuelled and I ask the Leader to investigate this. We need to adopt a calm approach, but from the information available to me, that is not happening.</P>
      <P>On the subject of travel, the bus crash on the N5, between Longford and Ballaghadereen, should be brought to the attention of the National Roads Authority. There are 13 people still in hospital and we were lucky lives were not lost. The case for upgrading this road has been put by counties Longford, Roscommon and Mayo local authorities and in this House. However, the National Roads Authority has ignored the requests and submissions made by local authorities and this House, including one from me. It is now time, in the interest of public safety, that the National Roads Authority is contacted. I would appreciate if the Leader would use his good offices in the interests of the people of that area.</P>
      <P>I support to some extent what Senators Costello and O'Toole have said about the attempts by many groups to inflate prices. This should be brought to the attention of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. He gave an increase of £7 per week to old age pensioners in his budget. Health boards have clawed back £6 of that from rent relief in many cases. I know of a case where an old age pensioner&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot go into detail on this matter. It is open to the Senator to seek a debate on the matter he has raised but it is&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too bad if public statutory bodies such as health boards are clawing back the increase given by the Minister for Social, Com<Col N="1277" /> munity and Family Affairs. It is totally unjust for them to take back from rent relief £6 of the £7 increase given by the Minister. That should be made public. I ask the Leader of the House to request the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to investigate health boards in regard to this matter, so that people who received an increase in their pensions will be entitled to spend that money on themselves and their spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to have a debate on Northern Ireland? It would be appropriate to have such a debate as, while there are positive signs, there are also some worrying things. The All-Ireland Solidarity Committee, which many of us believe is the political front for the real IRA, is proposing to have a meeting, which is causing considerable distress to the relatives of the Omagh bombing victims. It is monstrous for these people to be so insensitive in an area where they have created such damage.</P>
      <P>The Leader gave an undertaking to try to find time for a brief debate on Tibet. There are two items on this matter in my name and that of Senator Ross on the Order Paper, No. 21, motions Nos. 18 and 19. They have been passed by a number of other European parliaments, including the French, who are pretty close to the Chinese on financial grounds. I think it would be possible, given the strong sympathy for Tibet in this House, to have this debate and to pass those two motions. I would be very grateful if we could have an hour to do that before the end of the session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like a debate on inflation, although I will not go into the details because that has been done already. I congratulate the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, on the introduction of a 10p levy on plastic bags. That is a wonderful idea. I would like to think this House had some input into that because both sides frequently raised the issue of plastic bags during our debates on waste management and pollution. However, I want to add a caveat. The principle that the polluter pays is very good and we all support it. In this case, the polluter is not just the individual who purchases the goods but also the supermarket or shop which sells the goods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a balance between the two, which would put pressure on supermarkets and shops to change their <i>modus operandi</i> and replace plastic bags with paper ones. Perhaps the Minister would take that on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>A very important document, the Bacon report, was published last week. Will the Leader find out from the Minister or Department why that report was not circulated to Members of <Col N="1278" /> this House? It was circulated only to Deputies and any members of the press who required it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share all the concerns raised regarding the dangers of our ever increasing inflation rates. There has been a number of calls in the House over the past few weeks for a debate on this. We received a level of sympathy from Senator Dardis last week, but perhaps we could get something more definitive today in regard to a debate on that issue before the House rises. There have been conflicting signals from different members of the Government. The Leader has a way of smothering such differences and I look forward to his clarification.</P>
      <P>I raised during the Leader's absence the question of the single regulatory authority for financial institutions. I would appreciate any update on the timetable for that.</P>
      <P>Finally, and very importantly for the south west&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the little time remaining between now and the end of session, I realise it may not be possible to have a debate on the issue I wish to raise, but I ask the Leader to please bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the grave concerns among many women about the time it takes to process colposcopy results, the follow-through examination to the test for cervical cancer. There are delays of up to 12 weeks which cause unnecessary worry and anxiety for many women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I wish to again raise the issue of inflation, which I have been raising for so long. I propose an amendment: &ldquo;That inflation be debated as the first item on the Order of Business.&rdquo;  The summer recess is due in about ten days and we have called for this debate very often over a long period. We had a debate on the economy on 1 June, when we had a chance to debate it, but things have changed dramatically since then. As we said last week, we know the Minister for Finance may not be present, but we will happily have the debate in the presence of another Minister as we think the matter is sufficiently urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Manning as my understanding regarding the commitment given last week on the Statute Law (Restatement) Bill is similar to his. I understand the point made by Senator Dardis that the commitment given was not that the Government would accept in its entirety the tone and terms of Senator Manning's amendment, but that it would propose something close <Col N="1279" /> to it. However, what is proposed, which is a half-hearted effort to address the point, does not seem to go anywhere near Senator Manning's amendment and I do not believe we should support it.</P>
    <P>Regarding plastic bags, I understand no instructions are given to supermarkets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the most recent Bacon report in view of the increasing number of young people who are unable to get accommodation from local authorities and the fact that formerly well paid young people such as gardaí, teachers and nurses cannot afford to buy a house. There is an increasing urgency for such a debate. At clinics I am faced with an increasing number of young people who cannot and will not be able to get a house of their own while the Government sits on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Quinn's amendment to the Order of Business. It is time we had a debate on inflation. I fully understand why the Government does not want such a debate and I think we should be sympathetic &ndash; it has nothing to say &ndash; but we could have a debate without a Government contribution. Members on this side have a great deal to say. In case the Leader returns and says the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach is not available, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Public Enterprise are in the House and I am sure would be available for a debate on inflation. Therefore, I do not think such an excuse would wash. We are in a crisis &ndash; there is a housing boom, inflation is out of control and the economy is not just overheating but is almost out of control &ndash; and at the core of the crisis is inflation. Senator O'Toole and I have different views on it, as does the Government, but it is appropriate to have a debate at this critical period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning sought a list of business until the end of session. I will have this ready by this evening for all leaders. Regarding No. 4, I understand an amendment has been tabled. I am mindful of what was said by Senators Manning and Dardis and I will speak to the Minister. Business has been ordered and we can see what progress we can make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators O'Toole, Costello, Coogan, Quinn and Ross called for an urgent debate on inflation. The Finance (No. 2) Bill will be debated in the House on Thursday, 29 June. I have no problem with allocating time for a debate on this very important and serious issue. I will see what I can do to make the longest possible period of time available. If that means sitting an extra day before the session concludes that is what I will propose. It is very important that the Minister is present. I will report to the House tomorrow morning on how I am progressing in having these arrangements made to facilitate the requests of Senators. Senators on all sides would welcome an <Col N="1280" /> opportunity to hear what the Minister has to say and what Government policy is on this very important topic.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello, Dardis, Coogan, Coghlan and Quinn, who makes some worthwhile contributions, raised the issue of plastic bags. I wish to be associated with their remarks and look forward to Senator Quinn having some enlightening suggestions which he has been known to have from time to time as an expert in the trade in which a substantial number of such bags is used.</P>
    <P>I will pass on the views of Senators Ridge and Finneran to the Minister for Public Enterprise and ascertain the up-to-date position on the rail drivers' strike. I take Senator Finneran's point on the serious bus crash in Roscommon over the weekend. It is my intention early in the next session to have a debate on the National Roads Authority with the Minister present. We had such a debate about two years ago and it proved worthwhile.</P>
    <P>To respond to Senators Norris and Manning, although time is short given the volume of legislation to be processed, I have given a commitment to make time available for a short debate on Tibet and Sierra Leone. I will let them know what the position is tomorrow morning. Senator Norris also called for a debate on Northern Ireland. I will endeavour to make time available before the end of the session.</P>
    <P>Senator Moylan expressed disappointment at the fact that the Bacon report was not circulated to Senators. I regret this. The same thing happened at budget time. It should not happen and is disrespectful to Members. I was in contact with the office of the relevant Minister prior to the Order of Business and was assured that a copy of the report would be in each Senator's pigeon hole by the time the Order of Business concludes. I do not want this to happen again. Senator O'Dowd called for a debate on the report. The Minister will be in the House on Wednesday and all day on Friday in what I envisage will be a long sitting to progress the 450 amendments made to the Planning and Development Bill. Perhaps some of the points to be made on the report can be made then. We can review progress on the Order of Business early next week to see what is possible.</P>
    <P>I will endeavour to obtain the information required by Senator Coghlan and will pass on the views of Senator Keogh to the relevant Minister.</P>

      <P>Two amendments have been moved to the Order of Business. I will take them in the order in which they were moved. Senator Manning has moved the following amendment, &ldquo;That No. 4 be deleted from the Order of Business.&rdquo;  Is the amendment being pressed?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>No. I am happy that all sides of the Houses have agreed I have a point that the commitments given by the Government have not <Col N="1281" /> been honoured in the amendments, but I can fight that battle later today. While I will not press my amendment, I will support Senator Quinn's.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is on its way.</P>
      <P>Section 18 of the Act, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, provides that sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 will cease to operate on and from 30 June 2000 unless a resolution is passed by each House of the Oireachtas authorising the sections to continue to operate for such period not exceeding 12 months as may be specified in the resolution.</P>
      <P>Members of this House will appreciate that although this legislation has been in force for a relatively short period of time, the Act, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, recognised the importance of revisiting the provisions at an early date. The intention was, of course, to afford members of the House an opportunity to examine and debate the issues involved which go to the very core of our duty to protect fundamental rights and our responsibility as Members of the Oireachtas to protect the security of the State.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, which was enacted in the aftermath of the Omagh bomb, was to provide the additional protections and powers needed to tackle the threat to the security of the State and the integrity of the peace process presented by certain malevolent dissident groups by making amendments to the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 to 1972. Principally these amendments made changes in the rules of evidence in relation to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation and, more generally, other offences under the Offences against the State Acts and scheduled offences. The Act also created new substantive offences and extended the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the 1939 Act. It might be useful if I were to set out in some detail those legislative provisions &ndash; provisions which the Government wishes to see continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> The provisions of sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Act can be divided into four categories with four essential purposes. First, the Act made changes to the rules of evidence which previously applied in relation to both the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation and more generally for the purpose of other offences under the Offences against the State Acts and scheduled offences under those Acts. Second, the Act created certain new substantive offences of particular relevance to the activities of unlawful organisations and those who provide support for them. Third, the Act gave additional power to the courts in respect of those who provide support to the activities of unlawful organisations or engage in offences on their behalf and, fourth, the Act extended the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act.</P>
    <P>The first category of the sections we are discussing, sections 2 to 5 of the Act, concern changes in rules of evidence. Section 2 has specific reference to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation and is one of the key provisions of the Act. Its effect is to provide that where, in any proceedings against a person in relation to that charge, evidence is given that the accused failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question material to the investigation of the offence while being questioned in relation to that offence, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper. The section goes on to provide that references to any question material to the investigation of the offence include any references to any question requesting the accused to give a full account of his or her movements, actions, activities or associations during any specified period. The section also provides that any such inference may be treated as or as capable of amounting to corroboration of any other evidence relating to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>The section contains two important safeguards &ndash; it provides that the section itself does not have effect unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of a failure or a false or misleading answer might be and provides that a person shall not be convicted solely on an inference drawn from a failure to answer a question or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply.</P>
    <P>Section 4, which amended section 3 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, made a related and consequential change. The effect of the former section 3 of the 1972 Act &ndash; which provided that any statement or conduct by an accused implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation shall, when proceeded against for membership, be evidence that he or she was then such a member &ndash; was also to define the expression &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; as including an <Col N="1284" /> omission by an accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation. The change made by section 4 was to align the definition of conduct with the expression used in section 2 of the Bill, that is, conduct was defined to include movements, actions, activities or associations in addition to the failure to deny such a report.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Act which made the second important change in the area of evidence also has specific reference to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation. It provided that in proceedings for such an offence the accused shall not, without leave of the court, call any other person to give evidence on his or her behalf unless notice has been given of his or her intention to do so. The procedures to be followed in this regard are set out in section 3(2) to (7) which are closely modelled on the existing provisions of our criminal law regarding the requirement to give notice of an alibi on which an accused intends to rely for the purpose of his trial. The section also provides that the requirement in relation to the giving of notice will not apply to a witness whose evidence is solely in relation to the matter of sentence.</P>
    <P>The third change in the area of evidence was made by section 5. This section is not restricted to the offence of membership but, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years' imprisonment or more, has application to any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, scheduled offences for the purposes of the 1939 Act and offences arising out of the same set of facts as an offence under the Acts or a scheduled offence. The effect of this section, which is closely based on a similar provision in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so. This section, as with section 2, incorporated important safeguards whereby it will not have effect unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of a failure to mention such fact might be and provides that a person shall not be convicted solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.</P>
    <P>The second category of provisions created five new substantive offences in sections 6, 7, 8, 9 and 12 as follows, directing an unlawful organisation, possession of articles for purposes connected with certain offences, unlawful collection of information, withholding information and training persons in the making or use of firearms, etc.</P>
    <P>Section 6 established the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act, 1939. That offence attracts a penalty of up to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 7 made it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable sus<Col N="1285" /> picion that the article is in a person's possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences. It also provided that it will be a defence to prove that the materials were not in the person's possession for such purposes. This offence attracts a penalty of a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 8 made it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences. A serious offence is defined for the purpose of the section as an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of five years or more involving loss of human life, serious personal injury, false imprisonment or serious loss or damage and includes an act or omission done or made outside the State which would be such an offence if done within the State. The section also provides that it will be a defence to prove that the information in question was not being collected for the purpose of being used in the commission of a serious offence. The offence of unlawful collection of information attracts a penalty of a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 9 made it an offence to withhold information which a person knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by any other person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any other person for such an offence and who fails without reasonable excuse to disclose such information to a member of the Garda Síochána. A &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; is defined in section 8. This offence attracts a penalty of a fine or imprisonment for up to five years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 12 made it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. This offence attracts a penalty of a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both.</P>
    <P>As I indicated during discussions in the Oireachtas leading to the enactment of this Act, these offences have limited application. They are of a type that they are likely to be committed by members of unlawful organisations arising from the activities of such groups. They are targeted, therefore, as specific activities, such as the collection of information which would be of assistance in planning terrorist attacks or the possession of material which can be used in the making of improvised explosive devices, in which members or supporters of such groups can and do engage. Likewise, the offence of directing an unlawful organisation calls for evidence over and above that of membership of such an organisation. It was nevertheless considered prudent to provide for such an offence which is capable of attracting the higher penalty of life imprisonment to deal with circumstances where such evidence may exist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> The offence of withholding information has a wider potential application, but the message it is intended to underscore is that it is the duty of persons who have knowledge of planned offences involving death, serious injury or destruction, or information which would lead to the conviction of those responsible for such offences, to make that information available to the Garda Síochána. The effect of section 14 is to make these new offences scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. That will mean that persons suspected of committing such offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act and can be charged in relation to such offences on the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is the third category of provision and is intended to strengthen the powers of the courts in respect of those who provide support to the activities of unlawful organisations or engage in offences on their behalf. This section amended section 61 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which deals with the forfeiture of property used for the purpose of committing or facilitating the commission of an offence or intended to be used for that purpose in circumstances where a person has been convicted of an offence. The effect of the change made by section 17 is to provide that in the case of persons convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, a court will be required to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order. The provisions of section 61 apply to both real and personal property and, therefore, permit the seizure of lands on which arms are stored should such a course be warranted.</P>
    <P>The fourth essential purpose of the Act is to extend the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, which was 48 hours, in two separate circumstances. First, section 10 will allow a District Court judge to authorise the detention of a person for a further period not exceeding 24 hours on the application of an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, provided that the District Court judge is satisfied that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make or to have made submissions on his behalf.</P>
    <P>Second, section 11 allows a District Court judge to permit the rearrest and detention of a person, in respect of an offence for which he or she was previously detained but released without charge, for a further period which again is not to exceed 24 hours in circumstances where the District Court judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda about that person's suspected par<Col N="1287" /> ticipation in the offence and about which they wish to question the suspect.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that last Thursday, in accordance with the requirements of section 18(3) of the Act, I laid a report before this House on the operation of these sections during the period 3 September 1998 to 29 May 2000. That report contains information received from the Garda and it shows that during the period covered by the report, no court proceedings utilising sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 12 of the Act have yet arisen. However, the Garda authorities have informed me that the provisions in question have been utilised where appropriate by the Garda during the investigation of offences. Senators will appreciate that many of the investigations at issue are, by their nature, ongoing.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the number of occasions on which a period of detention was extended under section 10 was 29 and that each of these detentions was in respect of a single person. I am further informed that no persons in respect of whom extension orders were made have yet been charged or convicted of an offence, but a number of files have been submitted to the law officers for directions. Nobody has been rearrested under section 11 of the Act and no orders have yet been made utilising section 17 of the Act, although I understand that it is possible that the section will be invoked in relation to cases before the courts at present.</P>
    <P>In considering these statistics, it is important to bear in mind that the provisions of the Act, which were acknowledged on all sides of the House to be strong, were intended to be used only in limited circumstances. It is not surprising, therefore, that the power of extended detention has been used in a relatively small number of cases and that the trial-related provisions have not yet been applied. This sparing use of the provisions of the Act does not, of course, in any way indicate that they are no longer needed, rather it simply reflects the intention that exceptional measures should not be used routinely. The view of the Garda authorities, as outlined in the report which I have laid before the House, and in the light of their current security threat assessment, is that these provisions should remain in force. I concur fully with that view.</P>
    <P>In addition to immediate security concerns, which alone would justify the continuance in force of these provisions, there is another compelling reason for such a continuance in force. Senators may recall that in 1998, on foot of a commitment made in the Good Friday Agreement, I appointed a committee under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court Justice, Mr. Anthony Hederman, to conduct a wide-ranging review of the Offences against the State Acts. The review is currently under way and I expect that the committee will report towards the end of this year. It clearly would make no sense to ask such a committee under a distinguished chairman to review the Offences against the State Acts, <Col N="1288" /> including the provisions we are discussing today, and then to allow the provisions to lapse before the committee reported their conclusions on those very provisions.</P>
    <P>I am asking the House, therefore, in the light of the Garda assessment of the current threat to security which exists, notwithstanding the progress now being made in implementing the peace process, and in order to allow enough time for the completion of the report by the committee which is reviewing the Offences against the State Acts, to continue in force the relevant provisions for a further 12 months. I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This resolution is, in one sense, largely technical in that the Minister is coming back on foot of assurances given to the Houses last year when this legislation was going through that certain sections of its operation would be reviewed. The need for that was understandable given the very wide powers these sections give to the police and the authorities in the carrying out of their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the Minister's speech, which was in a sense largely a restatement of these powers, that this is not ground over which we want to go again. This a motion and that ground was covered during the detailed debate we had in the House on that occasion, so I do not intend to go through the Bill section by section as the Minister has done.</P>
      <P>It is very clear that the provisions have been used sparingly. That is clear especially from the report to which the Minister referred. In many ways, that report is limited in what it can say. It would be much more satisfactory if there was some way, perhaps through the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, that the police would be able to report back to the Members of the Oireachtas on the operation of the legislation because it would be very useful if the Members could hear from the police of the frustrations they still feel, the changes they might seek to make or perhaps the reasons progress under this legislation has been less than many people might have expected. It would be an innovation and, although there might be difficulties, it would give Members a fuller picture of how the legislation has operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems fairly confident that the Hederman review group will finish its work by the end of this year. Ministers invariably tell the Houses of the Oireachtas that whatever ongoing review is taking place is likely to be finished by the end of the year. I hope in this case he is right because there is a need for the publication of the findings of that overall review of Offences against the State legislation. It is a body of legislation which has grown in an<i> ad hoc</i> fashion over the years, often in response to immediate crises. Much of it was not perhaps thought through in a coherent way and the report of the Hederman review will be very important from the point of <Col N="1289" /> view of the whole body of law. I hope the Minister is right when he says it will report by the end of the year. If that is not possible, maybe an interim report would be useful.</P>
    <P>The first reaction to this debate is a sense of frustration. This legislation was passed in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing when there was a justified level of outrage at what had happened. It is one of the sad aspects of life that as time passes, our sense of outrage grows less. We should be as angry today as we were in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing about what happened then and as determined to ensure something such as that never happens again and that the perpetrators of that outrage should be brought to justice, made answerable and made pay for one of the worst crimes ever committed on this island or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that with the passing of time the people believed to be the killers and those belonging to the organisation responsible for the deaths are now free to assemble, carrying out their so-called political objectives with impunity and to signal to the rest of the community that they have no intention of giving up their methods of murder, bombing and so forth and that they are as determined as ever. That is the terrible sense of frustration which many people, but especially those who were touched and who lost loved ones in the Omagh bombing, must feel when they see in their midst these people grouping, their brazen arrogance and see that for these people, their perverted ideal, if it can be called that, is far more important than lives and the maiming of innocent people. We have not heard any sense of regret or remorse from these people or a sense that they might be mistaken in what they are doing. We know they have no mandate from anybody to engage in what they are doing, except from their own perverted reading of Irish history which alone seems to give them a mandate to continue along those lines.</P>
    <P>It is again perhaps a reflection on us as a community that such people are not visited with the moral obloquy which their deeds demand and that the system of shunning and boycotting such people is not part of our tradition and the community does not show these people in sufficiently stark terms what it thinks of them and their behaviour.</P>
    <P>When we review this legislation, there is a great sense of frustration that nothing seems to have happened. Great as these powers are, they have not been used in any effective way to achieve the purpose which is the bringing to justice of those guilty or, at least, those against whom charges can be brought. That is not the fault of the police, of which I am certain. It is not the fault of the Bill but is a fact of life we have to face that getting evidence in a closed society can often be very difficult where outdated and unsustainable notions of loyalty prevail and unsustainable attitudes towards co-operating with the police have become part of the everyday thinking, almost articles of faith, of many of the people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> Hopefully, events in Northern Ireland are moving with some degree of smoothness. Many of the major crises post-Good Friday have been met and overcome. We still face the problems of the implementation of decommissioning and the full implementation of the Patten report, two very formidable obstacles which are interlinked in many ways. Neither is a final solution to the problem but both are huge problems to be overcome before any sort of final settlement is reached.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, we cannot take for granted that all these problems will be overcome. What we can take for granted is that those who perpetrated the Omagh bombing will continue their campaign to destroy the Good Friday Agreement. We can be certain that they will not rest until they have blown the Good Friday Agreement out of the water and have destroyed the peace process. It is all the more important, therefore, that the powers in this Bill are renewed and are available to the police and the authorities in the event of further outbreaks of violence. As I said, we are dealing with people who are certain to engage in future outrages, who despise democracy, tread upon the constitutional rights of others and seek no justification for what they are doing.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish not to renew these powers today. It would be wrong of me not to say that these powers have not been abused in the period since their implementation and also not to say there is a great deal of frustration, which is widely shared, that these extra powers have not resulted in arrests, charges being brought and people being brought to justice. Hopefully, this will happen in time and these powers will not have to be used. I am glad they are there should that need arise. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Both the Minister and Senator Manning referred to the concerns expressed by Members on both sides of the House when this Bill passed through the Seanad in late 1998. At the time the Minister was at pains to point out that these changes would only be used in extreme cases and that this Bill would be back for repeal or otherwise 12 months later. Unfortunately, on Garda advice, the Minister has found it necessary to continue these sections for a further 12 months, and that is why the resolution is before the House. There was much scaremongering about draconian measures when the Bill was introduced but from the figures cited by the Minister and from his speech, it is evident the Garda has ensured these measures have only been used when absolutely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Omagh tragedy was the background to the 1998 Bill. That bombing stunned everyone in this country and throughout the world, and a massive amount of goodwill was expressed towards the victims. We should also remember that bombing took place when a peace process was in place following the Good Friday Agreement. However, some people were still willing and anxious to wreck the peace process, not by democratic <Col N="1291" /> means but by unlawful and violent means. That was why it was necessary to implement these changes.</P>
    <P>The peace process has come a long way since these changes were introduced in 1998. The process had its difficulties. The Northern Ireland Executive was set up and ran successfully for six weeks, during which Ministers worked closely together. Unfortunately the Executive collapsed. I compliment the Minister, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the leaders of the Northern Ireland parties, the British Government and all who held the ceasefires for bringing about circumstances in which the Northern Ireland Executive and the other fora were re-established.</P>
    <P>It is important that people in Northern Ireland are able to lead somewhat normal lives. The common denominator throughout the peace process and the ceasefires has been the strength of resolve for peace shown by the overwhelming majority of people, North and South, and of various political and religious persuasions. This is in spite of those who are still trying to wreck the process.</P>
    <P>The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, made changes to the rules of evidence which apply to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation and, more generally, for the purpose of other offences under the Offences against the State Act and scheduled offences under those Acts. The Act created new substantive offences of particular relevance to the activities of unlawful organisations and those who provide support for them. It also set out to strengthen the hands of courts in respect of those who provide support for the activities of unlawful organisations, or those who engage in offences on their behalf. The Act extended the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act. There were also other minor amendments.</P>
    <P>The report laid before both Houses outlines the following, from which I draw encouragement. In 1998, on foot of a commitment in the Good Friday Agreement, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform appointed a committee under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court judge, Mr. Hederman, to conduct a wide-ranging review of the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 to 1998. This review is under way and the committee is expected to report towards the end of the year. The Minister stated it would be foolish to repeal the Act in the absence of such a report.</P>
    <P>I also note that while no cases for utilising various sections of the Act have yet arisen, the provisions in question have been utilised by the Garda, where appropriate, during the investigation of offences. Many of the investigations at issue are, of their nature, ongoing. The period of detention has been extended under section 10 on 29 occasions and each detention was in respect of a single person. No persons in respect of whom extension orders were made have been charged <Col N="1292" /> or convicted of an offence, but a number of files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>No persons were re-arrested under section 11 of the Act and no orders have been made utilising section 17, although it is possible the section will be invoked in cases before the courts. The Garda authorities have indicated that, in view of the current security threat assessment, particularly the significant threat posed by dissident republican groups, it is considered necessary that the relevant sections of the Act remain in force. Both Houses must continue to give the Garda every assistance and support in this matter.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that a final decision on the need for the continued operation of the relevant sections should not be taken until the report of the committee is available, and on the need to allow sufficient time for consideration of the committee's report. The Minister proposes to continue the operation of all sections for a further 12 months. In so doing, taking the overall security situation into account and notwithstanding the progress made in implementing the peace process, he considers that any action to discontinue the relevant sections in advance of the examination of the committee's report would be inappropriate. I agree with that assessment.</P>
    <P>To repeal the Act now would send the wrong message to dissidents and those trying to wreck the peace process. When we least expect it, as in the case of the Omagh bomb, these people strengthen their resolve and seek to do damage to people and property in a bid to wreck the peace process. That process has its detractors and objectors in democratic fora, North and South. I have no difficulty with people who hold an opposing opinion, as that is what democracy is about. However, I have enormous difficulty with those who set out to knowingly murder and maim citizens of our country, North and South. The Minister's advice is that we have to extend the provisions of the Bill for a further 12 months. I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and, with reluctance, I welcome the resolution to extend the provisions of this Act for a further year. Democracy has many enemies and sometimes those enemies win. Sometimes their success is temporary or is a small victory, but the 1998 and 1999 Acts were small victories for those enemies of democracy. It is a pity and sad we have had to pass these Acts.</P>
      <P>I travelled to France as a student many years ago and on one occasion I was stopped and asked for my identity card. I asked what was meant by an identity card as we did not have such things in Ireland because we lived in a democracy and did not need them. Those living in France at that stage wondered how any democracy could exist without identity cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we fought for and won independence in the 1920s, we have had a sense of trying to avoid any constraints on liberty. These measures were <Col N="1293" /> introduced with reluctance following the Omagh bomb and were described by the Taoiseach as draconian measures. At the time, the Minister gave a commitment that the provisions would be reviewed, and that is what we are doing today. I welcome the chance to review the measure and the Minister's statement. He has taken us through the review very well and indicated to what extent these powers have been used. Senator Manning pointed out that they have been used sparingly.</P>
    <P>In an interview some months ago, the Garda Commissioner ruffled some feathers when he said it is unlikely those responsible for the Omagh bomb would be charged. That comment gives some idea of how, although these measures are draconian, they have not been strong enough on either side of the Border to bring those guilty of that outrage to justice. We are aware that we have to continue these powers which are constraints on our liberty. We do so reluctantly but in the knowledge that it is necessary.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday a bomb was found at Peter Mandelson's official residence in Hillsborough. I do not know how long it was there but it is a reminder of the continuing threat to democracy on this island. I look forward to the day when the Minister comes into the House to tell us we no longer need this legislation. I hope that day comes soon. We had high hopes after the Good Friday Agreement but lost some of that confidence as a result of the traumas of the past year or two. I hope we are close to that feeling again. Democracy will have won and its enemies will have lost when the Minister tells the House we no longer need these powers as we are living in a safer Ireland. I support this motion with reluctance. We continue these provisions in the knowledge that it is the only choice we have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Like Senator Quinn, I will support this motion with great reluctance. At least we had the foresight to ensure that the 1998 provisions would be on a temporary basis and subject to the review of both Houses. I am glad this House has an opportunity to review the provisions. It has been acknowledged that the offences against the State provisions are draconian and do not operate in normal circumstances in any other democracy in Europe. When similar measures were proposed in Westminster in 1998, it caused uproar. Britain is intent on ensuring that no tragic incident, no matter how horrific, will result in what it deems as bad law, including interference with the rights of citizens and the right to silence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the context in which we must look at this issue &ndash; the other jurisdiction did not feel it necessary to be as draconian as us. However, we implemented the measures because we were closer to the event. We did so on the condition that they would be temporary and that the Hederman committee, which we were obliged to set up under the Good Friday Agreement and which is due to report at the end of the year, would look at the matter. I agree with the Minister that it <Col N="1294" /> would be somewhat invidious of us, having passed the legislation in 1998, not to wait until we get the full report from the former Justice, Mr. Hederman. We can then review the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act, as we are obliged to do under the Good Friday Agreement, and bring the legislation of both jurisdictions on this island into line.</P>
    <P>I have some concerns about severe measures being adopted in legislation to deal with one organisation and one horrific incident. I do not think we can do that as citizens and democrats other than on a temporary basis. Therefore, a review of how well it is working is extremely important. The operation of the legislation does not seem to have been very effective. Sections 2 to 9, inclusive, and 12 have never been used in court proceedings. although section 2 might be used in the interrogation process.</P>
    <P>Detention was extended by an additional 24 hours on 29 occasions and there were no rearrests. I am surprised this did not happen. I would have liked some more information on the reason for the 29 extensions. Presumably a file was provided to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Minister said files have been submitted to the law officers. Who are these officers? Are they Garda officers? Are they or the Director of Public Prosecutions actively engaged in bringing charges? There is not much sense in putting draconian measures in place unless there are results.</P>
    <P>I am most surprised that nobody has been arrested for being a member of an illegal organisation under this legislation. I always thought it was easy for the authorities to arrest a member of an illegal organisation. Under the existing Offences against the State Act, all it requires is a superintendent, a high-ranking Garda officer, to say he or she believes that somebody is a member of an illegal organisation. Why have we been unable to find one single member of the illegal organisation, the Real IRA, which everyone knows is responsible for the Omagh bombing? I do not understand how this has happened because the rules of evidence are quite weak in this regard. This measure has always been used against members of the INLA and the IRA. I would like to know why we have no statistics regarding the charging of members of an illegal organisation.</P>
    <P>When this legislation was introduced, we wanted to achieve a balance in protecting the rights of citizens. If we were to give the Garda the draconian powers they sought, we wanted a counter-balance. It was in 1977 the heavy gang were put to rest, having operated from 1972 or 1973. At that time, a committee was set up under Judge Barra O'Briain to make recommendations on the taping of interviews in Garda stations. The Minister told us in 1998 that this system was operating on a pilot basis in eight stations throughout the country. I remember asking if Carrickmacross was one of them and I think the answer was negative. A great deal of questioning takes place there or in Dundalk. What progress <Col N="1295" /> has been made since then in making provisions for the audio-visual taping of interviews? I am not aware if any have taken place. Some protective measures were requested because, as this legislation specifies, if inference is to be drawn from the behaviour and responses of those being questioned, we will know there is a record of what transpired in the interrogation cell. Will the Minister give us some information on that? We need to know what checks and balances are being put in place.</P>
    <P>We also need more detail on the effective operation of this legislation. All we got was a bland statement from the Minister saying the Garda have requested the extension of this provision. Why do they want its extension if they have not made a single prosecution? No one has been charged with membership of the illegal organisation which this legislation was specifically introduced to deal with. We all want peace in Northern Ireland and we are willing to support what is necessary to ensure that. However, we cannot do that unless we know we are doing so on a sound basis. That requires information &ndash; I am not satisfied we have been given sufficient information to assure us of the value and effectiveness of this legislation, which also seems contrary to the human rights legislation we passed recently.</P>
    <P>When the former Justice, Mr. Hederman, makes his recommendations, he is almost certainly likely to strike down many of the provisions of the Offences against the State Act. We must prepare ourselves to make ordinary provisions dealing with offences against this State. Where there are provisions, they will have to be shown to be effective. The only reason the Offences against the State Act, 1939, has remained on the Statute Book is because it was handy and the Garda Síochána liked it being there. It was an extraordinary measure which was introduced during the Emergency.</P>
    <P>I support the retention of this measure on a temporary basis. However, I hope that as soon as the former Justice, Mr. Hederman, makes his recommendations at the end of the year, legislation will be introduced rapidly so that we can regularise the position in relation to the jurisdictions in the Republic and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I share the other Senators' concerns about the renewal of this legislation, but it is quite obvious it has to be renewed. I use this occasion to ask the Minister three questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first concerns the apparently increasing amount of drugs being found in Northern Ireland. Is there as much co-operation as possible between the police forces of both jurisdictions? The scale of drug abuse there appears to have become enormous. I have received letters from those involved in the rehabilitation of prisoners and their families in Northern Ireland indicating their shock at the way some of the families, rather <Col N="1296" /> than the prisoners, have become involved in drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Second, has any progress been made on preventing the expulsion of people in Northern Ireland by paramilitary groups and allowing for the return of those expelled? These groups have, for their own reasons, perhaps because they have decided the people are involved in drug abuse, decided that such people must go into exile.</P>
    <P>Third, has there been any further progress in finding the graves of the disappeared? This is a source of great distress. I realise the commission has had to halt digging at the various sites. I would be grateful if the Minister could tell me if any more progress is being made behind the scenes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for contributing so positively to the debate and for recognising the need to continue this legislation. The Garda Síochána want to see the provisions continued, although no charges have been brought forward. They believe that certain people in our society remain a security threat to the State. In those circumstances, it is in the interests of the common good that the legislation should remain extant.</P>
      <P>The issue of the video recording of people being questioned is progressing, in that stations throughout the country are being provided with the relevant equipment. I anticipate that each station involved will have the necessary equipment within nine months. Pilot schemes are in operation and it is hoped to introduce the scheme generally during 2001.</P>
      <P>These provisions are of considerable importance in the context of the continuing battle against people who would seek to subvert the will of the vast majority of the people of this island. That is why these provisions have been brought forward again for the coming year.</P>
      <P>In regard to the questions posed by Senator Henry, I will refer to those matters and contact her about them in due course, so that she may have the necessary replies. I thank Senators for their support for these provisions which are of fundamental importance.</P>

    <Title>Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne): Molaim an Bille beag tábhachtach seo don Teach. I commend this short but important Bill to the House. I propose to deal first with aquaculture licensing, to which provisions of the Bill directly relate, before broadening my remarks to cover my vision for the sustainable growth of aquaculture.</P>
    <P>A solid licensing framework is in place to facilitate the sustainable development of aquaculture to its full potential. I am determined to ensure the licensing framework works as effectively and speedily as possible in the interests of both the industry and the public whose support is essential. Since I spoke here in December 1998 on the Fisheries and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill, 1998, I have secured very substantial progress in processing the huge arrears of licence applications which had built up over years while the licensing law was being reformed and made operational. A figure of 294 licences, comprising 272 aquaculture and 22 trial licences for aquaculture purposes, have been granted as compared with an annual average of about 70 licences granted for aquaculture purposes in previous years. Licensing decisions have been made in a further 28 cases, of which 15 await the end of the one month appeal period before licences can issue in any event and 13 await the determination of the independent Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board on appeals.</P>
    <P>There are about 300 applications on hand which my Department aims to progress to decision in 2000 after completion of the necessary consultation and assessment procedures. Processing about 20 applications for finfish culture will have to follow publication of the necessary comprehensive environmental impact statement in each case. The more complex or controversial the application, of course, the longer it must take to process to decision. In straightforward new cases, usually small in nature, a decision is made within three to four months and sometimes earlier if no objections or concerns emerge in the necessary consultation process.</P>
    <P>My Department, in consultation with the aquaculture industry, is keeping licensing procedures under close review so as to ensure good practices continue to prevail both in the preparation and processing of licence applications and necessary supporting documentation. A suite of detailed monitoring and other protocols for matters such as water quality, benthic monitoring and amelioration, audit of farms, sea lice monitoring and control and fallowing of sites has already been devised for the marine finfish sector in consultation with the industry and other interested parties and made part and parcel of aquaculture licences. Work is proceeding on devising further <Col N="1298" /> protocols for both the marine finfish and marine shellfish sectors, with priority for visual impact assessment, lighting and marking of structures and benthic monitoring and amelioration for intensive shellfish operations.</P>
    <P>The industry and my Department intend addressing priority licensing issues concerning freshwater aquaculture later this year in consultation with other permitting authorities in order to streamline the permitting and monitoring procedures and allow the sector develop to its full potential in a sustainable way.</P>
    <P>The Bill concerns two priority matters relating to the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board. The provision of an independent statutory appeals mechanism as well as a mechanism for public consultation and consultation with expert organisations is a key feature of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997. It is essential that the board performs its duties efficiently and effectively and has the necessary powers to do so. It has dealt with a substantial caseload since it was established on 30 June 1998, with 48 cases already determined. As of now, 13 cases await determination, three finfish and ten shellfish.</P>
    <P>The board has pointed to the lack of power or obligation in the 1997 Act for its refusal to explain determinations made, in contrast to the specific statutory obligation on An Bord Pleanála under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts. This has created obvious difficulty for licence applicants and for me as Minister with responsibility for national policy for aquaculture licensing, and so calls for early remedy via this Bill. It is only proper in the interests of transparency and fairness of procedures that all future determinations of the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board shall be explained when made and that the board shall, on request, give a summary of the main reasons and considerations for past determinations. That is the purpose of section 2 which inserts a new subsection (8) in section 40 of the 1997 Act dealing with appeals to the board.</P>
    <P>The other priority matter concerns inspection powers. The Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board requested a clearer statutory statement of its own power and the power of a consultant or adviser engaged by it to visit any land, foreshore area or water to which an appeal relates, regardless of whether an oral hearing of the appeal is to be held. There is doubt that the current inspection power may be limited to appeal cases where an oral hearing is held, which was not the intention. I am delighted to be able to accede to the board's request in a timely way via section 4 of the Bill which provides comprehensive inspection powers for the board and any consultant or adviser engaged to perform functions on its behalf. A number of consequential amendments to the 1997 Act are provided for in sections 3 and 5.</P>
    <P>My Department is keeping the 1997 Act under review in the light of ongoing operational experience and changes proposed in other relevant legislation, notably that relating to planning. I will <Col N="1299" /> carefully consider suggestions which the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, the industry or third parties may make for improving the 1997 Act to better serve its purpose and operation. Legislative proposals will be made to the Houses of the Oireachtas as and when the need therefor is clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and I will review the staffing and funding arrangements for the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board at the end of 2000 in light of its operations, costs and prospective business in the medium to longer term.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture licensing framework in place and the important provisions of the Bill are an essential element of our strategy to develop aquaculture as a high quality and high value contributor to local and national development as soon as possible. My vision is of a major premier class industry competing successfully in international markets.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the further sustainable development of aquaculture, for which it has earmarked £25 million in the National Development Plan 2000-06. That is more than double the funding made available under the last round of Structural Funds. More than a doubling of annual aquaculture production is projected in that period, that is, to over 95,000 tonnes, as compared with 41,000 tonnes in 1998. The detailed operational aspects of the national development plan are being negotiated with the European Commission and my Department is keeping in touch with the industry on the progress of these negotiations. A strong partnership between my Department, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Marine Institute, Udarás na Gaeltachta and, more importantly, the industry will ensure we achieve our objectives for the aquaculture sector and position the industry to compete successfully in growing international markets.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the recently published CIRCA report which we commissioned last year to provide a major strategic analysis of the future directions and opportunities for aquaculture. The report concludes that sustainable development of the aquaculture industry is in the national interest and vital for our coastal communities. The report recommends that the industry must achieve critical mass in production terms, diversification into new species, best practice in line with stringent environmental guidelines and high standards of quality assurance. These are the key challenges we must address to position the industry internationally over the next decade.</P>
    <P>The report recommends the achievement of annual production of at least 150,000 tonnes by 2015 by adopting the following four strategies: quickly build critical mass in salmon, sea reared trout and mussels and increase the level of value added in the production chain; create additional peripheral coastal income and high quality jobs in species with lower capital costs and less potential value added; enhancement of State services underpinning quality, sustainable development, <Col N="1300" /> regulation and other technical and policy areas; greater support for innovation-led development, which ensures research and development, technology transfer and technical services will better meet the needs of the industry. The CIRCA report clearly puts a tough ambitious agenda before us and I assure the House of my total commitment to work with all concerned to make it happen.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Molaimid ar an dtaobh seo den Teach an Bille tábhachtach seo freisin. I also welcome the Minister of State who said that this is a short Bill. We recognise that it is short but its contents are of vital importance. It is recognised in the CIRCA report that the aquaculture industry is part of our economic development, particularly in the west where opportunities for industry or other job opportunities are severely limited and where the attraction of industrial jobs in towns often means the population along the coast is decimated, apart from people with second houses as holiday homes.</P>
      <P>The potential of the aquaculture industry is enhanced by adding value to product and looking at new ways of producing and selling it. I recently came across a company which has developed a product which before this I would not touch in one million years &ndash; rollmop &ndash; as I always found it sickening. It has however been able to remove the oily slink. As a consequence I can see the product taking off. I can see the same thing happening in the aquaculture industry.</P>
      <P>I commend the Department on increasing the number of licences. Up to last year approximately 70 licences per year were issued. Last year 294 were issued, of which 272 were aquaculture licences and 22 were trial licences for aquacultural purposes. This acceleration is be to welcomed if we are to achieve the critical mass recommended by the Minister of State and the CIRCA report. It is critical that we do this sooner rather than later. It is important that we create an identity for Ireland as a place which produces a high quality product and enter the European market as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board the same authority and responsibilities as An Bord Pleanála has under the Planning and Development Bill which is due to come before the House again tomorrow. This is to be commended. Anything that will show why a particular decision has been made is to be welcomed. I have expressed the fear, however, that Governments often hand over authority or responsibility to outsiders who are not accountable to the people. I said this about An Bord Pleanála and I would hate to have to say it about the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board. There should be another avenue of appeal which should not cost an individual too much to overturn a decision of the board without having to go the High Court or Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Government will increase the amount of £25 million earmarked for aquaculture <Col N="1301" /> in the national development plan. I am aware that this represents a doubling of the funding available but if we are to achieve the critical mass recommended by the Minister of State it is essential to accelerate faster. While some of the Bill's provisions will allow this, we can do a little better. I am not suggesting automatically as the Opposition is inclined to do that we throw more money at the industry, but the sooner we achieve the critical mass recommended by the Minister of State the better for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Many years ago when the original aquaculture fisheries were being established there were complaints about the visual effect. In this context I am glad that certain aspects are being enhanced. It should always be taken into account by the Minister of State that there are people who make a living from tourism which has to be balanced with aquaculture to ensure the visual amenity is not disturbed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to freshwater production. I look forward to debating that issue with him. There will be statements on water quality later today. The two go hand in hand. We want to ensure freshwater fishing is good and that the after effects are also good and do not add to pollution. I commend the Bill and thank the Minister of State for introducing it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne. This is a small Bill, but from where I come and given its effects, it is very important. It is the second Bill of its kind to be introduced to the House within the past 18 months. The Fisheries and Foreshore (Amendment) Act, 1998, introduced to the House on 18 December 1998 amended the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997. The amendment provided for under the 1998 Act was needed to get the licensing structure up and running as things had been at a standstill. Changes provided for in the Act ensured that existing aquaculture licensing arrangements will endure and will withstand legal challenge. Sections 74 and 75 of the 1997 Act were revised by sections 2 and 3 of the 1998 Act to remove any doubts in this regard.</P>
      <P>For many years, up to 1997, many operators had been operating without licences pending receipt of them. This continued up to early 1998 because of delays. Section 11 of the 1997 Act was also amended so as to prohibit from December 1998 operators from commencing aquaculture operations pending the granting of licences after due process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of many unlicensed operators due to the ineffectiveness of the legal structures and their acceptance by the Department, which helped the industry to develop at the time, caused many disputes which only came to light when the proper legal structures were put in place to grant licences. The 1998 Act was needed to protect the rights not alone of the licensed aquaculture farms but also third party rights. It was intended to ensure a proper process with regard to proposals <Col N="1302" /> for new aquaculture operations fully in accordance with the spirit of the 1997 Act.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems in the aquaculture industry have simmered for years, with no redress possible by genuine applicants or by third party objectors. It was only after the passing of the 1998 Act that the proper legal development of this very important industry to many coastal areas took place. Many of the problems over disputes about sites only came to light with the establishment of the appeals board structure and decision-making process, which commenced in early 1999. These problems only became apparent when the Department commenced advertising its decisions and the appeals board mechanism started operating. While there were always disputes regarding local difficulties, the location of sites and specific bays where certain operators with long established rights curtailed their use to new operators, many new problems arose, especially with environmental considerations, where new environmental groups were established to oppose the granting of licences to operators, even those who were on sites for many years.</P>
    <P>A new problem has arisen where many people are unhappy with the decisions of the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board. They consider that insufficient information has been available on decisions made. This is the reason for this Bill. Its main purpose is to correct continued inefficiencies and inadequacies in the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, which have come to light since the appeals board commenced its work.</P>
    <P>Section 2 obliges the appeals board to state the main reasons and considerations on which determinations are based on appeals against ministerial decisions to grant or refuse aquaculture licences under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, as subsequently amended by the 1998 Act. Some disquiet has been expressed that insufficient information has been available regarding decisions made by the appeals board. Objectors are not only determined about their objections, they are also very inquisitive about how decisions are made. Consequently, the Minister is not only prepared to provide for more accountability and transparency in the future, he is also providing by way of a supplementary provision a requirement on the appeals board to provide, if requested, a detailed summary of the main reasons and considerations on which it based its decisions on appeals heard by it before the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The appeals board has dealt with 48 cases since 1999, against which I understand there were up to 90 appeals. I also understand there was only a very small rejection rate of decisions made by the Minister. The appeals board has fully confirmed the Minister's decisions in up to 30% of cases before it. In most other appeals it has left licences in place but has altered the conditions on which they have been granted.</P>
    <P>The membership of the appeals board is set at seven and it comprises respected members of society. Both the chairman and deputy chairper<Col N="1303" /> son have considerable legal backgrounds. The other members have backgrounds in the marine, aquaculture, industry and food sectors. Even with this expertise, it is right that people who feel aggrieved should know the full facts on which the appeals board has made its decisions.</P>
    <P>The second purpose of the Bill is to clarify the power of the appeals board, or any expert employed by it, such as consultants or special advisers, as they relate to inspecting land, foreshore and any other sea areas relative to appeals. This removes any doubt that the inspection powers under the 1997 Act were confined to appeals which are the subject of an oral hearing, which was not the intention. Section 57(2) and (3) of the 1997 Act referred only to the powers of the appeals board where appeals were subject to an oral hearing. Inspecting powers of any consultant or expert are comprehensively provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also makes it an offence to obstruct the appeals board or its agents from carrying out inspections necessary in relation to an appeal. Penalties are laid down in the 1997 Act. Section 5 makes clear the obligation of any consultant or adviser engaged by the appeals board to provide it with a written report with recommendations on any inspections carried out in relation to a relevant appeal which he or she carries out on behalf of the board.</P>
    <P>The obligations imposed under this legislation are similar to those already imposed on An Bord Pleanála, where the board, on request, will provide not only a copy of its decisions but a full copy of the report written by its inspector. In many cases the board goes a long way towards explaining the decision it has made and the justification for it. It can soften the blow to the objector if the objection is not successful. It also works the other way where planning decisions are overturned. I have seen cases where the board has overlooked the inspector's report and made a decision opposite to that proposed by the inspector. It will be interesting to see how this new system is operated by the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board. If the appeals board goes against its inspector's report I doubt if matters will be dealt with more severely by the public than has been the case under the planning process.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a short technical Bill with two main purposes. However, when passed it will provide information on how aquaculture licences disputes are resolved. While it does not require additional staffing or additional costs to the Exchequer, I am glad the Minister of State intends to review the operational costs of the projected workload of the appeals board before the end of the year and, if necessary, provide extra staffing and funding.</P>
    <P>Until recent years the aquaculture industry has been underdeveloped. Nevertheless, its output is worth over £60 million per annum and it employs more than 3,000 people. The recent legislation has safeguarded and will consolidate the industry. Its potential growth is enormous, especially along the west coast. The industry must continue to <Col N="1304" /> apply the highest standards possible to all areas of fish farming. Secure aquaculture licensing arrangements that can withstand legal challenges will play a very important part in the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Department on the amendments to the legislation it has made over the past two years to improve the environment in which the industry operates. We need the support of other Departments to ensure the quality of the seafood being processed along the coastline. I encourage the Minister of State to put pressure on the Department of the Environment and Local Government to address the quality of water in many bays where aquaculture operations have commenced. There is an urgent need to provide funding to upgrade treatment plants in coastal towns where waste water goes into the bay.</P>
    <P>I know the Minster of State's Department has been in contact with Donegal County Council with regard to an upgrading of the sewerage scheme in my town of Dungloe, where the waste water goes into the bay and where a number of operators use the bay. I understand there are five licensed operators in the bay and two others who were refused licences because the water quality on the side of the bay where they operated was not up to the highest standard. I raised the issue at local level and succeeded in having the scheme raised from 11th on the country priority list last September to 4th at present. The matter is now with the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I argued the case primarily for the development of aquaculture in the bay. I pointed out to the Minister that the lack of adequate treatment of sewage entering this bay must be addressed urgently. I am particularly concerned at the low priority which the Department has placed on the construction of an appropriate sewage treatment plant. The local authority, through our efforts at local level, has brought the matter to the attention of the Department.</P>
    <P>Dungloe Bay is currently the largest production area for gigas oysters in County Donegal and supports up to seven operators. However, these operations, the jobs they provide and the substantial funding, both private and public, which has been invested in them are now at serious risk because of the increasingly poor water quality within the bay. Under the shellfish water directive, member states have an obligation to ensure that waters in which shellfish are cultivated are improved and not allowed to deteriorate. Unless urgent action is taken to reduce the outflow of sewage in my town, the Department may need to prohibit the sale of shellfish from the bay on public health grounds or face infringement procedures by the Commission under the directive.</P>
    <P>In the event of the closure of the bay there will inevitably be legal claims for compensation by those whose livelihoods will be affected. It is also the case that the adverse publicity arising from such actions would seriously undermine the repu<Col N="1305" /> tation of the aquaculture industry. We must ensure that the current and future potential of the industry in this bay is protected. I trust the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, will raise the matter on my behalf with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Another matter which causes concern is the necessary approval, both by the Department and the local authority, for the development of facilities for operators along the coast. The 1998 Act amended sections 12 to 14, inclusive, of the Foreshore Act, 1933, to update the protection of aquaculture and the foreshore generally from unauthorised development. For many years there were no obvious controls regarding the foreshore and activities along it. The legislation was necessary and more is needed for better coastal zone management. All of this involves more consultation with other Departments and statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>The growth of aquaculture in general and the expeditious way many aquaculture licences have been issued in the past 15 months will lead to much more activity in coastal regions. Many operators require working structures on the coastline. There are many sites available along the coast which are suitable for such development but it can be stalled by unnecessary delays in certain organisations such as the Valuation Office. I have noticed a huge change in the past year in the approach of the consumer section of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources regarding the provision of information and the speed with which it reaches decisions on granting licences. Continued improvements are necessary to enable the mariculture and aquaculture industry to develop to their full potential and to provide employment and a livelihood for those in many coastal regions which have suffered in recent years due to the decline in the fishing industry. This decline is due primarily to the reduced quotas. Suggestions have been made in the past week that we may have to suffer further fleet reductions.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Fahey, on his stance on this issue since becoming Minister and also on the issue of the re-negotiation of the CFP. I also congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, on the efforts he has made regarding the aquaculture industry. It has been a pleasure to work with him. On any occasion on which I approached him I received his full co-operation. That is appreciated not only by me and the other public representatives but by the many operators on whose behalf we approached him.</P>
    <P>I was glad the Minister of State was able to come to Mulroy Bay last week to launch the Mulroy Bay interpretative sign and to open an exhibition of results from an environmental education project run by the aquaculture initiative in conjunction with the three local primary schools. The installation of the sign was part of a countrywide initiative by Bord Iascaigh Mhara to improve the knowledge and awareness of the public regarding <Col N="1306" /> aquaculture. As the Minister of State will be aware, over many years great development has taken place in Mulroy in the mariculture and aquaculture industries. There are many other bays in County Donegal and along the west coast involved in similar developments such as Trai Beaga Bay in Inisowen, Sheephaven Bay off Arranmore Island, Traighheanagh Bay which is the next bay adjacent to Dungloe Bay, Loughros Point and Inver Bay.</P>
    <P>There is an active fisheries and coastal committee in Donegal County Council and it is most anxious to meet the Minister of State. I trust that when he is in Donegal in the next two weeks he will be able to meet the committee. It is supportive of the development of aquaculture, but it also has concerns and wishes to address various problems, particularly regarding the development in Lough Swilly and other matters such as the effect of the large increase in the number of seals on the inland waters and fisheries. I trust the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will be in a position to meet the committee and hear our views.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House. I am delighted at the speed with which it has reached this House and I hope it will be taken in the other House and passed before the recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal gairid a rá mar gheall ar an mBille seo. Any time I say that I ramble on for a good while and therefore I will be watching Senator Coogan, who can give me an odd wink.</P>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Byrne. Often Bills to do with the east containing 50 or hundreds of pages are taken in this House, but this is an important Bill to amend the Fisheries and Foreshore (Amendment) Act, 1998, which deals primarily with the west. The two Senators who spoke are from the west also. We come from a Gaeltacht area where, as the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will be well aware, there is a shortage of jobs and therefore we might as well return to where we all started, that is, sea fishing.</P>
      <P>Like other Senators, I congratulate the Minister of State and his Department on the number of licences which have been processed to date. The Minister of State has cut the backlog in the issuing of licences by a huge amount. In a climate when one often gets criticised for doing nothing, I hope this will be recognised.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the Department, the other agencies like BIM, the Marine Institute and Údarás na Gaeltachta are ensuring that all the Minister's objectives will come to fruition. Mariculture has not been forgotten in the national plan in that over the next five or six years up to £24 million will be invested in it. The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, has done a great job with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Senators, occasionally I receive a certain query and I might as well ask the Minister of State about it while he is here. Does the harvesting of seaweed come under the aegis of the Depart<Col N="1307" /> ment? If so, who owns the rights to the seaweed? Are there special designated areas where harvesting is allowed and others where it is not? Although I suppose everything is parochial, I raise this because there is a fairly big development starting in my part of the country and the developers approached me to find answers to these questions. They wanted to know whether licences were necessary and if they were issued by the Department. They also wanted to know the landowners' entitlements and whether these relate to the high-water or low-water mark. These are matters which always cause great difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, would know my part of the country as well as I do. For years they have been harvesting seaweed in Magharees on the Castlegregory side of the peninsula without equipment, cutting it with whatever implement they find and putting it in heaps along the shore before taking it away. Someone had the idea that there might be a mechanical means of collecting the seaweed and they asked if grants were available. Asking about this now will save me the trouble of writing a long letter to the Minister of State to raise all these points.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State continues his good work which is definitely appreciated. It means a great deal to the people of the west, especially those south of the Shannon. One often thinks of Donegal or Galway when one speaks of the west, but it also includes those areas south of the Shannon and Gaeltacht areas. I wish the Minister of State well and hope he can answer some of the questions we asked him. I welcome the Bill and the amendments contained in it.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne): Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeachas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir nua, Seán Ó Fearghail. Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé sa Teach seo nó b'fhéidir sa Teach eile sna blianta amach anseo. I wish Senator Ó Fearghail well. It seems, after recent GAA results, he and Senators Tom Fitzgerald and Coogan will have a busy summer whereas both Senator Bonner and I will not. We will say no more about that.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions which were very positive. I expect positivity from the Government side of the House, but it is pleasant to hear it coming from the other side of the House. This is an industry which deserves support. I note that Senator Coogan made no attempt to make a political football of it. He should be commended on that and I thank him for it.</P>
    <P>Many valid questions have been asked. I will try to deal with them as quickly and fully as possible. Senators Coogan, Bonner and Fitzgerald mentioned jobs in coastal communities. This is the one magnificent feature of aquaculture, that we can create jobs in remote rural areas. As most people will know, I live in such an area, namely, the Hook peninsula in County Wexford, which is <Col N="1308" /> the remotest part of that county. The nearest town is 20 miles away. When a famous politician came to visit, all he could see was water all around. He said he did not know how I would get elected because 95% of my constituents were fish. He also threw in an adjective or two which might not be appropriate to this House.</P>
    <P>I know how important it is for my constituents, people, friends and neighbours, who are, by and large, people with seawater in their blood, to remain in the local community, whether it be just playing with their local GAA club or being with their family. As the saying goes, the savage loves its native shore. There are not many savages in Wexford, but the people want to be there in any event. It is important for the country as a whole that people are kept in rural areas to stop pressure being placed on cities. There are many pressures on Dublin, so we should definitely keep people employed in remote rural areas. Such pressures include roadways, social welfare services, housing and other services. From an economic and social point of view, it is important to keep people in their own areas.</P>
    <P>I will deal with what is proposed in the CIRCA report to which all Senators referred. It is intended to increase the number of jobs, between the support industry and the industry itself, to about 10,000 from the current position of about 1,300 full-time equivalent jobs in the industry and 2,000 jobs in the support industry. If we can keep people living and gainfully employed in rural areas, we are doing them a big favour. I want to develop the industry and that is why I commissioned this report. It is not an <i>ad hoc</i> business. We do not move from day to day. We have set out a plan and we intend to follow it. I believe that what I have set out is achievable. The figures mentioned in the report are a little greater than those I mentioned. I am a realist who wants to achieve the targets set out. I thank the three Senators for the gratitude they expressed to me in my working with the industry. I want to work with the industry and the agencies because we are a team. If a team works well together, which did not happen in Wexford's case last Sunday, it can win, and that is my intention.</P>
    <P>I have increased the allocation of licences in the past year from the annual average of about 70 to 300 at present. I am being pressed on this matter by my Department officials and I thank Thomas Tobin, who is with me today, for maintaining the pressure. Decisions on about 60 licences have been appealed and it is a compliment to my officials and me, even if I say so myself, that only one of the appeals did not coincide with the decision I made. Needless to say, I am pleased about that and it is a great compliment to my Department.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary because, where decisions are made by the appeals board, it is right that anyone questioning such decisions should have an explanation as to why such decisions were made. Above all, I want to ensure transparency. I want the public to feel happy with decisions because it <Col N="1309" /> is suspicious of various structures and activities on our coastline. I want the public to feel comfortable with decisions I make. Consequently, I will invite members of the public to talk to me if they have any doubt about what is happening. The Bill opens the door to that a little more.</P>
    <P>I recently unveiled a sign in Mulroy Bay in Donegal, which is a beautiful part of the country. The sign is interpretative, which means that anyone, be they tourists, locals, environmentalists, inshore or shipping people, can look at the sign and see what is happening in the bay and the location of activities there. Again, it is an example of transparency. To complement that, I am introducing a programme called CLAMS, which is the short name for co-ordinated local aquaculture management systems. Many different groups have an interest in a bay, such as inshore fishermen, shipping interests, environmentalists and others who are concerned about the look of the bay, such as retired people living on the shoreline, aquaculture people, boating enthusiasts and swimmers.</P>
    <P>When I make decisions on activities within a bay or draw up a development plan for a bay, I invite those people to discuss with each other what they want to achieve. It has happened successfully in a number of bays where we have designed a plan of which all groups are agreed that aquaculture should be an element and the shipping channels should be kept open, which means environmentalists are happy with the visual impact and inshore fishermen can continue to do their business as before. This is an effort to generate more transparency because past suspicions have often festered and grown to a degree that spread into the wider world. Consequently, when applications were made there was a sudden rush of objections which were, perhaps, unnecessary. However, people are entitled to transparency. In the development of the industry I want to have people brought on board and for them to feel comfortable. That is the reason for the introduction of the new element in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank the appeals board for its work to date. An appeals board has a difficult job, by any stretch of the imagination. Some people say only cranks make appeals, but I do not believe that. I would like to think that the people who make appeals do so for good and genuine reasons. When appeals are heard fairly, people are pleased. If the appeals board requires further assistance, be it by way of additional funding or staff, I will ensure that they will be provided with same. The board is necessary and functional and it sends out the right signal to the public.</P>
    <P>I thank the Department for its performance in having the Bill ready in a short time and for the work done on the licensing system but, more importantly, for the development of the industry. I have given much of my time to aquaculture. I visited almost every county to date in supporting the industry and encouraging people to develop it to grow from the present income of £60 million per year to £450 million per year in 15 years' time. <Col N="1310" /> That target is achievable during my time in office, the likelihood of which is about 20 years. When I retire it will probably be the same Government which will continue. Whatever time it takes, I intend to continue with this drive, as my predecessor did and as I am sure my successor will do.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan referred to the question of additional money. Wherever a line is drawn with regard to money people will suggest there should be more. I agree with the general tone of what the Senator said, but I assure him that although £25 million has been included in the plan, if in my term of office more money is sought and the industry is dependent on it, I will put a strong case to Cabinet. I commend Senator Coogan on raising that issue.</P>
    <P>I will answer as best I can the question raised by Senator Fitzgerald regarding seaweed. I am delighted this question was raised because it is an industry which should be developed. As the Government has more money to spend and with modern technology we should certainly take this route which will create jobs in remote rural areas. Seaweed rights differ from place to place. It goes back to the original land titles in some cases. We will not go down that road because we are all aware of the great difficulties in that regard. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has granted foreshore licences for seaweed harvesting. The legal position is being reviewed in the context of the National Seaweed Forum. I agree with the setting up of this forum and people with interests should have a say. Dúchas and environmental groups have concerns with regard to seaweed harvesting not being done correctly. We should try to ensure that everything done relating to the seashore is done correctly so that nobody will feel ill at ease with it.</P>
    <P>My Department is in discussions with Dúchas in the context of future licensing. It is not just a question of asking Dúchas to become involved to the degree that it will prevent this from happening but we want to achieve consensus so that we can progress. It is my intention to push the growth of this industry to achieve about 1,000 jobs and to increase the income from £60 million at present to £450 million. This target can be met. The industry wants it and the agencies and I support it.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their positive contributions.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Coogan for enabling this Bill to go through the House so quickly. I thank the Minister for the work he is doing. Many of the licences to which the Minister referred were in the system for many years and the proposal for future licences which will be issued to achieve the target of a turnover of £450 million is something that has not been seen in the past. Those licences might cause more difficulties and there might be more objections than has been the case up to now.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the national development plan has doubled the investment in aquaculture to £25 million. I hope the measures set out by the Minister for the next 15 years are achievable, but whether Wexford wins the All Ireland hurling championships inside the 15 years is debatable.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for the help they have given in relation to marine Bills. I am surprised Senator Fitzgerald, with his long-standing knowledge of the fishing industry, had to ask questions on seaweed.</P>

      <P>There was much debate on this issue on Committee Stage. Having reviewed and discussed the matter with the Attorney General and the Director of Statute Law Revision, we have decided to delete section 2(3) of the Bill. What will happen in practice is that each restatement will be set out in numbered paragraphs, each paragraph will correspond to a section of the Acts being restated and a note will appear at the beginning of each paragraph indicating the derivation of the paragraph. Everyone will be able to see the relevant statutory material at a glance. Where there is a need for cross references, there will be a note indicating where a particular section will be found. Much of the concern expressed the last day centred on our not changing legislation. We are deleting the section to show we are not in any way changing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8<i>a</i>:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>4&ndash;Before endorsing any restatement the Attorney General shall advise an Oireachtas Joint Committee on the reasons for, and the nature of, the restatement and receive the approval of the Committee for the restatement.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 8<i>a</i> and 9 are very different amendments, and that is the nub of the problem. I am baffled. General agreement was expressed during Second and Committee Stage debates that there should be a final link of parliamentary scrutiny of restatements. The points made across the floor of the House, including those made by former Northern Ireland Ombudsman, Senator Maurice Hayes, were that restatement may inadvertently lead to changes which were not intended. An extra layer of scrutiny at parliamentary level was an added safeguard that the substance of the law would not be changed either by inadvertence or by sleight of hand, though nobody suggested the latter would happen.</P>
      <P>Two other points were made. The symbolic point that laws originate in Parliament, pass through it and carry its authority with them was also made. They carry that authority in the language in which they have been debated, presented and put on the Statute Book. That is part of what gives law its authority. The Bill proposes to allow the language in which the law is couched to be changed. Our laws should carry the imprint of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Restatement of laws would receive necessary publicity if they were discussed before a committee of the Oireachtas. The principle that an element of parliamentary scrutiny should be involved was accepted on the last occasion. I tabled an amendment which I accept may not be couched in perfect parliamentary language, but I left this House last Thursday with the strong impression that my amendment would be drafted in the appropriate parliamentary language, with the provision for some form of committee scru<Col N="1314" /> tiny being at the centre of it. I was less than happy when I received a copy of the proposed amendment which simply states that each restatement shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the Attorney General &ldquo;. . .  shall not publish or otherwise make available such restatement until the expiration of twenty-one days on which each House has sat&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We all know this is a passive way of examining legislation. On how many occasions has a restatement or a document which is left sitting before the House for the statutory number of days been brought before either House? I remember only once that such a process was used which was in the case of a former Minister, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn and related to health and children. We all know what happens &ndash; a document is laid before the Houses but Members are busy, 21 sitting days elapse and nobody really reads it. It is the lazy, passive way of adding an extra dimension of scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I am totally dissatisfied with amendment No. 9, which bears no relation to what we were told we would have when we last debated this Bill. It is not a satisfactory substitute for or alternative to what the House wanted last week. I await an explanation from the Minister of State of what has happened and how she thinks she can pass this off on us as being an adequate substitute for what the House agreed last week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse almost everything Senator Manning said. My understanding last week was that while Senator Manning's amendment may not have been quite correct, it was necessary to do something rather similar in that regard and that it was the Minister of State's intention to do so. When I saw the Minister of State's amendment I thought it was interesting, a new way of looking at this matter and that we should see whether it might work. I agree entirely with Senator Manning in that I cannot see it working. I know the Minister of State is anxious to ensure the legislation will be firm, strong and solid and will last for many generations, enabling restatements to be made.</P>
      <P>One concern expressed last week was that if a challenge was made in court to a statute that was restated, it might not stand up unless it was very securely enshrined in law. Senator Manning accepted &ndash; as I do in supporting him &ndash; that perhaps a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas was not technically a correct mechanism but that it was very close to what would probably be needed to make any restatement stand solidly in law. This amendment does not do that and it does not go far enough towards doing so. It is not watertight and is not built on solid ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister of State may have been advised that this provision will be adequate, I have grave doubts as to whether it would stand up in court. A restatement needs more solid and secure backing than just being left in abeyance without anyone commenting on it for 21 days. Putting it before a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas, if that is the best way, would ensure <Col N="1315" /> it is examined and passed even if no comments were made and on that basis I support Senator Manning's views. The Minister of State would be well advised to accept his amendment rather than the one she proposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>These two amendments change the situation from our last discussion. The Minister of State has agreed already to delete section 2(3) and (4) &ndash; we expressed our concern that the Attorney General might wander from the substance of the legislation in those subsections when providing his or her restatement. We felt the Attorney General might embark on changes in relation to renumbering, altering the form or gender proofing which are not within his remit any longer, but those have been taken out. Section 5, which states that any restatement will operate as <i>prima facie </i>evidence, is subject to changes as a result of the changes made to section 2(3) and (4), given that sections 4 and 5 clearly indicate that they will only have the <i>prima facie </i>strength subject to subsection (3). I take this as meaning the Minister of State is abandoning to a considerable extent the power to make a substantial change in the text. We must take that on board when discussing these amendments. It is an improvement and means that the protections we need will be somewhat less as a result.</P>
      <P>The protection the Minister of State offers is now in amendment No. 9 in which she proposes that a copy of each restatement will be laid before both Houses. Obviously this is a negative form of approval, if that is not a contradiction in terms, but it allows the Attorney General to present the documentation, although the Attorney General is already cautioned against making the substantial changes we were concerned about and wandering from the text. The measure then comes before the House.</P>
      <P>This is a meaningful development of the matters we debated the last day, but I am not sure the Minister of State has gone far enough. I see this as the bare minimum if we are to deal with the questionable matter of the Attorney General having sole responsibility, subject to the measure being laid before the Houses for three weeks. Something more proactive is desirable if we are to satisfy ourselves as to our duties as legislators. Despite the protections in place, there is no guarantee that what is stated in the restatement will be in accordance with what is in the legislation. How do we ensure that the Attorney General does not go into fresh matter in his restatement? If the restatement is to be used then <i>prima facie</i> evidence will be open to challenge. We need protective mechanisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State says that the mechanism she proposes is that the restatement be laid before the House, while Senator Manning feels it should be put before an Oireachtas committee first. I have my doubts about the restatement going before a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas, as such a committee has no standing. Unless we give it some standing and function we <Col N="1316" /> cannot know what we are talking about when referring to such a committee. If we establish a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas which approves of the restatement, what will that mean? It does not mean either of these Houses has approved of it. However, if the restatement was run past the committee first and then put on the floor of the House, perhaps that would be a sufficient check and balances.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State might consider both Senator Manning's amendment and her own amendment, although I would like something more proactive, such as a motion on the Order Paper as appears today in relation to the renewal of the Offences Against the State Act. A restatement of legislation would appear on the Order Paper and if we felt it needed debate we could do so. We could consider whatever legislation comes before us, such as happens with some but not all of the directives from Europe. We could have it before us and decide as legislators if we wanted to take further action.</P>
    <P>This is an improvement on our earlier discussions. I am not sure it fulfils all our objectives and perhaps it requires further examination before it goes to the other House.</P>

      <P>I find myself in some difficulty about this matter. I indicated my support for what Senator Manning talked about last week. I still take the view that there is a requirement for scrutiny. I made the point last week that it might not necessarily be the particular mechanism which Senator Manning advocated at that time but I think he was flexible on that, as I was. This may technically fulfil a requirement but I think it does no more than that. We will probably have to take a broader look at it. I suppose, in some ways, it is regrettable that we are dealing with this on Report Stage because if we teased it out in somewhat greater detail, perhaps it would be possible to arrive at a consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>I do not object, in principle, to Senator Costello's suggestion that restatements be put on the Order Paper but it would cause practical difficulties because, by virtue of the number of Bills being dealt with, it could make the Order Paper quite congested. In any event, it is not remaking legislation, it is just looking at the wording being used. Nevertheless, it would be useful to have a mechanism, as I said last week, whereby the matter is looked at because we frequently find errors. It is not a question of difficulties about the nature of the Oireachtas committee or whatever body would look at it. Some questions were raised about that last week &ndash; for instance, how could we make legislation? We are not making legislation but looking at legislation which has been made and its so-called translation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back to the point I raised last week, to which Senator Quinn referred, that there are plenty of precedents whereby the courts would take the view &ndash; they have a standing in the courts as we know from dealing with the Bill last week &ndash; that if this did not go through the Oireachtas, it does not have a standing before the <Col N="1317" /> courts. There is a difficulty there. I do not know what can be done in practical terms to resolve this impasse. Perhaps it could be looked at between now and the time it goes to the Dáil but I am aware that we are running out of time and that it will have to come back to us if it is amended in the Dáil. I await what the Minister has to say with interest.</P>
    <P>I understand it is up to the Houses to regulate their affairs and to establish whatever committees they might wish rather than proceed by diktat, so to speak. Although frequently the genesis of the committee starts at Government, it is the Houses which ultimately decide what committees are required and what the membership should be. There is probably some reasonable ground for compromise. I think I understand that the Government amendment fulfils the requirement &ndash; the Minister will probably be able to clarify this &ndash; but it is a minimum. There should be a greater degree of scrutiny, by whatever mechanism, to ensure things do not slip through, so to speak.</P>
    <P>This afternoon I heard the Ombudsman say in regard to some other matters that he regarded secondary legislation as important. Senator Manning made that point last week. It is slightly separate from this but if there was to be a committee on secondary legislation, that would be another appropriate place where this could be looked at. I am uncomfortable with what is before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in agreement with Senator Manning last week in regard to the inclusion of some mechanism whereby the Oireachtas would have some say. I was quite happy with the amendment when I read it this morning until I met Senator Manning who told me he was completely dissatisfied with it. Some 21 sitting days is about seven weeks because sometimes we sit two days per week, sometimes three days. Even if we sit three days per week, it is approximately seven weeks.</P>
      <P>The matter will be laid before the two Houses but my questions is, how will it be laid before the Houses? How will we know it has been laid before the Houses? We have for two or three years brought resolutions and motions before the House with the agreement of the Opposition. They have been circulated to the House and there has been no debate. Members read them and are quite happy with them. Will this be laid before both Houses in that way or, as Senator Costello said, will it be printed on the Order Paper? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not go along with the idea that it is bad to lay it before each House of the Oireachtas. Although I have not participated in some of these debates, Members have continually argued for certain Bills, which have gone through the House, to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. That is regularly included in Bills which pass through this House. I cannot remember an instance but I am sure Senators will agree it is regularly included in Bills that they be laid before each House of the Oireachtas on a yearly basis. We dealt with one such Bill today, the Offences <Col N="1318" /> Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998. When that Bill was enacted, it stated that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would have to come back to the House on a yearly basis.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Manning and Senator Quinn about the workload Senators, Deputies and Ministers have in trying to watch everything going through the House. Some vital legislation which is restated could go through unknown to us. I am satisfied with the amendment that we regularly seek that legislation be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, sometimes on a yearly basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Referring back to comments Senators made about last week, the one thing which was accepted was the principle that the Dáil and Seanad should have accountability and the final say in relation to legislation and restatements. The initial view last week was that a restatement was just that, not new legislation or a change, it was only an administrative matter and that it would not be necessary to come back to the House. The points were very well made last week and I fully endorse what was said in relation to accepting the principle of accountability.</P>
      <P>What was also said last week was that we would try to work out the best process by which that could be done. I know there were differing views, particularly between Senator Manning and Senator Costello, as to whether it should be by way of an Oireachtas committee. We said we would try to work out this process. What has come up today gives the House of the Oireachtas the accountability and the final say but does not set up a special committee on that basis because it is for the Houses of the Oireachtas to decide how to regulate their business. Equally, we are not suggesting placing an obligation on the Houses of the Oireachtas to pass a special resolution in this regard.</P>
      <P>The amendment states that the Attorney General will be obliged to lay a copy of the restatement under this Act before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as is practicable after it is made and to do so for 21 days. There would be a strict statutory obligation on him to do this, to make the Houses of the Oireachtas aware of his work in the field of restatement and to enjoin him from publishing or otherwise make available a restatement before the Houses have had an opportunity to review the restatements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It refers to 21 sitting days which is, in effect, as Senator Fitzgerald said, perhaps seven working weeks. The Houses may decide how to deal with laying restatements before them. For example, there are eight different documents before the Seanad which are laid out on the Order Paper under statutory and non-statutory headings. It could be included with those and would have to be on the Order Paper. Alternatively, the House may decide to include a special heading under that section and to draw particular attention to it so <Col N="1319" /> that Senators and Deputies would be aware this restatement had been made before the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello used the word in a negative way and may be right in many cases. If, in reviewing a restatement, a Senator found something with which he or she was not happy or to which he or she felt attention should be drawn, a negative resolution could be passed in the Seanad prohibiting the Attorney General from publishing the restatement or making it available as it was not in line with the views of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or perhaps because it deviated from what the original legislation was meant to be.</P>
    <P>This amendment gives the Oireachtas the final say but also upholds Article 15 of the Constitution which gives the Houses powers to make their own rules and Standing Orders. The Houses can make special rules concerning restatements and how to deal with them if they so wish. This amendment does not propose to prescribe how the Houses should deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>Questions have also been raised as to how these restatements would be handled in court. It is important to state that where there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence, any challenge would not be made to a restatement <i>per se</i> but to the underlying Act. This is a reformatting of the initial legislation which does not change that legislation.</P>
    <P>There are two strong sides to this debate. The initial argument last week was a procedural matter in that a restatement does not need to be scrutinised by the Houses. However, by accepting the various amendments last week and today as to the numbering of paragraphs, gender proofing and so on, we are recognising that anything which would lead people to believe we are changing the legislation should be and has been removed from the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there were valid arguments that the Houses should be involved in the scrutiny and this is a method of doing so. The amendment gives the Houses the final say. It is left to the Houses as to how they ensure we give a restatement particular attention when it appears on the Order Paper. We must always bear in mind we are not changing legislation in any way, but that this involves a restatement. However, the Houses need to be assured this is what is happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the debate and see and approve of what the Government is trying to do. However, my central argument was different and comes close to what Senator Costello said in the second part of his contribution. We are dealing with a fundamental issue. We live in an age in which people need to be given information and in which changes need to be explained. Decisions by Government or authorities must be taken in the most open and accountable manner and the public must be involved in what is being done, particularly when there is a possibility of change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was non-dogmatic last week as to the form my proposal should take. I suggested that when <Col N="1320" /> changes are being made, it would be useful if the Attorney General was present to speak to Members of the Houses and to explain what was being done. This is carried on television, is reported and is on the record. Therefore, if changes have been made, at least there is a record and the Attorney General, or someone acting on his or her behalf, can be questioned.</P>
    <P>We are moving into a new phase in the life of Parliament. Within a short time, I hope all parties will be adequately staffed and Members of Parliament will have the expert advice, which few of us have at present, to examine these issues at the level at which they should be examined.</P>
    <P>Mistakes can be very costly and can have significant consequences. My proposal is supplemental to what Senator Costello ably stated, namely that it would add an extra dimension. I accept the argument that it is up to the Houses of the Oireachtas to organise their affairs. Nonetheless, if this legislation contained a provision that this would be presented in the manner I stated whereby the Attorney General would appear before a committee of the Houses, one of the committees could take on that task. Alternatively, a special committee could be established. There are difficulties, but if the Oireachtas passes legislation providing that a committee be established, that is the view of the Oireachtas. The Oireachtas itself is making that decision, it is not being made by the Attorney General or anyone else. The Oireachtas is deciding it shall set up a committee and it is up to its internal procedures to determine what sort of committee it should be. The Oireachtas is quite capable of doing so and I do not see any constitutional interference as the Houses themselves have decided to set up a committee. I do not see that as a strong argument.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Dardis, I regret we are having this debate on Report Stage. I compliment the Minister of State on her able presentation of the case and on her capacity to listen to the arguments. She has not come into the House as a rubber stamping Minister of State. She is listening carefully and has her own views on the matter. However, the view of the House today and on the last occasion is that some mechanism of the sort I am proposing would improve this legislation and the way in which we do business.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to push this issue to a vote but it is an important matter. Is there any way in which the Minister of State could take on board the consensus which exists in the House and take into account that the Houses of the Oireachtas want this measure? The details can follow at a later stage as the Houses are well able to organise business in this regard. I urge the Minister of State to examine whether some compromise can be reached. If a change is made in the Dáil, the Seanad is sitting the following week and could approve that change with great speed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed on the principle involved and the fact that we want to facilitate the Houses of the Oireachtas. However, we inter<Col N="1321" /> pret the Constitution in different ways and that is what lands us in half this trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>My reading of it is that it is the House making rules as opposed to making legislation to make the rules. A House that makes its own rules as opposed to having the force of law are two different things. The amendment does not preclude the House from deciding, for example, on the day on which a restatement is laid before it, that a special committee shall examine the matter and the Attorney General shall be invited to make a presentation, or whatever. One or both Houses may decide to go down that road. By including the 21 day provision, <Col N="1322" /> seven working weeks, a restatement will be on the books and will be published unless stopped by the Seanad or the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning said this was a lazy and passive method but the only people who would be lazy or passive would be Senators or Deputies who let it go without properly examining it. That would not be the Senator's intention. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Water Quality:" RHead="Statements">
    <Title>Water Quality: Statements.</Title>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace): I welcome this opportunity to comment on the position in relation to water quality and to outline the measures in place, and being developed, to protect and improve the quality of Irish waters. I am confident Members will agree these measures are the most appropriate arrangements for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Water is one of our most precious resources. It is essential for life. We need it as a raw material for agriculture and industry. It plays an important role for amenity and recreation, for fisheries, tourism, wildlife conservation and habitat protection. Almost 200,000 visitors to Ireland annually are principally drawn by active water-based pursuits such as fishing, cruising and sailing. Angling alone accounts for almost 140,000 foreign tourists annually.</P>
    <P>By international standards, Irish waters are in good condition. This is confirmed by the recently published Environmental Protection Agency report, Ireland's Environment &ndash; a Millennium Report. In fact Ireland's waters compare quite favourably with waters in other countries of the European Union and this applies to all our waters &ndash; rivers, lakes, canals, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwaters.</P>
    <P>However, economic growth is leading to increasing pressures on our waters from different sources &ndash; agriculture, sewage treatment, industry and domestic activity. There are quality deficiencies in many privately sourced group water schemes. Elevated levels of nitrates are now a cause of concern in groundwaters in certain areas. Most importantly, over recent decades the incidence of slight and moderate pollution of our rivers has continued to increase. The problem is eutrophication, caused by excess inputs of phosphorus. This trend has continued up to 1997, the date of the most recent comprehensive assessment by the EPA. While EPA reports confirm the generally good condition of Irish waters, as I already said, the millennium report also sends a clear warning. It identifies eutrophication of <Col N="1324" /> inland waters as perhaps Ireland's most serious environmental pollution problem. There is a very real danger, therefore, that the quality of our water could be undermined by the economic and consumer activities which it supports. I am determined this will not be allowed happen. The Government is firmly committed to the necessary preventative actions alongside a vigorous programme to tackle existing pollution trends.</P>
    <P>While two thirds of the length of our rivers are unpolluted, the remainder is affected by slight, moderate or serious pollution. For decades up to 1997 our rivers had shown a continuing deterioration. The EPA's millennium report indicates that some 32% of river channel in 1997 was affected by slight or moderate pollution. This represents an increase of 50% in the extent of such pollution over the previous decade and is largely due to excessive inputs of phosphorous. Agriculture has been identified as the single biggest contributor in this regard, but significant inputs also arise from sewage discharges and industry.</P>
    <P>If water quality is to be protected, then all sources of pollution must be addressed and all players must participate. Everyone has a part to play in securing a high quality environment &ndash; Government, social partners, local authorities, individual citizens. A range of policies and measures is being developed by the Government to protect and improve the quality of our waters.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, the Government has been promoting a comprehensive, catchment based national strategy to combat eutrophication in rivers and lakes. A catchment based approach to water quality enables all sources of pollution to be dealt with on a comprehensive and integrated basis. Major projects to establish monitoring and management systems are well under way in relation to loughs Derg, Ree and Leane and the rivers Boyne, Liffey and Suir. These projects are supported by appropriate infrastructural projects. The combined cost of sewerage infrastructure investment in these catchments is £162.49 million, with an investment of £6.8 million on monitoring and management systems. This expenditure is supported by European Union Cohesion Funding.</P>
    <P>The catchment based strategy is underpinned by the phosphorus regulations made by me in 1998. The regulations require no further deterioration in the quality of rivers and lakes and improvements to be achieved by end 2007 in the condition of rivers and lakes found to be polluted during the 1995-97 period. Catchment wide initiatives provide a framework to facilitate participation by all interested parties. Real progress will also require increased awareness by all the players of their responsibilities to protect and conserve the river systems as water supply sources, salmonid fisheries, recreational and amenity resources and natural habitats. The introduction of a monitoring and management system is not, of course, an end in itself. The ultimate objective is to achieve and maintain good water quality in all waters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> I am glad to say that some encouraging developments are now emerging. Catchment management is beginning to show early positive results in some locations. Water quality in Lough Derg, for example, has improved significantly and the improvement appears to be continuing. However, we are not about to rest on our laurels. The Government is committed to a new drive to improve water quality. I am now expanding the catchment based approach to include not only rivers and lakes but all waters, including groundwaters, estuaries and coastal waters. I want to see catchment based projects established in the short to medium term for all our waters so we can deal on a nationwide basis with all sources of pollution and human impacts. Accordingly, my Department is actively encouraging local authorities to bring forward appropriate proposals for water management projects which cover all inland and coastal waters. I am heartened by the positive response of local authorities to date and I look forward to significant progress during the coming year on the establishment of broadly based catchment management projects.</P>
    <P>Achieving good water quality will be substantially advanced by the major programme of capital expenditure by local authorities and my Department, supported by European Union funds, under the water services investment programme. The National Development Plan, 2000-06, includes provision of an unprecedented £3,000 million for water supply, including rural water and waste water infrastructure. This is three times the amount under the 1994-99 national development plan. The major portion of this expenditure will be directed to investment in the provision and upgrading of waste water treatment facilities. This investment programme provides the basis for systematically tackling and eliminating pollution from untreated or inadequately treated discharges of sewage to our rivers, lakes and coastal waters. It will also largely complete our implementation of the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, one of the most important pieces of EU legislation for environmental protection. Large-scale projects are now being advanced in respect of all our major cities and towns, including Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Dundalk and Drogheda. These areas account for approximately 80% of urban waste water arisings.</P>
    <P>The most recent report of the EPA on drinking water quality covered the year 1998 and confirmed the fundamentally good quality of drinking water in public supplies to the vast majority of the population. It also highlighted difficulties with the quality of privately owned group water schemes. These supply some 50,000 rural households, or 5% of households nationally. The Government acknowledges this situation is not acceptable and is determined to confront and remedy these problems. A major programme of activities is in train under the rural water programme for this purpose. Record investment of £420 million is provided under the national development plan for rural water. The bulk of <Col N="1326" /> this funding will be targeted at remedying deficiencies in the group water schemes.</P>
    <P>On 27 March my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, unveiled a radical revamp of the grant and subsidy schemes which support the group water sector. Under this package water disinfection and filtration equipment qualifies for 100% capital grants. With this support group schemes will now be in a position to provide state of the art technology to bring their water up to EU standards. In addition, 85% capital grants are being provided for the upgrading of distribution systems, provision of source protection measures and extension of group networks to houses currently dependent on private individual supplies. Another key facet of the rural water programme is the intensive monitoring of private sources used by group schemes to determine causes of pollution and assist in the development of appropriate source protection measures. I will shortly make regulations to impose more stringent requirements on suppliers of drinking water and to establish a clear statutory timeframe within which permanent improvements must be achieved to rectify all deficiencies in drinking water quality.</P>
    <P>The successful implementation of the rural water programme is dependent on a vibrant partnership approach between the group sector and local authorities working together to achieve a common objective. In this context a national rural water monitoring committee representative of local authorities, the national federation of group water schemes and the rural organisations has been established to advise on policy and oversee the implementation by local authorities of the annual rural water programme. In addition, the national federation of group water schemes is being supported financially by my Department in implementing its development and training programme.</P>
    <P>The national development plan also makes substantial provision for schemes operated by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Joe Walsh, which address in particular phosphorus inputs from agriculture. No less than £1.5 billion is being provided for the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and £147 million for the new scheme for the management of farmyard waste. Nutrient management planning is being promoted on a widespread basis under the REPS, which also provides for the protection and maintenance of watercourses and wells, limitations on the use of herbicides and pesticides and more extensive cultivation of tillage crops. The new farm waste management scheme will promote better waste management facilities on farms.</P>
    <P>Such measures are already showing results. There has been a reduction of 20% since 1996 in the use of phosphorus fertilisers. Agriculture continues however to be the largest single source of water pollution and greater efforts are required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> I am glad that several local authorities are giving active consideration to the making of by-laws under the water pollution Acts to combat pollution from agricultural activities. Cork County Council took the lead by making by-laws in 1999. I hope many more local authorities will follow its example.</P>
    <P>I urge farmers to exercise care in slurry spreading at all times and avoid spreading where weather conditions are unsuitable. Dry soil conditions are required to absorb slurry. Slurry spreading in wet conditions runs completely contrary to good farming practice and creates a high risk of losses to waters and serious water pollution. Slurry should not be spread near watercourses. All facilities for the storage of waste or silage effluent should be checked and maintained in good condition. Our fish stocks are particularly vulnerable to pollution in summer months when water levels are low. I appeal for vigilance on the part of farmers and farming contractors to protect our waters.</P>
    <P>I indicated that recent monitoring results show elevated levels of nitrates in groundwaters in certain locations. The level of nitrates is approaching or, in some cases, exceeding the limits set in EU legislation in certain areas. The nitrates directive requires that additional measures be put in place to protect water quality in areas where waters are polluted or susceptible to pollution by nitrates from agriculture. The primary objective is to ensure better management of manures and fertilisers. My Department has liaised closely with other interested bodies in this regard, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Geological Survey of Ireland. I expect to be in a position shortly to make a detailed statement as to the location of affected waters and the action which will be taken to protect them.</P>
    <P>A major aspect of water management which merits attention is the proposed EU framework directive on water policy which is nearing the final stages of adoption. The directive will impose formal requirements on member states to address water management on the basis of catchments or river basins rather than on the basis of administrative or legal boundaries. It will require the preparation of river basin management plans with broad terms of reference to address the management and protection of water quality and aquatic ecosystems in a river basin and to promote the sustainable use of water resources.</P>
    <P>The development and implementation of river basin management plans will require a high degree of co-ordination and co-operation between public authorities and other stakeholders as well as extensive public consultation and participation. Ireland is well placed to implement this approach. Our catchment based national strategy is very much in line with EU thinking on how to deal with water pollution problems. The experience we have gained in relation to catchment based projects will be of <Col N="1328" /> considerable assistance in the implementation of the proposed EU framework directive on water policy.</P>
    <P>In so far as industrial discharges are concerned local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency are now required to review any licence in respect of a discharge to a water body affected by the requirements of the phosphorus regulations. Local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency have been advised of the need to identify at an early stage the measures required of licensees so that licensees can provide for the planning necessary to ensure the target reductions in phosphorus levels can be achieved over the timeframe allowed for compliance with the quality standards.</P>
    <P>An important and welcome development is the voluntary agreement concluded in December last year by my Department with the detergents industry in relation to phosphorus in laundry detergents. The agreement provides for the phasing out of the marketing in Ireland of phosphate based laundry detergents and their replacement by zero phosphate products. The targets are for 55% replacement by mid-2000 and 90% by the end of 2001 with further reductions thereafter. The agreement marks a significant contribution to the reduction of the phosphorus load to our waters.</P>
    <P>The European Commission recently published a composite report on the quality of bathing water for the 1999 bathing season. The report indicates that 98.3% of our bathing sites complied with the mandatory values laid down in the bathing water directive with 100% of our inland sites complying. The percentage complying with the more strict guide values rose sharply from 80.2% to 89.2% in 1999. These are very impressive and encouraging results. They are among the best across the European Union.</P>
    <P>Recently, 70 blue flags were awarded to Irish beaches and five to Irish marinas, a testament to the excellent facilities available in Ireland. The blue flag has become a symbol throughout Europe of clean bathing water but other criteria also apply. The award of a blue flag requires, for example, proper facilities and equipment for life saving and first aid, good litter management and the dissemination of environmental information to the public. Although the overall number of blue flags awarded this year is slightly down, there has been a steady improvement in bathing water quality throughout the 1990s.</P>
    <P>The increasing levels of eutrophication in our rivers and lakes did not happen overnight. It will clearly take some time to reverse recent trends. I am confident that the strategy and statutory provisions now in place provide a firm basis for tackling the causes of the eutrophication problem. Our long-term objective is to achieve and maintain good quality status in all waters. I am fully committed to delivering on all the commitments in our catchment based strategy and I am confident that these initiatives will deliver on their objectives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. There is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> because it is not long since we discussed this topic. Nevertheless it is of such national importance that it is worthwhile to revisit it often in order to ascertain what the Government is doing and if its actions are effective. The Minister of State should note the importance of water quality to the people. Let me quote some figures from the EPA booklet which reflect their level of awareness of and attitudes to water quality in comparison with other pollutants. In Europe 20% are aware that cars cause air pollution. The figure for Ireland is 16%. In Europe 27.5% are aware of water pollution. The figure for Ireland is 36.3%. This indicates that it would be well worth the Government's while ensuring it is eliminated.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that, judging from the EPA report, Ireland is doing extremely well in comparison to Europe but it is false to compare ourselves with anybody else. For many years we had water of the highest quality which was untainted. Two thirds of the world is covered in water, most of which is saline which means that it is not drinkable. If my figures are correct only 2.3% is drinkable, most of which is locked in the ice caps. This leaves a figure of about 0.01% which is unevenly distributed. There are parts of the world which continually suffer from droughts but that has not happened to us. Perhaps that is the reason we have been so lackadaisical during the years about water quality and considered it to be a natural asset and topic of conversation, but this complacency has caused much damage.</P>
      <P>I mentioned in the House about two years ago that Friends of the Earth had accused the Government of not doing its job. It said that the EPA was not conducting sufficient pollution examinations. The quality of the examinations was also inadequate. It also complained to the EU about the Environmental Protection Agency with regard to the irregularities in the drinking water monitoring regime in Ireland and about the infrequency of sampling. It said that based on the Environmental Protection Agency's report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland, published for the years 1993, 1994 and 1995, it is apparent that some local authorities are applying an unacceptably low monitoring frequency in respect of most of the water supplies for which they are responsible. It outlines a significant number in this regard, looking at the number of samples taken, the type of samples, the poor sampling techniques and the laboratory practices involved. It concluded that the EPA was not carrying out its work properly. As a result, it took the Government to the European courts. I understand Ireland is to be prosecuted, despite the money invested by the Government and efforts by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to try to address the problem of pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pollution problem is extraordinary. The Minister of State said that Ireland compares well with the rest of Europe. However, the rivers are becoming increasingly polluted. Yesterday, I was <Col N="1330" /> informed by my colleague, Senator Costello, that the River Tolka was polluted with a fish kill of over 2,000. This indicates how important this issue is, not just as regards drinking water but also from a fishing and tourism point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State can cite all the figures he wishes, but the Government is not addressing the issues involved. Pollution is caused by a number of factors. It is mainly caused, as the Minister of State has admitted, by farming practices, for example by the spraying of slurries into the water base at the wrong time of the year and by the maintenance of slurry in tanks that cannot hold it and are breaking down resulting in leakages into the water base. It is also caused by the spread of raw sewage into rivers. I invite the Minister of State to Galway city where I will indicate to him points in the rivers where sewage from houses is deposited. That problem is being slowly addressed, but it indicates that we are not up to date in practice.</P>
    <P>The recent EPA reports says enough is not being done and that our practices are not good enough. According to an article in <i>The Irish Times,</i> the water in Lisdoonvarna was likened to chardonnay &ndash; in colour, not taste. Visitors thought they were getting something very cheap, but it is not the kind of thing we want to show tourists.</P>
    <P>The Government is being take to the European courts because of inadequate sampling and bad sampling practices. Those concerned believe it to be the case. No matter what the Minister of State says, the Government is not doing enough, nor is it acting fast enough. It is afraid to tackle the problem where it originates.</P>
    <P>When he returns to the House to debate this matter, I ask the Minister of State to provide an EPA report that indicates we are the best in Europe. We can be the best in Europe. Thirty years ago if people bought a bottle of water in a restaurant, they would have been considered poseurs. Now there is surprise if they do not because nobody will drink tap water.</P>
    <P>Recently, a number of people have opposed the chlorination of water. However, if many of the water supplies throughout the country were not chlorinated the health of the people drinking from them would be endangered. Other issues also need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The facts speak for themselves. The EPA has expressed concern about inadequate water quality. Friends of the Earth is taking Ireland to court and it appears it will win its case. These alone are enough to condemn the Government for its inadequate policy on clearing up our waters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has attended the House to debate a number of environmental matters, including the very important issue of water quality. In his address to the House, he outlined that water is one of our most precious resources. It is essential for life and its importance to the economy from a tourism point of view has been highlighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> The Minister of State has addressed the issue honestly. While there are problems, they are not of recent origin but go back a long time. We are debating the initiatives that have been taken, most of which have been sponsored by the Minister of State, to address what is, and has been, an unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>In 1998 the Minister of State introduced the phosphorous regulations, one of the main initiatives taken to tackle the significant phosphorous content in water, which is deleterious to quality. He set a target of significantly reducing the effects of phosphorous on our rivers and in our waters by 2007. At present, approximately one third are polluted. That target, and the measures being effected, will be trusted when we see progress. Since 1996 there has been a 20% reduction in the use of phosphorous fertiliser. People are taking heed. The same developments are happening with regard to detergents.</P>
    <P>These initiatives require funding. The national development plan will provide £3 billion for the period 2000-06, which is three times greater than previous sums that have been made available. Much of the public water supply is of good quality and compares well with quality elsewhere, although the questions that have arisen about the use of additives to the water supply need to be checked.</P>
    <P>Most of the difficulties and problems experienced are in the area of group water schemes. The Minister of State has made considerable funding available to address this issue. It is important to highlight that only 5% of households approximately are involved, although this is not to understate the seriousness of the issues. The blue flag status for many beaches and marinas &ndash; regrettably my county lost some this year &ndash; was not lost because of a deterioration in the quality of water, but because of non-compliance with administrative procedures in the dissemination of environmental information, which was not done in accordance with the criteria laid down.</P>
    <P>However, there are serious issues to be addressed. In conjunction with local authorities, the Minister of State and his Department are obligated, as the agencies responsible, for implementing many of the EU directives. A broad range of directives deal with water quality. The statutory responsibility for water management and protection rests primarily with the local authorities. I concur with some of what Senator Coogan said in that the policing and monitoring of the regulations needs to be addressed in a more emphatic manner. The Minister of State should encourage local authorities in this regard. He outlined how Cork County Council and other county councils have taken initiatives which should be replicated by all local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the strategic policy committees, which are fundamental to the new local government system, are still being resisted at <Col N="1332" /> official level by certain sectional interests employed in local government. These initiatives, all of which can be used for these issues and problems, should be implemented fully and allowed achieve their potential. Anything the Minister can do to realise their potential by overcoming objectives from officials would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the Environmental Protection Agency, which has an important role to play. As a consequence of the rapidly expanding urban populations, many local authority water treatment facilities are under severe pressure. In many instances they are unable to cope with the increasing volumes of waste. This is obviously a source of pollution in rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>In rural areas there is a continuing threat to the aquatic environment from the intensive livestock rearing and dairying sectors which generate large quantities of high-strength waste, the bulk of which is disposed of by spreading on land without pretreatment. It is not surprising, therefore, that recent surveys of fresh waters throughout the State show a continuing increase in the length of the water channel subject to slight and moderate pollution and highlight eutrophication as the main problem to be addressed by management measures. While this deterioration in the quality of the aquatic ecosystem is relatively minor in many cases, it signals a change from the near pristine conditions which obtained in many areas up to the 1970s. I suppose to some extent we are paying the price of increased population and development. Measures which perhaps were apt and relevant some decades ago need to be looked at and strengthened for the future, and the Minister rightly addressed many of those areas.</P>
    <P>The main threat presented by these developments concerns the health of the game-fish stocks, which are not favoured by the more productive waters resulting from artificial enrichment. There are already signs that the population of these fish is declining in some waters and this appears to be linked to eutrophication. On his last visit to the House and again today the Minister highlighted the need to address this and outlined initiatives he has taken in this regard. Obviously the emphasis needs to be continued in that area because it is one of the main target areas in improving water quality.</P>
    <P>In recent times the phosphorus standards of rivers and lakes have been tackled with EU support. There have been studies of monitoring and management systems in a number of catchments, including those of loughs Ree and Derg on the River Shannon and Lough Leane in Killarney. These and other measures dealing with improvements to sewage and industrial waste treatment and nutrient management on farms are designed mainly, but not solely, to minimise the loading of phosphorus on surface waters. An indication of the efficacy of such measures has been provided by recent studies in the Lough Conn catchment area. Certainly efforts are being made in that direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> Despite what Deputy Coogan stated, the Government has undertaken a wide range of initiatives. As I said, the provision of £420 million to improve group water schemes is significant. Of course that is not the only provision. The Minister highlighted the huge investment which is set out in the national development plan. It is worth pointing out also that as recently as 1996 as little as £8.5 million was provided for rural water schemes whereas in 1999 no less than £38 million was provided.</P>
    <P>The Government is also developing comprehensive county level strategies involving intensive examination of all rural water supply systems to ensure that public health is safeguarded in all group schemes and that the principle of best practice is given widespread application in all aspects of the management and operation of private group water schemes. They are determined to resolve the problem of poor water quality in group water schemes and ensure that the people of rural Ireland enjoy clean uncontaminated drinking water. In March 2000, the Government announced major increases in grants and subsidies to banish substandard water supplies. The grant for each affiliated dwelling increases from £1,600 per house to 85% of the approved construction cost, subject to a cost limit of £6,000 per house. The Minister also announced a new 100% capital grant for disinfection and filtration equipment for substandard group water schemes. Therefore, initiatives are being taken which are backed by the provision of the necessary resources to achieve the objectives being set. Undoubtedly it is an important area to which the Minister has given serious priority. We should congratulate him on his efforts to date and encourage him to continue the effort being made to ensure that the quality of water for drinking and in the rivers and lakes is pristine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace. I also read the fine Environmental Protection Agency's millennium report, but I think the Minister produced the best of its figures rather than some of those which were alarming, or perhaps he has given it a certain gloss.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to hear of the efforts the Government will make regarding improving water supplies and inland waterways which are polluted. As the Minister of State said, the quality of estuarine and coastal waters was relatively good, which was extremely cheering, but we could be less than sanguine about the situation of inland waterways and rural water schemes, which are in a bad state in over 35% of the country. I was delighted to hear of the amount of money the Minister will provide for these schemes. At present they are infected by e.coli and in some instances e.coli 0157, which is a killer bug, has been found. Cryptosporidium, streptococci and clostridia have also been found in rural water schemes. These are seriously dangerous bacteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main problem with many of these small water schemes has been pollution by sewage. In <Col N="1334" /> many cases this is caused by septic tanks which were ill-sited in the first place, which were not maintained or which have become too old and need to be replaced. I did not see much in the Minister of State's speech about serious consideration being given to specific septic tanks and, if necessary, the steps being taken to remedy the damage they are causing.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of pollution by animals encroaching on the sites of water supplies. This is a common problem in rural Ireland and I do not think the significance of it is understood by many people. It is important, therefore, to educate those on whose land rural water supplies begin. I do not think they fully understand the damage that animal faeces which gets into the water at that level causes to the ground water, which of course is important to the supply of drinking water.</P>
    <P>The monitoring of e.coli is always taken as important because that shows that there is contamination by sewage, but I would like to think that in this day and age we were doing a little more to try to find out the level of herbicides and pesticides in these supplies. Indeed, we do little in the way of measurement of herbicides in particular &ndash; I suggest that we have got to the stage where we really need to get going on that because they are quite widely used.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State pointed out that the major problem with the pollution of water is of course phosphorus, followed by nitrate. On agriculture, the Minister of State stated that there has been a 20% reduction in the amount of phosphates used on the land, and indeed this is most welcome. I have seen reports which state that there is a five year oversupply of phosphate in some parts of the country. I had thought that Teagasc would monitor the level of phosphate and nitrate within soils on farms in Ireland and give farmers these readings, but I have not heard any more about it. It is a matter of concern to me. Initiatives are undertaken which may or may not begin but we receive very little information on the monitoring and that is a problem.</P>
    <P>Groundwater pollution from phosphorous is almost always due to pollution from animal rearing. One extraordinary aspect is that pig and poultry rearing enterprises are subject to integrated pollution control monitoring. However, they are much less polluting than cattle rearing enterprises because the slurry from cattle is of greater volume than that from pig and poultry rearing enterprises. Is it not time to bring cattle rearing under integrated pollution control? That could be extraordinarily important. The Minister of State is correct to say that the rural environment protection scheme assists in this regard in that the cattle are outdoors more and are much more dispersed. However, only a certain number of farms are involved in REPS and it may be difficult to get others involved.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the efforts of the Minister of State to tackle sewage and industrial waste. The treatment of sewage is very important in the context of inland waterways, but not enough atten<Col N="1335" /> tion is paid to the pollution which occurs in small rivers and streams. Senator Coogan pointed out that, even in Galway, one can still see the sewage from individual houses going into rivers. Sewage is still not treated in some villages and towns in Ireland. Only primary treatment, which removes large solid waste, is available in others. Tertiary treatment, where sewage is aerated, which helps improve the bacteriological content of the sewage so that the organic matter is broken down more, is available in some towns, but the number of places where tertiary treatment units are in place is very small. I understood that tertiary treatment units were only in place in towns with 10,000 or more inhabitants and if so, this leaves out a large number of places, some of which may be dormitory towns for Dublin and other areas. The south-east and the Shannon basin seem to have the worst problem with sewage pollution in small rivers and streams. We should decrease the size of towns or villages in which good sewage treatment is installed. I hope money is given to encourage this as quickly as possible because, as the Minister of State will have seen from the Environmental Protection Agency report, serious pollution frequently takes place far upriver.</P>
    <P>Is there any monitoring of the spread of slurry? I cannot be the only Senator who has seen slurry being spread in pouring rain. Is it monitored and are there any sanctions against the people who spread slurry at such times? It goes straight into the watercourses and, if the rainfall is bad enough, fish kills occur as a result. That is extremely sad considering the efforts made by the regional fisheries boards to improve fisheries. Nitrates are another major problem in groundwater and none of our sewerage schemes remove them from sewage. I may be wrong but I have not heard of any that do so. There is a need to remove phosphates and nitrates in sewerage schemes. We do not have enough respect for groundwater and it is important to remember that groundwater is important for the food processing industry in many places. Furthermore, we are not sufficiently careful about the siting of tanks for chemicals and hydrocarbons for petrol stations and such places. Recent legislation has been good in this regard and I am sure those installations being constructed at present are being properly installed. Nonetheless, one must wonder about the leachate from old plants which have existed for 30 or 40 years and whether a better effort should be made to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not mention it but the EPA report mentioned problems due to mining. Mining is on the increase and the Avoca River is the worst affected in the country. Nothing can grow beside it and the water is crystal clear despite the copper and iron mining. A disastrous decision was taken to put rubbish into the mine and that meant there was no control over what came out. Those who promote such action in the Silvermines area have not examined the situation carefully enough. I have listened to those who say waste can be managed by placing huge plastic <Col N="1336" /> liners around major dumps, but I would be sceptical about that. It is a huge risk to take with our water quality by placing dumps in areas where the leachate could affect the aquifers.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the eutrophication of lakes and rivers. It is a great pity that some of those affected are very important for tourism, such as loughs Leane and Sheelin, and that despite huge efforts from local authorities, eutrophication recurs, especially as a result of agriculture. Greater education and much stricter controls are needed if prolonged success is to be achieved in this respect. The Minister of State said Lough Derg is improving and I am glad to hear that because Lough Ree is in a bad state. One amusing aspect is the fact that the infestation of zebra mussels has assisted in tackling the eutrophication of loughs Ree and Derg because the mussels eat the algae. However, we do not know what they will do next. They may jump out of the water and bite us around the ankles, so I do not encourage people to put zebra mussels into the lakes of Ireland where they were not known before. The Minister of State said the canals are in remarkably good shape, but we must be careful that the pollution of feeder streams does not cause trouble for them.</P>
    <P>It is appalling to witness the fish kills which take place during summer during hot weather when the water level is lower. It must be soul destroying for those who make such huge efforts in promoting the sport of angling in the areas where the kills occur. I understand the position with salmon has improved enormously in some rivers due to the curtailment of drift-netting. I would like to think we could reach a position where the fish stocks in our rivers improved.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Coogan that we must be concerned about the flavour and appearance of our water. I do not remember which department it was in the Dublin Institute of Technology but someone there produced a splendid little device for measuring the turbulence within water, which shows how much organic matter is present in it. Perhaps some of these devices could be purchased by the Minister of State's Department to allow for greater monitoring. It would be well worthwhile. I also agree with Senator Coogan that the amount of bottled water drunk in this country is astonishing. That said, I have been able to go back to tap water in the notorious Dublin 4 because the taste has improved. At one stage it tasted of nothing but TCP, but the flavour at present is much better. As a doctor, I must advise people that it is a good idea to have the contents of bottled waters inspected. In some cases, as regards pollutants, one would be better off drinking tap water. Our public supply has been very good from the point of view of cleanliness. It is just that, as Senator Coogan said, the taste and the colour are occasionally off-putting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to the House and the legislation which he and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, have put through since taking office. They <Col N="1337" /> must be complimented on the work they are doing.</P>
      <P>While many people are critical of the quality of water, we have come a long way over the past 40 to 45 years. It is not too long ago that people in rural areas had no water facilities and people in towns and villages had only the use of the village pump. We are in the process of changing the lead pipes which run through towns and villages to upgrade the quality of water. People are entitled to good clean drinking water and it is something for which we were always highly recommended. From a tourism viewpoint, people value Ireland's beauty and the cleanliness of our lakes and rivers and that is an image we must uphold.</P>
      <P>Recently there were water problems in Killarney but the local authority immediately removed the algae from the system and it is working successfully. I welcome the Government's injection of substantial amounts of money in purification and treatment systems. When the economy was crippled in the mid-1980s we sought money for various projects without success. With the growth in the economy money should be put to good use. For example, it should be put into our infrastructure, sewerage and water treatment plants. I welcome the Government's announcement regarding the allocation of large sums of money, particularly the £440 million in the national development plan for the upgrading and renewal of rural water schemes. It will be welcomed by many others also. I compliment the Minister and the Government for highlighting rather than hiding the problem and for tackling it.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of bathing and other waters and rightly so. The quality of these waters must be examined. Children should be cherished and we must ensure that our rivers and lakes are safe for bathing. I was pleased to learn that our rivers and lakes are 100% safe and other bathing waters are 98% safe. This is a huge achievement. Senator Walsh mentioned the recent announcement of the loss of blue flag status. Naturally, a debate was called for on this issue by the Opposition. They will try to blame the Government but it turns out that the local authority was responsible for the loss of blue flags, particularly in counties Wexford and Louth. I am proud to say Kerry got 13 blue flags this year and our beaches are top class. Anybody who wishes to visit Kerry during the summer and use our bathing facilities is more than welcome. I compliment my local authority on the way it monitored the blue flag beaches. It informed us recently that there must be ongoing monitoring every two months or so. The reason blue flags were lost was that local authorities did not see that through. This was due to a breakdown in administration, not to the poor quality of water. We should try to get more blue flags as that status is something which people want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Government's determination to resolve the problem of poor quality drinking water in group schemes and to ensure people can enjoy clean, uncontaminated drinking water. I welcome the introduction of increased grants for such schemes. Mention was made earlier of the <Col N="1338" /> fact that it is the norm to order a bottle of drinking water with a meal, something that was not done in the past. There is a rural group water scheme in my area of Kerry from which half of north Kerry appears to take water because it is suppose to be champagne water. Any time I go to a hostelry I look for it as it is special water. Such schemes should be in operation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's initiative to tackle the problems. Money is available, and rightly so, to upgrade our sewerage and treatment plants. We should try to make our drinking water 100% clean.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I recognise his efforts and those of his counterparts in Government regarding the investment in water schemes and the commitment in the national development plan to improve rural and major water and sewerage schemes. Without reiterating what has been said, it is important to say water is a fundamental need. I agree with the concept that we are above comparisons with Europe because our population is low. We are an island surrounded by water and we have a responsibility for monitoring and working with what we have. Any deterioration in an island with a population of 4.5 million needs to be corrected. It should be a great challenge for us because it is one of our prime structures.</P>
      <P>I recently met the Chinese ambassador to Ireland. It was interesting to note that she asked about the west of Ireland, rural development, the quality of water and the environment. I said that she must have major challenges in setting out policy. She inquired as to the population of the west of Ireland and I told her it would be in the region of 750,000 to one million people. I asked what would be the population of the west of China and she said that policy is being made for 300 million people. The scale of what must be done and our challenge is not enormous but it is fundamentally important.</P>

    <P>In my recent visit to Tipperary during the by-election I looked at the quality of the rivers in Clonmel and I was interested that there were some trout there. There is a need for a high level of education, legislation and good example. We have some fine quality waters. If one looks at the present agricultural practices one will realise the amount of investment which has been put into this area. We understand the challenge which exists. One of the major challenges is to have an integrated policy and sustainable planning of social, economic and environmental practice. That should be the fundamental principle of attacking and approaching this practice, particularly under the Agenda 21 policy of local authorities. Local authorities have not played a strong enough role in the past but I think they are ready to do so now. I welcome the Minister's statement that he will make a major announcement regarding nitrates and that he will identify the areas which need specific management under catchment management plans in the water framework directive, that they will be specifically named, set <Col N="1339" /> out and that structures will be put in place to deal with and manage these areas. If we do that we can make a genuine input into maintaining the quality of property there.</P>
    <P>The recent initiative by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development regarding the types of payments for farmers in disadvantaged areas in particular is to be welcomed. Paying on an acreage rather than a headage basis is an investment in the future environment of this country. It will reduce the numbers involved, which is very important. We have found that the quality of water in some of the finest areas of rural Ireland has deteriorated and is polluted with e-coli and other bacteria. The changes being negotiated are fundamental to the long-term improvement of water quality in our lakes and rivers.</P>
    <P>Substantial legislation and directives are being introduced in this area at global and European level. We must challenge this issue at local level. I welcome the Minister's indications of further decision-making in that regard. In my opinion, the Environmental Protection Agency has done very little up to now. Local authorities have breached many laws in relation to landfill dumps, contamination of public water supplies etc. There have been no subsequent prosecutions and we must face up to such problems. It will cost a great deal of money but it will be an investment in our future. Everybody must share the responsibility. With a population of only 4.5 million people it should not present a major challenge. The resources are available and such an investment will prove itself in the long term. Local authorities are strong enough to meet the challenges and changes required in some agricultural practices. We must all play our part. I welcome the Minister's strong interest in this matter.</P>

      <P>Kilcolman national school, County Limerick, made an application to the Department of Education and Science in October last for the appointment of a resource teacher. The school currently shares a remedial teacher with Ardagh and Carrickerry national schools. A number of children were psychologically assessed and a need for the appointment of a resource teacher was identified. The grouping in place for the remedial teacher has been broken up and Kilcolman national school is no longer included. I <Col N="1340" /> hope the Minister will consider favourably the school's request for a resource teacher.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Cregan for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to respond to his query regarding the appointment of a resource teacher to Kilcolman national school.</P>
      <P>A major new initiative for the integrated education of children with special needs was launched in November 1998. This initiative provided the first ever automatic support for many children with disabilities. The measures involved are aimed at ensuring all children with a special educational need, irrespective of their location or disability, will receive the support they require to participate fully in the education system. The measures extend across the entire spectrum of special needs and deliver extra teaching and child care services to special needs children, whether in groups or individual isolated settings.</P>
      <P>The level of response in each case has regard to the number of children and the severity of disability involved. Where a group of special needs children attend an ordinary school or adjacent schools, the support may take the form of full-time teaching or child care support, or both. The resource teacher is an additional post allocated to assist a school or cluster of schools in providing an education which meets the needs and abilities of children assessed as having a disability. Resource teachers are allocated where there is a number of children with special educational needs arising from a disability who have been fully integrated into mainstream national schools and where there are no other adequate support teaching resources available to the children.</P>
      <P>Resource teacher posts may be sanctioned on a full-time basis either in a single school or in a cluster of schools provided there are sufficient children with special educational needs arising from a disability to warrant a full-time post. Alternatively, part-time hours may be sanctioned to provide support teaching for individual children where there are sufficient children with special educational needs to warrant allocation of a full-time post or a second post.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science is currently investigating the level of resource teaching support required by the school in question. It is expected that the investigation will be completed shortly and the Department will be in touch with the authorities and Kilcolman national school regarding this matter in the near future.</P>
      <P>I will take Senator Cregan's points into account and convey his request to my Government colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and the officials in the Department who will do their utmost to arrive at a positive conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 21 June 2000.</P>
