      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 2 and 3: No. 2, statements on inflation, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of other Senators are not to exceed ten minutes, and the statements to conclude not later than 1 p.m.; No. 3, statements on Sierra Leone, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes.</P>

      <P>I am happy with the Order of Business, but perhaps the Leader might allow second speakers 15 minutes on the inflation debate. It is unfair to confine them to ten. I am sure there will be time to include everyone. I thank the Leader for making possible the debate on Sierra Leone. He was asked for it at short notice and I am grateful to him for allowing it.</P>
      <P>I note that No. 5 on the Order Paper concerning the Ombudsman is to be taken without debate next week. I accept that, but perhaps the Leader would allow time in the next session for a full debate on the Ombudsman. Not alone has the Ombudsman been one of the great success stories of public administration over the past decade or so, his office has also assumed a huge range of new responsibilities. It is important that we debate this and perhaps we could have that debate in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise an issue concerning Eircom, not its disastrous showing on the stock market, which is a different story and which was predicted by few, including many of our leading financial commentators, but the continuing scandal of the unavailability of and long waiting list for telephones in many parts of the country. We were assured that, when Eircom was privatised, we would see a new, lean, hungry and customer-friendly organisation. I have reports that busi<Col N="1530" /> nesses are waiting up to six months to get telephones. The idea of getting a telephone on demand is still a dream. I wish to focus on this issue and to put pressure on Eircom to live up to the promises we were told would be delivered when it was privatised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>A very wise decision. The Order of Business is agreeable to me. Will the Leader arrange a debate as soon as the next session commences on the virtually total absence of a psychiatric service in our prisons? I have raised this matter on several occasions, including on Adjournment debates. Another suicide has taken place in the prison system of someone who obviously should have been in a psychiatric hospital.</P>
      <P>I am not asking the Leader to do anything about the mental health Bill because I have information that nothing is to be done about it until the end of the year &ndash; about the same time it was introduced in this House last year &ndash; following a debate on the report of the inspector of mental hospitals, Fine Gael having kindly given me time to raise the issue once again. I know votes are not secured by raising the issues of mental treatment or psychiatric services in prisons but to show that we are a humane and compassionate society we should urge the Minister to take notice of this issue. Since it has been going on for 20 years I cannot expect a rush of blood to anybody's head about it now. We were promised a mental health Bill as a matter of urgency three years ago. I should have asked what was meant by urgency.</P>
      <P>I would be grateful if this topic could be the first to be debated in the next session. Will the Leader do everything he can in the interim to encourage the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address these serious issues, which should really come under the aegis of the Minister for Health and Children? The only thing that will happen in the meantime is more suicides in the prison system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with Senator Henry. I also ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the prison system. Senator Henry is focusing on the psychiatric service and the need for the new mental health Bill. The death of a person in prison who was serving only a six month sentence is another tragedy. Psychiatric services are deficient. On the one hand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is trumpeting that crime statistics have come down during his period in office, yet the prison population is rocketing. <Col N="1531" /> The Minister is putting far more people into prisons yet there are no services there.</P>
      <P>It is time to examine what is happening in our prisons, particularly with regard to the services being provided for people with difficulties, whether that person is exceedingly depressed or has a more fundamental mental problem. The absence of a proper drug treatment scheme should also be examined.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the fact that an elderly person spent 14 hours waiting for treatment after a serious accident and the recommendations made by the coroner on what should happen in casualty departments. This follows the matter raised by Senator Henry two weeks ago on the quality of the medical services. The situation is getting worse despite the promises that funding and resources would be put into the medical services. Waiting time at casualty seems to have got worse.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader allow time for a full discussion on the medical services and waiting lists?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to instruct Dublin Corporation to withdraw its threat to increase parking fees by 50%? It is seeking to charge £1.50 per hour instead of £1 per hour, which is bad enough. To add insult to injury, it is suggesting that people who can afford to pay £1,200 can park anywhere they like for as long as they like. That is fine for big companies and corporations who can write off such an expense, but there are very few people who can afford to pay that amount of money for parking facilities. Parking one's car in Dublin is no longer a luxury. The only place one can park is on public streets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs our concern at the execution of a man in Huntsville, Texas? Had Senators not been called alphabetically, I have no <Col N="1532" /> doubt Senator Ross would have raised this matter because he pioneered the whole question of the death penalty in this House. This is a particularly unpleasant situation because it happens in the run-up to an American election, as usual. Governor Bush is a candidate for the American presidential election and this amounts to no more than a convenient little spot of murder to advance the presidential ambitions of a particular candidate. It is appalling and it happens across all political parties. Mr. Clinton was involved in such activities also. It is appalling to think that people are being put to death to advance a political campaign.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader inform the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that there is growing concern about our deportation policy? The matter was discussed in the House yesterday. I read figures into the record yesterday which indicate that 2,000 people in Europe had died in the past couple of years either by police action or suicide. Immediately after that I received a telephone call from a distressed person who had briefed me on the subject to say that a young Nigerian woman living in Dublin who had been served with deportation papers had hung herself. That happened as we were debating this issue. We should take such matters seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader allow time early in the next session for a debate on the fluoridation of water? I realise we had a debate on water quality earlier this week, but that centred more on local government responsibility in this area. We should ask the Minister for Health and Children, whom I compliment on appointing a group to investigate this issue, to come to the House to discuss the matter. There is a great deal of argument about the fluoridation of water. We need to elucidate the facts so we can make a decision as to what we should do. Will the Leader request the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House so that we can have a meaningful debate on this issue?</P>
      <P>Another issue worthy of consideration at the earliest possible convenience is insurance for young people. This has been a hot potato for many years and is something we need to grasp. The cost of insurance for young people is so exorbitant that many of them are driving without insurance. We need to devise a way for them to get insurance and to take a more responsible attitude to driving. I ask for a debate on this matter.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Chair on calling Independent Senators alphabetically. Whether one goes by Christian name or surname, that puts Senator Ross at the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to those of Senators Costello and Henry regarding health issues, specifically the case of a dying woman who needed four ambulances in ten hours to get to a hospital in the mid-west. The Minister told us last week that we had asked him to delegate responsibility to the regions and that this was not, therefore, his responsibility. Will the Leader ensure the Minister does something about the health services in the next few months? Once the Houses go into recess the atmosphere is relaxed until we return and there is a danger we may not come back on time if the building is not ready. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to make this period a time of action rather than a time of talk.</P>
      <P>I remind the House that today in Benin an agreement is to be signed to replace the old Lomé agreement between 77 countries from the Caribbean, Africa, the Pacific and the European Union, but there is a threat to this development aid coming from Britain. Ms Clare Short, the British International Development Secretary, has written an article calling for Britain to withdraw from this agreement and to find another way of helping the Third World. She may have the best reasons in the world, but she is very critical of what the EU is doing. That is an area on which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development should keep an eye.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Leader who was responsible for the e-commerce Bill as I gather it will get through the Houses. I had sought it in the past few weeks and was doubtful if it would be introduced. I know it is not good manners to wish that a Member never comes back to the House, but one Member may never come back depending on a vote today. I wish Senator Tom Hayes every success and I know all other Senators will offer him the same good wishes &ndash; that we never see him in the Seanad again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring the provision of public playgrounds for children to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. It may not be seen as a matter of national importance, but it is very important for children to be able to play. Some counties with large populations do not provide public playground facilities and a number of local authorities did not even reply to a recent survey on this matter, which is not a good sign. It is not a matter that will be on the agenda of every local authority &ndash; it has not been to date &ndash; but there should be a directive from the Minister to local <Col N="1534" /> authorities instructing them to provide facilities for children as part of their development plans. Everyone needs a good start in life and playing is the first language children use. We should address this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to say on the Chair's decision to call people in alphabetical order. I support Senator Norris's comments on the execution of a man last night in Texas. This House took the initiative in this issue by unanimously supporting the abolition of capital punishment in Ireland many years ago. This is a disgusting state crime perpetrated against a member of the community. We do not, as a nation, approve of or carry out executions, but for some extraordinary reason when it happens in America we are mute. When barbaric actions of this sort happened in Iran, Iraq and South Africa, Ireland was very happy to condemn them as there was no economic interest involved, but when it happens in America we are silent.</P>
      <P>A message should go out from this House today that we do not believe it is appropriate that there should be judicial executions and that the final decision should be taken by someone who is running for president and will obviously take that decision in a political context. It is quite unacceptable that human lives should be treated in this fashion and should be subject to political decisions. That, indeed, is what has happened. I suggest that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Minister for Foreign Affairs should send a clear message from this House that we find this sort of activity disgusting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It made me feel somewhat sick this morning to get this invitation from the American Embassy to celebrate 224 years of American independence when they are popping people in their country. I presume everybody else in this House got a similar invitation to bring a guest along. If I could make a mischievous suggestion, maybe they could bring along a member of Amnesty International.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>If 60 of us did that, it might send a message to America that we find the decision to convict on the basis of only one witness and a decision taken in a political context quite revolting and that we, as a nation, disapprove of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator thinks all the Independent Senators are equal but, unfortunately, that is not the mutual position among them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join in the call for a debate on the Ombudsman. It is of vital importance that we debate this <Col N="1535" /> fine report, which has proved successful in that different Governments have made and implemented decisions based on it. That the finger has been pointed at many local authorities is something which should be debated because, after all, we are the representatives of the elected members of local authorities. If any group has emerged badly from the report, it is local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with a debate on health. Psychiatric services should be available in prisons and maybe they should be enhanced. To some extent, we created this problem in that we dismantled the psychiatric services by depending on a document &ndash; Planning for the Future. Part of that dealt with community services, but we did not implement that. It is unfortunate that, to some extent, people are ending up in prison who should possibly be dealt with by the psychiatric services.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a debate on health because this Government has spent more money on health than any other Government in the history of the State. A huge investment is provided for in the national development plan. It is not as a result of lack of money that there is a shortage of services this summer &ndash; in fact, the wards will be open this summer &ndash; it is a question of personnel. That is an indication of the success of the Minister in regard to the health services.</P>
    <P>I call for a debate on bank charges. We have raised this issue in the past but it appears our calls are falling on deaf ears. Up to 24% interest is being charged on credit cards and up to 14% on overdrafts. A good face is being put on mortgages and other special situations. By and large, people are being fleeced.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Quinn's call for a debate on the hospital and health services. It is unbelievable to read in today's newspapers that two people died trying to access accident and emergency services. It is a very sad state of affairs that a person was driven around the mid-west for ten hours trying to gain entry to a hospital. I support Senator Quinn's call for a debate with the Minister for Health and Children on the health services because action will have to be taken immediately.</P>

      <P>I support the call for the provision of psychiatric services in prisons. I made such a <Col N="1536" /> request in 1982 to the then Governor and the visiting committee of Mountjoy Prison when I was a member of that committee. I also asked for alcohol therapists as many people end up in prison due to a problem with alcohol or drugs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I am coming to it. Psychiatric services have been used or abused by people accused of serious crimes who have sought to find an easy way out of their difficulties. I would welcome a debate on this issue. I agree with Senator Finneran's comments on the input of the Government and the Minister into the health services. This reflects the great success we are enjoying.</P>

This is the middle of the tourism season and by the time the House resumes after the summer recess the holiday season will be over for most people. However, many people, including myself, have had bad experiences in paying for holidays. What EU rules or regulations are available to protect people who pay good money but enjoy holidays from hell?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Leonard's call for a debate on the provision of play areas. I would also ask for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come into the House to discuss the issue of difficult tenants. There is a difficulty&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support Senator Bohan's request for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to intervene with Dublin Corporation on the increase in car parking charges. It is ironic that on the day the House holds the long awaited debate on inflation we are talking about a potential 50% increase in the cost of what is a basic necessity for a significant number of people.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Bohan's comments on the proposed £1,200 annual bulk fee or corporate rate, whatever the corporation wishes to call it. That works out at less than £5 per day whereas the cost for ordinary members of the public is £18 per day. That is a ridiculous gulf and begs the question as the whether the corporation also intends to introduce bulk rates for declamping and what kind of margins will exist.</P>
      <P>Before any changes to car parking fees are suggested or discussed, the machines used to collect those fees should be adjusted to accept legal tender, particularly the £1 coin. Will the Leader ask the Minister to seek the Attorney General's opinion on the legality of these machines?</P>

      <P>I would like a debate on the compensation culture which is the root of many of our problems. Many doctors are spending more time in the courts than at their clinics because of the compensation culture. There should be an inquiry into how the legal profession operates the compensation system. In the courts, one can see barristers running between three or four clients. Cases cannot be settled the day before they go to court, but at the court they are eager to settle them. Sometimes the clients do not know what they will get.</P>

      <P>I will be brief so the debate can start immediately. Senator Manning sought an extension of time to 15 minutes for other Senators. I agree to that and Senators may also share time. Senators Manning and Finneran called for an investigation of the long waiting lists for telephones. We all remember the great work done by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. I agree with the sentiments expressed. It is a disgrace that telephones are not available on demand. I will arrange for an urgent debate on this topic when we have reviewed the progress of Eircom over the summer. We will wait until September, when we reconvene, to see what progress has been made, given the trust both Houses of the Oireachtas have placed in the company.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senators Manning and Finneran on the need for a full debate on the Ombudsman in the next session. Senators Henry, Costello, Quinn, Burke and Glynn expressed concern about the psychiatric and prison services. We will have a debate on this matter after the full debate on general health services after this session.</P>
      <P>Senators Bohan and Glennon appealed to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to intervene as a matter of urgency in view of the threat by Dublin Corporation to increase parking fines by 50%. Any fair-minded person would agree that this is an effort to do something about illegal parking in the Dublin city. However, in the north inner city, which has experienced nothing of the Celtic tiger economy, Dublin Corporation should adopt a hands-off policy, particularly in relation to Parnell Square, Croke Park and the surrounds.</P>
      <P>If Dublin Corporation is going to be selective, it should start in the areas that the economic growth has benefited most, rather than what it is doing around the Parnell Square area and in the north inner city generally, clamping cars and making parking impossible. People who are trying to conduct business and give employment in that area should be supported. If there is a black spot in the area, such as Parnell Street, the corporation should take off the gloves and do something about it, rather than showing a lack of support for decent people who are creating jobs and giving employment in the area.</P>
      <P>I will pass on Senator Norris's views to the Minister regarding the deportation of the people to whom he referred. I will also pass on Senator Ross's views. This House has been unanimous in its condemnation of countries that still have the death penalty.</P>
      <P>Senator Gibbons called for a debate on the fluoridation of water. I will certainly allow time for this during the next session. Many Senators have called for a debate on car insurance for young people. I have agreed to have this debated during the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confirm to Senator Quinn that the e-commerce Bill is scheduled for Monday week. Senators Leonard and Glynn called for the inclusion of playgrounds in county development <Col N="1540" /> plans currently with local authorities. This is part of the County Westmeath plan which is going through this afternoon. I thank Senator Leonard for bringing it to the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran called for a debate on bank charges. It is a disgrace that a 24% rate should be charged on credit cards. The sooner we have fair charges the better. If it is necessary for the Minister to bring in a regulation to ban this excessive charge, she should do so. I fully support the call for this.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn called for a debate on tourism. That will take place during the next session. Senator Farrell wholeheartedly welcomed the 1,000 jobs at Intel&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Moylan referred to the National Roads Authority and the problem of people selling produce on the roadside outside the speed limit areas. We intend to have a debate on the National Roads Authority early in the next session, when this matter can be highlighted. Senator Fitzgerald called for a debate on speed limits in general, and we can also have a debate on that in the next session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be given the opportunity to outline the Government's position in relation to inflation. The most recent figures published by the CSO showed that inflation stood at 5.2% in May. This is a considerable increase compared to last year and represents a disappointment for the Government. We are naturally concerned about this high rate and share the concerns expressed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the IBEC and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As noted by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in the Seanad earlier this month, there are a number of factors behind the increase. These include the impact of the weakness of the euro, the international trend in oil prices and once-off <Col N="1541" /> factors such as the increase in excise duties on tobacco introduced for health reasons. While the increase in excise duties on tobacco added about 0.75% to the CPI, this effect will fall out of the index in December. Higher inflation in the services sector is also an important factor, including the ongoing and unacceptable increase in alcohol prices.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress the impact of some external factors. As Senators are aware, we have one of the most open economies in Europe. In simple terms we import much of what we consume. A large part of our trade is with countries which are not part of the euro area, namely, the UK and the US. As a result, changes in the value of our exchange rate &ndash; now the euro &ndash; have the potential to significantly increase the price of goods contained in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the euro has declined since 1 January 1999 when it was launched. It is estimated that the lower value of the euro has added over 0.5% to the CPI. The price of oil has also added to our inflation rate. The price of oil on international markets was about $11 a barrel in spring last year but it has increased almost threefold since then and is now hovering at about $30 per barrel. Given our dependence on imported energy, the impact of higher energy prices in particular has been significant, adding over 1% to the CPI for the period. The energy component of the overall CPI rose by over 12% in the past 12 months. Finally, increases in interest rates have also contributed to the rise in the CPI in recent months. Given these developments, the increase in inflation is to be expected.</P>
    <P>In the coming months, as the Taoiseach has said, there will be a further rise in inflation due to higher energy prices and the impact of the recent increase in interest rates by the European Central Bank. However, inflation will begin to fall as the negative factors I have mentioned become less important, a view shared by most commentators and forecasters.</P>
    <P>The Government is particularly concerned about the impact of the current 5% plus inflation rate on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. As Senators are aware, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on Wednesday to discuss the current situation. The meeting had been sought by the ICTU within the context of the new agreement. At the meeting the Government reiterated its commitment to achieve enhanced living standards both for those at work and those dependent on social welfare payments, as outlined in the programme. It was agreed that this would require an active process of management on the part of Government in consultation with the social partners. Developments in relation to inflation and living standards will be monitored over coming months and will be the subject of regular contact with the ICTU.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it was restated that the primary <Col N="1542" /> objective of the Government and the social partners is the achievement of a better quality of life for all our people. Higher living standards are a part of this but the attainment of this objective also requires action in a number of areas. It was agreed that particular priority would be given to the issue of affordable child care, the development of public transport, the promotion of family-friendly work practices and mechanisms to encourage gain sharing in the workplace. These will be the subject of further discussions with the social partners in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that a valuable contribution to tackling these and related issues could be made by the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, which is provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Arrangements for its establishment will be accelerated.</P>
    <P>Despite higher than expected inflation most employees will see further increases in the real value of their take-home pay this year. The combined effect of income tax reductions effective from April and the standard pay increases under Partnership 2000 and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness should generate average increases in nominal take-home pay of over 10%. This is in excess of the most pessimistic inflation forecasts. This comes on top of significant increases in real take-home pay over the last decade. Real take-home pay for those on average manufacturing earnings rose by 35% in the 12 years to 1999. This is in marked contrast to the declines in the first half of the 1980s. During the seven years to 1987 real take-home pay fell by over 7%. In this respect social partnership has clearly worked and the Government is fully committed to ensuring it continues to work in everybody's interest.</P>
    <P>The employment statistics show the progress we have made. Employment increased by over 500,000 between 1988 and 2000 while the unemployment rate has fallen from 16.3% in 1988 to 4.6% according to the latest numbers. In overall terms, income per head is fast approaching the EU average.</P>
    <P>Maintaining this economic success requires that we tackle inflation. More competition is a key element of our strategy. There is a need for further measures to promote competition and tackle anti-competitive practices in sectors where there is evidence of excessive margins. As experience illustrates, competition can have a large impact on price developments. For example, there is considerable evidence that air transport liberalisation has resulted in strong growth in demand and significant downward pressure on air fares. This has been a key factor behind the success of the tourism sector over the past decade. In 1998 there were over 18 million passenger journeys into and out of Ireland, three quarters of them by air. This compares to around 8 million in 1988. More recently liberalisation of the telecoms market is having a profound effect on prices. The cost of calls is falling rapidly. Costs fell by more than 16% in the three years to December <Col N="1543" /> 1996. Further falls are likely as competition intensifies.</P>
    <P>The Government is pursuing a series of further reforms designed to boost competition across a range of markets. In February the first stage in the liberalisation of the electricity market took place. In March the Government launched the final report of the competition and mergers review group which reviewed and made recommendations on the future of competition policy. In April the Government announced a new institutional framework for public transport, including the introduction of competition to urban bus markets.</P>
    <P>Further measures are at an advanced stage of preparation. These will include a vigorous programme of price monitoring and publicity to heighten consumer awareness, stimulate competition and identify evidence of anti-competitive practices. They will include selective measures to remove restrictions on competition and curb price increases. There is a need for specific targeted interventions in areas where measures to combat restrictive practices and stimulate competition are proving difficult or likely to take time to be effective. Full details of these measures will be announced next week.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Government should lower indirect taxation to reduce inflation. No options in this regard have been ruled out. Careful consideration will be given to proposals put forward in the context of preparations for the next budget in December.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the housing market. The rapid increase in the price of housing in recent years is one of the undesirable consequences of our strong economic performance. The problems faced by young people in entering the housing market are a major cause of concern. As a society this situation represents a fundamental challenge that we must address.</P>
    <P>The Government recently approved a further package of measures for the housing market. This follows the publication of the third report by the economic consultant, Mr. Peter Bacon. The measures which the Government is implementing are designed to achieve a number of key objectives, among which is to increase further the supply of housing. It must be acknowledged that much has been achieved. There has been progress in a range of areas, including the serviced land initiative, major water and sewerage schemes in the greater Dublin area, road access schemes and additional resources for An Bord Pleanála and local authority planning departments. This is leading to some success. Last year 46,500 new houses were built, which was the fifth consecutive year of record output. However, as the Bacon report pointed out, if we are to meet demand we need about 55,000 new homes per year in the private sector.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances we have implemented measures aimed at managing the demand side of the market. In particular, the Government sought <Col N="1544" /> to strengthen the position of first time buyers to curb speculative demand for housing. Taxation measures are a suitable instrument to help accomplish these goals. The measures announced last week, and already given effect by a financial resolution, include a comprehensive restructuring of the stamp duty regime. These changes will work to the advantage of first time buyers and other owner occupiers.</P>
    <P>Last week the Government also announced a new anti-speculative tax which is to have effect from 15 June 2000. This tax will apply at the rate of 2% of the market value of residential properties acquired on or after 15 June, other than principal private residences. Senators will have an opportunity to discuss these taxation measure in greater detail shortly when the Finance Bill to give them effect comes before Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>Throughout our term of office the Government has been proactive on the housing issue. We understand the frustrations many people are experiencing, especially those who are contemplating buying their first home, due to increasing house prices. As noted, the most recent study commissioned by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister of State was the third such exercise. Where the studies have recommended measures these have, by and large, been put in place rapidly. The Government has not hesitated in introducing appropriate changes to the taxation system to improve the position of first time buyers and other owner occupiers.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the Government's concern about price developments. We are confident inflation will, over time, fall below current levels. However, we are determined to take whatever action is necessary to reduce the current rate as quickly as possible. This is essential if the Government's achievements, including record employment growth and low unemployment, are to be sustained into the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no reflection on the Minster, but Members believed the Minister for Finance would attend the House today to discuss this very important issue. We are disappointed neither he nor the Minister of State at his Department is not present.</P>
      <P>When I spoke on the Adjournment debate last Christmas I drew the attention of the House to the fact that inflation was increasing once again. It was not then popular to talk about the issue as the rate of inflation was only 2.5%. Nevertheless, I expressed concern that the rate was beginning to rise, and so it has. The inflation rate is now 5.2%, the highest rate in Europe and the highest we have experienced in 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Stage debate on the Finance Bill, I devoted a major part of my speech to the rise in inflation. At that time the rate was 3.6%. In his reply, the Minster for Finance stated that it might increase to about 4% but that it would taper off at that point. Unfortunately, that has not <Col N="1545" /> happened. We now have the highest inflation rate we have experienced for a long number of years.</P>
    <P>I detest inflation because I have seen the damage it has caused to economies during my lifetime. It is disastrous and morally corrosive and it destroys lives. The disturbing thing about inflation is that those who can best protect themselves or even gain from it are often those who have most, while the losers are those who have least. It is, as I once said on the Order of Business, a tax on the poor and a free tax benefit for the rich.</P>
    <P>For these reasons there is a moral obligation on the Government to take measures to reduce the rate of inflation. It must find a formula to control it and restore the value of the pound, especially for the lower paid workers and those in receipt of social welfare benefits. It must implement appropriate fiscal controls to tackle inflation.</P>
    <P>The Government must be taken to task for its ineptitude in dealing with this problem. Initially, the Government denied that inflation would be a problem. Then it said that it was a problem, although a limited one which might not last and that whatever was causing inflation had nothing to do with the domestic matters, it was all imported. This theory has now been exposed. The current rate of inflation is the highest for 15 years and it is the biggest economic headache the Government has had to face since coming into office.</P>
    <P>No doubt the problem of inflation, taken together with the surge in property prices which the Minister has addressed, has the potential, if not resolved, to prevent the Government's re-election. These are the two issues on which the next general election will be fought &ndash; inflation and property prices. They are real issues, not like some of the phoney issues being discussed in the media. They are the real issues because they hurt every citizen's pocket, especially the lower paid and the less well off in society.</P>
    <P>The Government could claim that it has been unlucky with the sudden rise in inflation and that it could not have foreseen the sudden rise in the price of oil and the collapse in the value of the euro. Even the trade unions, which signed up to the pay negotiations and a pay rise for workers of 15.75% over 33 months, did not see that happening.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated that he believes inflation is a product of success. He said that no other country has had a high rate of growth, very high unemployment levels which had fallen and the amount of spending in the national development plan. In saying that, he ignored the fact that the US has enjoyed high productivity and low inflation over the past number of years and also that our near neighbours in Britain have enjoyed eight years of steady growth while incurring inflation of only about 2%. The Government might like to blame external factors for the rise in inflation but it is really a domestic problem. General services <Col N="1546" /> inflation is over 6%, reflecting the labour shortage, high wages and the willingness of consumers to pay higher prices.</P>
    <P>No doubt joining the euro in January 1999 was one of the main causes of the surge in inflation. Interest rates were reduced to 3% on joining the euro. This was an entirely inappropriate low cost of borrowing, given the pace at which the economy was growing at that time. It is interesting to note that inflation has increased from 2.1% to 5.2% since January 1999, yet the base rate for the euro is 4.25%, and there is little chance of this being increased before September at the earliest because there are fears that a 0.5% increase might, in itself, do much damage to the main euro economies of Germany, France and Italy.</P>
    <P>We are now in the extraordinary situation in Ireland where real interest rates are negative. It pays people to borrow money and, as a result, saving is penalised. It is no wonder that private borrowing is increasing at an annual rate of 30%. Mr. Willie Slattery, a former employee of the Central Bank, has on a number of occasions in recent times issued warnings regarding the rapid increase in private borrowing. If we are to halt the inflationary spiral which we are experiencing at present, then it is important that the agreement negotiated under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness holds. I know trade union leaders are facing pressure from their membership, who signed up to this pay deal on the basis that inflation would not exceed 3%. With inflation running at almost twice that rate, those workers now want a compensating wage round. I am pleased to note that their officials understand a basic rule of economics, that pushing up pay rates will not stop the rise in inflation. In fact, increasing purchasing power is almost certain to further increase inflation.</P>
    <P>I want to acknowledge the lead given by Senator O'Toole in this matter. He believes that the Government's priority must be to use the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to tackle, as he put it, the twin problems of inflation and wage value erosion. He is on record as stating that, beside cuts in indirect tax and price controls, congress will want a declaration from the Government that it will use its December budget to restore workers' earning power through cuts in income tax, which were promised in the programme.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate this debate is taking place this morning because the ESRI report was issued today. Although I have not had an opportunity to study it, I see from a glance that it is opposed to the reduction of taxes at the next budget and has suggested that they be delayed. That is very unfair, especially to the less well-off in our community, because they are the ones who will suffer, so they must get the benefit of income tax reductions. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, would be right to ignore the advice of the European Commission and introduce further tax cuts. If labour shortage is one of the main causes of wage inflation, it must be dealt with. Tax cuts <Col N="1547" /> may fuel inflation, but they are needed to encourage people to join the workforce which, in turn, could reduce the problem of wage inflation. A fiscal stimulus may, paradoxically, be good.</P>
    <P>Many experts now claim that a cut in indirect taxes, either in VAT or excise duties, on items such as drink or fuel, could help reduce headline inflation, assuming that companies and retailers pass on this reduction to consumers. It must be a priority for Government to ensure this happens. There is no good in reducing indirect taxes if the benefit is not passed on to the consumer. Some critics will say that this will make things worse by putting more money in the pockets of consumers. However, cuts in indirect taxation might reduce the headline inflation rate and that could have the effect of fending off other pay claims, especially in the public sector, until inflation begins to decline to its previous lower levels.</P>
    <P>There is one bright light at the end of a dark tunnel for the Government. The recovery in the euro may be a slow process given the lack of confidence in the currency market in European economic management, but it could happen by default as sterling and the dollar lose value. In the past month alone, a considerable amount has been knocked off the excessive value of sterling. We must acknowledge that a sensible interest rate policy in the UK means the economy there is cooling to a manageable pace with the inevitable impact that has on sterling.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is on record as pledging to curb high inflation by tackling profit-taking and promising competition. He stated he would not allow a situation where excessive profit-taking occurred, especially through anti-competitive practices. There was evidence of opportunistic profit-taking in the price of services such as food and drink, and I am pleased to note that the Government has committed new resources to the Competition Authority to aid its work. I hope it will strengthen its ability to protect consumers and business alike.</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious about tackling inflation, it must address the problem of labour supply. It must do all in its power to continue to develop the workforce. It must increase the numbers in employment, and the obvious sources are females in the home and immigrants. Last month, a leading firm of stockbrokers suggested that the number of people at work would increase by 83,300 this year, but the labour market still needs a further 24,500 workers to meet demands. It said that tax reform and a clear immigration policy would be required, with substantial tax reductions needed to attract married women into the labour force and more labour from Britain, where taxes, especially for a single person, are much lower. They also wanted an extension of the existing visa scheme to experienced service sector workers and supported the proposals of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to issue work visas to non-EU nationals with construction, nursing and information technology skills. That is where demand for employment lies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> While the time has come for the Government to persuade public opinion to accept and embrace immigrants, its policy towards asylum seekers, however, has created the impression that they are all scroungers. Its failure to promote a positive approach could be partly explained, if not excused, if there were high unemployment, but not at a time when there is a labour shortage. It is a policy that also ignores the British and European experiences that the majority of immigrants work and support their dependants and add entrepreneurial zest to the country in which they live. I have no doubt that allowing more non-Irish workers into the economy would help keep down inflation, but it would also have other implications for society and the Government must not be found wanting in giving a lead in this area.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to stop talking down inflation as some external nuisance over which it has no control and face up to the responsibility it has as a democratically elected Government to tackle domestic inflationary pressures to stop them from raising their ugly heads in the economy. Tackling labour shortages through an enlightened immigration policy, encouraging the supply of people into the workforce through decreasing effective taxation at the lower end of the labour market, promoting competition and combating restrictive practices in the services sector are all policies the Government can and must implement. If the Government fails to do so, it will not be returned at the next election. The two main issues on which the election will be fought will be inflation and high property prices.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance addressed us during the previous budget, he was in very bullish form and said the Government was in a win-win situation. I warned him then to be careful as he might score an own goal. The Government has scored that own goal because the previous budget gave too much to the well-off and not enough to the less well-off people in society. In doing that, it fuelled the economy and caused the inflation rate we have at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleague in Opposition in welcoming the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, to the Seanad. I am pleased the Leader and the Leas-Chathaoirleach afforded us the opportunity to debate this important economic issue, namely, the rise in inflation. This is the third debate on the economy we have had in six months. We dealt with the budget and had a long debate on that. We dealt with the Finance Bill and we now have an opportunity to make statements on the economy again. This has been called for by a number of people in past weeks, especially those from the Independent benches. I hope that, when they contribute, rather than criticise and question, they will come forward with solutions because, while there have been many questions in the contributions on the Order of Business over the past four weeks, there have been no answers. I expect the learned gentlemen <Col N="1549" /> from that side of the House to come forward with some constructive proposals.</P>
      <P>This country and economy is a victim of its own success. To explain that, I reflect back to the mid to late 1980s when this country was on its knees from an economic point of view. The creditors were at the door and young people, especially graduates, were boarding planes and boats and heading for Europe, the United States and Australia because no jobs or opportunities were available here at the time. In 1987, the then minority Government through the then Minister for Finance, Mr. MacSharry, put in place a series of drastic measures to redress the fact that the economy was on the wrong road. That Government and subsequent ones can take credit for the position in which we are today. It was achieved through measures initiated at the time and followed by subsequent Governments.</P>
      <P>The most important feature of all the Governments was their ability to enter into social partnership agreements with employers and trade unions. If there was a cornerstone upon which our success was built, it was the understanding and recognition by the trade union movement, employers and Government that, if we were to emerge from the economic mess in which we were, we had to work together. Social partnership has been the cornerstone of our success.</P>
      <P>We now have growth in the economy of up to 10% per year and we have budget surpluses on an annual basis. Unemployment has been virtually eliminated and stands nationally at about 4%. Long-term unemployment is at about 2%, which we thought was unachievable.</P>
      <P>Although there has been much success since the late 1980s, there are problems. We are a victim of our success. It is believed there are up to 60,000 job vacancies, which has created pressures. The demand in the area of employment has caused wage increases and consequent service cost increases. External factors should not be ignored. At no time did any Minister for Finance or Taoiseach indicate that our open economy was exclusive of outside pressures, as has been suggested. No such statement was made by the Minister for Finance or anyone deputising for him, certainly during my time in the past three years as Government spokesman on finance.</P>
      <P>As an open economy we have been conscious that outside forces could interfere with our stability and that is as relevant now as it ever was. It can be seen in two areas. The first is in the area of oil prices, which are not decided at the behest of this or any Government in the western world but are controlled and sometimes orchestrated by OPEC. I am pleased that in the past few days OPEC has decided to increase the output of oil. I have no doubt that will have a positive impact on our economy but it will take time to kick in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second factor is that we have seen a decline in the value of the euro. There was a wonderful debate here on the euro on its initiation. We were all in favour of it and hoped it would trade favourably with the dollar and the yen, but <Col N="1550" /> this has not happened to the extent we expected. During debate on the euro, Senator Ross may have been the very prominent dissenting voice but it has stabilised <i>vis-à-vis </i>its strength against the dollar and sterling and we will see an improvement in its position. This will give rise to a positive response from an international viewpoint with regard to inflation. Those two factors have had an effect on inflation.</P>
    <P>The real problems are on the domestic side. I have referred to the great numbers of people needed to take up between 55,000 and 60,000 job vacancies. That creates demands and increases the pressure to pay higher wages, which in turn impacts on the price of goods and services. That has been the case in recent times. I question the level of increase being imposed in some service areas which appears to be above and beyond what is justified. People are cashing in on the situation in which they find themselves. To an extent, they abuse the introduction of the minimum wage of £4.40 per hour by causing prices to spiral, particularly in the service sector. The minimum wage in the UK is £1.20 less per hour.</P>
    <P>Price control is not the answer and it is a philosophy I do not believe in. There should be more competition and an increase in the labour market. More training is required and greater opportunities should be created for people to work here. This could be achieved by providing work permits. It is important to focus on these issues. In the past we focused on re-training and on getting people back into the job market. As that resource has been exhausted, we must look to our emigrants and to those who regard this country as a suitable place in which to work and live.</P>
    <P>Competition is the base line for any market. It is suggested that if price controls were introduced in the Dublin area, particularly in the pub business, it would bring down the price of alcohol. The bottom line is that more licences and competition in the market are needed. Pussyfooting with price control is not the route to take.</P>
    <P>Increases in mortgage interest rates have had an effect on inflation also. My analysis is that we have come a long way through partnership. We are a victim of our success and are reaping the down side of having reached employment saturation point, with price rises in the domestic market. It is a time for reflection. Those who signed up to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness should reflect on our present circumstances. It should be looked at in an overall context. We are only a few months into this programme and it will last 33 months. While there is an inflationary content, some of it has been fuelled by the budget. The increase in the price of tobacco for health reasons has caused problems but, as the Minister stated, it will level out towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>We should consider the benefits achieved through social partnership. I would say to those who are claiming there must be renegotiation and that the Government should take drastic measures that we should steady ourselves and <Col N="1551" /> look at what has happened since the late 1980s. It should be addressed in the overall context of what we have signed up to for the next three years. There is an opportunity in the overall package for a major increase in wages &ndash; a 16% increase &ndash; and a massive tax break. These two factors are safeguards in the situation in which we find ourselves. As the Minister said, even with the worst prospects there is still an opportunity for a 10% increase in wages this year. Those entering discussions and negotiations with regard to our temporary predicament should reflect on that.</P>
    <P>Many people returning here find the country attractive to the extent that salaries and the general environment are good, but they find it very hard to get into the housing market because prices are excessive. The Government is putting in place important measures to address the problems in that area, but we must take things a step further. We must look at the national development plan in the long-term and populate areas outside Dublin, as mentioned in that plan. We must accelerate that trend in the midlands, the northwest and the southwest but we cannot leave its implementation to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have 20 years experience at local authority level. I was chairman of the General Council of County Councils in the 1980s. Local authorities are not geared to deal with what is required over the next ten or 15 years. Many county council executives have tunnel vision. They are more interested in the picture as presented from a European point of view &ndash; a lovely environment with no more activity that we currently have. Would that it could be so, but it is impossible. This country has a growing population and the Government must put in place measures to address that growth. I do not believe local or regional authorities can solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Europe is intent on ensuring things are dealt with at a local and regional level, but there is a need for strong national policies to populate areas outside Dublin. I welcome decentralisation but I do not think that alone is sufficient. We must create new Government-led cities. It is necessary that we do this in the midlands, north west and south west. I hope the Government will pursue that issue with vigour.</P>
    <P>Matters relating to the groceries order have been brought to my attention. I believe in competition and the free market. Repealing this order will cause major problems for independent grocery retailers. Forty per cent of small villages in England have no local shop and it would be devastating if that were to happen here. It would take away the fabric of villages. We should reflect upon that when considering the repeal or alteration of the groceries order. I do not want to see a development similar to that which happened some years ago when we lost post offices, Garda stations, schools etc. We should not have to fight to hold on to the local corner shop in the interest of protecting the fabric of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn is an expert on the grocery <Col N="1552" /> trade and would have a particular view on this matter. My view is that we should maintain the facility for people to shop locally. We should also maintain the independence of the grocery trade and ensure it is not swallowed up by multinationals. I would not like to see that happening.</P>
    <P>Some of the decisions taken by arms of government are contributing to the problems we are facing. I heard two Senators from the Dublin area bring to the attention of the Leader of the House the intention of Dublin Corporation, an arm of government, to increase its parking charges in the city by 50%. Surely it is conscious of the national interest and that it is contributing to rising inflation by imposing such an increase. In many cases people have to bring their car to work. An extra £10, £15 or £20 a week charge in parking fees would mean they take home less pay. That will be highlighted by the trade unions representing those workers when they come back to the negotiating table. Dublin Corporation should reflect on that decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has given an increase of £7 per week to non-contributory old age pensioners. Within a week of that increase being made available local health boards implemented a reduction of £6 a week in the rent allowance, resulting in the pensioner gaining a £1 increase. I compliment the Government on the good work it is doing, but the next tier of government, be it at local authority or health board level, has a national responsibility in this area also. It must dovetail into national policy. It is scandalous that a health board should grab £6 of the £7 increase given by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to old age pensioners. That defeats the good intent of the Government, the Minister and those involved in social partnership.</P>
    <P>There are many areas on which I would like to speak but time has run out. I applaud all who have contributed over the years to social partnership, which has been the cornerstone of our success. It should not be thrown away at this juncture. We are in the first months of a 33 month partnership deal and should reflect on what is involved.</P>
    <P>The Government will implement measures that will ease some of the pain, if not all of it, which some sections of our community are experiencing. I hope the message goes out that this is not a case of the Government against everyone or vice versa. This is the Irish people looking after the interests of this and future generations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate, which was reluctantly granted. It is appropriate, as Senator Doyle said, in light of the fact that the ESRI report criticises the measures which the Government has not yet taken. That marks the end of the ESRI as the Government's house trained poodles.</P>
      <P>The significance of this debate is that it does not mark the rescue of the PPF, it marks the end of the pay deal. I have listened to a lot of fairy tales here for the last few weeks. Everyone trots out the same old jargon about the PPF, saying that the pay deal is in danger and will be broken if we do not do something about inflation. There is no pay deal. Let us forget that fiction. Do we think that Intel, which has supposedly created 1,000 jobs, on which we have attempted to piggyback already today, is going to take any notice of the pay deal or the PPF? It could not care less.</P>
      <P>When Senator Finneran parrots the Fianna Fáil line, as we expect, saying that social partnership is responsible for our great economic success, where does that leave the multinationals? They have not given two hoots about social partnership from beginning to end. Does anyone know how Intel will get the 1,000 workers it needs? It will get them partly by offering perks to employees, but if necessary &ndash; and it will be necessary &ndash; Intel will pay 15% to 25% more to people to come here. Where is the pay deal? There will not be a whisper from the Government, the Opposition, the IDA or anyone else about breaches of the guidelines because Intel is involved. The pay deal does not exist. It is a fiction that exists between the Government and the unions playing tic-tac with each other in keeping the figure at 5.5% this year. We all know that, including the unions.</P>
      <P>The pay deal was broken in its first week by the bus drivers, while the ASTI withdrew from it before it was born. It will continue to be broken by those who say the way to get increases of over 5.5% is through benchmarking and productivity. That is a little dodge, but I can see now that the process for benchmarking and productivity will be accelerated &ndash; wait and see. What does it mean? It means wage increases and that the pay deal is a fiction; it is a line in the sand that anyone can cross. We will go on for the next 33 months saying the pay deal is in danger and there will not be a sinner in the country with as little as 5.5% except a few mugs like me in the NUJ. The NUJ signed up early to the pay deal, condemning a lot of us to 5.5% for a few years. We are mugs. I do not mind particularly as I have other sources of revenue, such as a salary from this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very few people will abide by this pay deal, yet it is a wonderful flag for the Government and unions to wave, as they can say that they must abide by 5.5%. That has not happened and will not happen. The Government and the unions will do what ICTU wants them to do in this case. Why did the Minister say today that the Government is concerned by the high rate and shares the concerns of ICTU, IBEC and others? I am sick and <Col N="1554" /> tired of this sharing of ICTU's concerns. The Minister went on to list the ICTU agenda, but we should wait to hear what Senator O'Toole wants, as it will be in next week's package.</P>

      <P>When we talk about inflation being 5.5%, what we hear is, &ldquo;Don't worry lads, we got a tax package in December so you are beating inflation.&rdquo;  That tax package was in people's pockets long ago and was supposedly nothing to do with ICTU. It was supposedly the budget, not negotiated by ICTU, but a spontaneous response from the Government to the needs of the people. It was not, of course &ndash; it was negotiated by the two big pillars of Irish society, ICTU and IBEC, though with less involvement from IBEC, and then presented as a Government package. It is noticeable that the Minister referred to ICTU and consultation and what ICTU wants while mentioning IBEC in passing, but he knows that IBEC, as it always does, will roll over. The measures being introduced will be measures IBEC does not want, but it will roll over and accept them for the sake of the pay deal as short-term measures. That is what we are about to see &ndash; short-term measures that will not work. The measures mentioned by the Minister, the unions and today's newspapers will not work.</P>
      <P>One of the best descriptions of those measures was given by Mr. Danny McCoy of the ESRI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I may need an extension of my time if there are any more foul tackles. Mr. McCoy said, &ldquo;These measures are just messing with the thermometer, not easing the overheating in the room.&rdquo;  That is the whole point. Next week we will have a lot of measures designed specifically to bring down the monthly figures. It is not very difficult and can be done by cutting the price of drink and subsidising transport. That is what will be done and it will bring down the figures for a month or two, but anyone with any nous or experience of the economy knows, as Mr. McCoy says, price controls can keep a lid on prices for a short while, but they will then burst out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to create trouble for ourselves <Col N="1555" /> down the road. This knee-jerk reaction to inflation is designed to get Senator O'Toole and Peter Cassells off the Government's back for a month or two so that they can go back to their members and fool them into believing they have a great deal. The fact is that Senator O'Toole and his friends were suckered into accepting 5.5% when inflation will run ahead of that. That is not a great deal. They did not know at the time, which makes it worse, but if they did not know what inflation was at the time, why did they not include indexation? They have delivered nothing to their members with this deal and now they are coming back to try to rewrite the rules. That is how the country is run &ndash; the rules will be rewritten for them temporarily, but we will have more problems with the budget in December and further down the line, when they want more and more.</P>
    <P>Their members will sooner or later see this deal for what it is, a contrived, artificial deal to keep trade union leaders in good jobs and to keep the Government in power. It is not in the interests of any members of these unions. If they had free collective bargaining they would have better deals and those who work hard would get a lot of money, while those who did not would get very little money. Instead we have the pay deals so beloved of Senator Finneran which give flat increases across the board. Those days are over in reality. We are paying lip service to a deal involving 5.5% over 33 months, but it is irrelevant. Most pay deals will ignore it and it will hardly apply in the private sector at all.</P>
    <P>The response of the Government to this concern about inflation is inadequate. I noticed what they had to say about being disappointed and concerned but there is a problem here that the reasons being given by Government spokesmen and apologists for inflation ring true, to some extent. However, an even bigger problem is that there is very little that can be done about it because those reasons are partially external and partially the creation of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed the fall in the euro is the problem. Who took us into the euro? Now we are blaming it for all our problems. The reason we went into the euro was to keep inflation down. Now we are being told that the euro causes inflation. We, as a nation, went into the euro speculating that it would go up, or go up a little. We did not really think very much, we just went in. However, we cannot now say that the purpose of that decision was principally to keep down interest rates and inflation and then blame it for having the opposite effect. Were they wrong or were they just wrong about the direction in which the euro would go?</P>
    <P>I was alarmed by the statement by Senator Finneran who said everything was okay with the euro now and that it has started to go up. I thank him for the tributes he paid me for being a lone voice in warning about the euro &ndash; I did not. All I really said was that it was dangerous to assume the euro <Col N="1556" /> would be a strong currency, and I was probably right about that. Everybody else assumed it would be a strong currency and Government policy was based upon stability not only of the euro but of interest rates.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran is right that the euro is one of the reasons inflation is going up. He is right as well that there is very little we can do about that, but he and Government spokesmen are wrong to say continually &ndash; I have heard this said in the House so often &ndash; not to worry, the euro will go up and we will all be okay. That is not true. It might or might not go up &ndash; nobody knows. It is, however, an extraordinary way to base Government policy.</P>
    <P>The second reason given by the Minister for inflation was the old chestnut of oil prices. I do not quite understand why this is always given as a reason for inflation. He is right, of course, but our problem is not the rate of inflation but the difference between our rate of inflation at 5.2% and the European average of 2% or 1.9%. They import oil as well and have the same problem, so it cannot be the reason for the difference. We should not hear that.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say &ndash; this was one of the most revealing points in his statement &ndash; that we have a problem, that it is imported inflation and that 50% of our trade is with the UK and the US. That is the first time in many years I have heard that coming from the Government. <i>Touché</i>&ndash; the Minister is right and that is the reason we should not have gone into the euro when we did. Now he is saying we were wrong about that as well. They never mentioned it at the time but now they are using it as an excuse. The euro is going to be the currency which takes all the blame for Ireland's economic woes from those who went charging in without seeing the dangers.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who say it is very difficult to do very much about it. It is like trying to unscramble an egg or to put an egg back in its shell from an omelette &ndash; it is not possible. The situation is not a hopeful one because what we have is an economy which is virtually out of control. The Government is now using words like &ldquo;concern&rdquo; and &ldquo;disappointment&rdquo; which are, I suppose, euphemisms for panic. It is using words like &ldquo;overheating&rdquo; which it did not use some months ago and which is a euphemism for a blazing furnace, an economy that is out of control. The Government does not give much hope on this issue.</P>
    <P>We have to ask a couple of very fundamental questions about the economy which is overheating. Senator Quinn was the first to spot inflation as a real danger many months ago. Is growth at this particular rate a good thing? Should we be thinking the unthinkable and saying growth has got to be kept at a certain level? We read reports from brokers, the ESRI, economists and everybody else which continually claim that growth of 10%, 11% and 12% is wonderful. There has to be an upper limit to growth because excessive growth is inflationary. I do not know where it is <Col N="1557" /> or where it should be, and I do not claim to know that. We have to question the benefits of growth.</P>
    <P>We also have to question &ndash; this is fundamental to some of the State agencies about which I do not have the time to make a coherent argument &ndash; whether the drive for job creation should now come into question. Should the IDA or what is now known as Enterprise Ireland be trying to create jobs as fast as possible? There is a real difficulty about the mantra that we &ldquo;created employment here, created employment there&rdquo;. What we are doing now is creating vacancies. Senator Finneran quite rightly pointed out that there are 50,000 or 60,000 vacancies. That is very dangerous.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is no longer the problem it was, although it is in certain areas and among certain people. Long-term unemployment now runs at 1.9%, which is negligible. The idea that economic policy should be based on growth and creating jobs is dangerous and questionable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to add my thoughts to this debate. I have been concerned about the way inflation has been rising for some months. A number of factors &ndash; the Minister has outlined the main ones &ndash; have caused the rise in inflation in recent months. Senator Ross is correct that what is important is not the absolute level of inflation, but the relationship between it and that of our competitors. It is important to bear that in mind. The rate of 5.2% compared with 2% in the rest of Europe is very worrying and we must do whatever we can to reverse it.</P>
      <P>The situation in which the Government finds itself is that it has to look at the options to see how that can be done. A number of things can be done but the effects of these have to be assessed in terms of the continued competitiveness of the economy and the effect on the workforce.</P>
      <P>The demands of some people for huge profits are contributing enormously to inflation in an indirect way. The price of drink is one factor of which we are all aware. It has come to my notice in the last week that blocklayers in the building trade are looking for as much as £500 a day. This type of situation may be sustainable on a given job, but is economically unsustainable over a longer period. We have to cap such practices.</P>
      <P>Part of the reason for the rise in inflation is the great economic success of recent years which has raised everyone's expectations. Many people feel that one must make hay while the sun shines. However, occasional rain is necessary to ensure next year's crop. This is an opportunity for such a shower or rain to allow us think, simmer down and face the problem in a coherent manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of oil has played a significant role in the increase in inflation and accounts for about 3% of the rate. We have no control over the price of oil and Senator Ross stated that the fact that other EU countries also import oil means we cannot take it into consideration as one of the contributing factors. However, the Senator forgot to <Col N="1558" /> mention that Ireland is more dependent on oil than the rest of Europe and that must be factored into the situation. We can play around with statistics to suit ourselves but it is important to deal with real facts and face up to the difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Government could introduce a number of measures to deal with the problem. One such measure would be a reduction in VAT. A 1% cut in the standard rate of VAT from 21% to 20% would take about 0.4% off the consumer price index. A 2% cut would obviously reduce it by 0.8% and would bring us into line with the rest of the EU. This is worth considering. This assumes that the full impact of price reductions are passed on to consumers but that is a difficult assumption in a buoyant economy. The gross cost to the Exchequer of reducing VAT by 2% would be about £200 million so we must consider these options as we are talking about a lot of money. The economy is buoyant and Exchequer returns are very good, however, we must think matters through properly.</P>
    <P>The increase in excise duty on tobacco introduced in the last budget has contributed 0.88% to the rate of inflation. The Minister pointed out that this is a significant increase. The difference between the European average rate of inflation and the Irish rate is 3%, so removing the increase in excise duty on tobacco would take away a quarter of that difference. I am not sure it is the right thing to do as the effect of tobacco on the CPI would disappear by the end of December. The measure was introduced as a health measure and not a means of raising Exchequer revenue.</P>
    <P>The large increase in the price of oil over the past year must also be taken into account. A cut of 5p per litre in excise duty on petrol would reduce the CPI by 0.3%, the maximum cut allowed by the EU. When considering this option it is important that the saving, which would be about £95 million, would be passed on to consumers. Likewise, a 5p cut in the price of a pint of beer would reduce the CPI by 0.2%, but it would only have the desired effect if the saving is passed on to consumers &ndash; such a measure would cost about £45 million.</P>
    <P>These are some of the options open to the Government to address the problem, but it is particularly important to decide on our objectives. The Government has a number of objectives, one of which is to be seen to be doing something immediately to keep the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness on track. It is important that reductions in VAT and other duties are passed on to consumers. We do not want people profiteering from these measures, but that is a danger. It is important that these measures benefit all workers.</P>
    <P>Another objective must be to engineer a real decrease in the CPI as quickly as possible, in which case cuts in indirect taxes would seem the best option. We must also make the economy more competitive by a range of measures to identify areas where very generous margins are being <Col N="1559" /> earned, such as in the brewing industry. We must promote real competition in these areas.</P>
    <P>These are longer-term measures. Senator Ross said we do not want to introduce measures which will provide a degree of window dressing in the short-term. We must implement measures which keep the economy competitive and that must be our first and most important objective. These measures must last and must be passed down the system to consumers.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the announcement of the Government's measures next week. Social partnership has been one of the primary reasons the economy is doing so well and that so many more people are working today compared to ten years ago. We must maintain social partnership but introduce measures which will see that partnership and the economy continue to perform as they have been doing.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Senators may have wished to have the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in the House but we are quite happy to have any Minister present for this debate. I would have welcomed the Minister for Finance to the House for one reason. During the week he said that Governments sometimes have to take unpopular decisions, and that is what we will have to do if we are to encourage competition. We will have to face up to the howls of protest from vested interests who will be unhappy with steps taken to encourage competition. I was impressed by the contributions of Members. Senators Finneran and Gibbons talked about encouraging competition. I have said before that the job of the telecommunications regulator should not just be to ensure fairness but also to spur, encourage and create competition. That is why I suggested the Government should take that role back into its own hands instead of having an independent regulator. This would not just be to encourage fairness but to encourage competition, and the Government should grab hold of the opportunity to encourage competition in many other areas.</P>
      <P>For example, regulations on taxis should be abolished so that anyone could operate a taxi if he or she put up a disc and passed the safety test. That would introduce competition in the taxi business. Senator Doyle will get annoyed when I say this would be a better option than Dublin Corporation's reaction of suggesting it will solve the problem by appointing wardens to control queues and putting roofs over them so that people do not get wet while waiting 45 minutes, two and a half hours or whatever. The creation of competition in public transport would mean lower prices immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Gibbons mentioned alcohol, which is one of the biggest contributors to inflation. I was surprised to read we are the second largest consumer of beer in Europe &ndash; the Czech Republic is the largest. It is clear that increases in the price <Col N="1560" /> of alcohol were a major factor in the recent consumer price index.</P>
    <P>A group of supermarkets &ndash; I have no vested interest in this &ndash; is proposing that outlets with wine licences should be allowed sell beer produced in Ireland. They are not permitted to sell Irish-made products. The Government decided in the recent Intoxicating Liquor Bill not to allow outlets with wine licences to sell beer because it is an Irish product. If this happened, there would be immediate competition and people might be tempted to drink at home rather than in the pub. The Government should do something about this in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. I know the Leas-Chathaoirleach would not encourage anybody to drink beer. Even at this late stage, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill should be changed to allow more freedom for competition in this area.</P>
    <P>I have a vested interest in the repeal of the groceries order. There will be howls of protest from manufacturers saying the grocers will bully them. There will be howls of protest from the grocers who will say the supermarkets will bully them. There will be howls of protest from everybody, but we must face up to this if we are to do something about inflation. We must encourage competition. The groceries order does not only state that one must not sell below cost, it states one must not sell below invoice price which means one could sell at a lower price which would not be below cost. Any grocer opening or renovating a shop cannot ask for a discount or lower price because that would be wrong. However, the law cannot be enforced against companies based in Britain, Germany or the United States &ndash; where one large company has threatened to relocate. We must face up to this.</P>
    <P>The repeal of the groceries order would encourage grocers to compete on price rather than other areas. They do not always compete on price and place large advertisements in the newspapers instead. That is not in the interests of the public. If we are to face up to inflation we must take unpopular decisions, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said that Governments must sometimes do.</P>
    <P>I will not mention the past, unlike almost every other speaker. I will discuss the two dangers facing us, inflation and the overheating of the economy. If we look back, it should only be to ensure we learn from our mistakes. Senators Gibbons and Ross spoke about measuring inflation on the basis of the CPI. We should not tamper with the map and believe we are changing the territory. Senator Ross referred to the ESRI and said that we should not believe that by tampering with the thermometer we are changing the heat in the room. We could play with the CPI and get it down but tampering with it does not do any good. Creating lasting competition is one solution.</P>
    <P>The other solution was mentioned by Senator Ross, that we should question whether growth for all is the most important element. What is the origin of that thinking? From the 1920s to the 1980s our objective was the creation of jobs. We <Col N="1561" /> decided that we had to promote growth to create jobs. However, we are now in a situation where we must question if we want growth. I am not sure if I want growth. An article in one of today's newspapers suggests that people commute from Castlecomer, Gorey, Dundalk and so on to Dublin. However, another article points out the problems this creates for the roads and proposes that the solution is high rise buildings in Dublin for those who want to live close to work. Do we really believe high rise buildings or more roads are the solution? Questioning growth should be high on our agenda. We must ask if we are certain this is the direction we should be taking.</P>
    <P>We should be questioning some of these solutions. However, it is more important to ensure that the steps taken by the Government do not overheat the economy. I am concerned about most of the proposals. If they manage to bring down the consumer price index, it will create an overheated economy which will result in many more problems.</P>
    <P>I love the way we complain about the problems we have with the euro. The euro has brought us a great deal of success, although I know Senator Ross does not agree. We have a thriving economy and more jobs than we ever had before. There have been huge benefits from many of the steps taken in the past ten years. We must not assume that because the value of the euro is causing a problem with inflation, there is nothing we can do about it.</P>
    <P>I know there is nothing we can do about interest rates. How can we gain control of the economy and avoid overheating if we do not have control over interest rates? Almost every suggestion made here will result in the overheating of the economy. We can avoid this by finding other ways of taking purchasing power out of the economy. This is a worthwhile suggestion which I have not heard being made before. If people save money instead of spending it, it has the same effect as taking the money from them in taxes, and is more pleasant. Saving money is not attractive because of the low interest rates and people are not doing it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. Given what has happened to the Eircom share price, investment in the stock market is not a guaranteed winner and is unlikely to be an attractive option for many people. However, there are ways for the Government to make saving more attractive, including lower taxation on savings. However, if we are to grasp this nettle and get the overheated economy under control, we should consider a compulsory savings scheme, where a proportion of earnings would not be taken in taxes but put into a savings account for a minimum period. The money would still belong to the people but they could not spend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot increase interest rates and we do not want higher taxes, so if we want to control <Col N="1562" /> inflation compulsory savings may be the only way to take purchasing power out of the economy. Almost every other suggestion made here and in the newspapers is a sticking plaster and not long-term. They are in danger of reducing figures by tampering with the CPI. Encouraging saving or making it compulsory would take money out of the economy. It would still belong to the people but would have the benefit of not overheating the economy and combating inflation. I urge the Minister to give this some consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister also wants some time to reply, if we can manage that. I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>I am glad we are having this debate, for which we have been calling since Christmas. We are concerned on all sides of the House with rising inflation and the threat of overheating in the economy. When the Minister came to this House for the debate on the Appropriation Bill in December, he told us the inflation rate for 1999 was 1.6%. That was a wonderful backdrop to social partnership and to negotiating the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. However, I have always felt that new programme was to a considerable extent negotiated under false pretences in that there was already a very worrying underlying trend during the last couple of months of 1999 which was not represented in the context of anything that was said in this House by the Minister for Finance or any other Minister. The figure we were left with was 1.6%, a wonderful track record for 1999. By the time the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness was signed in March this year, inflation had risen to 3.9%. Now it has reached 5.2%.</P>
      <P>All we have heard from the Minister is the old mantra that although the rate of inflation will increase to 3% or 4% &ndash; he acknowledges that it is now over 5% &ndash; it will decline in the second half of the year. He has never told us what factors will ensure such a decline. All the prognoses are that inflation will continue to rise. There is no sign that it will decline, unless there is some form of intervention. The Minister for Finance has done nothing in the past six months other than repeat the mantra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade union movement is now putting pressure not just on the Minister for Finance but on the Taoiseach and on the Tánaiste, and now there must be a new approach, otherwise the 5% negotiated for the first year of the programme will be wiped out. I disagree with Senator Ross in relation to social partnership. I am a great believer in it as the way forward. It has a proven track record of delivery of jobs.  According the figures the Minister has given us, unemployment was over 16% in 1988. Social partnership came <Col N="1563" /> into existence in 1987. Now unemployment is at 4.5% or thereabouts.  That is a wonderful track record. Inflation has also come down over the years. The big danger now is that inflation will reverse or wipe out all the good that has been created by social partnership. Social partnership is not the problem, it has been very largely the cure, and I want to see it continue.</P>
    <P>Many factors have been mentioned. I will not go through them again except to say that there are external factors, namely the euro and oil prices, and internal factors such as tobacco and alcohol prices, mortgage interest rates and house prices that are feeding into inflation. I can anticipate the responses to that. I do not want to go through those responses in any great detail because I do not want to take up valuable time.</P>
    <P>I would like to concentrate for a moment on making suggestions about what went wrong and how it can be rectified. I blame the Minister for Finance. In three budgets he has done one thing &ndash; skewed tax breaks and wage increases in favour of those who already have good spending power. That is the kernel of the problem. Where is spending concentrated as a result of that? Broadly speaking, that spending goes out of the country. It goes on the cars that are congesting our city. The huge increase in the number of new cars purchased in the past couple of years means a huge increase in petrol consumption, and every gallon of that must be imported against a background of disproportionate exchange rates between the punt, the euro, the dollar, the yen and so on. We are losing out through the purchase of luxury goods by those who are already well off.</P>
    <P>This has a knock-on effect in relation also to other goods such as tobacco which is also totally imported. More tobacco is consumed, and more alcohol. There is also an increased demand for housing, to which I will refer in a moment. Senator Quinn suggested that we should perhaps reduce purchasing power. I would not agree with that. Purchasing power should be adjusted in favour those who do not have it at present, those who are poor, those who are in need of child care services, those who are on the minimum wage and those who are on low incomes. They will not be buying luxury consumer goods. We saw the figures from Barnardos and the OECD last week which indicated that a quarter of our children are still living in poverty. The Minister can put as much money as he likes into that area and not increase inflation. However, if he gives it to people who are already on high incomes, he will increase inflation because they will spend it on externally produced luxury goods. I hope the Minister will take that into consideration in preparing his budget for next year.</P>
    <P>The second area of major concern for me is the huge multinational sector which has created an unreal economy here. More than 50% of our manufacturing output is from the multinational sector. This sector has grown at an alarming rate. <Col N="1564" /> It is wonderful in terms of the tax it brings in, but it makes us very vulnerable. It also means that we very often have tax receipts which are not properly invoiced to our Exchequer because of our low tax rate. In a sense we have an artificial economy that is fuelled by multinationals and which could collapse at any time. We are in very great danger from that sector. I want to see a huge amount of extra resources put into shifting our economy towards the indigenous sector, enabling us to generate the manufacturing output which is currently being provided by the multinational sector because we are a suitable location.</P>
    <P>In the context of competition, also raised by Senator Quinn, we should immediately deregulate public house licences. Why should the licensed trade be different from others? Senator Quinn spoke about deregulating the taxi market, but the taxi market is not contributing to anti-competition to anything like the extent that public houses are. Prices are estimated to be 40% in excess of a fair price. There are not nearly enough public houses in urban areas. All we are doing in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill is providing for licences from rural areas to be used in an urban setting. We need to do far more than that.</P>
    <P>We have a housing monopoly, and that is the biggest area fuelling inflation. The price of houses is incredible. The CPI relates only to mortgage interest rates. The impact of housing in terms of skewing the market and creating inflation is huge. In Dublin there is a monopoly of eight developers who own 80% of the land, and they decide when zoned land will come into production. While the Minister said local authorities are not providing resources or servicing land, the problem as I see it is that developers are controlling access to and supply of land.</P>
    <P>On the question of employment, we must widen our scope in dealing with it. We have discussed the issue of asylum seekers, about 1,000 of whom arrive every month. In central Europe there are many people who would love to come into our labour market as economic refugees, as our citizens were in the past. We should be much more flexible regarding our labour market. We should not allow bottlenecks caused by lack of supply in the workforce. It would be very easy, with a degree of regulation and organisation, to provide a much greater labour pool than currently exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very perceptive opening comments which were spot on. It is amazing that Senator Ross can offer half solutions to problems. Inflation concerns all the social partners, and business, trade unions, the voluntary and community sector and the Government have a duty to come together to try to deal with it. It is too easy for people in both Houses to automatically blame the Government. I will blame the Government if it does not take appropriate action, but the PPF is predicated on three fundamental issues, namely, that economic growth be higher than 5.6% per year, that the <Col N="1565" /> budget surplus be maintained and that fiscal policy should ensure low inflation. We are way ahead of target on the first issue and are also way ahead of target and expectations on the second issue, with a possible surplus of £3 billion this year. However, things are twice as bad as expected on the third issue because people were expecting a rate of inflation between 2.5% and 3.5%. That is a disaster, but is not necessarily the end of the PPF which is structured in such a way as to cope with it. The programme is written precisely in terms of how to deal with problems. We are currently addressing those problems, which can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>There are immediate and longer term approaches to inflation. I do not disagree with the points made by Senators Ross and Quinn about the importance of taking medium-term action. However, there is an expectation among workers throughout the country in terms of the value of the increases they will receive this year. If inflation is maintained at the current level, the value for money they expected will be eroded by the time they receive their increases, which are mainly due on 1 October. That is an issue for those who had expectations, who voted for the programme and who are entitled to get value for money.</P>
      <P>I was appalled to hear Senator Ross talking about a wage free for all, where people would return to the old spiral of trade unions asking for increases in order to compensate for high inflation. If that happens, as it might, it will signal the end of the PPF. We were through all that in the 1980s when workers got one increase after another and finished up being about 7% worse off by the end of the decade in real terms than at the beginning. I do not want members of my union, other unions or families to have to again face that reality. If we reach the stage where we have to compensate for inflation by submitting wage claims, which might happen, the game will be over.</P>
      <P>In the meantime we must take stock of things. The most extraordinary proposal by Senator Ross was his suggestion that after suffering two years of pain, which resulted in the decrease in the value of the euro, we should leave the euro zone, hang our coat on sterling and start the pain all over again.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put on record that I told that to Senator O'Toole privately and that he said he was going to say it anyway. That is the most dishonest thing I have ever heard said in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross has been saying that all week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to examine a number of things in terms of the current rate of inflation. The <Col N="1566" /> increase in the price of alcohol accounts for 1.2% of the current rate of 5.2%. Therefore, if there was no increase the rate of inflation would be 4%. The same can be said of the cost of oil. Senator Ross asked why the increase in the price of oil does not impact on the rest of the euro zone. However, the increase has the same impact on other EU countries where it accounts for 0.6% of the rate of inflation. We can compensate by reducing the excise duty on oil in order to offset the increase. A prices order on drink and a reduction in the excise duty on oil would immediately reduce inflation from the current level of 5.2% to approximately 3.2%, bringing us back into the ball game.</P>
    <P>What effect would this have in the future? Rather than messing with the thermometer this would turn off the heat because by the end of the year other factors will have come into play. For example, almost 0.9% of inflation is caused by the increase in the price of tobacco, which will be factored out of the equation by December this year, immediately reducing the rate by 1%. Similarly, the increase in interest rates over the course of the year currently accounts for 0.6% of the rate of inflation. This will also be factored out by the end of the year, though there may be other marginal movements in interest rates but not to the extent we have seen recently.</P>
    <P>The euro has hardened from 89 cents to 95 cents or 96 cents, an improvement of about 6%.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an improvement of 3%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an improvement of approximately 6%, and this must also be taken into account.</P>
      <P>People say that putting money into the economy creates inflation. The flow chart is simple &ndash; there is growth in the economy with more money creating more demand and increased demand hiking up prices when not met by supply. How can we deal with this? Senator Quinn put forward one proposal which would work in textbook terms, namely, to take money out of the economy, not through taxation but through saving. No doubt that would work, but we are at an all time high in terms of the amount of money being saved by ordinary punters through investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Investments is what we are discussing. However, there is another way, although Senators Ross and Quinn may not be too keen on it. Taking money out of the economy does not mean taking a couple of pounds from the punters at the bottom of the line. We could also take it out in bulk to increase profits, corporation and capital gains tax, which would have precisely the <Col N="1567" /> same effect. I would like the Government to bring forward a package of measures&mdash;</P>

It is also important for the Government to do its own thing on this issue and not be swayed by people such as Senator Ross who have no solutions to offer and who stand here and take the easy option.</P>

His worst nightmare would be to be put around the table and asked, &ldquo;Well, Senator Ross, what would you like to do about this?&rdquo;  We can be assured of one thing, namely, that Senator Ross will have no solutions because it is much easier to speak here or to write in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and have a go at everybody in colourful and extraordinarily good prose, which I enjoy. I do not believe any of it, but I enjoy it &ndash; I am entertained rather than informed by it. I know what the tactics are and I hope he continues for a long time &ndash; he is filling a very good space in that sense.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the tragic developments in Sierra Leone and the deterioration in the situation there since the Seanad last considered the matter one year ago. Although the security situation is slightly improved, it remains nevertheless highly volatile. We continue to be deeply concerned about the crisis and are strongly supportive of the efforts of the UN peacekeeping forces to restore long-term peace and stability to the country. With our EU partners we have appealed to the international community to join in supporting a strategy in Sierra Leone which further stabilises the security situation and helps rebuild the country.</P>
      <P>The Government is particularly concerned about the humanitarian situation. As part of our ongoing bilateral support Ireland will continue to commit significant funds to the international humanitarian effort for the suffering people there. It is claimed that the civil war over the past decade has been responsible for the loss of over 50,000 lives, the internal displacement of between 1 million and 2 million people and the forcing of more than 500,000 people into exile. The war has also left tens of thousands maimed, largely at the hands of the rebel forces. In addition much of the social infrastructure of the country such as schools, hospitals, clinics and water supplies has been destroyed.</P>
      <P>Following the signature of the peace agreement in Lomé in July last year we called on all parties to adhere strictly to its terms in order to achieve a lasting peaceful resolution of a conflict that has imposed immense suffering on the people of Sierra Leone. In this respect we have emphasised that the accountability of individual perpetrators of grave human rights violations is important in ensuring a fair and equitable justice system and, ultimately, reconciliation and stability in the country.</P>
      <P>The peace process suffered a very serious setback in May as a result of the unprovoked armed attacks on UN peacekeepers, the detention of several hundred UN personnel and the destruction of several hundred disarmament and demobilisation camps by fighters of the Revolutionary United Front, RUF. Regrettably, those developments overshadowed the limited progress achieved in the implementation of the peace agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to these events some progress was being made in implementing the accord. A meeting of the National Commission on Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration in March was attended by the leaders of the main factions and the monitoring group from the Economic Community of West African States. At that meeting all faction leaders agreed to grant unhindered access to all parts of the country to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, the humanitarian community and the entire population, to <Col N="1569" /> relinquish the territory they occupied and to allow the Government to have full control over every part of the country. As a result of these efforts the number of checkpoints maintained by the factions had been reduced and the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone was able to deploy in new areas. All progress however has been, temporarily at least, brought to a standstill by RUF actions in May.</P>
    <P>EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation at the most recent General Affairs Council meeting ten days ago and reiterated deep concern about the continuing crisis. We have appealed to the international community to join the European Union in supporting a strategy which further stabilises the security situation, repels the rebels, restores the peace process and helps to rebuild Sierra Leone. In this context we welcomed the decision of the Government of Sierra Leone to put Foday Sankoh on trial. The European Union is willing to consider any requests from the Government of Sierra Leone for assistance on this issue.</P>
    <P>While President Taylor of Liberia played a helpful role in the release of UN detainees held by the RUF in Sierra Leone, we are very concerned that he failed to act to prevent arms and other supplies from reaching the RUF rebels in Sierra Leone from the territory of Liberia, that close links remain between those rebels and supporters in Liberia and that the illicit diamond trade continues through Liberia. We have called on Liberia to behave in a responsible and consistent way by contributing to a solution to the crisis in Sierra Leone. EU policy, including under the EU-ACP Lomé Convention, will take full account of Liberia's behaviour in regard to Sierra Leone.</P>
    <P>The Government is extremely concerned about violations of UN arms embargoes in conflicts in Africa, including Sierra Leone. Continuing supplies of arms from outside are fuelling such conflicts. In this respect the European Union has expressed its grave concern over the allegations of arms shipments that have helped the RUF to sustain military operations after the peace accord was concluded and called on all parties to refrain from any action that contributes to prolonging the conflict.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the role played by UN peacekeepers in Sierra Leone and the Security Council is re-examining the mandate of the mission. Recognising that a strong, effective and robust UN force is essential if lasting peace is to be achieved, the European Union has appealed to the international community to offer increased support for the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone. The number of peacekeepers deployed in the country is now 12,394 after the arrival this week of additional soldiers from Bangladesh. Current information is that there has been no change in the condition of the 21 UN detainees still held by the RUF at Pendembu, nor in the stand-off in Kailahun where 233 personnel remain surrounded by RUF forces. The UN mis<Col N="1570" /> sion is continuing to deliver rations to the soldiers at both locations. The European Union has agreed to consider urgently what practical support we might give in order to help the United Nations fulfil its mandate and strengthen its presence in Sierra Leone in coming weeks.</P>
    <P>A meeting between the United Nations Security Council and the political committee of the Economic Community of West African States in New York this week condemned the continued restrictions on the movement of UN personnel by Sierra Leone rebels. The group had just completed a visit to Sierra Leone where it met President Kabbah. Council members condemned the continued detention by the RUF of UN peacekeepers of the Indian contingent of the UN mission and the denial of freedom of movement to a large number of other UN staff in the east of the country. They demanded the immediate and unconditional release of all UN personnel detained or surrounded and recalled the mandate given by the heads of state and government of the Economic Community of West African States to the President of Liberia, to obtain the release of the remaining hostages, and called on all leaders in the region to ensure this was brought about speedily. The delegation from the Economic Community of West African States and the Security Council members agreed that those identified as responsible for flouting the terms of the peace agreement should be brought to justice.</P>
    <P>We have all been appalled by the horrendous violations of human rights in Sierra Leone. It is simply unacceptable that murder, mutilation, torture, abductions, rape and the use of child soldiers should take place anywhere in the world in the 21st century.</P>
    <P>At the recent 56th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, with our partners we called on all parties to implement the peace agreement speedily and step up efforts to implement the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programme. A resolution adopted by consensus at the meeting expressed grave concern at the continuing abuses of human rights and humanitarian law committed in Sierra Leone, generally with impunity, and the ongoing atrocities committed by the rebels. The Government of Sierra Leone, in co-operation with the international community, is asked to give priority attention to the special needs of women and children, especially those who have been mutilated, sexually abused, gravely traumatised and displaced in Sierra Leone.</P>
    <P>All but six of the Irish citizens known to have been in Sierra Leone have left or been evacuated from the country. Those remaining are the Honorary Consul-General and three other Irish citizens in Freetown and two clergymen in Kenema, some distance from the capital, all of whom are safe.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the Government remains very concerned about the humanitarian situation in Sierra Leone. With the peace agreement last year, it was hoped that the improving security sit<Col N="1571" /> uation would at last result in access by humanitarian agencies to the majority of war-affected civilians and a move from relief to recovery. The current deterioration in the security situation has seen a concomitant deterioration in the humanitarian situation. Humanitarian agencies have once again been forced to abandon or delay the implementation of their projects. Unhindered access to many parts of the country remains impossible. While there are huge food stocks there which should cover predicted food shortages, disbursing them remains problematic. Despite the obvious humanitarian needs facing the people of Sierra Leone, it remains difficult to address those needs until a political settlement is reached.</P>
    <P>Due to the continued instability, for the time being the focus of the international community's humanitarian assistance remains on providing for the immediate needs of the vulnerable and displaced, as well as providing support for Sierra Leonean refugees in camps in neighbouring countries. Since 1998, Ireland has allocated over £1 million pounds from the emergency aid and rehabilitation budgets alone for humanitarian projects in Sierra Leone. This funding has been allocated to the Irish humanitarian organisations, Concern and GOAL, and to the United Nations agencies which are trying to address the current needs. Already this year, £369,000 has been allocated to the International Committee of the Red Cross and GOAL.</P>
    <P>In addition, the European Union is providing support to Sierra Leone both by way of emergency assistance through the European Community Humanitarian Office and longer-term support programmes through the European Development Fund. The European Community Humanitarian Office has provided almost 19 million in emergency humanitarian assistance over the past twelve months. A further package of 12 million is currently being implemented. In December 1999, the European Development Fund management committee approved funding for an 8.9 million structural adjustment support programme aimed at assisting the Government of Sierra Leone in its post-conflict recovery reforms.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to commit significant funds to the international humanitarian effort for the suffering civilian population. When the situation improves and a secure and stable environment is established, Ireland Aid will start to look at providing increased funding for rehabilitation projects. I assure the House that Sierra Leone will remain a priority for Ireland's humanitarian assistance programme.</P>
    <P>The conflict in Sierra Leone is, unfortunately, one among a number of conflicts in Africa. At the European Council in Feira on Monday, we heard the President of South Africa, Mr. Mbeki, speaking about the problems in southern Africa. The Minster of State at my Department, Deputy O'Donnell, visited Ethiopia in May and a delegation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on <Col N="1572" /> Foreign Affairs, led by my predecessor, Deputy Andrews, has also just visited that country. It saw at first hand the devastating effects of conflict in that region.</P>
    <P>Recently, in Libya, I had discussions with my Libyan counterpart on the enormous challenges we face in Africa and the role that Europeans can play in addressing these issues. We will be pressing for active follow-up to the Africa-Europe summit which took place in Cairo earlier this year. We will also be supporting at the United Nations follow-up to the report of the Secretary General, Causes of Conflict and Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa. We are committed to tackling the root causes of the terrible conflicts which we are witnessing, including those that emanate from outside the African continent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this debate at such short notice. When I requested this debate it was not my intention to be critical of the Government. On the contrary, our track record has been very positive and I pay tribute to the work of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Andrews, in this area. I know he intended to visit Sierra Leone some time this year had he stayed on as Minister. Perhaps the Minister may find himself in a position to do so and see at first hand what is happening there.</P>
      <P>My request for this debate was prompted by the Irish Sierra Leone solidarity group. I recently attended a meeting of the group where I heard of the experiences of Irish people very recently returned from Sierra Leone. In some cases they had spent most of their lifetime working in that country and they had a huge commitment to it. The stories we were told that evening were harrowing. There was a sense of close to despair among some people and also of the sheer wastefulness and horror at what is happening.</P>
      <P>To date, out of a population of just over 4.5 million, 50,000 people have been killed, 100,000 have been mutilated and over two million, that is half the population, have been displaced. If the current peace movement fails there will be a further round of killings and mutilations and a massive humanitarian crisis.</P>
      <P>This crisis could have been, and still can be, prevented. The root cause of much of the present problem lies with Liberia. The Minister was diplomatic in his language about Liberia. I do not feel that need. President Taylor is a ruffian. He is responsible for much of what is happening in Sierra Leone today through the financing of the rebels, the protection and promotion of the illegal diamond trade, which provides the finance, and through his inability or unwillingness to help the UN to resolve this problem. I do not know if international pressure can mean anything, but the severing of international aid to Liberia for as long as President Taylor continues his present policy is being considered by the EU. I hope it will be supported by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In overall terms this is a problem for the UN. <Col N="1573" /> There is an international consensus about what needs to be done in Sierra Leone. Everybody is agreed on what ought to be done and who ought to be backed. Despite the figures I have cited, the scale of the problem is not huge by international standards, indeed it is manageable. Unfortunately, the UN got off to a very bad start, with very poorly equipped troops going in, some hardly trained at all, the best of them only moderately so. They were also very badly led. Unless the UN can get its act together in Sierra Leone &ndash; that is easier said than done &ndash; then we will not see an improvement. Worse, the UN, which has invested so much of its credibility in Sierra Leone, will lose it. That may have a very bad effect on the possibility of further UN intervention in southern Africa. The Minister has indicated how this will be needed.</P>
    <P>We have long been supporters of the UN and I urge the Minister &ndash; I know he is doing it &ndash; to see if it can devote even further resources, especially better trained troops, to Sierra Leone. A small number of British troops had more impact on restoring peace there than all of the UN groups acting together. Now we are faced with the withdrawal of the British and the possible withdrawal of many of the Nigerian troops from Sierra Leone. The prospect of those left seeking to restore order does not fill anybody with confidence. Some are still being held hostage by the rebels.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on this subject previously, I mentioned the strong ties which bind certain groups in this country with Sierra Leone. I pay tribute to the people in the Department of Foreign Affairs who have been handling this issue. They have always treated solidarity groups with the greatest courtesy, help and commitment.</P>
    <P>We could probably do more in terms of the provision of bilateral aid, especially to rebuild Sierra Leone. Sadly that work cannot start until there is peace, but I would like to see Sierra Leone being upgraded on the Department's list of countries with whom we have a special bilateral relationship and perhaps that could be looked at. Until the situation becomes peaceful again there will be little chance of rebuilding Sierra Leone.</P>
    <P>There is one further point worth making and it has to do with the question of refugees. If peace and stability is not restored in Sierra Leone, the refugee problem will be horrendous and we will be faced with our share of the refugees. For the most part, the Sierra Leonean refugees who have come here have integrated well. They are courteous, nice people. They want to stay in their own country but if Sierra Leone is not made stable, the instability will flow into other countries, and not just Africa but Europe will find itself facing one of the greatest refugee problems in human history. Therefore, it is very much in the interests of the countries of the western world to do everything possible to help restore stability and peace in Sierra Leone and to play a constructive part in the rebuilding of that country. It is a small coun<Col N="1574" /> try and the job should be manageable. The resources needed are not huge, but first we must do what we can. Among the things we can do is put further pressure on those who control the illegal diamond trade, which is funding so much of the civil war in Sierra Leone, a war which has resulted in the most appalling mutilation, murder, torture and rape of any conflict in recent times.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Cowen, for his contribution. He covered the ground fully. His analysis of the situation is one with which all of us could agree. I hope conditions will improve in Sierra Leone in order that it can begin to rebuild itself and I would like to see Ireland playing an even more positive part in helping it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to the House. This is my first opportunity to compliment him publicly on his recent successes as Minister for Foreign Affairs, in particular, on his major success on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive. That is a major achievement of the Government.</P>
      <P>The people of my rural constituency, Longford-Roscommon, are extremely pleased with the Minister's completion of the deal on live exports to Libya. It is a welcome development which has been sought for many years. This is a welcome development for the farming community in my constituency and the people involved in the beef trade down through the years who have been the victims of the cartel of the factories, in the absence of a live trade which would have brought competition into the market.</P>
      <P>As expected, the Minister has started off well in this portfolio. He was successful in other Departments to date. His experience in those Departments and his ability to negotiate, both in the Labour portfolio and in other portfolios since, will stand him in good stead.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Manning for raising the issue of Sierra Leone. It is the second occasion in recent times that we have had an opportunity to discuss the disturbing situation in that distant land. It is harrowing for any person to watch the pictures on our television screens any night of the week, particularly those showing evidence of the mutilation of children and the human rights abuses perpetrated on the civilian community. It is harrowing for any person to witness those, even by looking at them on a television screen.</P>
      <P>Anything which can be done should be done to alleviate the enormous trauma inflicted, particularly on the civilian population of Sierra Leone. Like Senator Manning, I compliment and express my appreciation to Irish religious and lay people for their contribution over the years in support of the civilian population and human rights generally, and for their attempt to improve the lives of the inhabitants of that land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sierra Leone is a small country with a population of 4.5 million. It should be a peaceful place and people should be able to live in a calm environment, but unfortunately that is not case. The <Col N="1575" /> results of the civil war are catastrophic. As the Minister stated, 50,000 people have been killed and possibly between one million and two million people have been displaced, while many have been maimed and injured, which is terrible.</P>
    <P>All this is going on in a situation where international arms dealers are providing enormous shipments of weapons to the rebels. Often I wonder about this in terms of all the conflicts mentioned by the Minister on the continent of Africa and in other areas. If there were no arms dealers to profit from the trade in arms, I wonder would there be such a large number of conflicts. The nations of the western world and eastern Europe which have supplied arms to both sides in many cases, and in this case to the rebels of Sierra Leone, are the real perpetrators because they are supplying weapons of death. It is not a war in the normal sense where two armies fight or an army fights insurgents. In this case the population is being dehumanised. There are unbelievable atrocities being perpetrated on women, children and even babies. I saw a picture on the television the other night of a baby at its mother's breast whose hands had been chopped off. It is hard to believe that this type of atrocity can be perpetrated by one human being against another.</P>
    <P>While Ireland is a small nation in the European Union and on the world stage, its views are respected on account of its neutrality. No doubt the Minister will take on board what was said here today. We take comfort in what he said and in the Government's attempts to help the people of Sierra Leone in the situation in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>I know that Ireland contributed in the region of £350,000 in 1999 to humanitarian organisations and United Nation agencies which are trying to address the current problem, but I agree with Senator Manning that for some reason the UN seems to be running up <i>culs de sac</i> as far as Sierra Leone is concerned. It does not seem to have focused properly on how it should handle the situation. It seems to some extent as if it has adopted an <i>ad hoc</i> approach. I am not an expert in this area, but looking at it from a layman's point of view and trying to analyse what is happening, it seems extraordinary that the UN should find itself in some of the situations in which it has found itself there. The UN must refocus its efforts in Sierra Leone. If it is found lacking or does not address the problem, it does not augur well for conflicts which will arise or which are already taking place in other areas of the African continent and other places mentioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the leader of the Opposition has raised this subject for discussion. It is important that we speak on the matter and add our humble voice in support of the downtrodden people of Sierra Leone. I know the Minister will take a special interest in this and that he takes seriously the issue of Africa. If there is anyone with the enthusiasm to take it a step further, it is <Col N="1576" /> the Minister. It is a question of how we can progress bilateral relations with Sierra Leone, how we can afford an opportunity for placement of refugees or displaced persons from that country and how we can integrate further with the UN in its involvement with people there. As Senator Manning said, it depends on the ability of the UN to impose some type of reasonable peace there. For the agencies which I have no doubt the Minister and the people will support, both financially and with personnel, to operate there, there must be a better climate than exists at present.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for being present and, as the spokesperson for my party, we are pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this issue which has been raised by the leader of the Opposition, Senator Manning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for attending and for giving such a clear statement of the Government's position with regard to Sierra Leone. I compliment Senator Manning on having the foresight to raise this issue because it is an exceedingly important one. As Senator Finneran said, Sierra Leone is an area of which it is all too easy to lose sight. The Minister will know better than any of us that, in a busy schedule, these matters are always a question of prioritisation. We are vaguely aware of some kind of ongoing horror, but until it is registered clearly and vigorously in our minds, we tend to put it on the back burner. The classic example of this, as the House knows only too well, is East Timor. However, as far as I am concerned, this matter has been prioritised by a number of issues.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I received a handwritten letter four pages long from a woman in Sierra Leone who was writing on behalf of her sister and her sister's two children. She enclosed photographs. She had to write on behalf of her sister because, although her sister was an educated woman, both her hands had been amputated. There was no reason; it was just a type of bloodlust. The children had also lost limbs. I put it to one side &ndash; she was looking for direct cash to help the family &ndash; because I wanted to obtain the appropriate money draft from the bank to send over. I am ashamed to say that I have lost it. I know it is somewhere in the house and I intend to have a look for it this weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will do that partly because of this issue being raised here but also because, coincidentally, on Wednesday last I received a delegation from Sierra Leone in the interview room. The delegation consisted of three people who came at the instigation of Christian Aid. They were led by Ms Haja Mariatu Mahdi, who is a founding member of the Interreligous Council of Sierra Leone. She is a Muslim, a woman of great dignity and courage and President of the Federation of the Muslim Women's Association in Sierra Leone. The other delegates were the Reverend Llewellyn Rogers-Wright, who is an Anglican pastor and who has a number of significant positions in Sierra Leone, and the Reverend Tom Barnett, <Col N="1577" /> who is head of the evangelical Lutheran Church in Sierra Leone. They were mandated by their groups and by the Interreligious Council in Sierra Leone to approach the Government and I understand they had satisfactory meetings in Iveagh House where they made these representations. They have been mandated to represent the Interreligious Council in dealings not just with the Government but also with non-governmental organisations, church leaders and church organisations.</P>
    <P>What struck me was how extraordinarily civilised these people were and the degree to which there was real intercultural co-operation. There is a tragic situation in Africa whereby Muslims and Christians engage in bitter and murderous conflict. These people I met had a high level of sophistication and education and were able to tell the tragic story of a country rich in natural and human resources which has been fragmented by ongoing conflict. They were able to tell me that, 11 months after the peace agreement in July 1999, one third of the population was still displaced, either as refugees in neighbouring countries or as internally displaced persons.</P>
    <P>The northern part of the country and much of the eastern part still remains under rebel control. Civilians and UN peacekeepers have been attacked and kidnapped in these regions and the Minister made this clear. It is horrifying to think of United Nations personnel being herded together in camps and only being permitted food parcels and visits from UN officials. It is intolerable that an international organisation of this standing should be treated in such a manner. Revolution United Front commanders in the diamond mining areas have repeatedly turned back UN peacekeepers who have attempted to deploy there and people from these districts are becoming increasingly frustrated. Perhaps what is needed is a stronger mandate from the UN to the peacekeeping forces and a strengthening of the personnel there.</P>
    <P>I understand that the key issues for the people of Sierra Leone are the disarmament, mobilisation and reintegration of 45,000 combatants. That is not an easy logistical task. Many of these are children. It is essential to a lasting peace but there are many problems. There are barriers to reintegration. How can these people be brought back into their society? Some of them are children as young as seven. They have been sexually abused, fed alcohol and drugs and forced to commit atrocities against their own neighbours. It is a lot to ask communities to take back these people, even though they are obviously victims themselves. If a seven year old came into one of our houses and hacked to death or shot some of our people, albeit under the influence of alcohol or drugs or whatever, it would be very difficult to accept them as neighbours. That is a real challenge and it would be such in any society. A broken society such as Sierra Leone needs everything it can obtain.</P>
    <P>Both sides are using children to fight in the war. Thousands of children have been deliber<Col N="1578" /> ately and arbitrarily killed or have had their limbs cut off while others have been forced into the internal conflict. I wish to record two quotes from people to whom this happened. They are the testimony of victims:</P>
    <P>The combatants who abducted me [said a teenage girl who was raped] told me: &lsquo;You don't understand. This is the reason we go and capture you people. If you don't sleep with me today, I'll kill you'.</P>
    <P>That is an awful prospect for a teenage girl. A young boy said:</P>
    <P>When I was killing, I felt like it wasn't me doing these things. I had to because the rebels threatened to kill me.</P>
    <P>That was a 12 year old boy who had been kidnapped, threatened by the rebel forces and doubtless would have been killed if he had not done what he did. He was fed drugs and was out of his skull and did not know what he was doing. As he said himself, it was like watching someone else doing these appalling things.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of funding. I am glad Ireland has committed funding and I hope it will be increased as a result of this debate. It is essential that the international community continues to commit this level of funding, if not a higher level, to assist these initiatives. Immediate humanitarian assistance is also urgently required to meet the needs of thousands of internally displaced persons of whom it is estimated there are 1 million. It is estimated that there are 5,000 amputees in Freetown alone, and 2,500 lost or abandoned children. We need support in the initiatives regarding the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programme and immediate humanitarian assistance for the victims of violence.</P>
    <P>I found it ironical and troubling that while we were celebrating Bloomsday in Dublin on 16 June, Amnesty International was issuing a statement on the situation in Sierra Leone. This showed that very different experiences were occurring simultaneously with our joyful and peaceful celebrations here, although Leopold Bloom would have understood this well because when he was attacked in Barney Kiernan's pub on the afternoon of 16 June 1904, according to Joyce's imagination, he was asked if he was talking about the Jews in a very dismissive way. He said, no, that he was talking about injustice and what was happening today in that people were being sold into slavery and brutality. If this was true then and if Bloom had the imagination to see it, it was true ironically once again on the anniversary of Bloomsday.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International indicated that attacks on civilians were increasing as hostilities were intensifying on 16 June. It called upon efforts to be made to protect civilians who were very often the victims in this. Eye witness accounts described civilians fleeing from violence, being threatened with and subjected to physical violence as they attempted to pass RUF checkpoints on the road <Col N="1579" /> south towards the junction known as Mile 91, 145 kilometres from Freetown.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International reiterated that continuing abuses of human rights, including killings, rapes and abductions, are not covered by the amnesty provided in the peace agreement signed by the Government and the RUF in Lomé in July 1999. The human rights organisation has always maintained that the viability of the peace agreement was undermined from the outset &ndash; a point this House must accept &ndash; by providing a blanket amnesty for human rights abuses, including war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the eight year internal armed conflict. This is astonishing. War crimes and crimes against humanity normally do not have a time limit. It is horrifying that a year into this agreement we sowed the seeds of further problems by writing them off.</P>
    <P>There should be the establishment of an international commission of inquiry to investigate the human rights abuses which occurred during this period. According to Amnesty International, peace in Sierra Leone is predicated on ending impunity for the human rights abuses committed before and after the signing of the Lomé peace agreement. In its reviews of UNAMSIL's mandate the Security Council should provide a clearer mandate for the protection of human rights of civilians at all times. </P>
    <P>I found the Minister's speech to be comprehensive and helpful. I will refer to two points. The first is that the question of the illicit diamond trade must be addressed. We were treated to the notion of an ethical foreign policy when Mr. Robin Cook came into power but we have not <Col N="1580" /> seen much evidence of it. An interesting start could be made here because diamonds are being exploited on the international diamond market in this way to fuel economically the kind of war known in the trade as blood diamonds. There should be an internationally enforceable ban on trading in the shares of companies involved in this hideous trade. One example is the attempted stock market registration of such a company on the London stock exchange and we should act to indicate our strong disapproval. I hope the British Government will at last live up to its ethical commitments and prevent this trade not just in Sierra Leone. The wonderful humanitarian President, Robert Mugabe, whom I was criticised in this House for describing as a dictator, has proved me right because he is also involved in this trade in my native land in the Congo. It should be stopped there also.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to continuing supplies of arms from outside. That is a very useful and interesting statement but I would like further information. What countries are the sources of these arms? Would it be embarrassing for us to acknowledge that, perhaps, some of them are our colleagues in the European Union? The sooner we tear the mask away from these countries and say these so-called respectable civilised European countries, the fount of so much of our literature, music and architecture, are still continuing this bloody trade, the better. They should be embarrassed and shamed in public because the ordinary citizens in many of these countries do not realise the foundations of their prosperity are frequently soaked in blood.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 1.45 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 27 June 2000.</P>
