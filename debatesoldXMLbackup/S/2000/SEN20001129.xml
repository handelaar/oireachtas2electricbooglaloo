      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 2, Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill, 1998 &ndash; Second Stage, which is not to be taken before 3 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes and on which Senators may share time. Item No. 16, motion 27, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business will resume thereafter if not previously concluded. Business is to be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2. p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to begin by being contrary this Wednesday morning, but the Leader has indicated we are talking Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 1 today. Over and over again, Members of all sides of this House have said it is bad practice to go straight from Committee Stage to Report Stage. By doing that, we are indicating the Minister has come into the House with a closed mind, that the legislation will be rubber-stamped and no amendments will be taken. There should be an interval, preferably a couple of days, between the taking of Committee and Report Stages of a Bill. The Deputy Leader yesterday kindly agreed to a similar request from this side of the House regarding the Wildlife Bill, the Report Stage of which was correctly deferred. Deferring the taking of Report Stage of this Bill will not hinder the work of the House. We do not mind if the Remaining Stages of this Bill are taken next Tuesday, as dealing with them will not take long. As a matter of principle, I ask the Leader not to take Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 1 today. Otherwise the Order of Business is agreeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business yesterday I called for a debate on taxi services, but the time has come in this controversy for calmness all round. I am not sure a debate at this stage would be of help. <Col N="1050" /> It is time for people to go away and reflect, for the taxi men to reflect that intimidation will not work and for the rest of us to reflect on the fact that they may well have some legitimate grievances, that there are differences between the situation of taxi men in the capital and in other parts of the country. The time has come to take the heat out of this controversy in the hope of finding some resolution within the general framework laid down by the Government.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to a Supreme Court judgment yesterday, where Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness pointed out certain serious lacunae in matrimonial law. She called upon the Oireachtas to address the need to make the necessary changes. At a later stage, will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come into the House to address the points made by the Supreme Court yesterday, which feels there is an obligation on the Oireachtas to fill this gap?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support strongly the point made by Senator Manning about the Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 1. I draw the attention of the Leader to the fact that the Deputy Leader showed greater leadership and flexibility yesterday in dealing with a similar matter. We look forward to similar openness and responsiveness from the Leader today. This is a serious point. It creates agitation unnecessarily when Members feel they cannot contribute. We need an interval between the taking of Committee and Report Stages of the Bill. It is only a matter of ordering our business to allow that to happen. Will the Leader confirm that will be done?</P>
      <P>I repeat what I said last week, that the scenes on our streets yesterday give an extraordinarily poor image of our democracy. It is bad we should see television images of people breaking the law and immediately afterwards see their representatives walk into a meeting with the Government. For those of us who lead large organisations, who use the right to protest properly and correctly within this democracy, it is extraordinarily bad if the image goes out that people can break the law and then get to see a Minister. That gives the wrong impression. It makes it difficult for those who are members of an organisation or union who try to work within the existing structures and within the law. The law was broken yesterday. That is unacceptable. A democracy cannot do business with people who use violence to attain their ends. That is a simple, straightforward tenet of democracy.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Leader about an issue I raised previously. The current review of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness&mdash;</P>

      <P>Order, please. Has Senator O'Toole a brief question for the Leader? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1051" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the review of the programme, the Government agreed to improve maternity regulations and to increase paid maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks, which requires a change in legislation. I raised this issue yesterday and there may be a response on it today but we need to get that legislation moving as quickly as possible. I would also like it initiated in this House. It is a minor amendment to change the period from 14 to 18 weeks but it would be very welcome and would be supported by all parties. It would also give a clear impression that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is working well, despite the opposition of certain Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the comments of Senators Manning and O'Toole about taking all Stages of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill today. We have always stated that the principle of taking Committee and Report Stages at the same time is wrong because there needs to be an interim period to reflect on Committee Stage amendments, while often we request the Minister to reflect on amendments with a view to responding on Report Stage. A period of time is required by both sides to prepare for the next Stage.</P>
      <P>Regarding the taxi issue, we are the people with responsibility for introducing and passing legislation and, as such, the Government is responsible for ensuring the laws are obeyed. Clearly, if there are people in the taxi lobby who have broken the law the responsibility is then to ensure they are properly dealt with. There was a sufficient number of gardaí around yesterday to see anyone breaking the law and in that case the custodians of the law were there to deal with that matter. I agree with Senator Manning that this is now a time for reflection and cooling off. I have never accepted the principle of deregulation. It is wrong in any area.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot go into a detailed debate on these matters now. I allowed a lot of latitude to Senators yesterday. If I allow Senator Costello to go into such detail I will have to allow other Senators to do likewise and I am not prepared to do that on the Order of Business. I thought I was very fair to Senators yesterday in the amount of latitude I gave. More detail than would normally be acceptable was allowed in relation to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is under discussion and consultation at this time and that is the right way to proceed.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan and I have been raising the issue of the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, for some time. At least 18 months have passed since this Bill appeared on the Order Paper. It is a very desirable Bill as it enables network operators to open and use public roads for the establishment or maintenance of telecommunications infrastructure and provides for the sharing of telecommunications infrastructure. It gives power to local authorities to control the opening of roads and the manner in which the telecommunications industry will operate in a more co-ordinated fashion. That is absolutely essential as our roads are being dug up all over the place, which leads to congestion. The whole place is in &ldquo;chassis&rdquo; because of this. Will the Leader get confirmation that this Bill will be brought before the House? It would be of tremendous assistance in getting through the streets of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey our congratulations to RTE and Mr. Pat Butler, who presented the &ldquo;Léargas&rdquo; programme about Kilmichael last night. It is appropriate to acknowledge that programme and it is also appropriate that the truth about what brought this nation into being is told by RTE. That is why I commend Pat Butler on at least attempting to do that. One could not agree with parts of it, but be that as it may, it brought to national light a story that deserved to be told.</P>
      <P>I will not pay too much attention to what Professor Peter Hart had to say. I come from that part of the country and the people in that area know the story best. That was told last night and I commend Pat Butler on bringing out that part of the story. The people of west Cork were pleased enough with that programme. The story of the butchery and savagery of the auxiliaries was told last night &ndash; the torching of Cork and Crossbarry, which is in my parish. Maybe Pat Butler and RTE should take this further and tell the story of what happened around the country. We cannot deny the history of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, to take into consideration the Limerick <Col N="1053" /> taxi position. It is very different from Dublin and those people have a voice in relation to ongoing negotiations.</P>
      <P>As I have done for the past few weeks, I ask the Minister for Education and Science to talk to the teaching unions, otherwise we will have a contrary electorate. It is in the interests of children to have talks initiated by the Minister. I impress on the Leader the importance of bringing those messages to the two Ministers concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to make a statement, in consultation with FÁS, about the back to work allowance schemes. Such schemes are confusing the public. We need to be clear about what these schemes stand for, where they are going and whether they are market-oriented in terms of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business. The Leader's proposal to take all Stages of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill is completely unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Only Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>If only Committee Stage is being taken I will withdraw my amendment but the intention, apparently, is to take all Stages today. It is obvious that if, as Senator Manning said, this is the proposal, the House is being asked to rubber stamp the Bill, as the Minister has no intention of accepting amendments. It is a very important Bill and we should ensure it is taken seriously. It is complicated and will decide the fate of State pensions for at least 50 years. I ask the Leader to reconsider the matter and to take Committee Stage only. There should be no guillotine on Committee Stage either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move the following amendment to the Order of Business: &ldquo;That the Seanad adjourn after Committee Stage of the National Pensions <Col N="1054" /> Reserve Fund Bill, 2000, and take statements on industrial relations.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent weeks several Senators have called for a debate on BSE and the beef industry in general. The Leader gave a commitment last week that we would have that debate. When does he envisage that debate will take place?</P>
      <P>In view of the way the UN climate change conference ended last week in The Hague, it is appropriate that we examine our commitments in this regard. I ask the Leader to accommodate a debate in the near future and invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to the House to give us his views and outline the way we will reach the levels we have set for ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to promised and necessary legislation, the local government Bill. I raise the question this morning in view of what I read in the newspapers over the weekend, namely, that its appearance in the other House, where it is to be introduced, is not certain. There is great interest in the legislation in this House also. One Member of the Oireachtas who will have a pivotal role in relation to its passage stated: &ldquo;There is no way in the wide earthly world that I will accept the Bill in its present form.&rdquo;  Will the Leader let us know the current position in relation to that Bill?</P>
      <P>The other question concerns my old hobbyhorse, the international criminal court Bill, a ratification Bill of an international treaty which this country signed two and a half years ago. This is important legislation because it would eliminate impunity for those people who carry out atrocities in the names of their states. It will establish in The Hague, on a permanent basis, an international criminal court to deal with these crimes. This country has to ratify that treaty in our domestic law in the same way as we have to ratify all the United Nations sponsored conventions. Has the Leader had discussions with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or his officials on the introduction of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of grave importance and urgency for the people who are directly affected by this problem. Senator O'Toole raised the matter yesterday and many other Senators have raised it over a number of months. The sub-committee has worked long and hard over a number of months and it has published a worthy <Col N="1055" /> report. I would like this House to have an opportunity for a full debate and a strong endorsement of the recommendations in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the amendment to the Order of Business by my colleague, Senator Ross, because it will give us an opportunity to comment on the taxi situation. I will make one remark on that. We have seen an extraordinary shift in attitudes regarding the fact that women and children were pushed to the front line by the taxi people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We ought to be careful about how hard we become because the same people in this House and outside it were correctly critical of the attitude of the Israeli authorities, but when it comes to our own doorstep, we are quick to say it is disgraceful and that they are using women and children as cannon-fodder. We should have the same attitude generally if it is a question of principle.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment on the rather gloating speech, which shocked and surprised me, of Senator Callanan on the subject of the Kilmichael ambush. I found it extremely offensive and it is a pity this House should rake up these Civil War issues. In west Cork during that period&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Is it the Leader's intention to draw to the attention of the relevant Minister the need to put in place a code of conduct or regulations to debar the use of children as cannon-fodder in the type of protests we saw yesterday? It is gross child abuse to expose very young children to the naked aggression that I saw on the streets of Dublin yesterday and it is an issue that must be addressed. I am asking the Leader of the House to seek to have it addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Cregan for a debate on the report on flooding on the River Shannon and the management of the river. That would be a useful exercise. Much of the time of this House has been taken up with that matter over the years and now that we have a report, we should debate it.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, the internal discussions taking place in the ESB to rationalise its local offices and shops. I understand the customer base is to be increased from approximately 10,000 to 35,000. That will result in the closure of ESB offices and shops in practically all our county towns. That is an anti-rural stance on the part of the ESB and it is not in line with Government or EU policy on regional development. I ask the Leader to call on the Minister and the ESB to abandon this proposal in the interests of providing a service to its customer base in our local towns and villages.</P>

      <P>The question of community employment schemes was raised by Senator Ormonde. I was shocked to discover that there is discrimination in the operation of community employment schemes in certain respects. Will the Leader prevail upon the Government, particularly the Tánaiste, to ensure that people are not treated differently and that all discriminatory codes are removed forthwith?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said about taxi drivers, the events that happened yesterday and what has been happening over recent weeks, but it is about time the authorities, both at Government and civic level, sat down for discussions. Will the Leader initiate a debate on the means of protest, to which everybody is entitled, in Dublin over recent years? There is no doubt that 50% <Col N="1057" /> of what happened on the streets yesterday had nothing to do with taxi drivers. No mention was made of the Socialist Party placards that were being held up. One lady with a Socialist Party banner in her hand was pictured attacking a garda. The slogans that were written on the hotel across the road and the damage that was done had nothing to do with taxis. It had more to do with extreme left wing politics and the politics of so-called republicanism. Dangerous elements are coming into the protest and this House should initiate a debate on the best way to allow people to protest in a manner in which they will achieve the most, while ensuring that the public will not witness the scenes that took place yesterday and the day before.</P>
      <P>An epidemic of AIDS and HIV has spread throughout the world, particularly to Russia, and Zambia and Lesotho are being decimated by the disease. We discussed the AIDS problem in the House previously but it is imperative that we have a debate in view of what is happening in Africa and Russia.</P>
      <P>I would like the House to acknowledge that today is International Day of Solidarity with the People of Palestine, a UN designated day.</P>

      <P>The importance of a debate on BSE cannot be overstated. I have called for such a debate for the past two weeks and the need for it becomes more urgent by the day. Consumers are concerned about this issue and it needs to be cleared up. A debate in this House would highlight many of the safety regulations in place and it is imperative that it take place as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Given the failure of the Minister for Education and Science to get involved in the teachers' dispute, it is important that a mediator be appointed. There are hardship cases and leaving certificate students are extremely worried about this dispute.

      <P>We should not flog ourselves into the position as if we were in the Tuileries about a week before the French Revolution. The Garda should review the handling of street dem<Col N="1058" /> onstrations and protests, as I am sure it will want to do. It is important that this is done in a way that does not inhibit protests. We should err slightly on the side of allowing protests and tolerating them rather than otherwise.</P>
      <P>I support the point made by Senator Manning and others that it will demean this House and take away from its dignity if there is no time between the Committee and Report Stages of the Bill. It suggests that the views of the House do not matter. It is not a good time to have a debate on industrial relations as a number of disputes are at a delicate stage and words can be picked and used to light a fire, which we are trying to keep down. When people are actively and earnestly trying to resolve these disputes they should be allowed get on with the job. For this reason, I ask the Leader of the House to meet Senator Ross to discuss the possibility of allowing time between the Committee and Report Stages. I ask Senator Ross to meet with the Leader to agree another issue those of us who do not want a debate on industrial relations can discuss in the interval.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning appealed for calm as regards the taxi drivers' dispute. Last week I raised the issue of access to Leinster House. I do not know if it applies only to me, but the Garda seem to hassle me more coming into the House than it hassles unruly demonstrators. I have been a Member of the House for a long time and I have never experienced hassle and intimidation to the same extent as I have in recent days. If people and groups who make civilised protests and demonstrations can be brought before the courts then the taxi drivers should also be brought before them for their unruly demonstrations and the hassle they have caused Members.</P>

    <P>Senator Costello referred to the telecommunications Bill. This Bill is not listed to be taken in the House before the Christmas recess. Before I came into the House Members asked when the Remaining Stages of the Wildlife Bill will be taken. They will be taken on Thursday, 7 December, with the permission of the House. I will pass Senator Callanan's views on last night's RTE programme to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senators Ormonde and Coghlan called on the Minister to intervene in the running of FÁS schemes. Everyone wants to see the good work under the schemes continuing, but there is a changing climate in employment and the training aspect needs to be encouraged. I agree with the comments made by Senators Ormonde and Coghlan and will pass them on to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senators Gibbons, Tom Hayes and Rory Kiely called for a debate on BSE. I agreed last week to allocate time for such a debate.

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;The establishment day for the purposes of this Act shall be 1 March, 2001.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is important legislation and I know the Minister is anxious to fix an establishment date as soon as possible because at present more than £5 billion is in the fund which earns very little interest. The commission will have to be appointed between the passing of the Bill and its establishment and it, in turn, will have to appoint the National Treasury Management Agency as manager of the fund. All types of problems could arise if a definite commencement date is not set down. It is important a date is fixed in a measure such as this and that is the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. Considering the amount of money involved in this fund and given that funding under temporary legislation has been allocated, it is appropriate that there is a determined date on which the fund will commence. I know it is the Minister's intention to progress matters as quickly as possible, but there should be a specific date for the commencement of this measure. It is a preferable way of doing business that the legislation would include all details on the type and management of the fund, the constitution of the commission and when the fund will commence. We know the date on which it will come to an end, which is 2055, but we do not know when exactly it will commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 provides that the establishment day will be decided by the Minister for Finance and appointed by ministerial order. The Government has already allocated over £4.8 billion to this new fund. These moneys are currently being managed by the National Treasury Management Agency in short-term deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be desirable to commence as soon as possible, as is the wish of the Minister for Finance, the process of transferring these moneys to longer-term investments consistent with the objectives of this fund. Obviously this cannot be done until the Bill is enacted and the national <Col N="1062" /> pensions reserve fund is legally and properly established. Therefore, it is intended to set the establishment date as soon as possible after the Bill's enactment. However, it must be recognised that some breathing space will be necessary to enable the manager, that is the NTMA, to finalise preparations for the setting up of the fund. This will have to be taken into account when setting the establishment date.</P>
    <P>It is preferred not to specify the proposed 1 March date in the legislation as that removes the possibility of setting up the fund on an earlier date. The sooner we set up the fund the better. Members should know that there was some discussion of this issue on Committee Stage in the Dáil. The possibility of providing that the establishment date should not be later than 1 March was also examined. This would still allow the Minister for Finance to proceed with the establishment at an earlier date if that proved feasible. On further reflection and after discussion between officials from the Department of Finance and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government it was decided and agreed not to proceed in this way. Establishing a cut-off date for establishment of the fund would mean that if for whatever reason, whether through a delay in the enactment of this Bill or due to some other delays subsequent to enactment, it was not possible to meet the establishment date a further amendment would be necessary in order to establish the fund and we would have to come back again into legislation. For these reasons it is advisable that we should allow the flexibility to the managers, that is the NTMA, to make a recommendation to the Minister and when all the details and structures are in position that he should sign the necessary order and allow the fund to commence.</P>
    <P>Consequently, on the advice available and the fact that we must operate to best practice, I regret that it would be inadvisable to accept this amendment and I am not able to do so.</P>

      <P>This section clearly sets out the functions of the commission. In section 6(1)(<i>e</i>) reads: &ldquo;To appoint investment managers to invest and manage portions of the Fund,&rdquo;. The functions are listed as far as section 6(4). Section 6(5) <Col N="1063" /> reads: &ldquo;The Commission shall perform all its functions through the Manager .&rdquo;. The commission has the functions mentioned between section 6(1) and (4) but it states in section 6(5) that all of the functions are performed through the manager. What functions have the commissioners?  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the question posed by Senator Doyle but I would go a bit further. As far as I can see we have a structure being set up which has the Minister for Finance at the top. He appoints the manager, who according to this Bill is the NTMA. The manager sits on top of this structure but does not appoint. In other words, he is in charge of the commission. I am open to correction on this because it is not clear to me from the Bill. The commission then appoints the fund manager. We have a four-tiered structure. I do not understand why we need a manager. Senator Doyle asked this question in another way.</P>
      <P>I can understand from this Bill what the commission does. What will the NTMA be doing? The commissioners will be the board of directors. They will direct a bureaucracy which is underneath them, having appointed other people to decide the investment policy. What will the manager or the NTMA do? There is a case for the NTMA to be released and removed from this process once the commissioners have been appointed.</P>
      <P>On top of this there will be, according to the Minister who was here last week, a large bureaucracy underneath the NTMA. What is the NTMA's role? It seems to me that the NTMA is being used or being put in a temporary capacity at present. This may not be a good thing. I do not know whether it will have a role after this structure is set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides that all functions, powers and responsibilities with regard to the fund, as set out in section 6(1) to (3) inclusive, are vested in the commission. All powers in relation to the fund reside in the commission.</P>
      <P>Section 21(1) states: &ldquo;The Commission shall appoint a manager of the Fund . to act as its agent in the performance of its functions under the Act.&rdquo;  The manager has no powers in his own right. He is merely the agent of the commission. In other words, the commission decides a policy and gives the instructions that the manager operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relationship between the commission and the manager is one where all of the powers and responsibilities belong to the commission. The manager will, as agent of the commission, act as their executive, in other words, like the Civil Service acts as the executive of Government. This is <Col N="1064" /> the bedrock of the relationship between the commission and the manager.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the commission and the manager is further dealt with in two sections which were the subject of debate on Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann, section 6(5) and (6). Section 6(5) requires that the commission must make use of its agent, the manager, in the performance of all of its functions with two stated exceptions. The section has been included in the Bill in the interest of proper corporate governance of the fund. The purpose of the section is to ensure that the commission does not, under any circumstances, attempt to set up a parallel executive to the manager, for instance, by hiring consultants on a semi-permanent basis and having consultants carry out executive functions for the commission. Were this to happen there would be confusion about the roles and responsibilities and management of the fund would suffer. The likelihood of this section ever having to be invoked may be remote but it is well to have it in this Bill to ensure absolute certainty. There is no doubt that the commission will act as trustees and policy managers and the manager will act as the operational manager of the fund.</P>
    <P>Section 6(6) allows the commission to delegate any of its function to the manager. The extent of delegation by the commission will be decided by it in the light <i>inter alia</i> of the requirement on it under section 6(4) which states: &ldquo;To exercise due care, skill, prudence and diligence, acting in the utmost good faith, in the discharge of its functions under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Should the commission choose to use section 6(6) the manager may have decision-making as well as the executive functions in relation to the areas delegated to him. Where the commission does not use this subsection to delegate its function to the manager, he will have to refer issues back to the commission for its decision. Delegation by the commission under section 6(6) is likely to require it to spell out and duly record the extent of the functions being delegated and the circumstances in which the manager should refer back them for decision.</P>
    <P>Where functions are so delegated the commission will remain responsible for the manner in which the manager executes his delegated powers. The chief executive of the manager will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for any actions or decisions taken by him under delegated authority from the commission. There is a direct line to the Oireachtas through the Committee of Public Accounts and there will be an opportunity to interview, question and get a response and reports from the chief executive of the manager.</P>
    <P>These sections provide a framework for the governance of the fund and it will be a matter for the commission to decide how these sections will operate in practice. This legislation is very struc<Col N="1065" /> tured and systematic and gives an absolute transparency to the evolution of the fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some clarification of the structure that has been outlined by the Minister. When we discussed this on Second Stage, my understanding was that the Minister for Finance said the first manager would be the NTMA. The definition of manager on page 6 of the Bill is &ldquo;the person appointed as manager of the Fund under <i>section 21</i>&rdquo;. So the definition of manager is a person, not a body. How do we equate the NTMA as a body with a person who is to be a manager?</P>
      <P>I am quite confused about the hierarchy of responsibility and how it will operate. Clearly, it would seem that if the first manager is to be the NTMA or its chief executive &ndash; it is not quite clear whether the definition is correct as it stands &ndash; its function will be to take some direction from the commission. Its function will also be to hire fund investment firms. I wonder how that will operate. What exactly will be the NTMA's role if it is going to contract out this function? Will it contract out consultancies or managements? Will it have an operational role and how will its direction come from the commission? In other words, if we are talking about a body that will have a figurehead commission, the NTMA may run the show in a sense, but it will not actually have a hands-on managerial role.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give some idea of what range of fund investment bodies he is talking about in the section, whereby fund investment managers will manage portions of the fund? Is it envisaged that part of the fund will not be dealt with by fund investment managers, but that part will be dealt with either by the commission or the NTMA?</P>

      <P>Who will appoint the fund managers? Will it be the commissioners or the NTMA? The appointment of fund mangers will be crucial to this substantial investment fund. There could be a conflict of interest if the commissioners' view differs from that of the NTMA's chief executive. Who will resolve that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators have posed many interesting questions. The Bill provides for the appointment of the National Treasury Management Agency to act as agent of the commission in managing this fund for an initial period of ten years. After this there will be an option, at five yearly intervals, for the commissioners to extend this arrangement further, or to appoint an alternative manager. In deciding to give this role to the National Treasury Management Agency, the Minister for Finance was strongly influenced by the fact that almost £5 billion will be entrusted to the commissioners once the fund is established. <Col N="1066" /> They will, therefore, need to have access to a fully functioning executive with the systems and expertise to manage such a large sum from day one. The NTMA has been managing the liability side of the State's balance sheet for over a decade. While asset management will require the agency to acquire some additional skills, it is far more sensible to have the NTMA manage the fund than to expect the commissioners to start from scratch and establish a second specialised agency to manage such a large amount of money, which I believe would be a waste of public money.</P>
      <P>The NTMA has a unique track record. It is a centre of excellence in fund management and in financial and fiscal policies in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not interrupt Senator Ross and I would ask him not to interrupt me. I read what he wrote last Sunday and I would not like to ask him for a reference as a result. All I can say is that the record is there. The ingenuity of the former Minister for Finance and former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in creating this structure has saved the State billions of pounds in managing our national debt. We have a reservoir of talent and expertise within the NTMA.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Doyle's question, when the Bill is enacted, the commissioners will make the decisions. There cannot and will not be a conflict of interest. The NTMA will make recommendations and the commissioners will take the decisions. Irrespective of whatever view the chief executive of the NTMA or any of his staff or agents hold, the commissioners will take the final, legally binding decisions which will become operable.</P>
      <P>Going back to Senator Costello's question, the NTMA may choose to manage this fund wholly itself, but we are giving it the flexibility to see where the opportunities are in international financial management and to decide what is prudent, positive and practical at a particular time. If the NTMA requires assistance from other people to act as agents for part of the fund or otherwise, it will have to make recommendations to the commissioners who will take the final decision based on their personal knowledge and expertise, the information available to them and what they believe is in the best interests of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his contribution on this section, although I disagree with virtually every word of it. It has been fashionable among Ministers to parrot out this line about the NTMA being extremely successful at what it does. I have never seen a coherent argument or evidence to justify that, but I know that successive Governments, particularly Ministers for Finance, always say it. Who are the NTMA's competitors? With whom are we comparing this <Col N="1067" /> staggering performance, as the Minister makes it out to be? The reality is that there is none. For the Minister to come into this House and say that the NTMA has saved the nation billions of pounds is absolute nonsense, because he cannot prove it. The only people who say that are those in the NTMA.</P>
      <P>Although he has not been privileged to be there, the Minister should know that every 31 December we have to put up with an NTMA statement that it saved so much money for the nation. The NTMA people usually have some tame Minister for Finance sitting beside them who is nodding, grinning and agreeing with this very complicated business because he does not understand what they are talking about. At the end of the day, they pat each other on the back and say, &ldquo;We've saved billions of the national debt,&rdquo; which is absolutely unprovable. One cannot prove what would have happened if the NTMA had done something else. I do not know whether the NTMA has been successful or unsuccessful, and neither does anybody else. Quite obviously, the NTMA could have saved a great deal more money, or lost it, if it had done other things.</P>
      <P>There is a benchmark, but the way in which it is selected is not properly independent. What happened to that benchmark when devaluation occurred in 1993? At that time the benchmark was suspended because the NTMA had the national debt in all the wrong currencies. What is the point in having benchmarks if, when one does not like the result of what one has done, one suddenly says, &ldquo;We are suspending the benchmark because of devaluation&ldquo;? The NTMA got it wrong. It should have wiped 10% off the benchmark and operated at 10% below it, but it was suspended instead. In the case of the NTMA, benchmarks are fictional. They are set by the agency but suspended when it does not want them. Yet Ministers come to the Seanad and say these guys are doing a great job. It is nonsense. Let us see the NTMA being compared to independent agencies which run national debts overseas.</P>

      <P>There is still a relationship between them and the manager is referred to in subsection (6). Let me continue in the same vein. The Minister of State also said that it was very strong on <Col N="1068" /> the liability side. That may or may not be true &ndash; we have already discussed the issue &ndash; but what we are dealing with is the assets side, not the liability side. The NTMA may or may not have been good at managing debt &ndash; the jury is still out on that issue &ndash; but what experience does it have of managing equities? There is no doubt that a large portion of the fund will be invested in equities, not bonds. It will be invested in ordinary stocks and shares &ndash; ordinary assets. This is not stated in the Bill, but that is my understanding of the principal target of these massive funds.</P>
      <P>What experience does the NTMA have of managing assets such as these? The Minister of State did not reply to my question. Why is this not being put out to tender internationally? It will be one of the biggest funds in the world. By 2055 God knows what size it will be &ndash; it will amount to billions of pounds.</P>
      <P>I want answers to these questions. The House should not have to put up with assertions about the NTMA which we are expected to believe without evidence.</P>

Nobody in the country would accept that statement. The Minister is anything but tame and is very well equipped to deal with financial matters. That point should be put to bed straight away.</P>
      <P>Everyone is entitled to a view on the merits of the NTMA or other international agency, but the Minister has decided that the body in question has a track record. It is generally accepted that it has done an excellent job, although Senator Ross is entitled to his view that it cannot be compared with other agencies. The Minister and the nation generally can see that the national debt has been very well managed with the result that the debt ratio is now the second lowest in Europe. Surely the agency must be doing something right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>From the available figures. I agree with the Senator that investing funds is a different kettle of fish from managing the national debt. Investing in equities requires <Col N="1069" /> different skills and abilities. Last week on Second Stage I referred to a survey conducted by Chase de Vere, independent advisers, which showed that of the 474 fund managers surveyed very few had beaten the index. That is the real issue. The commission and manager will have to secure the highest rate of interest on the funds invested in what is a very difficult climate. I was very pleased that the survey was referred to in the money supplement to the <i>Sunday Times </i> of 26 November 2000. It went further stating:</P>
      <P>Investors are being warned to ignore the spurious past performance statistics and marketing hype commonly used to promote funds. Every year fund managers heavily push fad funds which have typically offered very high returns, but only in a very short time when investors are lured in at the peak.</P>
      <P>It cited the technology market as an example. That is the difficulty we face. We have to be certain that the people concerned will have the necessary expertise to get the best return on the funds invested. That is the point we are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification on the definitions of &ldquo;manager&rdquo; and &ldquo;agency&rdquo;. It is stated in section 21 that on the establishment day the National Treasury Management Agency will be appointed as manager of the fund. &ldquo;Manager&rdquo; is defined to mean the person appointed as manager of the fund, while &ldquo;agency&rdquo; is defined to mean the National Treasury Management Agency. Are we to take it that a person will be disembodied and turned into a body corporate? I seek clarification on the terminology used.</P>
      <P>As Senators Ross and Joe Doyle said, there is a huge difference between the management of the national debt and the management of an investment fund. In the management of the national debt one is looking for the lowest interest rates available. In the management of an investment fund one is looking for the highest rates available.</P>
      <P>While I accept the propaganda that the NTMA has been successful and done a fantastic job &ndash; I have admired the results achieved each year when the national debt has been reduced by between £100 million and £200 million because of the excellent choices made by the agency &ndash; how has this been benchmarked? Where are the comparisons? As there has been no comparison, this cannot be determined. Clearly, it all up in the air. Are there any international comparisons which can be used in benchmarking the alleged success of the NTMA in reducing the national debt by securing preferential interest rates? Why, therefore, on the establishment day will it be appointed as manager for a period of ten years? That is a lengthy period during which there will, probably, be three or four Ministers for Finance&mdash;</P>

      <P>While it would be reasonable to start with a body with a track record in the general area such as the NTMA, given the enormous sums involved, it would not be appropriate to tie it down to one particular management agency for an entire decade. That is not to say that it will not do a wonderful job, but it seems that in not looking abroad we are almost buying a pig in a poke. Investment is anything but a science. As Senator Doyle said, investment fund managers seem to be securing much lower rates of return than if one placed one's money in the post office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to talk about what might happen if one invested in some of the new stocks and shares, which may well become the fad. Can one imagine what would have happened if the fund had been established two years ago when Eircom was floated? I will bet that massive amounts would have been invested in the company straight away. Would the Government have had no confidence in its own flotation? Given all the hype, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, would have been highly annoyed if the NTMA had not invested a considerable sum in Eircom. It would by now have gone down the tubes.</P>
      <P>What concerns me is that there is very little information available. There are few competitive standards to be examined and little benchmarking. We really do not know where we are going in this regard. I am more concerned about the duration of the appointment rather than the initial appointment of the NTMA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <P>This is an important section of the Bill, dealing with the appointment of the commission and its responsibility to appoint fund managers. Fund management is not a simple matter. If the return we receive on the investment of this pension fund is not greater than the rate of interest we pay on the national debt, it would be simpler to pay off the national debt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might tell the House the average rate of interest on the national debt. Whatever it is, the return on the pension fund must be at least one or two percentage points more or we will lose money. That is common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had answered some of the Senators' questions earlier. With regard to the national debt, the average rate of interest is approximately 5.5%. Senator Costello queried the manager being a person <i>vis-à-vis</i> a corporate body. That refers to the legal person and under the interpretation Acts it can be a human person or a corporate body. There must be a human to manage the body.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross referred to the NTMA as being judge and jury in relation to the determination of the debt management benchmark and the measurement of the agency's performance against that benchmark. This is grossly unfair to the agency and wide of the mark. The debt management benchmark is approved by the Department of Finance on advice from an independent firm of investment bankers and from the advisory committee of the NTMA. The agency has outstanding members who have remarkable track records in financial management, treasury management and so forth. Senator Ross will be aware of that. The members of the agency are appointed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the measurement process against the debt management benchmark is independently audited by a major firm of commercial auditors. The agency has done an outstanding job in managing the national debt and the basis on which its performance is evaluated is a matter of independent determination. There is a tendency to denigrate our operations. The agency has an outstanding track record of success. The model of the National Treasury Management Agency has been put into operation in Austria and Australia. Germany, the industrial power in the European Union, is currently examining it with a view to replicating it. We are equal to the best and better than most. We can be proud of the centre of excellence we have in the National Treasury Management Agency. Why should we spend large amounts of money handing the fund over to international firms when the State already has the capacity to manage it?</P>
      <P>Our level of indebtedness has fallen dramatically in recent years. The debt GDP ratio has fallen from 94% in 1990 to a projected 41.5% by the end of this year. Furthermore, the substantial budget surpluses run in 1999 and 2000 of £1.2 billion and approximately £2 billion respectively have been used to repay debt. The Minister for Finance is committed to reducing the debt. Given projected growth rates and continued budgetary surpluses, the current downward trend in both the debt GDP ratio and the absolute level of indebtedness is likely to accelerate over the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirements placed on Ireland as partici<Col N="1072" /> pants in EMU to avoid excessive deficits and to achieve a medium-term budgetary position close to balance or in surplus over the course of a normal economic cycle will effectively prevent the debt increasing over the longer term. Ireland is in position to commence pre-funding while also reducing the national debt and the consequent interest costs at a rapid rate. There is no conflict between the two strategies. Equities have historically outperformed bonds over most historic periods. Over the long-term holding period envisaged for this fund, equity type investments can be expected to give a higher return than the cost of debt.</P>
    <P>The appropriate equity bond mix will be a matter for the commissioners to determine in light of the likely pattern of drawdowns from the fund, in the same manner as the trustees of a pension fund will determine the appropriate mix in respect of their funds. This is a responsible task and it will be given to a responsible agency under the auspices of an outstanding commission. While it is a matter for the commissioners, the National Treasury Management Agency is unlikely to become active in management of equities initially. It is likely that such investment will be put out to tender, as Senator Ross suggests. It is expected that the agency will be more directly involved in both management and bond investment.</P>
    <P>It is important, given the track record and expertise of the agency, that it be allowed to move into this area of operations on behalf of Ireland to ensure the opportunities that exist and the liquidity in the economy can be maximised by Irish management in the best interests of our people. The Government and the Minister for Finance have the utmost confidence in the NTMA to do the job as well as the best and better than the rest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the NTMA in passing. It is not difficult at a time of historically low interest rates to reduce the cost of debt servicing. It would be extraordinary if it did not happen. The agency is involved with reducing debt servicing, not reducing the net national debt. We should not confuse this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NTMA has not reduced the national debt. It was set up to manage that debt and to reduce the cost of servicing it. The Minister is confusing the cost of servicing with the actual reduction of the debt as a percentage of GNP. He is correct that the national debt is being reduced as a percentage of GNP. He is also correct that Ireland is a star in the European firmament in that regard. Our percentage has continuously reduced. However, that is due to Government surplus, a matter for which this and the last Governments can claim enormous credit. It is due to sound economic and fiscal policy; it has nothing to do with the NTMA. The surplus goes to pay off the national debt but the NTMA's job is to reduce the cost of servicing that debt and, in that regard, it has benefited from low interest rates. There is <Col N="1073" /> a huge distinction there. The Minister was being a little modest about that&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have several fresh comments to add. The Minister introduced another element which is so dangerous and flawed that it must attract comment. He said that historically equities can be expected to give a better return than the 5.4% it costs to service the national debt. If the Minister of State can point to any equity market in the world where the yield is more than 5.4% on average, I will take a punt at it. On average, equities in the Irish, British or American markets do not yield more than 5.4%.</P>
      <P>If his argument is correct, the Minister of State is saying that we should not pay off the national debt but should use the money to invest in equities in order to garner big profits. Why does he not proceed to borrow many billions of pounds at a rate of 5.4% and give it to the NTMA to manage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will provide a simple answer to the Senator's question and that will be my final contribution on this issue. The Senator is stating that he wants Ireland to compete in the market with the private sector by borrowing funds to invest elsewhere. That is a matter for the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what you are doing already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The market rules. We are doing it already in terms of the national debt which we have a legal and political responsibility to man<Col N="1074" /> age. The agency responsible for managing that debt is doing an excellent job. We have removed the impediments and barriers and created a level playing field. In the past the State consistently borrowed money, interfered with the private sector, drove interest rates up and added to inflation. That is no longer the case. The playing field is now level and the market responds to the opportunities that arise. The State must exist in such a financial environment.</P>
      <P>We are asking the NTMA to do a particular job; we are giving it cash to manage in co-operation with a management team of commissioners who will act as trustees of a fund on behalf of the people of Ireland. That fund will meet liabilities we will incur after 2025 and, surely, one could not make a more forward-looking or positive decision on behalf of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is pure and undiluted waffle. I want the Minister of State to indicate why he will not borrow billions of pounds more and give it to the people to whom he refers so that they can make more money than is required to service the national debt.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>7.&ndash;The Freedom of Information Act, 1997 shall apply to the Commission.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In light of the previous discussion, this amendment assumes greater importance and resonance. The Freedom of Information Act should apply to the commission because people will want to know how it makes decisions and enunciates policy, how investment managers will be chosen and how it will operate its brief under section 6.</P>
      <P>The current mechanism used to extend the ambit of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, is incredibly bureaucratic, unwieldy and unnecessary. It would seem far more appropriate that when each new item of legislation is debated it should be decided whether it should come within the ambit of the Freedom of Information Act. At present, ministerial orders are all that is needed to decide whether a new body will be subject to the provision of the Act. Under the current procedure, a Bill comes before the Houses and is referred to the relevant committee which considers and returns it. There is no discussion on whether it should be subject to the provisions to which I refer. The process is terribly cumbersome and I do not know why matters are dealt with in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that, since 1997, each item of legislation should have been considered <Col N="1075" /> in terms of which of its provisions were appropriate to be covered by the Freedom of Information Act, rather than allowing a Minister to make an order to bring certain provisions under the ambit of that Act. The Houses of the Oireachtas should be responsible for making such decisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is extremely important because it involves a massive amount of taxpayers' money which will be salted away, in one form or another, from now until at least 2055 when it will be used to pay people's pensions. That money will be invested in various ways and citizens have a major interest in knowing how it will be invested. Those who will be pensioners when the moneys in the fund become payable will anticipate that it will make them comfortable in retirement. That is the intention behind the fund. Those of us who hope to live to pensionable age will be interested in how the fund will operate and the Freedom of Act should apply from the outset.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>However, as Senator Costello stated there are many who will benefit and who will be interested in the progress of the fund. It is only proper that the commission should come under the auspices of the Freedom of Information Act because people will then be able to obtain the information they require. This matter is particularly relevant in terms of the issues raised during the debate on section 6. It is important that members of the public should be aware of how the funds will be invested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Senator Joe Doyle that he will live a long time. Given the quantity of sustainable and resilient east Galway blood flowing through his veins, he could be around to see the fund grow and develop and, perhaps, benefit from it.</P>
      <P>The Freedom of Information Act, 1997, commenced for central Government and related public bodies on 21 April 1998. It was extended to health boards and local authorities six months later and to voluntary hospitals and certain publicly funded voluntary bodies providing services to people with an intellectual disability in October 1999. In December 1999 the Government decided to extend the Act incrementally, between May 2000 and no later than July 2001, to a range of other bodies in the enterprise, electricity, telecommunications regulation, cultural and broadcasting, universities, health services, environment and social services sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> The Freedom of Information Act will be extended incrementally across the wider public service as experience is gained in its application. Its application to this commission will be decided in the context of the extension of the Act generally. When drafting the Bill, room was made for the possible application of the Freedom of Information Act at a later date. I refer specifically to section 13 which prohibits the disclosure of confidential information on the fund by a commissioner, a member of the staff or the manager, a member of a committee, an investment manager or a custodian, consultant or adviser engaged by the commission, except where such disclosure is authorised by the commission and otherwise provided for by law. The latter exception caters, <i>inter alia</i>, for the requirement to disclose information in a court of law or where disclosure is required under some other statute, including the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>In any event, the Bill contains significant provisions to ensure transparency and accountability. These include section 25 which requires the chairperson of the commission to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts, section 26(3) which provides for the preparation of annual accounts to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and for the laying of such audited accounts by the Minister before the Houses of the Oireachtas, section 26(4) which requires the chief executive of the agency, as accounting officer for the fund, to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to give evidence on matters relating to the accounts; section 27(1) which requires the commission to make an annual report to the Minister for Finance of its activities, after which the report will again be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and section 27(4) which enables the Minister for Finance, from time to time, to have an examination carried out into various aspects of the operation of the fund.</P>
    <P>These provisions will ensure that detailed information regarding the management of the fund will be constantly in the public arena. As already stated, the question of making the commission subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act will be considered at a later date in the context of the general extension of that Act. It would, therefore, be unwise to proceed with the amendment at this point and, consequently, I do not propose to accept it.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State made a cogent argument in terms of the accountability of the commission, under the provisions of the Bill, to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Oireachtas. However, freedom of information involves making information accessible to the citizenry and deciding whether it is appropriate that information regarding the management of the fund should be available on a wider basis. The Minister said that material should not be dis<Col N="1077" /> closed except where provided for by law. However, no such disclosure is currently provided for other than to the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I was making a different point. Formulating legislation provides the best opportunity to explore the purpose of the legislation, the parameters within which we see it operating, the matters we regard as confidential or not confidential and the degree of accountability and disclosure. The time to do so is when the totality of the legislation is being debated rather than leaving it to the possibility of a ministerial order being introduced at some stage in the future. We will forget about the citizen's right to know once the legislation is passed.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is no guarantee that a ministerial order will be introduced. Even if it is, the Bill is creating a cumbersome procedure whereby a separate order will have to be introduced in both Houses every time something is to be disclosed to the public. Such orders have to be sent to a committee and then must go back to both Houses to be agreed. This is not the way to do business. The correct approach is to deal with this matter in the legislation. The Freedom of Information Act has been in place since 1997 and surely the best approach would be to state whether and where the Act will apply in terms of the disclosure of information. The Minister of State's reply was praiseworthy but does not answer my question.</P>

      <P>We are introducing a new Bill and creating a new structure under which funds will be managed for Ireland and the people of Ireland. The structure will evolve and grow. We must allow for the fact that the Government has decided to incrementally introduce the Freedom of Information Act to various sectors of the public service and this will happen in this case in due course. In the interim there is absolute accountability for every section of the structure, whether the commissioners, the chairperson, the NTMA or its chief executive, all of whom must appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. In addition, the Minister for Finance can obtain a report at any time and take appropriate decisions and Members of the Oireachtas, acting on behalf of the people, can raise matters under the instruments available to the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>These procedures provide ample opportunity to obtain necessary information at any time. We must not put the cart before the horse. The structure must be allowed to go forward. Only then will we be able to examine its performance to see if it can be included in a gamut of services to come under the remit of the Freedom of Information Act in line with the Government's incremental decisions on that legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (3), line 44, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;following consultation with such committee of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas as may be appointed in that behalf by resolution of either or both such Houses&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes that we do not leave the appointment of the commissioners to the discretion of the Minister for Finance but that such appointments be made following consultation with such committee of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas as may be appointed in that behalf by resolution of either or both Houses. Senator Ross tabled a similar amendment.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with a very important matter, both in terms of the amount of moneys involved and the future use of those moneys to pay pensions. We could benefit enormously from having a committee which would assist the Minister. The Bill stipulates certain sectors from which the appointments will be made, such as law, finance, investment, actuarial services, accountancy and so on. However, the recent proposed nomination to the European Investment Bank showed how big a mess the Minister for Finance can make of an appointment. In that case the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who will make the appointments under this legislation, chose someone over whom he was not able to stand in the final analysis and who had to withdraw from the nomination. In light of this, I am not sure the correct approach is to leave the Minister to his own devices when making appointments. It seems more appropriate that some assistance be given to the Minister so he can obtain the advice and support of a wider body of people. My amendment proposes that this body should be a committee of the Oireachtas. This would be a desirable, holistic approach to this matter considering what we are proposing to do in the interests of senior citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled my amendment for different reasons than Senator Costello even though we seem to have come to the same conclusion. I tabled a similar, later amendment which I intend to withdraw. I find it difficult to reconcile appointments to boards and agencies of this sort with the independence of those appointed. There are serious questions to be raised about political appointments, which these are, to State boards and agencies.</P>
      <P>I accept there are difficulties with asking Ministers of any Government to appoint people who are independent as, almost by definition, such appointees lose their independence once appointed by a Minister of a certain political hue. This may not apply in all cases but it does in some.</P>
      <P>My amendment seeks to protect this agency from abuse by Ministers of any political hue when making appointments. The Minister has protested innocence in this regard but there is overwhelming evidence of abuse by Ministers in appointing cronies to State agencies who do not have the necessary qualifications, or a veneer of such qualifications. The public is entitled to be protected from this sort of abuse.</P>
      <P>I will not go into specific cases, although I am not sure why I should not do so. However, every Member knows what I am talking about, namely, that people who serve political parties well are inevitably appointed to the boards of State bodies. This body will undoubtedly be another case in point if we do not do something about it.</P>
      <P>I accept that my second amendment is unfair and overly restrictive in that it bars a whole category of people. However, we have to embrace procedures which end this particular kind of political skulduggery. I do not know whether this body will be a semi-State body or agency but I presume it will be an agency. We must not allow this kind of abuse to continue without it being absolutely apparent who is being appointed and why they are being appointed and without such appointees being subjected to public questioning by an all-party committee. A large number of the people appointed to semi-State boards do not have the requisite qualifications and their first qualification is to the party and the Minister who appointed them. That is the danger.</P>
      <P>There is already £5 billion in this fund. I do not know what our GNP will be in years to come, but that fund will grow to be one of the largest funds in the world. It will have immense financial clout globally. This fund will be 1% of our GNP &ndash; it is not just a bit of old tax, it is a serious amount of money. If we do not appoint people to manage this fund who are responsible and immune from political pressure, it will be abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal reason I do not believe in this fund is that it is so large and in the years to come, perhaps 10 years' time &ndash; under the legislation it cannot be touched until 2025 &ndash; Ministers in <Col N="1080" /> times of hardship, which will arise, will be tempted and will probably put pressure&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. The Minister will put pressure on the commissioners whom they appointed to put some of this fund into their favourite projects. That is the danger in this fund. This will not be a semi-State body in decay, rather it will be a really powerful fund that will have influence all over the world through its financial clout. I would worry even more that the commissioners would agree to put some of this money into local projects that would affect constituencies. That has happened previously and it is not a particularly attractive part of our political culture or other political cultures throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Given the size of this fund, it is inevitable that in times of hardship Ministers will want to loot it and will want to direct the funds. The protection exists to stop them looting it, although legislation can be changed. There is no protection to stop them putting pressure on politically appointed cronies to put the money into certain areas. This appears to be a case where exactly that would happen. There is no need for it at the moment, as we are not a poor country, but there will be a need between now and 2025, the first day money can be taken out of the fund.</P>
      <P>I tabled this minimalist amendment to ensure that the public is aware there is all-party agreement and approval for these appointments and that the public is privy to them. This is not a semi-State plaything for various Governments. This is a serious fund and where it puts its money will have global implications.</P>

The statement that this fund could be looted by a Minister for Finance is incorrect, as a Minister cannot touch it for the next 25 years.</P>

      <P>To be fair to the Minster of State, he has made it clear that he will make a distinction between the type of person who will be appointed as a commissioner and people who have been appointed to semi-State bodies. He is committed to this fund. It is difficult to get people with the necessary experience who have a high reputation in society to serve on State boards, thereby ensuring they would not become political pawns, as we witnessed in recent times. I support these amendments, as it would be to the appointees' advantage to have their names put before a committee. When those names are passed by a committee, those individuals would not be seen as the Minister's nominees but as people who have been appointed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. There is merit in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. This is the most important section of the Bill. The success or otherwise of this new fund will depend on the quality of the people appointed commissioners, especially in the early stages. It goes without saying that the best possible people must be appointed.</P>
      <P>Matters have changed greatly here in recent years. I accept the Minister will want to appoint the best people, but he may end up being told who the best people are by his Civil Service advisers, acting in the best interests of the public and so forth, but perhaps not seeing all of the angles or the wider picture. From some recent committee hearings it emerged that Civil Service thinking can be blinkered, can omit points of view that might otherwise have been considered. The culture of our committee system is changing. Our committees are fair and their objectives are to get the best possible results in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am not sure which of these amend<Col N="1082" /> ments will be pressed, I support the proposal that the people to be appointed should appear before a committee to explain their views on how they would do the job. Such a committee could vet their qualifications. The commissioners, when appointed, would need to be very well remunerated. That is part of the new openness that exists. As Senator Doyle said, it is important that they would not be seen as the Minister's people or anybody's people, rather as people who were appointed after a full and open public process.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Ross will not push his other amendment proposing to bar a member of a political party from being a commissioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ross would make an excellent commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be at the top of my list, although it might overlap with his writing. I am glad he is withdrawing that amendment. It is wrong of him to keep making that point. There is nothing wrong with a member of a political party being a member of a commission. We all try to attract the best possible people into political parties. We try to get people of expertise and eminence to join parties, rub shoulders with ordinary party members and to be proud to be members of political parties. If we are saying to them that public service will require them to resign from a political party, that is not desirable.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross is a little unfair at times in his views of people who are appointed to State boards. Often a Minister will have a good insight into a person and a good view on his or her capabilities, having served with that person in politics. Many people who were political appointees will quickly turn on their Ministers if they consider they are doing something wrong. Because they are people of independence and achievement in their own walks of life, they join boards to serve not the Minister but the board and the State to the best of their ability.</P>
      <P>Of course people Senator Ross might describe as hacks and cronies have been appointed, but a Minister today would be very careful to appoint someone who is suitable, qualified and independent. The last area where the Government seems to be shirking this is in appointing judges, which is still a very closed process. The new judicial appointments commission does not seem to have made a great difference. I support the amendment because it would benefit the legislation and ultimately strengthen the position of those who are appointed as commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The main functions of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission are to control, manage and invest the assets of the fund. By vesting control and management of the fund in the commission, the Bill gives the commission full independence and responsibility in the management and operational decisions in connection <Col N="1083" /> with the fund. In view of the considerable discretionary authority and responsibility to be given to the commission, it is important to ensure that the persons selected to serve as commissions have the capability, judgment and stature to make a constructive contribution to the work of the commission.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, section 7(4) of the Bill requires the Minister for Finance to appoint persons on the basis of their experience and expertise at senior level in specified areas such as investment management, actuarial practice, the pensions industry, accountancy and auditing, trade union representation and other areas such as consumer protection and the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>As it stands, the Bill contains measures which will go a long way towards ensuring that only persons of the highest calibre may be appointed as commissioners. These amendments contain wider issues which would need to be considered in the context of ministerial appointments generally. To accept the principle that a Minister for Finance should consult an Oireachtas committee regarding the appointment of this commission raises the issue of whether Ministers should consult the Oireachtas before making appointments to boards, committees, bodies and councils generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a bad idea.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue must be considered on its own merits. If the Oireachtas were to decide that Ministers should consult it before making appointments generally, I would have no problem with such a requirement applying to appointments to this commission. However, I have difficulty with such a requirement being applied to the appointment of the commission as that could be interpreted as setting a precedent regarding other ministerial appointments.</P>
      <P>To strengthen this section the Minister for Finance brought forward an amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil accepting a suggestion by Deputy Noonan to remove a provision leaving the decision as to what constitutes substantial expertise in the Minister's opinion. Deputy Noonan suggested that deleting the provision would remove the possibility of the Minister for Finance appointing a patently unsuitable person, arguing that it was his or her opinion that the person possessed suitable qualifications. Therefore, as the Bill now stands the Minister will have to show objectively, on the basis of the curriculum vitae of the person he or she is appointing to the commission, that the person has the relevant qualifications to perform the functions of a commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also contains substantial measures to insulate the commissioners from political press<Col N="1084" /> ure and to ensure that, short of amending legislation, the fund cannot be raided by future Governments. First, there is the statutory minimum annual contribution of 1% of GNP and, second, there is a complete prohibition on drawdowns prior to 2025, as Senator Finneran said. Drawdowns after that date will be determined according to ministerial rules, which must provide that payments from the fund are calculated by reference to the projected increase in the numbers of persons over the age of 65 with a view to avoiding undue variations from year to year in the net Exchequer position. Furthermore, section 19 gives the commission an unambiguous commercial mandate when investing fund moneys. In the Dáil debate on the Bill the Minister rejected amendments which would qualify this commercial mandate and enable the fund to invest in other projects. He also rejected amendments which would allow him to give directions to the commission in certain circumstances, as this would disrupt the clear arm's length relationship between the Minister and the commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains detailed accountability and reporting arrangements with regard to the fund. Section 27 provides for a detailed annual report by the commission to the Minister for Finance and for the laying of this report before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Sections 25 and 26 provide for the appearance of the chairman of the commission and the chief executive of the manager, respectively, to come before the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Manning. Many Ministers have made appointments over the years. I have been involved with many appointments in nine Departments and 99.9% of those people served the State, often at great expense and inconvenience. They sacrificed their jobs and families to give professional advice to the State and for very little remuneration.</P>
    <P>The Constitution and our freedom as a nation have always given people the right to make decisions about joining a political movement, and that should not be a crime. People are allowed freedom of expression in whatever way they see fit within the law of the land. Why should it be a crime for people to be members of a political party if, by virtue of membership of that party, they are known to the Minister or Government as having the expertise for a job? Senators will know that when Governments change new Ministers have no option but to work with those appointed by the previous Government. That has worked well. Those of all political views &ndash; and some with no political views &ndash; have been appointed to boards, commissions and other bodies and have done an outstanding job, working well with the Ministers and Government of the day to serve the people. I pay tribute to those people who are prepared to come forward. We must be careful as politicians that our utterances <Col N="1085" /> do not discourage people from coming forward to serve the country. That is vital for future interaction between the people and the political system.</P>
    <P>Senators can be certain of the judgment, commitment and integrity of the Minister for Finance &ndash; similar to his predecessors &ndash; in taking into account the full qualifications, international or national, necessary for the senior management appointments he will make to the commission. These people will work for the commission for five years while holding down full-time jobs elsewhere. They will be giving of their time and expertise to serve the management of this fund in a proper manner. I am satisfied the Bill contains sufficient measures to ensure that the commission will be independent of the Government, will be seen as such and will be accountable to the Oireachtas. On that basis it is not possible to accept the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority are now. In the past everyone who came before the courts had to come through Mountjoy but that is no longer the case. They go to Limerick, Cork, Portlaoise, Castlerea or other prisons, so the vast majority of prisoners in Dublin are from Dublin. Yet the expertise of people from Kerry and other parts of the country is deemed to be appropriate for visiting committees. I do not want to go down that road because my point is the opposite.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the current Minister for Finance will not try to choose the best people. I have no doubt he will, but under this criterion it is entirely at the discretion of the Minister. He is not under obligation to consult anybody in relation to the appointment of the commission members other than determining that the members have substantial expertise in these nine different areas. The Minister has expertise in accountancy, but what does he know about the law, trade union representation or a variety of other areas?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is known for not being too worried about the advice he is given, as we know from his recent budgets. We had the credit union debacle, the individualisation issue in the last budget, which embarrassed so many backbenchers, and the European Investment Bank issue. That top financial position was in the gift of the Minister for Finance and the Government, yet the Minister ploughed ahead willy-nilly with the person he determined to be the best person for the job. His judgment may well be suspect and it is important, when we have so many people to select for such an important position, that there is somebody in the Oireachtas who would be more representative, with more ability and expertise across the board, to advise the Minister in his own interests and in the interests of the fund and the people.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the reason this amendment cannot be accepted and I would be concerned about what will happen in relation to the appointments. There is no compulsion on the Minister to refer to a single adviser in the Civil Service. There is nothing in the legislation to say that he has to do that. All he has to do is consider appointing people who, in his view, have acquired substantial expertise and experience at a senior level. How can any Minister for Finance know, in the broad range of expertise that is required under the terms of this section, that he has got the best person? That is my concern. I am not happy that the commission will be selected in this manner and it would seem appropriate that some thought would be given to these two amendments for Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the order of the House this morning the House will suspend until 2 p.m. Amendment No. 4 will be disposed of at 2 p.m.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Sitting suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 2 p.m.</i>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 not moved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (10), line 33, to delete the words &ldquo;2 consecutive terms&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one term&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a minor amendment which is related to previous amendments. It should be a principle that if people are to be appointed to the commission in the fashion outlined in the Bill, they should serve only one term. Otherwise, it might become the natural course of events for Ministers to reappoint commissioners as it does for them to reappoint politically appointed people to State boards. I do not understand why two consecutive terms of office are chosen as the limit and not three, four or five. We should set a principle in these appointments that people are appointed for one term only. We would not then have the invidious situation of political appointees of one party not being reappointed by politicians and Ministers of another party. They should be appointed once and that should be that. Will the Minister of State explain why it is necessary to appoint them twice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very good point. During the debate on the previous amendment I emphasised the considerable discretionary authority and responsibility being given to the commission and the importance of ensuring that persons selected to serve as commissioners have the capability, judgment and stature to make a constructive contribution to the work of the commission. That is what governs all appointments. The provision enabling commissioners to serve two terms strikes an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, continuity and ensuring the commission gains the maximum benefit from the experience of persons who make useful contributions to its work and, on the other, that the commission remains fresh and benefits from new thinking and ideas through the regular appointment of new commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an evolving situation. The NTMA and the commissioners are in place and the new fund will be in place. We ask people to give the best of their expertise and experience, be it international or national, to serve at this high level in advising on the management of these funds. When they have completed their terms, they will have brought together a reservoir of information <Col N="1089" /> and expertise which should be of major benefit to them in the second period. Why would we then dissipate that reservoir of experience and expertise rather than having it as an invaluable tool of advice for the manager in the management and execution of the funds? When we go for fresh thinking, the expertise will exist, the fund will grow and there will be reassurance and comfort for the future pensioners of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was deliberately brief in my opening remarks because I wanted to hear what the Minister of State had to say before I stated the main point of the amendment. The Minister of State has not answered the question. There is a logic, which I accept, to his saying that they will gain necessary experience. However, the logic, if followed through, is that they should be given a third term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator feels like it&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Minister of State will not do that. He will only give them two. There is an inconsistency and flaw in that. My principal objection is to the reappointment of people who are politically appointed. It is bad enough that they are politically appointed in the first place but once they are politically appointed for five years and they know they are subject to a review after five years, how will they behave during that period? The temptation and danger exists that to get themselves appointed a second time, they will behave and make decisions in a way acceptable to the Minister. That is the point.</P>
      <P>If the Minister of State is right in what he said, and I imagine he knows he is not, every rule of logic points to the fact that they should be appointed for a third and fourth term because they gain more experience and increase their fund of knowledge, as the Minister of State called it in that flowery language he used so beautifully. If they are not in their dotage, why not reappoint them every time because they will gain this vast experience and expertise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Some will probably be in their dotage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct. Some of them probably will, and it may be an advantage for them to be so in this case. The principle should exist that once people are politically appointed, they should not be subject to reappointment.</P>
      <P>One of the great strengths of judges is that they do not have to seek reappointment by Ministers and that is the characteristic which guarantees them the independence necessary for a position of this type. The flaw is that once a person is reappointed by a Minister for a job such as this, he or she will have to do the Minister's bidding. It is not reviewed by anyone else other than the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand Senator Ross's motivation. He is a politician, as is the Minister <Col N="1090" /> for Finance whose function is to discharge his obligations under the Constitution of managing the fiscal and financial policies of this country and taking the decisions required to fulfil those commitments under the Constitution. He will appoint people to manage the fund on behalf of the people as a result of which investments will be made carefully over the next 25 years. He has specified in the legislation the background of the people he will appoint. Surely the fact that Senator Ross and the Minister are politicians does not reduce that decision, regardless of whether it is his or the Minister's appointment.</P>
      <P>Once commissioners are appointed under this legislation, they are in control. They only report to the Minister. They do not do anyone's bidding and make their own decisions based on their capacity, ability, expertise and professionalism and the experience they have gained in life. What is wrong with that? They must be given a reasonable amount of time to put together a reservoir of information and expertise. Once that is available, why should we dispose of it? Let the thing evolve and manage the fund, but if the Senator tabled an amendment providing for a third term&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Ross can trust the judgment of successive Ministers for Finance and be assured that the commissioners will be at arm's length from the Minister. They will do no one's bidding. They will have a fundamental responsibility to manage the fund in co-operation with the manager within the policies and parameters laid down. The manager will be responsive to them. They will both be responsive to the Oireachtas through the Committee of Public Accounts. Both of them will have to produce annual reports and report to the Minister for Finance as he requires on behalf of Government at any particular time. If democracy is not sustained and transparency is not operable through those arrangements then I do not know what more we can do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister of State a few questions about the qualifications of commissioners. To me these qualifications are merely a fig leaf. They are, undoubtedly, an honest attempt by the Minister to put in criteria which will qualify people for the position of commissioner.</P>
      <P>Before I go any further I have two specific questions for the Minister of State. Will the lawyers, people who have acquired substantial expertise and experience, and people who will have substantial expertise and experience in accountancy and auditing need to be qualified in those professions?  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Senator think? If Senator Ross was the Minister would he appoint unqualified people to fill those positions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know whether they must be qualified. It is a simple question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite simple. As I said earlier in response to an amendment, the Minister for Finance will take serious cognisance of what he reads on the curriculum vitae of each individual being recommended. This is not a simple mechanism. There will be a screening process within Government whereby the Minister for Finance and his advisers, along with the Cabinet, will make the final decision on all of the CVs available to them of people wishing to be appointed.</P>
      <P>The Senator can take it for certain that we are talking about highly qualified senior people who have international or national experience, whether it is in investment or international business management, finance or economics, lawyers, corporate lawyers, financial lawyers and actuarial people. There are many fine actuaries about. We have fine actuaries internationally, Irish people who have done very well, particularly in London and elsewhere. Of course there will be people qualified in accountancy and auditing. They will have a track record of being partners in firms or otherwise. They will be chairmen, managing directors, principals etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People will come from the Civil Service and the wider public service. They will be civil and public servants of high repute who have made a major contribution in particular sectors of the public service. Trade union representatives, people from ICTU and other organisations and people in the pensions industry sector will also be considered. The consumer protection sector is another area that will be considered. People with a track record as consumers will be considered. We are <Col N="1092" /> all consumers but these people will have a track record in a profession. At the end of the day we will get a mix of high quality professionals who have left a mark on the business that they are in and on the areas of activity that they pursue. This means we will get a totality of objectivity when it comes to a conclusive decision being taken by the commissioners at any time on any issue.    </P>

      <P>It depends what area. No, you do not do it because you do not normally specify any criteria. This is new. The Minister of State does not know. If this is so new then let it be spelt out so there is no high watermark in the case of accountants, auditors and lawyers. Joe Soap from somewhere in the west will be asking people if they have studied law. People will respond by saying they know a bit about the traffic lights down the road and the legislation related to them. Joe Soap will put them forward. He will consider anyone who was arrested once and in front of the District Court in Galway to know a lot about law. We will have this type of situation. It is important that we know what qualifications these people have. We do not know them.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister of State is underlining the point that I am making, that these nine qualifications which are spelt out in the Bill are worth nothing. These are a pure and utter fig leaf. I hate to say this. My guess is that certain Members of this House could qualify under six or seven of these categories.  </P>

We should legislate for Ministers who make mistakes, bend the law and do not carry out the good intentions in documents of this sort but abuse them.</P>
      <P>I was not being frivolous when I said this provision is too broad. It mentions those who have qualifications at senior level in investment or international business management, finance or economics and the Civil Service. Does that mean anyone who has ever been a civil servant? It does. It says anyone who has experience and substantial expertise at a senior level of the Civil Service of the Government or the State. That is 200,000 people to start with and to pick from &ndash; tame civil servants. They cannot all have that sort of expertise and be qualified. That would include any civil servant who had studied law or accountancy. What do we get back to? Anybody who has been involved in trade union representation?

Every damn quango that is set up by the Government has to have some members from IBEC and the ICTU. Why? It is because they are putting the maximum amount of political pressure on the Government to be represented on these bodies, which is where the power lies. They have a great deal of clout. One of the most extraordinary aspects of this Bill is that whereas one will have, willy-nilly, representatives of IBEC, the ICTU and the social partners on the board, we are not allowed to have a Member of Oireachtas. Why is that? The Minister can appoint people who are members of political parties &ndash; I do not think they should be barred, I was wrong about that &ndash; as commissioners, but Members of the Oireachtas cannot be so appointed. One can have representatives of IBEC, the ICTU and farmers but one cannot have a Senator or a Deputy. Why is that? It seems totally inconsistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely some Members of the Oireachtas are qualified to make judgments on an issue as important as this one. Some of them are highly qualified. What about former Ministers for Finance who sit in the Lower House? Is the Minister telling me that if the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, retires or, God forbid, leaves office and is still a Member of the House, he should be barred from sitting as a commissioner on this body? The Minster of State said that the <Col N="1095" /> Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is a man of great integrity and expertise in this area. Given the flamboyance and knowledge of the Bill he has demonstrated today, the Minister of State would be qualified to sit on this body.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great interest to what Senator Ross has had to say. I am afraid, however, he has skipped the most important lines in that section. Section 7(4) states:</P>
      <P>. . . the Minister shall only appoint persons to be commissioners who have acquired substantial expertise and experience at a senior level in any of the following areas&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)investment or international business management, </P>

      <P>(<i>h</i>)the pensions industry,</P>
      <P>(<i>i</i>)consumer protection.</P>
      <P>It is unusual in a Bill to specify the areas of qualification which are required. While we have excellent civil servants, only Secretaries General, Assistant Secretaries General and former ones could be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator asked why Members of the Oireachtas are not on this list. That is very simple. There is a tradition in this country that law makers do not benefit from the law they create. Members of the Legislature are not appointed to boards or bodies which they have created by law. That, however, does not debar them from becoming candidates for appointment on a professional basis when they leave political life. Of course, in a future life Deputy McCreevy, <Col N="1096" /> as a qualified accountant and a former Minister for Finance, would be eminently suitable for this position. Whether he would be interested at that time is another story, but we are talking about a long time in the future because I am sure he will be serving the people for many years in his present capacity, and we would not like to have that interrupted. We are talking about highly qualified people with a track record at senior level.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked why we should have representatives from IBEC or the ICTU included. The Government believes in partnership. We were the people who initiated social partnership. No Government worth its salt can run a nation for the people without having partnership with the people. Why should those with whom we are in partnership not have representatives on these boards and bodies if they are qualified to do the job? Let us continue with partnership in the interests of the people by bringing the required expertise to the highest levels. Collectively, we will make decisions that are in the best interests of the country and that can be sustained in the future.</P>

If the Minister appointed one of his senior civil servants as a commissioner &ndash; there are people in the Department of Finance who would easily qualify, such as Assistant Secretaries General or the Secretary General &ndash; would he or she be independent or be seen to be independent of the Minister?

      <P>How much remuneration will the commissioners receive? That is an important point arising from subsection (11). I have a general question concerning something that amazes me, although it may be unfashionable to pose it nowadays. Under subsection (13)(<i>a</i>) why is someone disqualified from being a member of the commission because he is adjudged bankrupt?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because if one is adjudged bankrupt, one is not fit to manage finances, and obviously one is not fit to manage these finances or give advice on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator asked what remuneration the commissioners would receive. The Minister gave a commitment in the Dáil that he would pay them more than £4,000 per annum, which is the figure paid to directors at present. No decision has been taken on the figure they will receive. That is a matter concerning the availability of people and the recommendations made to the Minister as to what figure would be relevant. That has not been decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why we should not be told now what they will be paid. This is ridiculous. The idea that we should give <i>carte blanche </i>to the Minister to decide later on what they are paid is absurd. We would have some idea of the status of these people as non-executive directors if we were told they will be paid £20,000, £25,000 or £30,000. I do not know whether they will get £4,000 or £40,000. I cannot understand this extraordinary matter which the Minister says is normal. Things are often very wrong, and just because something is normal does not mean it should be in the Bill, such as bankruptcy which I have also queried. It is absurd not to tell us what the commissioners will be paid just because it is normal not to do so. Perhaps the Minister will <Col N="1098" /> give us some indication of what they will receive. Will it be £4,000, £10,000 or £20,000? What status will these people have and what amount of work will they do? I do not understand this coyness about how much they will be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no coyness involved whatsoever. No decision has been taken. As the Minister for Finance said in the Dáil, they will be paid more than £4,000. They will have plenty of work to do and most particularly in the first three years of this activity they will be very busy people. They will have to devote much time to this situation as it evolves and progresses. I do not know what the figure will be. No decision has been made so I cannot tell the Senator about something that has not been decided.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is normal practice to put legislation through and then see the cadre of the people one requires before focusing on their remuneration. That is normal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important point. The Minister keeps referring to the fact that it is normal, but it is a bad practice. We are perfectly entitled to know the status of these jobs. Presumably, whoever drafted this legislation, and whoever's crackpot idea this was, decided how much work these people will do and what status they will have. Presumably, also, they know how much they will be paid. These people will have a job to do. It is specified in the Bill. They will need to know how much work will be involved and what responsibilities they will have. To be in charge of and managing such enormous funds will be an immense responsibility, far greater than people imagine. It is absurd to state that they will be paid more than £4,000. As no one is being paid less than £4,000, the Minister of State is not telling us anything. In dealing with future legislation we should at least be told on Committee Stage what the level of remuneration will be.</P>
      <P>There are two abuses of remuneration, the first of which is paying people far too little. I agree with the Minister of State that many people in semi-State bodies are paid £4,000. This is a pittance for which they do far too much work. I am not certain but I think members of the RTE authority are only paid £4,000 &ndash; it might be £6,000 &ndash; and they have 12 meetings a year. They also do work behind the scenes. They are grossly underpaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also gross abuse of directorships or, in this case, commissionerships where people are paid far too much for doing far too little. They happen to be members not just of State boards, but also of the boards of public companies because they may be the friends of someone else. They are not appointed on merit. My criticism is not restricted to appointments to State boards; it is not just politicians who are involved in this racket, those at the top of industry in PLCs are <Col N="1099" /> appointing people to boards of companies who are patently not qualified and know nothing about the board in question. There is hardly a sinner on the board of Eircom who knows anything about telecoms. That is one of the realities. In drawing £30,000 a year they are grossly overpaid.</P>
    <P>Where will this rank in the order of things? Will this be a £30,000 a year non-executive job, which is quite common at the top of banking, or will it be a £6,000 or £10,000 a year job? Many people at the top are paid far too much and do very little work. There will be a temptation to appoint people to positions above their abilities to give them a very pleasant income. At what level will they be paid? This fund will be far bigger than any other fund. Members of the boards of banks are paid £30,000 plus, but within a very short time this will be much bigger than the funds managed by banks. Will people be paid <i>pro rata </i>or will they be paid normal semi-State fees? The Minister of State does not know what the exact amount will be, but where will they be in the pecking order? Will they be at the top, the bottom or in the middle?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on what the Minister for Finance said in the Dáil, I am quite certain that they will be in the middle. They will not be at the top or the bottom. They will be highly qualified professional people who will have a very important job to do. They will not be appointed to permanent positions or to public companies. It will be a State appointment for which certain parameters are being laid down. We hope to attract the best and brightest, those with great expertise. I am certain that they will be reasonably remunerated for the job they will do in keeping with the position and the time they will have to give to it.</P>

      <P>The situation in this case is different. As a commissioner, the chief executive officer will be a full voting member. He is not a member of the board of the NTMA. As a commissioner, he will manage the fund and decide on policy within the criteria laid down by the policymakers, that is, the commissioners who will delegate responsibility to him and the board and staff of the NTMA for management of the fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the NTMA will be one of seven commissioners with equal voting rights on top of which he will have enormous additional duties and responsibilities. For the next ten years the manager &ndash; the NTMA &ndash; will be responsible for managing the fund, although it may subcontract. Its <i>de facto </i>chief executive officer, therefore, will manage the fund. Surely he or she should be at arm's length from the commission in voting on policies which he or she will have to implement and execute. That is akin to riding two horses at the same time. It means having a huge amount of additional information and responsibility while at the same time being in an equal position to participate in and influence a vote. The Minister is giving too much power to one commissioner.</P>

      <P>This morning, when we dealt with the section which provides that the commission shall perform all functions through the manager, I asked if there could be a conflict between the manager and the commissioners. Now that we are teasing this issue out, it appears there is such a possibility. The chief executive or the manager will also be a commissioner. He will manage the fund on behalf of NTMA for the commission and will also be a commissioner. I do not see how that can work. If a conflict arises between the manager of the fund and the commissioners, how will it be resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see a problem with this. Most companies' managing directors sit on the boards as full directors. The managing director presents his reports, advises on policies and issues, responds to queries and questions and is part of the consensus that reaches decisions. That is the case in normal private companies.</P>
      <P>In this case we are asking the chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency, on the basis of his qualifications, expertise and unique record of having held the post of Secretary General in two Government Departments, to apply this expertise as a commissioner. As commissioner, he will have responsibility for policy matters. In such situations one is unlikely to find a vote arising. These are highly qualified people who will achieve a consensus as to the best way to deal with funds in terms of their investment and management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His other responsibility will be the normal, professional, day to day management of the National Treasury Management Agency. This will be in addition to his responsibility for managing these funds through his agency. While there is a major link between both, we believe the expertise in that linkage will be of major assistance to the commissioners. It is normal that the managing director of a body sits on the board. In this case, he will sit on the board as a policy adviser and decision maker in his capacity as commissioner. That is normal, sensible and practical. It is also good business. The linkages are important. At the <Col N="1102" /> end of the day we will say, &ldquo;They have done a great job and we made the right decision&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the core funding of the pension fund. It empowers the Minister to set aside 1% of gross national product each year for the fund. That is a substantial amount of money. At present, it amounts to between £600 million and £700 million to be invested each year. That is fine when there is a surplus in the budget account.</P>
      <P>Acting as devil's advocate, I am long enough in the Oireachtas to remember budget days when the Minister for Finance had to tell the House that after servicing the national debt and providing for health, education and social welfare, it was necessary to borrow to pay for all other State services. That was the position in the early 1980s when the country's finances were in a mess. Thank God, we have moved away from that to a position where there is a surplus in the current account. That has been the case for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fine to put aside 1% of GNP each year when the country can afford it but that might not always be the case. The Irish economy is strong at present but a number of factors account for that. The weak euro makes Irish products competitive in England and the United States and makes our tourism industry attractive, among other benefits. We are also dependent on a number of industries, particularly in the telecommunications sector. I listened to a radio programme this morning which was broadcast from <Col N="1103" /> the site of a major industry in Kildare. Approximately 4,500 people are employed there. There are many such industries located throughout the country. I hope they all succeed and continue to grow.</P>
    <P>However, I must act as devil's advocate and point out that this position might not apply in years to come. The country might have a deficit again and have to borrow to meet it. The Minister said this morning that somebody had suggested we should borrow money to invest in the pension fund. The day might come when there is a deficit and we will have to do that to meet the 1% requirement. The amendment provides that a variation should be available to the Minister for Finance of the day. If there are insufficient funds to transfer to the fund, a lower amount than 1% should be considered and the amendment suggests 0.5%. It is only common sense.</P>
    <P>We are committing ourselves to make this substantial contribution to the fund each year over the next 50 years. A contribution of between £600 million and £700 million is a lot of money for future generations to pay. They are committed to it if the Bill is passed without this amendment. I propose to include some leeway whereby if the country's finances are not as good as they are now, the Minister for Finance would not have to make provision for 1%.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>We should revert to the Minister's intent. He is putting a nest egg in place for pensions in the future. Under the Bill that nest egg cannot be touched for the next 25 years. The Minister set the annual amount for the fund at 1% of GNP, which translates to approximately £600 million at present.</P>
      <P>While Senator Doyle has put down the amendment in good faith, he is attempting to leave open the option of reducing the amount for the fund by 50%. That is raiding the piggybank. The Minister's intent is that there will be sufficient funding available to meet the pension and superannuation needs of future generations. Under no circumstances should we be diverted from that goal or change the provision from 1% of GNP. The 25 year period will remain. Even if circumstances change &ndash; I accept that economies run in cycles &ndash; the last thing we should do is raid the pension fund we are creating to make superannuation payments to retired people. It would not be in the best interests of the fund and it would send out the wrong message if we deviated from the Minister's intended course, namely, the investment of 1% of GNP per year into the fund for the next 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. As Senator Doyle stated, it is common sense that a minimum and maximum amount to be invested in the fund should be stipulated in the legislation. At present, the amount to be invested would be of the order of £600 million to £700 million while in a couple of years it will be £1 billion. We know <Col N="1104" /> the Minister intends to keep this matter at arm's length by ensuring that the legislation indicates the exact amount to be invested. However, we must consider that a &ldquo;rainy day&rdquo; may arise in the future. For example, one, two or five years from now the economy might get into difficulty. It is not that long since we were in dire economic straits. The concept of social partnership is under major pressure at present and there could be a free for all at any stage.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the point made by Senator Finneran stands up to scrutiny. We are investing money to provide a nest egg for future pensioners, but none of that money can be touched until 2025. In the next 25 years, there will be many pensioners who will need sufficient funds to allow them to be comfortable in their retirement. Are we going to subtract money from their pensions if the economy cannot meet both commitments? In other words, will the amount paid into their pensions over the next quarter of a century be reduced in order that the pensioners in the following quarter of a century should have access to a larger pension fund? I do not believe that is fair. We must take into consideration those who will become pensioners during the next 25 years in addition to those who will become pensioners between 2026 and 2055.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why we should be obliged to introduce new legislation in respect of this matter. We should put in place now a mechanism to offset the economic pressures which may arise. Everybody accepts in principle what the Minister is doing. However, in practice we may find it difficult at some stage during the next 55 years to invest 1% of gross national product in the fund. We are legislating for the next half century and discussing enormous amounts of money. The Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Costello has let the cat out of the bag. As he correctly stated &ndash; with a realism which is not characteristic of the Minister of State &ndash; God knows what will happen when we encounter hard times and we have all this money salted away. The Labour Party has been honest and stated that there will be too much money invested in the fund and that it will take some back. That is what will happen&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;because there will be a huge pot of money which politicians will want to use for purposes for which it was not originally intended.</P>
      <P>Although I do not agree with the specifics of the amendment, I will be supporting it. I agree with Senator Doyle's assertion that the level of investment in the fund should be reduced to at least 0.5% or perhaps it ought to be flexible. The Bill is making use of a crude measure, namely, that 1% of GNP will be invested for 55 years. That is an extraordinarily crude piece of work on the part of any Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps provision for the future should be <Col N="1105" /> made, but I am doubtful about that. I am not sure that today's taxpayers should pay for the pensions of tomorrow. I seem to be the only Member of the House who doubts that principle. Why should I, the Minister of State or anyone else be taxed to pay the pensions of our children or grandchildren, if we have any? If we do not have children or grandchildren it is even worse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>We should consider using Senator Doyle's figure of 0.5% and try to estimate the amount of money the fund will accumulate by 2055. The reason we have not been provided with estimates is because we do not know how much money will accumulate. However, there is no doubt that the final figure will be absolutely enormous. I would have thought that if an independent body is going to monitor this fund, a flexibility should be attached in terms of the amount to be invested and that a crude figure should not be stipulated. The amount of money yielded by 1% of GNP will be enormous. In a period of recession, 1% of GNP will represent an even bigger commitment because it will be money that was hard earned. That is the difficulty with this provision.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment because it reduces the compulsory confiscation of people's money by a certain amount. There is no doubt that 1% is too crude. It is too much and I do not believe the provision will work.</P>

      <P>Senator Finneran stated that I intended to raid the fund. That is not the case. Let us consider a situation where I approached my bank manager when times were good and stated that I wanted to transfer £1,000 each month from my current account to my savings account until further notice. If things went wrong, I would want to be able to reduce the amount from £1,000 to £500 or else stop the transfer of funds altogether. I must measure what I am in a position to save against what I earn.</P>
      <P>We are committing ourselves as a nation, for the next 50 years, irrespective of whether we are running a surplus or a deficit, to putting aside this amount of money. That is the point I am making and I believe there should be a mechanism put in place to allow the Minister to reduce the 1% commitment in times of recession.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much appreciate the assistance. It is important that we plan for the future and take full account of the demographics which obtain and the fact that we have an ageing population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget strategy for ageing group which was established by the Department of Finance to <Col N="1106" /> consider the budgetary issues posed by ageing estimated that approximately 3.5% of gross national product would have to be set aside annually to equalise the Exchequer burden of health and pension costs during the next 50 years. However, given the magnitude of the prospective costs involved and the many other competing demands on the State's finances, the group concluded that a more feasible sum to set aside would be 1% of GNP, which it was estimated would meet approximately 30% of these costs. In making this recommendation, the group acknowledged that it was making no provision for the post-2056 situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives discretion to future Governments to extend the life of the fund beyond 2055. While our demographic projections do not go beyond 2056, when we estimate there will be one retired person for every two persons of working age, it would be quite unrealistic to expect a quick decline in the ratio. The ageing problem will continue for some years at least and perhaps some decades after mid-century.</P>
    <P>In establishing a single reserve fund which is not designed to meet a defined liability but to part fund social welfare and public service pension costs to a year potentially beyond 2055, it was decided to adhere to the recommendation of a contribution of 1% of GNP. This is at a level which will make a significant contribution to future pension costs and it is a sustainable commitment. Once built into the multi-annual budgetary structure, it should not cause undue difficulty.</P>
    <P>The contribution is slightly less than our annual contribution to the EU budget and less than one third of the interest payment on the national debt in 1999. If our economic circumstances make contributions over and above the 1% of GNP feasible, the Bill allows additional contributions to be made to the fund by way of resolution of Dáil Éireann. In effect, the 1% of GNP is a minimum annual contribution to the fund and it is open to future Governments to make an increased contribution in any particular year.</P>
    <P>Given the size of the pensions liability that is awaiting us and a projected increase of 7.7% of GNP on current levels by 2055 and in light of the fact that the fund will only meet part of this liability, I would be firmly opposed to any measure which lessened the 1% contribution to the fund. I do not accept that in earmarking 1% of gross national product for the fund the Government is in any way neglecting the current needs of our society. Contributions to the fund are not being made at the expense of other goals and commitments.</P>
    <P>As a result of our economic success, we are in the happy position of being able to pre-fund, within a sustainable budgetary strategy, which will also allow for substantial infrastructural and other capital investment under the national development plan, continuing implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, further <Col N="1107" /> improvements in public services and ongoing reduction in the national debt. In short, the economic success we have all worked so hard to achieve and the demographic bonus we are enjoying, allow us to make provision for future pension liabilities without compromising our more immediate economic and societal goals.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Senators may have concerns about a 1% annual contribution when economic circumstances may not be as favourable as at present. However, the Government takes the view that it is prudent to budget for a known liability. To allow discretion in the making of a 1% contribution in the manner proposed by the <Col N="1108" /> amendment would significantly reduce the capacity of the fund to meet future pension liabilities, leading to major problems for future Governments and generations.</P>
    <P>I do not have to remind the House of the straits in which we found ourselves in the past due to the prioritising of short-term interests over the long-term sustainability of the public finances. A contribution of 1% of GNP is a prudent and sustainable commitment and the Government is being fair, practical and positive in this decision. I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 15, before section 19, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;19.&ndash;The Commission shall with the consent of the Minister prepare and publish an ethical investment policy which the Commission shall apply in holding or investing monies standing to the credit of the Fund and which shall <i>inter alia</i> prohibit investment in enterprises involved in the armaments industry and the tobacco industry.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important amendment. No guidance, good bad or indifferent, is given as to how the commission will exercise its responsibility in relation to investment. In the absence of guidance on where the money might be invested, we should set a good example by ensuring an ethical investment policy is incorporated in the legislation. This is the first time we have had an opportunity to invest such a level of surplus funds and we should have an ethical investment policy. Our elderly, who expect to benefit from this fund, and our young people would like an idealistic approach adopted to the investment of moneys in this fund. We should not invest in the armaments industry or the tobacco industry and I am sure we <Col N="1109" /> could identify other areas that are not ethical for investment. We are talking about the nation's money and providing a model, a good example. We are concerned to ensure we get the optimum return on our investment, but as has been said, investment funds are poorly managed in terms of securing an optimum return and such returns are little better than the going rate one would get in a bank, post office, building society or any other standard financial institution where one gets the going rate. We should show an example here and establish an investment policy that prohibits investment in certain enterprises that destroy people.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Bill is to give people enough money to enjoy a happy retirement. If we start investing in something that is destructive towards humanity, whether that is armaments, tobacco or some other substance that abuses the human body, we are giving a bad example. If we give a good example it does not mean we cannot get a good return. I am sure there are large numbers of investment areas that would be beneficial rather than detrimental for humanity. Can we draw the line here and incorporate a specific provision that Ireland has an ethical policy regarding investment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. We should have an ethical investment policy and we should not invest in armaments. I do not think the commission will invest in the tobacco industry, as it is going through the floor as a result of people in America taking lawsuits against it. I would add the drinks industry to that list. We must show our young people an example, and the abuse of alcohol is one of our great social problems. If I had put down this amendment I would have added the drinks industry. We must be brave and face up to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would love to be able to support this amendment but I cannot, mainly because of the inclusion of inter alia in it. This is a difficult problem because of where one draws the line and Senator Doyle has highlighted this by suggesting we add the drinks industry, which is a legitimate point of view. There are certain ethical funds which are very broad in terms of limitations and narrow in terms of funds in which they allow investment. Some ethical funds do not allow investment in banks, as they feel banks are immoral usurers, they play very little part in the productive side of the economy and they are an oppressive force for evil. That is another point of view. It is not one I share but it is one people hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very unspecific. Banks lend to tobacco companies and keep them going. Banks provide huge amounts of money for armaments and lend to Governments which export arms and which should not be supported for that reason. We have <Col N="1110" /> a difficult problem with ethical investment. It sounds worthy but I challenge anyone to produce a credible list of investments where one company is connected to another which is doing something most of us would find indefensible, and I do not mean in terms of just arms and tobacco. It is not a problem we will resolve today. Senator Costello wisely included the term inter alia because it gives a let-out to everyone who is in favour of an ethical policy. He has highlighted the fact that this fund will be launched without any policy. We are giving this fund a blank cheque for £5 billion to start with and it can do what it likes. I am not sure that is a good idea and I am not referring to ethical investment; I am talking about giving the fund certain instructions and parameters, which we are refusing to do. Will the fund invest in infrastructure in Ireland, which gives no obvious return unless toll roads are concerned? Attempting to pin the Minister of State down as to what type of investment will be made is a worthy objective but we cannot do it.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of tying people into ethical investment because that area is incredibly subjective, though I approve of the fact that we should not invest in certain regimes of which we disapprove. I would also have great difficulty with investing in the tobacco industry. However, if the Minister of State is a believer in fund management &ndash; I am not but he obviously is as it is part of the Bill &ndash; one must start by letting everyone compete on a level playing field. Unfortunately, plenty of pension funds invest in tobacco companies, in armaments or in Governments which produce or use armaments or which are tyrannical regimes we do not find acceptable for political reasons. If we go down that road we are taking a journey that has no end. The Minister of State's defence on this should be the level playing field, that he cannot tie the hands of the supposedly talented people by telling them they cannot invest in certain areas while others, with whom they are competing, can. That does not make sense, even if it is a worthy objective.</P>
    <P>I do not think it matters in investment terms whether one ties the investment manager's hands. It would be better to do so, as most studies have proved that a blind monkey normally gives a better performance than these fund managers. Restricting investment to ethical areas will probably not affect performance but might even improve it. If one invested everything in ethical investments some years ago one would do better than in non-ethical investments. It is all a matter of luck. I do not believe the argument that the Minster of State is about to make regarding performance holds water, as the performance of these people is deplorable and they would be better off being restricted in some way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In determining the investment policy of the fund, consideration was given to <Col N="1111" /> whether this policy should be strictly commercial or qualified by ethical, environmental and other public policy criteria. A major difficulty with an ethical investment policy is deciding where to draw the line. I agree with Senator Ross on this issue, as there will inevitably be different opinions and intense debate on what constitutes ethical and socially responsible investments. In short, there is unlikely to be broad consensus on any ethical investment policy. Furthermore, the list of what might be considered unacceptable investments is likely to change continually in light of developments in the political, social and scientific spheres. If one attempts to delineate appropriate investments for the fund there is a danger of dragging the commissioners into a quagmire of public controversy and paralysing the investment procedures of the fund. Notwithstanding these considerations, a number of approaches which might be taken to implement an ethical investment policy have been examined.</P>
      <P>One could copy the UK precedent. From July the annual report of pension funds in the UK will have to contain a statement of the approach to ethical investment adopted by a fund. There will be no requirement for funds to invest in this manner; they will merely be required to state their policies. In other words, in the UK one can put one's money where one likes but one has to give a report on how ethically one is doing so. A fund can use its voting rights to put pressure on companies to pursue ethical policies and it appears that this approach can be accommodated within a commercial mandate, though its effectiveness is somewhat debatable, particularly if the shareholding of a fund in any one company is relatively small. Some funds put a small portion of their assets into a separate fund which is then invested according to ethical criteria. The drawback with this approach is that it is largely tokenism, with the vast majority of the fund being invested in the normal manner in the commercial markets.</P>
      <P>Screening is another approach which has been used by some funds. It involves hiring analysts who will examine all companies on an index. The analysts will identify those companies with assets of the class to which the investor objects or, alternatively, companies adopting best practice will be identified. When they have done that, the investment managers of the fund in question are given a target of beating the adjusted index, that is the index excluding the forbidden sectors or companies by a set percentage. In other words, they are told they can only play here and they have to reach that target. It is a bit like powerful corporations telling their sales managers that they did well last month but they have to achieve another target this month, and either the man dies of a heart attack or his target for the whole year is increased again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, a number of drawbacks to <Col N="1112" /> this approach. For instance, there would be major costs involved in hiring the analysts and tracking the performance of the adjusted index. These costs would be multiplied for a large fund where a number of indexes would be tracked. There would be increased risk as the list of forbidden investments lengthens and the portfolio consequently becomes less diversified, in other words, the persons are exposed because they are in a narrower portfolio or group of portfolios.</P>
    <P>There would be operational difficulties. For example, with a customised portfolio it would not be possible to use equity futures to hedge against market exposure as such futures contracts are linked to broad market indexes. There would be less opportunity to undertake crossing transactions where equities are traded directly with other funds, thereby cutting out brokers, reducing fees and increasing performance. Clearly there would be significant difficulties in incorporating an ethical policy into the investment mandate, no matter what approach is taken in pursuing such a policy. Accordingly, the investment mandate included in the legislation is modelled on the standard commercial mandate for private pension funds, that is, maximised returns subject to prudent risk management. Any explicit reference to ethical investment would politicise the investment mandate and would give rise to significant difficulties both in its interpretation and its implementation. Consequently, we must trust the markets, the performance of the managers and the judgment of the commissioners. We are optimistic about the future and I regret, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>That sounds like a &ldquo;no&rdquo;. My starting point was that the Minister has given no guidelines to the commission; it is <i>carte blanche</i>. He is not indicating one way or other where this money might go. I am not drawing up a proposal, although it is desirable that should be done, but I am trying to indicate one area which is not that big a problem, as has been suggested. We can point to all the difficulties but we can still pursue an ethical policy, and we should do that. I will not pursue the matter further now but I will eliminate the aspect that is causing the Minister and Senator Ross a problem, namely, that the amendment is perceived to be too broad. I will withdraw the amendment and re-enter it for Report Stage with the deletion of the words &ldquo;<i>inter alia</i>&rdquo;. I will identify the two areas about which there can be no confusion, the armaments industry and the tobacco industry, and it should not be beyond the comprehension of the investment fund managers to keep within those bounds.</P>

      <P>The Minister may have a note on this section. After 2025, the Minister can draw down from the fund but we will continue to contribute to the fund up to 2055. Will the Minister explain the effect that will have on the fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 20(5), the rules governing drawdowns from the fund must be calculated by reference to the projected increase in the number of persons over 65 years of age in the population between the relevant period, that is, 2025 to 2055, or later, subject to avoiding undue variations in the net Exchequer cash flow from year to year. This will link withdrawals from the fund to increases in the over 65 population cohort. As far as social welfare pensions are concerned, this will provide a reliable indicator for increases in Exchequer outlays, in other words, it will give a balance in Exchequer management, the interflow of cash and the withdrawal of same from the system. While increases in public service pension expenditure are not directly linked to the number of over 65s in the overall population, the pattern of withdrawals produced by the formula should be broadly consistent with increases in total Exchequer pension outlays due to ageing.</P>
      <P>Consideration was given to including a detailed actuarial formula in the Bill which would set a precise method for calculating withdrawals from the fund based on demography. It was decided, however, that it would be more appropriate to leave this issue to the ministerial rules. Although projections beyond 2055 are inevitably highly speculative at this stage, the indications are that the rise in the State's pension bill due to the ageing population will plateau out from mid-century when the dependency ratio reaches 2:1. In other words, for every two people employed there will be one dependent pensioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demographic problem will not go away quickly after 2055 and current indications are that it may be desirable to keep the fund going for some time after mid-century. In order to derive a formula which properly smoothes the pension burden on the Exchequer, one needs to set an appropriate end year when the worst of the demographic problem has receded. Given the number of variables involved, there is little point in trying to derive such a formula at this early stage. The whole purpose is to maintain a balance in the fund. We could not have a situation where we would be putting in a lot of money and withdrawing a lot of money. That would have a staid effect on the fund. We have to have consistent investment and, I hope, commensurate with that investment would be growth in the fund due to the professionalism of the fund managers on the advice of the commissioners. With that, we would <Col N="1114" /> draw down a ratio based on the demographics at that time and on the population at age 65 and onwards. That should help to maintain the balance so that the fund can grow and continue to service the requirement for which it is intended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (2), line 47, to delete &ldquo;10&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;5&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the setting up of the NTMA as the manager of the fund. We discussed this matter in its initial stages and whereas I seem to be alone in my reservations about the NTMA, we have had no explanation from the Minister, which I hope he will give us now, about the reason this process did not go out to tender. It would have been logical and fair that in the initial stages of this process it would have gone to international tender, not to the NTMA, and for the Minister to say we have these services available to us here is not correct. As the Minister rightly said, nobody in the Government services is experienced in asset investment. Those people are very experienced in managing debt, whether they are good at it is a different matter, but nobody, certainly not the NTMA, is experienced in managing investments of this sort or equities.</P>
      <P>I do not know the reason the NTMA is being given this job but I suspect it is that most Ministers for Finance, for some reason, have been entranced by the personnel layer and have been convinced that they are so good at managing the debt they will immediately be able to transform this into a completely different art, if it is such, which is managing assets of this sort. There is no evidence for that but there is evidence that the NTMA currently may not have enough to do, particularly since Government stocks have become such a minor part of our economy and since we no longer sell Government stocks in a meaningful way because we do not need to borrow the money.</P>
      <P>The NTMA probably has slack capacity, but this is not a good reason for giving the fund to it. This is the same as giving it to a banker who is good at lending money but who knows nothing about investment. The NMTA knows nothing about investment in stocks and shares, which is where this money will go. It is strange and wrong that this fund is not going out to tender internationally as it will be one of the biggest funds in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is bad enough to hand the NTMA, which knows nothing about the business, a blank cheque, but to say it can have the fund for ten years is absolutely extraordinary. Why is the period not five years? In the case of the com<Col N="1115" /> missioners the period is five years, with a renewable option for another five years. Why are the provisions not consistent? To give the NTMA ten years is to give it an extraordinary security of tenure. If these people perform badly at any time during the first nine years there is absolutely nothing we can do about it because the legislation provides for a period of ten years.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister providing in legislation for a period of ten years? Why can the period not be reviewed after five years or every year? The normal procedure is that the fund is reviewed annually and if it does not compare favourable with other funds the fund managers are fired. However, the NTMA will get the fund for ten years. Even if it is a disaster and the people selected as fund managers do not perform well the NTMA will still be there. People who know nothing about equities and have no experience in this area will be given the job, without competition, for ten years, presumably because there is spare capacity. The very least that should be done is reduce the period to five years. This period is still not satisfactory, but I am trying to meet the Minister half way. Nobody in any sector gets a ten year term when the performance can be so bad for nine years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments made by Senator Ross. It is extraordinary that on the day of the establishment of the commission the agency will be appointed manager of the fund for ten years. A number of Ministers for Finance will have come and gone during that period. We have no idea whether the NTMA will be able to do its job adequately. The ten year period is being set in statute, yet there will be no benchmarking or standards. What will happen if there is a series of disastrous investments? The NTMA will still be the fund manager, while the chief executive officer will be a member of the commission. The agency will have the lion's share in terms of decision-making and the implementation of decisions. It is not good enough to give the NTMA this very important job without setting parameters.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that the agency will not operate well. I do not share Senator's Ross's view of the NTMA, but he may be right as he knows more about these matters than I do. I would prefer a shorter period of time, which would be renewable on delivery so that there would be a good return during the initial five years on the enormous investment fund which we will put at the disposal of the agency. At the end of five years we should review the fund to see whether the agency has earned the right to be reappointed to the job.</P>

      <P>We touched on this point this morning. The commission and chairman will be appointed for five years, while the agency will be <Col N="1116" /> appointed for ten years. Senator Ross does not agree with me, but the NTMA has a good record in debt management. However, the crucial point is that it has no real known experience in relation to fund management. I have already outlined the record of fund managers European and world-wide and it is not very impressive. I hope the fund managers who operate for the NTMA will be more successful. Nevertheless, there should be a trial period of five years. I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides for the appointment of the National Treasury Management Agency to act as the agent of the commission in managing the fund for an initial period of ten years. After this, there will be the option at five yearly intervals for the commissioners to extend this arrangement further or to appoint an alternative manager.</P>
      <P>In deciding to give this initial role to the NTMA the Minister for Finance was strongly influenced by the fact that £5 billion would be entrusted to the commissioners once the fund is established. They will, therefore, need to have access to a fully functioning executive which is operational and resourced, with the necessary systems and expertise to manage such a large sum from day one.</P>
      <P>The NTMA has been managing the liabilities side of the State's balance sheet for more than a decade. While asset management will require the agency to acquire some additional skills, it was considered much more sensible to have the NTMA manage the funds than to expect the commissioners to start from scratch and to establish a second specialised agency to manage such a large amount of money.</P>
      <P>It is likely to take some time for the commission to fully invest the £5 billion held in the temporary holding fund. Teething issues will inevitably arise during the first year or so as the commission develops its investment strategy, defines its relationship with the manager, gains familiarity with its functions and refines its operating procedures. In view of these facts, the Minister for Finance took the view that setting a five year or one full commission term for the NTMA as manager was too short a period to properly assess its performance. Accordingly, he decided to make the NTMA the manager of the fund for the first two commission terms, that is, a ten year period.</P>

      <P>The Minister is futuristic and realistic in his thinking. He looked at the decade of success of the NTMA. Senators Doyle and Finneran also referred to this. Given this success, our capacity as a nation and the intellectual talent bank, structures and systems, particularly the public service which has served us so well, why should we not develop the expertise within the NTMA not alone as debt managers but also as investment managers? I am confident it will do an outstanding job and be the recipient of many more accolades in the future. I am sure similar models will be adopted by many other countries.</P>

      <P>It is all very well for the Minister to ask why we should not develop the expertise <Col N="1118" /> within the NTMA. However, there is already £5 billion in the fund, so on day one it will have this amount without the expertise. This means that people who know nothing about investing in equities will decide what to do with this money. This is a shambles. It is absurd to expect people with no knowledge of this area to manage a fund of this size. The Minister of State's reply is totally unsatisfactory. I cannot accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (1), lines 39 and 40, to delete paragraph (<i>d</i>).</P>
      <P>I have severe doubts about this section and about the virtues of fund managers. I note it refers to internal ethical and compliance guidelines. Ethics is not a concept unknown to the Government in the Bill, but it is unknown in the presentation and in the specific investments made and rejected in that way. I have a specific problem of principle with the exercise of voting rights by investment managers on behalf of the fund. The purpose of the amendment is to address that.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may be aware that there was a very controversial vote recently at the annual general meeting of Eircom. The wishes of shareholders were defeated by the block votes of fund managers. This was most apparent in the case of the largest block. Bank of Ireland Asset Management, which manages the largest number of funds in the country, cast over 100 million votes in favour of the board of Eircom. That was a vote decided upon and cast by an investment manager. In almost all these cases, one investment manager makes a decision. That is patently ridiculous for several reasons, the most obvious of which is the following good example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were between 3,000 and 4,000 small shareholders in that hall and, as far as I could see, not one of them voted the same way as the board on the more controversial motions, yet they were defeated. That happened because individual fund managers, as will happen in this case, were given hundreds of millions of votes to cast at their <Col N="1119" /> discretion. That is bad enough because it gives far too much power to one person.</P>
    <P>The real crime against democracy is that the people who cast those votes were quite patently voting against the wishes of the underlying shareholders and pensioners they represented. That is apparent from the fact that popular opinion, popular shareholding opinion and small shareholders were patently against the board on that issue, as could be seen by the small shareholders' votes and their expressions.</P>
    <P>The fund managers voted the other way, but they were voting for the same people that were in the hall. I was one of them. I only take myself as an example because it is so obvious to me. I was in the hall with a few thousand votes and voted against the board. My pension fund was in the back pocket of the chairman, voting for the board totally against my wishes. The biggest number of pensions in the country was also voting for the board against the wishes of the pension holders.</P>
    <P>It is very simple. This provision is patently anti-democratic. Pension fund managers should not have the right to have absolute and total discretion to vote enormous amounts of power to people who tend to be their friends, colleagues or people they meet at their golf and sailing clubs and in other places. This is what is happening.</P>
    <P>At the top of the Irish financial world there is a layer of people and bodies who vote for each other and look after each other at annual general meetings, and this is directly appropriate for this particular clause. The Bank of Ireland always votes for the AIB at its AGM and <i>vice versa</i>. That does not make an awful lot of sense. The directors of the Bank of Ireland are always re-elected by 99.999% because every fund manager in town votes for them. The AIB shares, votes cast on your behalf and mine, vote for the re-election of the directors and in favour of their old controversial motions and options. The Bank of Ireland then goes to its AGM and votes for the AIB. It is terribly cosy and works a dream, but the pensioners are never consulted. We have the ridiculous position that the fund managers are voting in a way that is patently against the wishes of those they represent but patently in the interests of themselves, the system and the oligarchy which exists at the top of the Irish financial world.</P>
    <P>This provision is a complete duplication of that patent injustice. I am surprised to see a Fianna Fáil Minister supporting such an anti-populist stance. I am surprised because I understood that there were moves afoot within the Government to change this unjust weighting of shareholders votes. Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on this.</P>
    <P>At the Eircom meeting everyone saw the absurdity of the chairman, Mr. Ray MacSharry, <Col N="1120" /> saying that 30 million votes went one way while several hundred million votes went the other. That is what happened &ndash; the big battalions came in and cast a vast number of proxies against the wishes of the underlying shareholders.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should have tabled another amendment and I will think about tabling one on Report Stage as I spell it out. I suggest to the Minister of State that no pension fund manager should ever be allowed to cast votes of this magnitude without consultation with at least the trustees of the fund, who could instruct him on which way to vote. I am not sure that is enough because I do not have total faith in the trustees of pension funds either, but it would be a start. In this particular case the individual fund manager who holds the shares on behalf of the fund should have to consult with someone who represents the shareholders. In this case it is either the commissioners, the NTMA or the Government.</P>
    <P>The pensions fund is the biggest one in Ireland. The Minister of State should remember that it could rock the Irish stock market in a matter of years. The stock market is only worth about £8 billion and this fund is worth £5 billion. It could buy the AIB and the Bank of Ireland. Its size is enormous.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator is talking about 1973. This fund is so enormous that its voting power, to which this provision applies, will be disproportionate to any company it invests in. It will be massive. That voting power is apparently going to rest in the hands of one fund manager, one individual who will decide whether so and so stays on the board or gets options, whether controversial matters are voted through, whether to put so and so on the remuneration committee or whether to consult with anybody. This when he is managing funds on behalf of people who pretty obviously disagree with him or at least he does not know it.</P>
      <P>This provision should be deleted. The principle of handing so much voting power, and I am not talking about money, to an individual whose motives are totally different from those whom he represents is wrong and should not be enshrined in this legislation.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Senator Ross. It is difficult to follow the logic of what he said. If we deleted section 22(<i>d</i>) we would leave open the voting rights on behalf of the fund. It would be incongruous to have such a situation prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the voting rights at an AGM, and I know how taken Senator Ross was at the recent Eircom AGM, it does not follow that indi<Col N="1121" /> vidual shareholders will have the knowledge and information to make an informed decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is patronising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That would apply to people who had canvassed for proxies and asked to represent people. They may not be best represented in a situation like that.</P>
      <P>The power of a fund manager to invest is a far greater exercise of power. It would have a greater impact on the individual investor and member of a pension fund. All investment decisions will ultimately determine the return and quantum of pension that the individual might receive. The purpose of the investment will be geared towards that. Surely that is a far greater power. Senator Ross does not seem to have any difficulty with the idea.</P>
      <P>Most of these funds have an element of collegiality. There is a team of people involved in making decisions. While the ultimate right might be with the investment fund manager, it is fair to say that the reputation of the fund and the manager will very much be determined by the results that the fund will achieve on an annual basis, and comparisons will be made. I do not disagree with Senator Ross when he said there is perhaps a cosy cartel prevailing within the whole financial circle. The Minister might examine that area, but its relevance is not focused on this amendment. The amendment would denude the fund manager and, as a consequence, the people who have invested in the fund, of a say at the annual general meeting. To have a system where each individual involved in the pension fund would have a vote prior to the AGM is impractical. In many instances, it is not something the investor would want.</P>
      <P>Many people who invest in funds do so because they recognise that the professional manager of the fund has the time, expertise, knowledge and information available which enables them to make informed decisions on their behalf, which they could never hope to do. It is wrong to try to use this amendment as a way of paralleling the analogy with Eircom. If Senator Ross reflects upon it, I am sure he will agree that the investment decision of the fund manager is obviously of much greater significance to the investor. However, it would be totally unacceptable to remove the power of exercising a vote at the AGM at his discretion in the interests of the fund, which he is obliged to act upon.</P>

      <P>Yes, I presume that is what we are discussing, the exercise of voting rights by the investment manager on behalf of the fund. Where it is deemed appropriate, the commission will appoint investment managers and grant them powers to, among other things, exercise voting rights at an AGM. It does not seem to do the same thing concerning the manager of the fund, the National Treasury Management Agency. The commission may very well ask the manager to invest and manage such portions of the fund, but it does not seem to grant voting rights to the NTMA. I would have thought that if one has an overall management agency, such as the NTMA, the commission would grant it the authority to decide how the AGM will be conducted and the voting rights that should accrue to the agency, rather than to the individual fund managers whom it may appoint from time to time, if we are to have coherence in terms of voting. I would like the Minister to address that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in saying that the NTMA will farm out portions of the fund to fund managers who will have voting rights in the areas in which the funds are invested? Senator Ross was reasonable when he said that on Report Stage he would ask that at least they would discuss the matter with the trustees of the fund before making a decision on the matter. In this case, the trustees of the fund are the commissioners. It is only fair that these fund managers should consult the commissioners before they cast their votes. That is a reasonable approach to the matter. If Senator Ross tables such an amendment on Report Stage I would be happy to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 22 deals with the appointment by the commission of investment managers and custodians. Investment managers will be engaged by contract and section 22(1) outlines some of the key issues which will be covered in such contracts. These key issues include the exercise of voting rights by investment mangers on behalf of a fund. Like any representative of a shareholder, investment mangers may be called upon to exercise voting rights from time to time on behalf of the fund in respect of shareholdings in particular companies. This does not always happen at AGMs &ndash; it is an exception. The commissioners will need to formulate a policy on the corporate governance issues which will be put to them, as shareholders, from time to time. This policy could, for example, require investment managers to refer back to the commission in particular circumstances before exercising voting rights, or it could set parameters within which investment managers are free to exercise voting rights as they see fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 22(1)(<i>d</i>) enables the commission to set terms and conditions which will ensure that <Col N="1123" /> investment managers exercise voting rights in a manner consistent with the objectives of the commissioners' policy on corporate governance issues. This amendment would remove this provision from the list of criteria which the commission should take account of in drawing up contracts with investment managers. Senators should note that removal of the provision from the list would not prevent the commission from setting terms and conditions in this area, as the list is not exhaustive. However, the provision deals with an important issue and it should be explicitly referred to on the list.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh put it well in his interpretation of the situation. In my book, the most important thing at AGMs is that there is democracy and that at least one has the right to vote on issues. At many AGMs ten or 20 people turn up and no more is heard about it. It is all over in 15 minutes, everybody nods their heads in assent and things seem to roll on and move forward. That happens consistently. However, in a certain number of AGMs, such as the Eircom one, we see a huge turnout of people. The shareholders exercised their views, as did the fund mangers, and there is a conclusion and a decision. I am confident that at the end of the day there will be a good return on the investments that have been made. We are confident that the same situation will prevail in <Col N="1124" /> this case. It would be draconian if we were to force absolute consultation at all times before a decision could be taken. If that were the case, I do not know how we would ever conclude an AGM.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 33, to delete &ldquo;2&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;3&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This arose from a comment by the Minister on Committee Stage that commissioners could quite happily serve for three terms. We were disputing whether commissioners should sit for five, ten or 15 years. The Bill provides that a commissioner &ldquo;shall not serve for more than 2 consecutive terms of office&rdquo;. Two is the least preferable of the choices. One term is perfectly acceptable if it <Col N="1125" /> must be set up in this way. Two terms is objectionable for the reasons I specified. The Minister said, correctly, the commissioner will get the experience &ndash; he said, &ldquo;three terms&rdquo;. This amendment is put down to facilitate the Minister.</P>
    <P>If one accepts the Minister's principle that the guy has to use his expertise and experience, he should have two terms for review, not just one. However, if my principle is accepted, that nobody should ever have to be reappointed if they are politically appointed, it would be a one term appointment. The danger is simple. If the commissioners must be reappointed and reviewed, they could be susceptible and vulnerable to political pressure. If one takes the Minister's perspective with regard to experience, why cut them off after two terms? They get more experienced and accumulate more expertise after two terms. The Minister suggested, as the record will show, that three was equally acceptable. If three is acceptable, let us opt for three terms. I agree with that proposition and that is why I put down the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. The logic of the Senator's argument is impeccable. In the first five year term, the commissioner is a mere novice and only getting to know the job. In the second term he gets to grips with it but in the third term the expertise has been built up to such a level that we will have a wonderful chief executive officer or commissioner. Three years is the obvious term.</P>

      <P>My recollection is reasonably good and I believe that what I said was that if the Senator had said three, it might have been acceptable. I did not say I was accepting that. I appreciate the generous way the Senator responded to my suggestion but I believe in change. When people have given ten years of service, the Government would be of the belief &ndash; this would apply to all Governments &ndash; that change and fresh thinking is important. Regretfully, I cannot accommodate the Senator on this occasion.</P>

      <P>No. I am serious about this matter. Even though the suggestion was by the Minister, it has been rejected. What does that tell us? It tells us that this Bill is not being taken seriously today. The Minister was sent in with riding instructions: &ldquo;Get this Bill through and accept no amendments.&rdquo; We know that, but the public does not know it. The people in the Public Gallery think we are debating this seriously. They might believe that some of these amendments will be accepted, that what is going on is constructive, but it is not. The people in the Public Gallery ought to know that the Minister came to this House with definite riding instructions to get the Bill through the House without accepting amendments.</P>

However, people outside believe we are debating a serious matter and that there is some chance that the Bill might be amended. I tabled this amendment to emphasise the point that even a suggestion, which was acceptable to the Minister of State earlier &ndash; he made it himself &ndash; is not acceptable now because the Bill must be rammed through today at all costs.</P>

When we see the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, entering the Chamber we know that a Bill will be dealt with in an extremely efficient, polite and robust manner and with a great deal of good humour, but we also know that it will be passed unchanged. What is happening now is the proof of that.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" />&ldquo;19.&ndash;The Commission shall with the consent of the Minister prepare and publish an ethical investment policy which the Commission shall apply in holding or investing monies standing to the credit of the Fund and which shall prohibit investment in enterprises involved in the armaments industry and the tobacco industry.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Ross, I have been trying to facilitate the Minister of State. In light of his remarks on Committee Stage, it seemed that the Minister of State believed the amendment I tabled at that point was too general and that it would be difficult to provide accurate parameters in relation to investment policy. I have recast my amendment to require that the Minister prepare and publish an ethical investment policy which the commissioners will use as a guide in relation to investing the State's money and which will prohibit investment in enterprises involved in the armaments industry and the tobacco industry.</P>
    <P>There is already £5 billion in the fund and we will be investing in the region of £750 million each year &ndash; this will quickly rise to £1 billion &ndash; for the next number of years. This large amount of taxpayers' money will be invested elsewhere and it is important that we lay down an ethical investment policy under which no money invested by the State will be used in destroying, mutilating or damaging people. In other words, it will not be invested in the armaments industry. Likewise, because of the inherent dangers posed by tobacco and in light of State policy, we will prohibit investment in the tobacco industry.</P>
    <P>We should at least provide an example in this area to our citizens, particularly the young. The investment of this money will go towards building a pension fund for the future. It is, therefore, appropriate that citizens recognise that the money we are investing on their behalf was earned by them and taken from them in tax. That money, which is designed to help build a nest egg for the future, should be invested in areas outside the armaments and tobacco industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment, which is reasonable, well thought out and sensible. I hope the Minister of State will accept it and disprove the argument put forward by Senator Ross.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Costello for tightening up his amendment. The Minister of State's objection on Committee Stage was legitimate because it is very difficult to know where to draw the line. However, Senator Costello has now drawn that line and I presume the Minister of State will accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The aviation industry is of major benefit to this country and to others throughout the world because of the opportunities for investment. Ireland is home to a number of leading edge technology companies which provide communications components for the aviation and computer industries. If we introduce a blanket ban on investment, the fund managers will not be able to invest in computers or in communications. We cannot allow such a situation to develop.</P>
      <P>We must trust the normal commercial market where policy will be decided on by the commissioners and where operations management will be the responsibility of the fund managers. I am confident they will make decisions, in the most prudent way possible, which will be in the long-term interests of this country. We have £5 billion in pension funds to invest immediately which will cater for our pension needs after 2025 and, in particular, after 2055. As the fund grows in line with economic growth, we are confident that the fund managers will achieve their goals, consolidate our investment and ensure that it yields the return the people of Ireland would expect from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion it is the Minister of State who is splitting hairs. His reply is a smokescreen for a lack of willingness to tackle the area of investment policy, particularly in terms of developing a national ethical investment policy. I am referring to the production of arms by the armaments industry and the production of tobacco products by the tobacco industry, from the beginning to the end of the process. The Minister of State can refer in broad terms to the communications and microchip industries but that is totally different. His argument is not relevant to the armaments or tobacco industries.</P>

It should not be beyond the ability of the Minister for Finance to draw up criteria that would establish parameters for an investment policy which would focus on the armaments and tobacco industries and fulfil the intention behind the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> Section 22(4) is concerned with the evaluation of prospective investment managers who will be employed by the Government and sub-contracted out and one of its requirements is that these managers shall have due regard to their &ldquo;internal ethical and compliance guidelines&rdquo;. The Government is, therefore, intent on demanding that the managers take an ethical approach. However, it will not impose any criteria in relation to where they invest funds on taxpayers' behalf. It is a cop-out to state that we cannot devise a policy to ensure that Irish funds are not invested in the armaments and tobacco industries.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 17, line 40, after &ldquo;Fund&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;only after seeking prior instructions from the Commission&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment in direct response to a plea from Senator Doyle on Committee Stage who said that if I tabled an amendment to this effect, he and the Fine Gael Party would support it. I will not repeat what I said on Committee Stage, but it will also accommodate Senator Walsh and the Minister of State, who said that by deleting this paragraph, removing the voting power of the fund manager, the situation would be left in limbo. I do not agree with them that it would not matter, as it would leave the power in the hands of the commission.</P>
      <P>Against my better instincts but in terms of political pragmatism, acceptance of this amendment would leave the power of voting with the fund manager but it would insist and ensure he exercises that vote only after seeking instructions from the commission. In other words, the beneficial owners or trustees of this fund would decide in controversial areas which way the fund manager should vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ridiculous that someone who is employed to make investments and who is supposed to have expertise in doing so should also be given a completely different skill, which is a doubtful one but one that is used in a political way by most fund managers, the privilege of exercising a vote, which has little to do with specific investments. These votes tend to be about re-election of board members and because of the position they hold, fund managers inevitably vote for the re-election of board members. To my knowledge, they never consult trustees of pension funds or unit holders, in the case of managed funds, to take instructions <Col N="1131" /> from them. They are left to cast tens of millions of votes to re-elect or reinstate people who should not be there. I do not wish to see that in the Bill. As a minimum, the Minister of State should make progress in this area. The Government is examining this area. That is why I am surprised at the lack of the Minister of State's response. A clause should be inserted in the Bill that those who exercise this vote, the delegated fund managers, who are temporary, should seek prior instructions from those who represent the beneficial holders of these shares.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. As Senator Ross outlined, this is an important amendment. Investment managers are employed from time to time to invest funds. It seems contradictory that they should exercise a vote without referring back to the people who put them there. They must refer to and represent the wishes of the commission in the voting process. The Minister of State might say that is already provided for in terms of section 22(1). It states that the commission may from time to time appoint such managers and their duties are set out, but it does not state specifically that for voting purposes they must refer back on a consistent basis to the commission for instructions in relation to the vote. It is important that it is written into the legislation that they should have voting rights only after seeking prior instructions from the commission.</P>

Now he wants the fund managers to be referred to the commission so that it will give them instructions as to how to vote in an AGM. It would not be unreasonable to assume that this fund would invest in over 1,000 companies, which would mean over 1,000 AGMs to attend.</P>

      <P>No. The commissioners would have to consider AGM documentation and what advice and decisions they wanted. They would instruct the fund managers, who would be bound by this amendment to go to the AGM and vote accordingly. Irrespective of the fund managers' experience or expertise, they are to ignore the small shareholder and are not to listen to the consensus or the requirements of the AGM. They are to vote at the discretion and instruction of the <Col N="1132" /> commissioners. That is one interpretation of the amendment.</P>
      <P>The other interpretation involves the need for full-time permanent commissioners who would be reading AGM documentation day and night, putting reports together, synopsising those reports and then making a recommendation after consultation with the fund managers. That is unwarranted, unwise and impractical and would be a waste of time, effort and energy. We have to trust the judgment of those managing the funds. They are experienced people and when reports come in the commissioners will deal with them in the normal way. They will have certain reports and information available to them.</P>
      <P>This would be an unworkable amendment and I cannot accept it. We have to trust the judgment of the policy makers in the commission and that of the fund managers &ndash; NTMA and its fund managers &ndash; and we are confident that the best decisions will be taken in the interest of the investors, the pensioners and the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extraordinary suggestion. If I am hitting the bone perhaps I am provoking interruptions. Now the Chair has interrupted me and I will have to start again.</P>
      <P>The point I was making before I was so rudely interrupted is that they do not have to go to the AGMs. All they have to do is send off three letters a day once those letters have been ticked in a few places. The idea that it is logistically difficult is absurd, because I do not know what else these people are going to be doing. Some fund managers do not move funds around very much. They read the newspapers and make decisions, half of which are right and half wrong. The suggestion that it is too much for these people to fill in a form and send it off to the chairman of a meeting is absurd. They do not have to attend the meeting at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not even a matter of 1,000 companies, as there will be plenty of fund managers. We discussed having ten, so it is only one every three days. Will these people have too much to do to fill in one form every three days? The Minister of <Col N="1134" /> State should not be ridiculous. Logistically this is no difficulty whatsoever; it is absurd to maintain otherwise.</P>
    <P>I do not share the Minister of State's faith in these people's experience as though this were some sort of rocket science and that some mystique surrounds fund managers or their great skill. Most studies show the opposite and that is the fallacy of this Bill. Most studies show that fund managers are a joke and do not outperform any index known to man. That is why the consensus fund was invented &ndash; because other funds were performing so badly and charging so much. The consensus fund allows one to invest in it and it then invests in all the other funds. One gets an average of the other funds and this is done by computer, not by man. Man was found to be faulty in this field &ndash; totally flawed. The consensus funds have proven on the whole to be as successful &ndash; more successful in some cases &ndash; than the other funds because they do not charge as much money, given there are not as many fees. It is a constant source of embarrassment to those fund managers in whom the Minister of State has so much faith that their performance is so appalling.</P>
    <P>Today we are not only being asked to have faith in their investments but the Minister of State is telling us not to worry as they have done so well in the past. They have not done well at all. They have done well in the last ten to 12 years because anyone would have done well in that time, certainly in the last seven years. One could not go wrong. There were figures of 12% per annum but they did not beat the market. They invested in the market but they did not beat it. Everyone got 12% per annum if they invested in average stocks in that period. They did not do well at all. We are now saying we should have faith in these people's investment abilities which we should not have. On top of that we are to give these clowns who masquerade as having skills they do not have applause for being clever.</P>
    <P>They do not have benchmarks. Pension funds measure themselves against guess what &ndash; themselves. They publish a table and that is all. They do not measure themselves against the ISEQ index, though others do. They do not measure themselves against the FTSE or the Dow or anything like that. They publish a table and say: &ldquo;I was sixth in the table last year, I am fourth this year. Haven't I done better?&rdquo; They may have done better than some of their peers but they have all done badly.</P>
    <P>Let us not pretend these people are particularly skilful or have some mystique. They do not. To give them voting rights on top of that is absurd. Giving them that power is crazy. My amendment is minimalist, as mine tend to be; it is far too milk and watery but I put it down to accommodate other Senators. The least we can expect is to make them consult and take instructions on these <Col N="1135" /> particularly controversial issues from the beneficial owners. These decisions are not investment decisions at all.</P>

    <Title>Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill, 1998: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give the force of law in the State to the Hague Convention of 1996 on the protection of children. It provides a framework within which effect is given to the provisions of the convention in their application to the State.</P>
      <P>The convention will determine what civil law should apply in cases of guardianship, custody of and access to children who have links with the jurisdiction of two or more contracting states. It will also determine what court should exercise jurisdiction in such cases. The convention results from the work of the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Many Senators will be aware of the work of that conference which has led to, for example, the Hague Convention on the private international law aspects of child abduction. Since ratification of that convention by the State in 1991, my Department has operated a central authority for the purpose of applications for the return of children who are abducted into or out of the State by a parent. The 1996 convention will in some respects supplement the convention on child abductions but its scope is a good deal wider because it deals generally with co-operation in respect of matters of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children and it deals in those areas with jurisdiction, applicable law and recognition and enforcement of judgments.</P>
      <P>We live in a world where travelling between different states is becoming ever easier and more frequent. The custodial and other interests of children need to be protected in an environment where children for one reason or another are moved by a parent or parents from one jurisdiction to another. There is increasing awareness of the international aspects of the law as it relates to children and a recognition that conflicts of jurisdiction between the authorities of different states may not be in the best interests of children. The best examples are custody disputes where parents are residing in different jurisdictions and they apply, separately, to the courts in those jurisdictions for a determination on the matter. As a result, conflicting judgments may emanate from each court on the issues involved. The convention addresses this long standing problem by setting out clear and uniform rules to be applied in such cases in all contracting states and it provides for the speedy and effective recognition and enforcement of judgments in those states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since some understanding of the provisions in the convention is a prerequisite to an understand<Col N="1137" /> ing of the provisions in the Bill, I propose to outline the main provisions of the convention before dealing with the Bill. The full text of the convention is scheduled, for ease of reference, to the legislation. There also exists an explanatory report on the convention as published by the Hague conference. Copies of that report, known as the Lagarde report, have been made available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Chapters I to V contain the main provisions of the convention. Chapter I sets out its general scope. It applies to children up to the age of 18 and is concerned with &ldquo;measures directed to the protection of the person or property of a child&rdquo;. The view of the Hague conference was that, since measures of protection vary with each legal system, any enumeration of those measures could only be in terms of examples. Consequently, the convention gives a non-exhaustive list of the measures to which it relates. In general terms, it applies to measures related to guardianship, custody and child care. It does not apply to matters such as determination of parentage, adoption, maintenance, succession, social welfare or health.</P>
    <P>Chapter II deals with jurisdiction and lays down a basic rule, namely, that the authorities in the contracting state where the child habitually resides should exercise jurisdiction in matters of guardianship, custody and child care. This was regarded during negotiations on the convention as providing the most realistic basis for determining jurisdiction taking into account the child's interests and the availability of relevant evidence.</P>
    <P>In the event, say, of the unlawful removal of a child the convention ensures that the first state retains jurisdiction over the child and it restricts the means by which the second state can acquire such a jurisdiction. This is particularly important by reference to the Hague Convention on child abduction and ensures that convention can continue to operate as successfully as it has done up to now.</P>
    <P>Special provision is made in the convention in regard to courts which have competence to determine an application for divorce, annulment or judicial separation and where one of the parents and his or her child does not have habitual residence in the jurisdiction. This might arise, for example, where an Irish court was seised of a divorce application in a case where the applicant is habitually resident in the State but the respondent and a child are resident in another contracting state.</P>
    <P>The view taken by the Hague conference was that it ought to be possible, from the point of view of convenience and cost for both parents, where they both accept the jurisdiction of the divorce court, for issues concerning the welfare of the child to be dealt with by the one court. Jurisdiction to take such measures may, under the convention, only be exercised where it is in the <Col N="1138" /> best interests of the child and it ceases as soon as the divorce proceedings have been finalised.</P>
    <P>The potential role of other states with which the child may have a substantial connection is also recognised, but in a subsidiary capacity. Thus, for example, the authorities of a state of which the child is a national may request the authorities of the child's habitual residence to authorise them to take appropriate measures of protection if they believe that in a particular case they are better placed to assess the child's best interests. The authorities of the habitual residence of the child may themselves initiate the transfer mechanism if they think it appropriate.</P>
    <P>The convention also allows the authorities of any state in whose territory the child, or property belonging to the child, is present to take measures in cases of urgency or to take provisional measures of protection, subject to the competence thereafter of the authorities who would normally have jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Chapter III sets out the law to be applied by courts when taking measures of protection. The basic rule is that the relevant judicial or administrative authorities should apply their own law but with sufficient flexibility to allow such authorities to take account of other relevant laws where the protection of the child or his or her property so requires. The convention provides that the law of the child's habitual residence be applied to the question of whether parental responsibility has arisen by operation of law or by agreement. If there is a change in the child's habitual residence, any such existing parental responsibility continues to be effective, but the law of the new habitual residence will determine whether any additional parental responsibility is attributed.</P>
    <P>The thrust of chapter IV is that measures taken in one contracting state for the protection of a child or a child's property must, subject to conditions, be recognised in all other contracting states. Those measures will become enforceable as if they had been taken by the authorities of the state in which enforcement is sought. The basic principle is that a measure relating to the protection of a child should not cease to have effect merely because a border between contracting states has been crossed.</P>
    <P>The guardian of a child whose parents are deceased, for example, should not have to go to the expense and trouble of obtaining a new order in the second state to satisfy the authorities there. Recognition and enforcement may be refused, however, in certain circumstances. These include lack of jurisdiction in the state of origin, breaches of considerations of natural justice or grounds of public policy and any interested party may apply to the court for a decision on the recognition, non-recognition or enforcement of a measure where difficulties arise.</P>
    <P>Chapter V requires contracting states to designate a central authority to co-operate with other <Col N="1139" /> central authorities for the purposes of the convention. A central authority's functions will include facilitating communications and offers of assistance between courts and administrative authorities in different contracting states, facilitating agreed solutions for the protection of a child's person or property in cases to which the convention applies and, at the request of a competent authority, providing assistance in discovering the whereabouts of a child who may be present in its territory and in need of protection. Such co-operation has been singularly successful in the context of the Hague Convention on international child abduction. According to the latest information available, some 53 countries have acceded to that convention.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 contains some standard definitions. Senators should note that particular definitions are given to the words &ldquo;decision&rdquo;, &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; and &ldquo;measure&rdquo;. These are necessary because the convention will apply to court judgments and to decisions made, for example, by health boards under the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991. The main provision in the Bill is section 2 which gives the force of law to the convention and provides that judicial notice shall be taken of it. These are standard provisions in Bills of this kind.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is a technical provision dealing with the application of the convention in the State. The terms &ldquo;authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; are used throughout the convention. In some contexts they mean courts in the State, whereas in some contexts they mean administrative agencies concerned with the protection of children. Section 3(2)(<i>a</i>) transposes such references in various articles of the convention, in so far as they apply to courts, into references to the appropriate court in the State. Paragraphs (<i>b</i>) to (<i>d</i>) provide for the manner in which the District Court is to exercise jurisdiction in relation to certain matters in respect of which it did not previously exercise jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 3(2)(<i>b</i>) provides for the manner in which the District Court is to exercise jurisdiction in regard to the recognition or enforcement of a measure taken in another contracting state and section 3(2)(<i>c</i>) provides that a measure in respect of which an order has been made shall, to the extent to which recognition or enforcement is authorised, be of the same force and effect as if the measure was an order of the District Court.</P>
    <P>Section 3(2)(<i>d</i>) is also of interest because it provides for the manner in which the District Court is to give its opinion on the suitability of a parent to exercise access to a child who does not habitually reside in the State, on the application of a parent who resides in the State. This is provided for in Article 35.2 of the convention. The article reflects the view that the authorities in the state where the parent resides are in the best <Col N="1140" /> position to gather information on the suitability of a parent to exercise access rights.</P>
    <P>Section 3(2)(<i>e</i>) makes clear that the definition of &ldquo;father&rdquo; in section 2 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, includes the father of a child who has by virtue of Article 16 of the convention, acquired parental responsibility by operation of the law of another state. Article 16 provides that where a parent has acquired parental responsibility by operation of law in the state of the child's habitual residence, without the intervention of the relevant judicial or administrative authority, it subsists after a change in the child's habitual residence. The maintenance of some continuity and certainty in this area is regarded, under the convention, as being in the interests of the child.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs (<i>f</i>) and (<i>g</i>) of section 3(2) allow for the fact that the State may reserve to the jurisdiction of its authorities the power to take measures directed to the protection of the property of a child in the State and not to recognise any measure taken abroad that is incompatible with any measure taken by authorities in the State. These reservations are permissible under Article 55 of the convention. In keeping with the principle that the law which should apply to measures for the protection of a child should be the law of the country in which a child habitually resides, paragraph (<i>h</i>) provides that, subject to Article 52 which relates to agreements between contracting states on matters governed by the convention, any enactment or rule of law which confers jurisdiction on a court otherwise than in accordance with the convention shall cease to have effect.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 to 8 provide for standard matters of jurisdiction in relation to the Circuit Court and the District Court for the purposes of applications under the convention in the State. Section 5 provides that judicial notice shall be taken of the relevant judgments of courts of other contracting states concerning the provisions of the convention. Where cases having an international dimension are concerned, it will be of importance that a court is seised of all relevant material relating to a child who is the subject of proceedings in that court. Accordingly, sections 6 and 7 deal with the provision of documents and evidence in court proceedings for the purposes of the convention.</P>
    <P>A court in the State may, by virtue of section 8, address letters of request for the purposes of Articles 8 and 9 of the convention to courts or similar authorities in other contracting states. The court may do so either directly or with the assistance of the central authority it is proposed to establish in the State for the purpose of the convention.</P>
    <P>Section 9 implements that part of the convention which requires contracting states to designate a central authority to promote co-operation among competent authorities to achieve the purposes of the convention. That section, which authorises the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, by order, to appoint a central auth<Col N="1141" /> ority is based on provisions which already apply to the central authority for international child abduction and the central authority for maintenance recovery which operate successfully in my Department.</P>
    <P>By virtue of section 10, the central authority under the 1996 convention will have authority, if requested, to provide information to the competent authority of another contracting state under Articles 31, 32 or 34. It may require a probation and welfare officer, a health board or the registrar or clerk of any court to which a written report relating to a child has been sent to provide information on the child. It will also have authority to require any public office holder or body to provide it with any information which will assist in discovering the whereabouts of a child. A corresponding power is proposed in section 17 for the central authority for child abductions.</P>
    <P>Article 26 of the convention requires states to apply a simple and rapid procedure to applications for enforcement of orders under the convention and section 11 accordingly provides for the making of rules of court to provide for the expeditious hearing of proceedings under the convention.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is a saving provision which makes clear that nothing in the Bill shall affect the application in the State of the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991, which gives the force of law in the State to the Hague and Council of Europe conventions on child abduction. When a child has been wrongfully removed from one jurisdiction to another, the priority will remain that of ensuring his or her immediate return, and that it will only be after this return that other measures of protection may be pursued. Section 12 also makes clear that nothing in the Act shall affect the existing jurisdiction of the Irish courts to take measures directed to the protection of the person or property of a child, who is not habitually resident in a contracting state, except where the convention specifically governs the taking of such measures in, for example, cases of urgency. The jurisdiction of the courts in the recognition, enforcement or non-recognition of measures taken in noncontracting states will remain similarly unaffected.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of a Bill which is, at its heart, child centred and reflects international concern at the increasing incidence of parental conflict relating to children who may be the subject of decisions or proceedings in different jurisdictions. Lengthy and protracted court hearings as to forum and jurisdiction are not in the best interests of children and the convention attempts to minimise those problems. The convention is of recent origin and states are in the process of preparing for membership of it. I am sure the House will agree that we should be to the forefront in this matter. The Bill will enable the State to ratify the convention. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with approbation and approval the signal success of the current administration in its prison building and refurbishment programme over the past three years and looks forward to the implementation of the prisoner rehabilitation programmes being developed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which can now take place in the orderly prison environment which he has achieved.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on his very successful and co-ordinated campaign to deal with prison issues since his appointment a little more than three years ago. Arising from his commitment to prison reform, there has been an increase in the number of prison spaces. This was a commitment given by him when in Opposition prior to the previous election. He gave a clear and unequivocal commitment at that stage to tackle the issue of prison spaces as well as the conditions in prisons among other matters. When he was appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he set about tackling those issues in a constructive and co-ordinated manner. The total number in custody stands at 2,965 and they come from various walks of life.</P>
      <P>It is also important to recognise the Minister's success in tackling crime rates. Crime has decreased almost annually since the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, took on the portfolio of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to providing extra prison spaces, the Minister has significantly improved conditions in prisons. He has refurbished completely Portlaoise Prison and made it a state of the art prison which any country in Europe would be proud to have. Considerable work has also been carried out on the prison in Mountjoy and in other prisons the length and breadth of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister came into office, serious problems existed in the operation of the prison system. Morale was low among prison officers and inmates. The Minister has, in the past two to three years, set up several programmes, such as rehabilitation programmes. One of the core concepts of prison is that a prisoner would be rehabilitated and released back into society to <Col N="1143" /> continue a normal life having served his or her prison sentence. This programme has been very successful.</P>
    <P>One of the prime objectives of the Prisons Service is to put in place an enhanced range of rehabilitative measures available to all prisoners. It is anticipated that completion of the prison building and refurbishment programme will greatly facilitate the provision of additional rehabilitative programmes for prisoners and the enhancement of existing programmes over the next few years. In this regard I must compliment the Minister. For the first time in recent penal history he tackled this matter head on. Certain programmes, such as probation and welfare services, psychology services, work and training programmes are all being put in place. They are a great benefit.</P>
    <P>The provision of psychiatric care or counselling by a clinical psychologist for prisoners, no matter what offence they committed, was unheard of 20 years ago. Under the Minister's programme, and I know this from first hand experience of Cork prison, a constant flow of service is provided by clinical psychologists in most prisons. These people can help prisoners get over the problem for which they were convicted and help them analyse and come to grips with their difficulties. In many instances our prisoners came from difficult backgrounds; they came from backgrounds of abuse and crime.</P>
    <P>It is an alarming fact, and the Taoiseach referred to this last year, that there are children and teenagers on the streets of Dublin whose parents and grandparents were involved in a cycle of crime. They inherited and were born into a system of crime. Unfortunately, the Bugsy Malone gangs of the 1950s and 1960s are still emerging two or three generations later. In many instances these young people need help, guidance and education, particularly anyone who started committing crimes, some of it petty crimes, as young as ten years of age. The Minister is going in the right direction in some of the programmes he outlined. We also have the connect project, prison education services and drug addiction programmes.</P>
    <P>One of the central problems of prison life, particularly in Dublin and to a lesser extent in other cities like Cork and Limerick, is the number of people imprisoned for drug related crime. In this regard the Minister has several programmes in place. This is welcome and is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, many people addicted to serious drugs such as heroin need medical attention and services to help them kick their habit and resume a normal life. The Minister's programme for prison reform and extra prison spaces is moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>There are also programmes for sex offenders. Whether we like it or not we must face the fact that the number of people imprisoned for sex offences has increased dramatically over the past 20 years. Most of these crimes are serious sex offences against young people. Like the vicious <Col N="1144" /> cycle of crime, many of the people convicted of these crimes were in positions of authority, such as teachers, clergy or swimming coaches. In many instances they had a background of abuse. They grew up with abuse and they systematically passed this on to young offenders.</P>
    <P>We heard about the concept of the revolving door a number of years ago. People were being incarcerated but were released 12 hours later. The last Government and successive Governments talked about this a lot. Since the Minister came to office he has tackled the concept of the revolving door. Now anyone given a prison sentence by a District Court or a higher one must serve their time.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a commitment on taking up office to tackle serious crime problems, particularly drug related problems. In his Criminal Justice Bill, or in any one of the several Bills he introduced in this House, he has made it clear to criminals that crime no longer pays. There are minimum statutory sentences for serious drug offences. This is the right thing to do. He has sent the message to the drug lords that anyone found peddling drugs worth more than £10,000, whether it is cocaine, ecstasy, marijuana or hash, will run the risk of receiving a minimum sentence of ten years which must be served in full.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of discontent and a barrage of abuse against the Minister for the way he operates the Prisons Service. He has reformed it but his work is ongoing. It will probably be five years before we see the fruits of his labour with regard to the reform of various prisons around the country and the setting up of new prisons, a women's prison and a place of detention for sex offenders.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the excellent reform and work he has carried out on the Prisons Service. His contribution should be recognised widely. He has spent a lot of money on the provision of extra prison spaces and on all of the back-up services, such as the psychological service, treatment for young offenders, early release programmes and prison education. All these measures are directly attributable to the Minister's vision and foresight in tackling this difficult area. He has done an excellent job. A lot of what he spoke about in Opposition six years ago has been put in place. Actions speak louder than words. The Minister has delivered and he continues to deliver in a very positive manner on issues such as prison reform and extra prison spaces.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion to the House and I thank the Minister for coming here and taking this motion on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to the House. He is a very familiar face here. I have been here for a short period and I can say that he has been here more often than any other Minister because of the high level of legislation that has been introduced since he assumed office in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> I want to begin where my colleague finished. When the Minister was in Opposition he highlighted the difficulties being experienced in the Prisons Service for many years. When he got the opportunity and assumed office he tackled these problems in a very comprehensive manner.</P>
    <P>Private Members' time is precious. It is good to have an opportunity to raise issues. However, I am at a loss to see how a political party could use this time to criticise a Minister, particularly this Minister about the Prisons Service when we have seen so many advances and changes for the better over the past three years. That is the prerogative of the party. I have no problem with that but I just wanted to make a point.</P>
    <P>There have been 1,207 new prison spaces made available. The Minister is not finished yet because a further 700 prison spaces will become available next year. That represents a 50% increase in prison spaces. In 1997, when the Minister assumed office there were only 2,200 prison spaces available. A new prison has been built in the midlands, in Portlaoise, and Mountjoy Prison will be comprehensively refurbished in the coming year. That is the first time any refurbishment has been carried out at the prison in over 200 years.</P>
    <P>Crime rates have fallen by 21% since 1997. Opposition speakers may say that figures for reported crime are down, but the same criteria are in place now as during the term of the previous Minister, Deputy Owen.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan referred to the revolving door syndrome which was a serious problem before 1997. Prisoners were released due to the lack of prison places for them and after being released they freely and knowingly committed crimes. They were simply being freed because there was no space for them in prison and that was not a proper way of doing business. In the past the persistently high level of overcrowding in committal institutions in the Dublin area &ndash; Mountjoy Prison and St. Patrick's Institution &ndash; resulted in the granting of release to some offenders who would not normally be considered suitable for such release. There has been a significant reduction in the proportion of temporary release of the total numbers serving sentences, from 15.8% in September 1997 to 6.6% in September 2000. The actual number on temporary release has fallen from a daily average of 463 in September 1997 to 204 in September 2000. By any stretch of the imagination, that is a huge improvement on the situation that pertained in 1997.</P>
    <P>The Minister has created many new initiatives and has expanded and improved upon many of the old initiatives, including rehabilitation programmes. He has approved 40 new personnel for the probation and welfare service. The psychological service has been improved and enhanced, and the new connect project has been initiated by him. The prison education service has improved considerably and we have seen advances in counselling services for drug addiction. The issue of sex offences is being treated seriously with the <Col N="1146" /> focus on proper rehabilitation to ensure that offenders do not reoffend once they are released from prison.</P>
    <P>The new alternatives to violence project is in place. In addition, new prison rules have been drafted to replace the 1937 prison rules and almost 30 other legal instruments have been scrutinised and revised by a senior management group, including senior operational managers from headquarters and prison governors. It is the first time this has been done and the Minister is to be complimented for that. The draft rules have been submitted to the Office of the Attorney General for legal advice and final drafting. The new draft rules are more in keeping with the European prison rules which are the European version of the United Nations' standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, we have seen tremendous advances and improvements in the area of prisons and prison places. The Minister is to be highly commended for his efforts. Before assuming office he made his intentions very clear. Since taking office he has missed no opportunity to ensure that we have a vastly different prison service in place compared to the pre-1997 period. I praise him for his efforts and have pleasure in seconding the motion before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of this motion is one of the most self-serving, self-congratulatory and gratuitous pieces of nonsense to have come before the House for a long time. The Minister makes great play of the fact that since assuming office he has put in place such a large programme for new prison places. However, the Minister inherited 90% of the new prison places which were either there or at such an advanced stage that they came on stream shortly after he took office. The only new project he can truly lay claim to is the one at Portlaoise, and nothing else.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced that providing new prison places is the way to combat crime. In fact, there is evidence to the contrary. Physical conditions in the Irish prison system are among the worst in Europe, notwithstanding the modernisation programme of the last five years. I want to compliment not only the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Owen, for the rehabilitation and new prison programme, but also the former Minister, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, who initiated the Castlerea prison project in my own constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Added to the shortcomings of the programme of rehabilitation and rebuilding, the educational rehabilitation services in our prisons remain totally underdeveloped and in many areas there have been no modernising developments at all. It can be said that, by and large, no good use is found for a prisoner's time while he or she is incarcerated. The system is designed for punishment which seems to have the highest priority. Because prisoners at the commencement of their prison terms never know how much of their sentences they will serve, they just mark time for the duration of their detention. Sadly, many who are <Col N="1147" /> given nothing better to do, spend their time harbouring a greater level of resentment and anger against a system they see as treating them unfairly. They leave prison even more damaged than before. This is the main reason so many of them reoffend and thus return to jail very often soon afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made great play, up and down the country and in these Houses, about the number of jail places he has provided. Everything he states on prison policy, however, shows his narrow thinking that prison and punishment are central to the way in which he counteracts crime. He seems hooked on the false notion that the more people one puts in jail, the more the level of crime will decrease. This, of course, is the worst kind of 1930s reactionary nonsense. All the evidence, both from empirical research and from experience, shows that if the number of prison places increased by 25% it would not even achieve a 1% reduction in the crime rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has never shown any vision of alternatives to prison. Because of what the statutes dictate, judges have just two alternatives when dealing with offenders &ndash; fines and custodial sentences. Sanctions, including community service, are rare and very limited. Home detention enforced by electronic monitoring is unknown in our sentencing policy. Weekend prison as an option for people who are working has never been thought about in the Irish system. There are many other options and good ideas that cannot see the light of day because of the Minister's vision of more and more prisons, purely for punishment and stigmatising purposes.</P>
    <P>We all agree that a large cohort of the prison population can only be dealt with by taking their freedom away for whatever length of time is appropriate. Every society has this problem, but this society fails by having poor and often non-existent rehabilitative programmes that would prepare serious offenders for their return to gainful employment in the community. That rarely happens here. As a result we have one of the worst reoffending records in the world. Prison sentencing policy under the current regime is seen as imposing punishment and stigmatising only. It is never seen as an opportunity to prepare offenders to be reintroduced to a normal life afterwards. There is no ethos of treatment in the prison system, notwithstanding the very complex psychological and medical needs of many prisoners related to their pre-prison health history, drug abuse and alcohol addiction.</P>
    <P>Probably the greatest scandal in the prison system is the proliferation of drug abuse, especially in Mountjoy Prison. It is shocking that many prisoners enter the prison with no history of drug use, let alone abuse, and leave as drug addicts. This is absolutely disgraceful. Almost 60% of the current prison population are serving return sentences. This is outrageous and it is directly related to the lack of rehabilitation and support programmes.</P>
    <P>In a report he prepared for the Department of <Col N="1148" /> Justice, Equality and Law Reform and published in June 1997, the year the Minister took office, Dr. Paul O'Mahony stated that of a sample of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison, 77% had spent time in St. Patrick's Institution for juvenile offenders, a majority had spent time in an open prison, one in three were of the view that it was likely they would return to prison and the annual statistics of prisons and places of detention for 1994 &ndash; there may be more up-to-date figures available &ndash; showed that 57% of those committed to prison in that year had served a previous prison sentence. That is at the core of the problem in the prison system.</P>
    <P>Then there is the scandal of the high number of people sent to jail for the non-payment of fines. I do not have up-to-date figures, but I am aware that from time to time the Minister has provided information on this category of prisoner in the Dáil. He may give us the figure, but I understand that there are at least 1,500 prisoners in the prison system today for the non-payment of fines. In the first instance, a financial penalty was imposed purely because their offence did not merit a prison sentence. Some have committed only the most minor of offences. In the majority of cases default was due to inability to pay and our only response was to place them in prison at a cost many times the value of the fine. It costs £150 per day to keep a prisoner incarcerated. This shows how ridiculous and costly it is when a person serves a sentence for the non-payment of a fine. It may cost the State tens of thousands of pounds to keep a person in prison for the non-payment of a fine of £100.</P>
    <P>There are many other points I would like to make, but time is very limited. On a subject such as this eight minutes is not enough. If I had been present for the Order of Business I would have argued that we should, at least, have 12 minutes&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister accepted his portfolio &ndash; it was a most unenviable task &ndash; he inherited a prison system that was in chaos. Their physical structure was Dickensian. There was overcrowding, a revolving door system and temporary release without justification. I am taking a shot not just at his predecessor, but at a number of his predecessors. Given the level of crime in the community, the deep rooted cynicism among the public at the ease with which hardened criminals could obtain bail due to the revolving door system and the extent of early releases which had led to it losing confidence in the ability of the Government to deal with crime, in opposition the Minister came to one clear conclusion, that the vital ingredient was to lift marauding individuals and gangs out of society, eliminate the revolving door system, minimise temporary release and create the environment within our prisons where meaningful and co-ordinated rehabilitation programmes could be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was obvious from the start of his Ministry that he would not expend massive amounts of taxpayers' money on rehabilitation programmes for prisoners who would be in one day and out the next. That would have been ludicrous, naive <Col N="1150" /> in the extreme and irresponsible on the part of the Minister. He chose a clear and definitive starting point, which was to ensure that the revolving door system would go, the unjustified and unstructured temporary release system would be minimised and that the pre-Dickensian conditions in most of our prisons, apart from the first purpose built facility at Wheatfield Prison, would be improved. Existing conditions could not facilitate rehabilitation programmes.</P>
    <P>The Minister wisely chose to implement a significant prison building programme while refurbishing and modernising existing prisons. To decent, law abiding and fair minded people, refurbishment and modernisation along with the provision of purpose built units was the humane way of trying to structure our prison system in a way that would facilitate the rehabilitation programmes he had in mind. Rather than being shortsighted, the contrary was the case.</P>
    <P>Nobody claims that places of detention and prisons are the answer to all our ills. The Minister does not claim it. However, he is saying it is the starting point. Ordinary people who recall the 1980s and 1990s will be quick to describe what they had to go through. They asked the politicians who called to their front doors why a person could get bail when it was known in the community that he was committing further crimes while on bail in the sure knowledge that he would only get concurrent sentences if and when he was convicted by the court. There was great cynicism about that. There was also great cynicism about the revolving door whereby individuals returned to a neighbourhood and scoffed at their victims.</P>
    <P>The Minister, then an Opposition Deputy, saw that and decided the only way to deal with it was to create the proper physical structures and environment in which we could ensure that the punishment fitted the crime and that when a criminal was sentenced, he would serve the sentence. The usual conditions could be attached but the sentence would not be served in a revolving door and temporary release environment.</P>
    <P>The other side of the House might believe I am suggesting that the Minister has done nothing but build prisons over the last three and half years. Nothing could be further from the truth. His priority has been to start with the recidivist criminal and remove him from society if there is to be any hope of rehabilitating him. One cannot rehabilitate him when he is out on the street, if he will go in one door and out the next or if he will be given temporary release on an unstructured basis.</P>
    <P>Contemporaneously with the prison building and refurbishment programme, there was a significant development of community based programmes in crime prevention and an increase of over 70% in the allocation for the Probation and Welfare Service. This was designed to ensure a realistic, properly prioritised programme was put <Col N="1151" /> in place. I warmly commend the Minister for the manner in which he has approached his task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;condemns the shortsighted policy of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in imagining that the notion of criminal and anti-social activity can be countered by merely increasing the number of prison places.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put this amendment down because I was horrified when I saw the smug, ghastly, self-congratulatory tone of the motion which &ldquo;notes with approval&rdquo; the building of prisons and so forth. It is shameful, the type of thing that can only emanate from people who have not thought about the problem. I wish to tidy the amendment up grammatically. It should read:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the shortsighted policy of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in imagining that criminal and anti-social activity can be countered merely by increasing the number of prison places.</P>
      <P>I am strongly of that opinion. If one looks at any analysis of the concentration of crime levels, it becomes clear that they exist in particular locations and for particular reasons of social and economic deprivation. There is virtually no investment in many of these areas while we prate about the wonders of building prisons.</P>
      <P>It is clearly a class system and I am amazed that the so-called republican party, which regularly refers to the objective of cherishing the children of the nation equally, can gloat at the creation of so many prison places. Tomorrow will be the 100th anniversary of the death of Oscar Wilde when we will be treated to another smug feast of incorporating that abandoned and harassed individual into our self-congratulatory society. It is appropriate to quote part of <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i> at this juncture:</P>
      <P>The vilest deeds like poison weeds</P>
      <P>Bloom well in prison-air:</P>
      <P>It is only what is good in Man</P>
      <P>That wastes and withers there:</P>
      <P>Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,</P>
      <P>And the Warder is Despair</P>
      <P>Is that not true? We know that people go into the prisons of which we are so proud clean and free of drugs and come out as drug addicts. What could more effectively illustrate what Oscar Wilde had to say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recidivism was mentioned by my distinguished colleague on the Fianna Fáil benches. Why does Ireland have the highest rate of recidivism in Europe? Why do we have such rotten treatment of prisoners? We have physical spaces but there is virtually nothing rehabilitative. We do not have any concept of restorative justice, no psychiatric <Col N="1152" /> services and no facilities in which we can take people off drugs. That is not something on which this House should compliment itself. It is morally revolting that anybody should be so insensitive as to think it appropriate.</P>
    <P>I have been briefed on this issue by the Irish Penal Reform Trust and wish to put some of the trust's points on the record. At least it knows what it is talking about. First, the trust calls for an end to the prison building programme. Second, it seeks the appointment of a full-time prisons inspector. Why do we not have such an inspector? Third, there should not be prison sentences for fine defaulters. Senator Connor dealt with this point. We are paying enormous amounts of money to deal with something which is, in many cases, scarcely a criminal activity.</P>
    <P>Listening to Senator Fitzgerald one would think this nonsense about zero tolerance had done something. Every weekend, however, people are shot to death in the streets of this and other cities. What has been done about it? Zero tolerance does not appear to work. The trust's fourth point is the introduction of drugs courts. Fifth, there should be improved induction training for prison officers and, sixth, restorative justice should be part of any new crime policy. This has been shown to work in other European countries, particularly with regard to young people, whose behaviour patterns can be changed. They must confront the people against whom they committed their crimes. They must accept blame and do something positive and useful in practical terms to make amends.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that imprisonment is class based. Look at the tribunals. One can get away with white collar crime. There is only one class of people imprisoned in this so-called republic. Imprisonment is also socially divisive. It has long been proven that it is damaging to individuals and does not reduce crime. Crime must be seen in its social context and in terms of the communities from which it springs. Factors such as marginalisation, poverty and other disadvantages must be seen as part of the overall equation.</P>
    <P>In the interests of social justice, rehabilitation for those in prison must be properly resourced. Most of our prison population is in the 16 years to 25 years age group. These are people who can be helped because the pattern has not yet necessarily been fixed. There is also the issue of drug addiction. A study carried out in Mountjoy Prison in 1997 found that half the prison population had used heroin during their current sentences. To a certain extent a &ldquo;wink and nod&rdquo; policy is in operation because the lid is kept on the general situation which obtains <i>vis-à-vis </i>heroin addiction. In a more recent study carried out by the department of community health and general practice, of nine prisons surveyed 21% of inmates claimed to have first started injecting while in prison. Of these, 58% shared drug injecting equipment such as needles, syringes, spoons and filters. Between 1990 and 1997, 12 prisoners died in prison as a result of overdoses. This is what is happening in <Col N="1153" /> the institutions of which Members on the Government side are so proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we need more prison spaces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>More spaces so even more people can die in prison. That is a wonderful Swiftian comment on the part of Senator Fitzgerald and I invite him to consider what he said in a more calm fashion.</P>
      <P>The draft plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system has not been fully implemented. If consultation is to be credible, it must be followed by decisive action. Lack of funding is not a sufficient reason for doing nothing, bearing in mind that £9 million has been allocated for the building of prisons. Why not spend some of that money where it can do some good? Genuine rehabilitation needs well structured and properly financed medical and probation services and we do not have these.</P>
      <P>Prison health care is substandard. A report published by the Helsinki Institute for Crime Prevention and Control in 1992 showed that the proportion of the Irish prison budget dedicated to health care was the lowest of the 27 Council of Europe states. That is something of which Fianna Fáil and the Minister are proud. The proportion for Ireland stood at 1%, compared to 6% for England and Wales and 9% for Scotland. The ratio to custodial staff was also the lowest, 0.3% compared to 12% in the United Kingdom. Up-to-date statistics from the Irish Prisons Service on health spending are not available but, given the increase in our prison population, the position is likely to have worsened. We spend huge amounts on building prisons but do nothing to improve the services that will assist the unfortunate people incarcerated in them.</P>
      <P>At present there are no full-time doctors in the Irish Prisons Service. Health care services are provided on a sessional basis by local general practitioners whose work does not co-ordinate in any rational way. In other words, they have not drawn up profiles on the prisoners they treat. Psychiatric services are virtually non-existent. There are no psychiatric beds in Mountjoy Prison and it is on this that the Members opposite have the unmitigated gall to compliment themselves. Resources should be made available immediately to provide these services.</P>
      <P>There are no proper measures in place in our prisons to deal with drug misuse. The practices that have been found to be effective outside prisons should be implemented in those prisons. Cloverhill remand assessment centre has to handle a large number of prisoners in the early stages of withdrawal from drugs and alcohol. It has been found in other countries that prisoners on remand suffer from high levels of mental illness and are at a disproportionate risk of suicide. It is crucial that measures are put in place form the start to deal with what are entirely predictable problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" /> There is also a need for much greater investment in the probation services if we are going to look after those who are unfortunate enough to be incarcerated in prison. In addition, the united code of conduct for law enforcement officials must be implemented. Article 6 of that code states that all prison personnel share a duty of care for those in custody. This means that the status of prison medical orderlies, with only six weeks training, needs to be abolished and nurses need to take their rightful place in the system.</P>
    <P>I understand that I have a seconder for my amendment. I cannot imagine how any decent person could stand over the volume of self-congratulatory hot air that has emanated from the other side of the House. The perception of Members opposite does not reflect the reality of the situation I have outlined.</P>

      <P>I can let someone else speak first if this is causing some difficulty. However, I would be quite happy to speak now. I second the amendment.</P>
      <P>I read the motion with some astonishment because of my recent disappointment when the Leader informed me that the mental health Bill will not be taken in the House before Christmas. The Bill was first brought to the House before last Christmas and I was told it was to proceed with the greatest possible speed. If the greatest possible speed is that an extraordinarily important mental health Bill cannot get through the Dáil in a year then I dread to think what is involved if something happens slowly.</P>
      <P>There is a very serious situation concerning prisoners. I would not mind so much if further prison places were being built or refurbished for the sake of the general well-being of prisoners, but that is not why all this prison building is going on. This building seems to be taking place so we can incarcerate more prisoners.</P>
      <P>Being a conscientious man I am sure the Minister read Dr. Enda Dooley's report on the health service in prisons. However, I am sure the Minister was as dismayed as I was at the continuing problems regarding the health of prisoners. At least 10% of prisoners have a serious psychiatric illness and 30% are described as having some sort of psychiatric illness. When one considers that the rate for such illness is about 4% in the general population one has to wonder if a large number of people are in prison because they have a psychiatric illness rather than because they committed a heinous crime.</P>
      <P>I have spoken before in the House about the homeless people I meet on my way home every night on Baggot Street, a considerable number of whom end up in prison. Surveys carried out by different Departments show that about 30% of homeless people admit to suffering from a psychiatric illness and another 30% suffer from alcohol or drug addiction. This is why these people are on the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have continued to point out that many of these people get involved in petty crime, are arrested, convicted and put in jail but cannot get bail because they have no <Col N="1159" /> address. They are kept in jail for a short period of time. The Minister speaks about the revolving door syndrome and people being released early. However, when homeless people are released they have nowhere to go.</P>
    <P>How many hostel places have been built in the past three years? No such places have been built for women. I do not know the number for men but it is very few. How many additional probation officers have been appointed? What increases have been introduced in community work programmes? These are difficult subjects, particularly community work, as there is the issue of supervision. However, people would join the probation service if positions were created. People cannot be supervised when they come out of prison nor can reports be compiled, even on children who come before the courts. Judges have stated it is impossible to continue with cases involving children without such reports.</P>
    <P>It would be monstrous if I applauded the Government for building more prison places when no action is being taken in these areas. If all of these prison places are being built what will be the increase in the number of prison doctors? What will be the position regarding nurses, particularly psychiatric nurses, working in the Prisons Service? The Minister has not addressed these issues.</P>
    <P>My primary concern is that when these people are released from prison, far from coming out to some sort of structured rehabilitation programmes, there is nowhere for them to go. Sometimes when released they have very little money, so what will happen to them? Those of a lesser intellectual ability will become involved in further crimes because that is all that is in front of them. No progress has been made in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not know what would happen if it was not for Sister Ó Caoimhín and her drop-in centre. As far as I know she gets £300,000 per year to run the centre. I think it costs about £50,000 to keep someone in prison. I am sure the Minister has visited the drop-in centre which is extraordinarily compassionate and helpful to people released from prison, yet it is run for the same cost as keeping six people in jail. Why can we not help other people to set up similar programmes? In particular, why can we not provide shelter, support and training for people, particularly young people, released from prison? Many prisoners are institutionalised because they have served many sentences, quite often for petty crimes. It is impossible to see how such people can remain outside prison.</P>
    <P>We have seen serious problems with taxi drivers in the vicinity of Leinster House. When taxi licences are being issued I have asked that the greatest possible care be given to ensuring that people convicted of sex or violent offences are not given licences. This has happened in the past. Many prisoners have been convicted of sexual crimes but are not receiving any form of therapy. <Col N="1160" /> I accept that such people need to show some commitment towards therapy but it is extraordinary that there are no treatment services in the Curragh and only a limited number in Arbour Hill Prison.</P>
    <P>About one third of sex crimes are committed by young people and it would be of great assistance if some form of treatment could be provided for them. If this happens then at least there is a possibility they will not reoffend.</P>
    <P>The new women's prison is very good and the conditions are much better than before. However, even in these conditions, people have committed suicide and others have attempted it. Psychiatric services should be the priority rather than the bricks and mortar. It is mainly personnel who are needed. The Minister is aware that it is mainly junior doctors who run the psychiatric services. They are not in a position to establish long-term therapeutic relationships with their patients. There is nothing in the way of psychology for those people. We put all our money into bricks and mortar and locked doors and expect that to have some effect. If we are just using prisons as holding stations and if there are enthusiasts who feel that at least crime will not be committed by people who are in prison, I presume it is not intended we should incarcerate them forever.</P>
    <P>I examined the position in America, where there has been a major programme of private prison building. Prisons have been built there in a speculative manner and those prisons will be privately run. Those who build them know that if they build them they will be filled. I hate to have to say it, but this prison programme reminds me of that &ndash; the prisons will be there and, therefore, they will be filled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to take this opportunity to highlight the achievement of the Government in developing a prison service of which we can all be proud, in terms of the prison building refurbishment programme, a major achievement in its own right, and the significant advances that continue to be made in developing rehabilitation programmes generally.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 I have presided over an unprecedented investment in our prison infrastructure. Already additional custodial accommodation has been provided at the Midlands Prison, 515 spaces, Cloverhill Remand Prison, 400 spaces, Dóchas Centre, 80 spaces, Castlerea Prison, 152 spaces, and Limerick Prison D Wing, 60 spaces. In all more than 1,200 additional prison spaces have been provided with a further 700 closed spaces on the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new female prison at Mountjoy, the Dóchas Centre, which I opened in October last year, is an example of the necessary accommodation that has been provided. It is one of the most advanced institutions of its kind in the world. The prison has accommodation for 80 women and offenders are accommodated in seven separate houses with mainly single rooms. <Col N="1161" /> There are a limited number of interconnecting rooms for family members and larger rooms for mothers with babies. Each room has a toilet, washbasin and shower installed in an en-suite unit. Each house has a kitchen cum dining area and sitting room. A comprehensive range of support and facilities is provided for the women, including education, life skills, computer skills, physical education, medical services, counselling, a library, a chaplaincy, indoor and outdoor recreation and a training workshop. The general layout of the facility is spacious and open.</P>
    <P>A visitors' waiting area has been provided at Mountjoy Prison which caters for the whole complex. It includes a children's play area and means of providing light refreshments for prison visitors. I am also pleased to confirm that I am planning another similar facility on a smaller scale for prisoners' families in Limerick.</P>
    <P>New accommodation such as we have provided recently will also enable the Prisons Service to commence much needed work on the upgrading and modernisation of some of our older institutions. I am particularly pleased to have approved the commencement of detailed planning for the complete refurbishment of Mountjoy Prison, where a major overhaul is long overdue. It is intended to commence work on the site next year. Is it the provision of accommodation such as this that the counter-proposers find objectionable or short-sighted or would they prefer us to have the Victorian conditions in which our offenders were formerly housed?</P>
    <P>Our investment will ensure that the scandal of the revolving door, with which we lived for so long, will have been brought to a halt for good. Already the number of prisoners on temporary release has fallen from 463 in 1997 compared to just more than 200 at present. Quite recently the governor of Cork Prison informed me that on a comparable day two years ago 125 people were on temporary release or early release from Cork prison, most of them on release on the sole criterion that there was an insufficiency of space. On the same Friday in November 2000, there were just 13 on early release from Cork Prison and all of them were on structured, planned releases. That gives Members an indication of what has happened in our prison service and the transformation that has come about under this Administration.</P>
    <P>Almost all prisoners on early release at present are on structured programmes, in many cases under the direct supervision of the probation and welfare service. Those not on structured programmes have been temporarily released for valid compassionate reasons, ill health or family related circumstances. For the first time in 25 years, we are reaching the stage where we can accommodate all those sentenced by the courts for the full duration of their sentences. The impact of the elimination of unplanned temporary releases on the level of indictable crime is not only clear but irrefutable.</P>
    <P>Aside from ending unplanned releases of offenders, other considerable benefits and oppor<Col N="1162" /> tunities arise from our prison building programme, benefits which are all too frequently overlooked. We are not only bringing to an end the chronic overcrowding which bedevilled our prisons for so many years, we are also in a position to create the conditions in which prisoner rehabilitation, through a coherent process of sentence planning, can take place. Our investment programme, therefore, goes well beyond physical infrastructure to include investment in programmes and activities for persons sentenced to terms of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Such programmes are almost impossible to deliver in overcrowded conditions. Thanks to the investment by the Government, however, the Prisons Service is now in a position to fulfil one of its prime objectives in developing and maintaining an enhanced range of rehabilitative measures that will be made available to all prisoners. In the revolving door period, which peaked under my predecessor in office, prison staff found it almost impossible to motivate prisoners whose only focus was to get temporary release. Equally, participation rates in prisoner education were much lower than they needed to have been. That has all changed in the short period of three years.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year a steering group was established at my instigation to put in place multidisciplinary prisoner programmes. This group, chaired by a senior prison governor, comprises representatives from the Department, senior Prisons Service management, the Probation and Welfare Service, the psychology service, the prisons education service and the Prison Officers Association. Its first task will be to oversee the development of a new rehabilitative programme for sex offenders. Given that we have almost 400 sex offenders serving prison sentences at present, or one in seven of the prisoner population, enhancing treatment programmes for sex offenders in prisons is a priority of the Prisons Service and its director general, Mr. Sean Aylward.</P>
    <P>The structured, offence focused, therapeutic programme for sex offenders, introduced in Arbour Hill Prison in 1994, has been operating successfully since then. Furthermore, generic therapeutic and counselling services for sex offenders have been put in place in the Curragh Prison during the past year and a dedicated, sex offender programme is due to start there shortly. The thinking skills course has been running in Arbour Hill and Cork prisons since 1998 and has recently been introduced in the Curragh Prison. It is designed to target a range of offenders, including sex offenders, particularly with a view to motivating the latter group to engage in the most intensive programmes. The course is run by multidisciplinary teams, including prison officers, probation and welfare staff and teaching staff under the guidance of my Department's psychology service. The success of this course augurs well for the use of multidisciplinary teams to deliver rehabilitative programmes for sex offenders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> An important future development in relation to targeted services for imprisoned sex offenders is the intention to develop a new rehabilitative programme for sex offenders. This programme will be delivered by multidisciplinary teams including prison officers, teachers and other prison disciplines, including the psychology and probation services. This model has been operated satisfactorily in Great Britain over the past number of years and I am anxious to see it developed in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The key element in this project is the drawing up of manuals for the delivery of this treatment approach and the selection and training methodology for the staff involved. A contract has been placed with an experienced professional to carry out this work which will be completed in the new year. The objective is for the Prisons Service to develop and put in place a wider range of rehabilitative programmes for sex offenders than are currently available to ensure they operate on independently accredited selection, training and service methods and that they reach every sex offender in custody who is willing to participate at some level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention.</P>
    <P>Another example of a successful multidisciplinary approach has been the Connect project. This project focuses on prisoners' transition from custody, through training, to reintegration in the community after release and labour market participation. The first stage of the Connect project commenced in February 1998. It was EU funded and involved a collaboration between my Department, the Prison Service and the National Training and Development Institute, part of the Rehab group. The project was developed and brought forward in a manner that involved extensive consultation and partnership within the prisons with the probation and prison education services and with the wider community.</P>
    <P>Connect has been designed as an individualised, person centred, employment and social inclusion initiative and is intended to move the offender from welfare to work, from a lifestyle of income dependency or worse to a positive role in society. A key feature in the project is the central role of prison officers, who play a key mentoring role for all participants and are a vital part of the multi-disciplinary team involved in the process. The multi-disciplinary approach is the only way forward in prisoner rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>The main result from the first stage of the Connect project was the creation of a process which could easily benefit prisoners in their preparation for employment after release. There were also some interesting facts and figures: a total of 174 prisoners, both men and women, participated in the first stage and of them, 76 have been released. Of the 76 who were released, 26% went straight out to jobs, starting immediately, 7% went out to further training, 5% went out to residential drug <Col N="1164" /> treatment and 58% dropped out of contact with the services.</P>
    <P>Most remarkably and significantly, of the 76 who were released only 4% have been returned to prison. This needs to be set against a national pattern of 70% recidivism in the prison system generally. All this information will be contained in a detailed project report which will be published later in the year. The Connect project made great strides and achieved real changes for individual prisoners and their families. It was admittedly on a small scale but produced striking results. Fortified by the evident success of the first stage of the Connect project, I sought agreement from my Government colleagues last year to make a £46 million provision in the national development plan for its expansion to the other prisons.</P>
    <P>Drug treatment is another area in which we have made significant advances in recent times. A closed institution such as a prison provides a unique opportunity to address the issue of substance misuse and the Prisons Service strategy seeks to do so by targeting supply, reducing demand and minimising harm. Supply is targeted with improved screening facilities in our institutions, demand is reduced through a wide range of treatment options available in all prison institutions as part of the general medical services available to all inmates and harm is minimised through improved general health education.</P>
    <P>Efforts to reduce the supply of drugs in the prison system are being pursued vigorously and in this regard a number of measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling into and use of illegal drugs in the prison system. These include video surveillance, improved visiting and searching facilities, increased vigilance by staff and urine testing. This policy has been further strengthened in Cloverhill remand prison and the new Midlands Prison by the extensive use of screened visits.</P>
    <P>Any offender who is willing to make a real effort to stop abusing drugs and who shows the necessary commitment and motivation is supported by appropriate medical intervention and therapeutic counselling. Intensive treatment has been available in the drug treatment unit which has been in operation in Mountjoy Prison's health care unit since July 1996 The unit is modelled on similar hospital-based units in the community. Almost 300 prisoners have been admitted to this drug treatment unit since it opened.</P>
    <P>There are a number of options available where inmates have completed the detoxification programme. For example, they can continue to serve their sentence in the general prison population, they may, if considered suitable, be granted temporary release to continue treatment with an outside agency or they may transfer to the drug free unit at the training unit adjacent to Mountjoy Prison. This unit provides a sympathetic, yet closely <Col N="1165" /> monitored setting in which those prisoners who are in the process of coming to terms with their addiction and who have achieved a stable drug free status can serve out their sentences in an environment free from the temptations and risks associated with illicit drugs. The regime in the drug free unit also provides inmates with valuable opportunities in the form of a wide range of work-related and training-related activities to assist in the rehabilitative process.</P>
    <P>The drug treatment unit has proved to be a success and its successful completion rate stands at 95%. It has been proven that prisoners who are motivated and who are given an opportunity to engage in a structured detoxification and rehabilitation programme and whose environment is made drug free through strict regulation of visits will successfully stay off illicit drugs. The action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system which I approved last year provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders and reduce the supply of drugs in the prison system. This includes the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of addiction counselling support services is central to the plan, which builds on a medical policy that has been agreed between my Department and the Eastern Regional Health Authority in that it seeks to provide the same access to treatment for prisoners as patients have within the community.</P>
    <P>The Prisons Service has established a national steering group for prison-based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group, chaired by the Prisons Service Director General, comprises representatives from my Department, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, senior prisons service management, the probation and welfare service, the prisons psychology service and the prisons education service. The idea is to work closely with other agencies with experience in this area. Our objective is to replicate in prison to the maximum extent possible the level of medical and other supports available in the community outside. I am confident that this approach has the support of all my colleagues in Government. They and I now want to see early action on the ground, at prison level in the deployment of all necessary medical and other supports to deal with this serious issue.</P>
    <P>A further significant development has been the recent opening of a new drug free area within St. Patrick's Institution. The aim of this unit is to assist young offenders aged between 16 and 21 years, many of whom are serving their first custodial sentence, in combating their drug addiction. This is expected to reduce the risk of these prisoners re-offending in the future and increase their prospects of securing employment on release by remaining drug free. I was very impressed by the presence of parents of some of <Col N="1166" /> the boys in the unit at the dedication ceremony for this wing in St. Patrick's Institution recently. They were very relieved and gratified to see this development, long overdue though it may be.</P>
    <P>However, I remain just as committed, in the case of those offenders whom the courts deem suitable for sanctions other than custody, to facilitating the use of community supervision and sanctions. There are at present about 4,600 individuals under the supervision of the probation and welfare service. Since 1998 I have approved funding for 12 additional projects under the guidance of the service. There are approximately 50 such projects in operation around the country, all of which are community-based, dealing with areas such as drugs aftercare, alcohol treatment for offenders before the courts, youth service projects, community reparation and offender-victim mediation. Further such projects will continue to be developed in co-operation with the probation and welfare service and under the national development plan. The budget for the service will increase to over £25 million next year, a 100% increase since I became Minister.</P>
    <P>Custodial sanctions, however, apply in every civilised society. They are imposed for a variety of reasons, including, most importantly, the protection of the public. As such they play a vital role in the overall criminal justice system. The whole edifice of justice, therefore, including the architecture of community sanctions I have referred to, depends on the custodial places being available to guarantee offenders that the sanction of last resort is there if they do not avail of the other lawful options open to them.</P>
    <P>The past three years have seen rapid development and change across the Prisons Service generally. Under the guidance of the Prisons Authority Interim Board, which I appointed last year, and the Director General of the Prisons Service, Mr. Seán Aylward, the management and functions of the Prisons Service are moving to a new independent agency. I intend to bring forward the necessary legislation to give formal effect to this change next year. The changeover to independent agency status is required in order to best achieve progress on a range of important issues. I am confident that time will prove the period since 1997 to have been the most significant in the history of the State's prisons. Over that period I have presided over three key developments: the replacement and expansion of the stock of prisoner accommodation, halting the &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; syndrome; the extension of prisoner programmes for sex offenders, drug dependent prisoners and to train and place offenders into gainful employment; and the putting in place of identifiable, accountable leadership for the Prisons Service.</P>
    <P>Regarding some of the issues raised, we have been looking at the probation and welfare service. I established an expert review group, which has reported to me, so that we might look at that <Col N="1167" /> service in general terms to see how it might be improved. Obviously, additional staff were required and I obtained permission from Government to appoint 40 new officers. The difficulty has been that there has been a very poor response to the advertisements for this position, which is most unfortunate. We have an ongoing competition, however, and we have had 300 applications, with ongoing interviews.</P>
    <P>I am building pre-release hostels in Cork and Limerick. I intend to build a pre-release halfway house in the Mountjoy refurbishment for as many as 70 offenders. As for medical treatment, it is difficult to recruit doctors. We have a full-time doctor in the midlands prison. Experience has shown that recruitment of doctors into the public sector is particularly difficult. I dearly wish we had more but the position is that there is a difficulty in getting people to apply.</P>
    <P>The whole question of electronic monitoring or tagging of sex offenders was raised. I am watching with great interest developments in electronic tagging, including voice tagging. However, our courts have suggested a type of tagging that has only recently become available in the United States. When I have firm results from the United States, I will certainly consider the issue. Incidentally, tagging was introduced in Scotland in 1998 and after six months only five court orders had been made. The set-up cost of electronic tagging is in the region of £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of there being a prisons inspector, the whole concept of developing an inspectorate attracts me greatly and it will be examined favourably in the context of the new Prisons Bill. That is not to say it is my intention to dispense with the visiting committees, which are very successful. The people who serve on them do so voluntarily and they are very dedicated.</P>
    <P>The concept of restorative justice was also raised as if it did not exist in my thinking. It does, and for the first time in the history of the State the new Children Bill, which is before the Dáil, embraces the concept of restorative justice. The entire philosophy underlying the Children Bill, where I intend to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years, is that the young person should face the consequences of his or her actions, if possible by facing the victim, if the victim would agree, in a family conference type setting. Restorative justice is the main plank of that legislation or, to put it another way, it is the philosophy which underlies the legislation. The Children Bill is the most revolutionary criminal legislation in many decades and it has been published anew following intensive research internationally. Restorative justice is very much on the cards. The very last option we want to consider in the context of the Children Bill is the option of incarceration. I want to try to get young people to face up <Col N="1168" /> to the consequences of their actions and thereby ensure that repeat offending is minimised or eradicated in many cases.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the psychology service in the prisons, in December of 1998 I approved the establishment of an expert group to review and report on the future role, needs, structure and organisation of the psychology service, and the report was published in August of 1999. Over the past 14 months, the number of psychologists employed by the Prisons Service has increased from five to ten, in other words, it has doubled. That is an indication of the value which I place on that service. In addition, the recruitment of further psychologists for the prison service is under way.</P>
    <P>I share the views expressed in relation to Sr. Ó Caoimhín. I have a prison working party assisting her building programme at Ballinascorney because I see great merit in the work she is doing.</P>
    <P>I note from the amendment to the motion that I am accused of imagining things. I have been accused of a lot since becoming Minister but this is the first time I have been accused of imagining things. I am not imagining anything because the reality is that the rehabilitation measures which people speak about here in the House &ndash; the need to educate, train and integrate people back into society &ndash; is simply not achievable in Victorian institutions and, like it or not, that is what we had. People who call for rehabilitation on the one hand and condemn the prison building programme on the other are contradicting themselves. Any fair-minded, objective analysis of the prison building programme will show that measures of rehabilitation, training and education are now in place in modern settings in new buildings. Far from seeking to incarcerate people for the sake of incarcerating them, I have resolutely sought to ensure that the rehabilitation measures were put in place, and they are in place in the new institutions. The people who condemn the prison building programme fail to say that Mountjoy Prison was ignored by successive Administrations&mdash;</P>

We are changing that and for the first time we will refurbish Mountjoy Prison, starting next year. That has been an objective of mine over a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, the objective of the exercise was also to restore respect for the criminal justice system. When I came into office, and I do not say this boastfully, respect for the criminal justice system had gone out the window because everybody knew that a sentence handed down by the courts was simply not enforced. A person going into pri<Col N="1169" /> son was in a position where he or she would be released without ever serving the sentence the courts had handed down. We cannot have a criminal justice system operating like that. It is bound to lose the respect of the public and the respect of the people who are convicted and sentenced by the courts. If evidence is required of this it must surely be the crucial fact that proper education and training programmes could not be put in place for most prisoners for the simple reason that the Prisons Service did not know from day to day whether that individual would be there the following week.</P>

      <P>The fact that crime under this Administration has been reduced by a stupendous 21% in three years, while the prison population has increased, must surely serve as cogent evidence that there has to be a connection. People might not like the fact that there is a connection but there is one. That does not mean, nor did I ever say, that people would be incarcerated for that reason alone. Incarceration is not an end in itself. I am duty bound to protect the public and the objective of the prison building programme is not only to ensure this but also to ensure that individuals are given the opportunity in prison to organise their lives in such a way that they can have a stake in society. That has been the clear objective across the prison building programme and no one who examined the new prisons would deny that.</P>

      <P>The reality is that at any one time the number of people in prison for the non-payment of a debt or fine is 1% or less of the entire prison population.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the inspectorate, restorative justice and rehabilitation in so far as I can during the limited time available. I accept fully the need to address white collar crime and that is why tomorrow in the Dáil I will introduce the new criminal justice Bill. This Bill will provide for the first time for simplified definitions of what have been complicated criminal offences, for example, embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, larceny and forgery. The simple theme running through the legislation is that a person who dishonestly makes a gain or causes a loss will be found guilty of an offence and the jury will understand precisely that he is so guilty. The difficulty with present day definitions is that juries sometimes find it difficult to comprehend the sheer complexity of what is charged and, unfortunately, it can lead to people being acquitted when they might not otherwise be acquitted &ndash; I use the words &ldquo;might not&rdquo; advisedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issues of health and psychiatric illness, I indicated that the number of psychologists in prison has been doubled. One of the tragic, unfortunate facts of life is that there is a high level of mental illness in prisons and this is why I have <Col N="1171" /> sought to improve the medical service. I readily accept that the service needs further improvement and it is my intention to continue to try to improve the health service and education and other services which would assist in the physical and mental well-being of prisoners. The new Connect project is very exciting in terms of rehabilitating members of the prison population.</P>
    <P>As I said at the opening of Cloverhill Prison, in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform even our good news is bad news. We have to try to make the best of it for those people at the bottom of life's pile. This is why I hope the prison building programme and measures for prisoners will help people at the bottom of the pile climb some way up the ladder, always being mindful of the fact that the public is entitled to be protected and must be protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the building, refurbishment and rehabilitative programmes in the prison system. When these programmes are complete, the number of prison places will have doubled from approximately 2,000 to 4,000. During the mid-1930s virtually all local prisons were closed, with the result that the number of prison places was greatly depleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years the Prisons Service has become much more open, for example, personnel have become more courteous and one receives a much better response to questions than was the case previously. The move towards the establishment of an independent prison board with a director <Col N="1172" /> general is the proper approach. Such an operational agency would be better able to come to grips with the complex issues which arise in relation to prisons.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined his wonderful plans and the steps he has taken, which mainly consists of a prison building programme. When one looks at the other measures, one sees that they are rehabilitation and refurbishment plans for the future. Mountjoy Prison is the most Victorian of all prisons, yet it still has not been refurbished, while the system of incarceration, toilet facilities etc., are the same as they were 150 years ago. Prison buildings are a monument to the inaction of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Probation and Welfare Service was very much opposed to the opening of the new prison in the midlands on the grounds that it was not satisfied enough was being done on the other side of the coin, that is, the rehabilitative programme. The Minister's thinking is that the more prison spaces that are created, the more opportunity there will be to refurbish other sections of the prison and to put in place rehabilitation programmes. This is good in theory but it is not happening in practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the whole edifice of justice depends on custodial places being available to guarantee offenders that the sanction of last resort is there for them. Of course, it is the sanction of last resort for a small section of the population, that is, those at the lower end of the spectrum, the less well off, the poor and the marginalised. The people who go to prison have a similar profile and a rehabilitative programme must ensure that there is a reception process for prisoners from once they leave the court until they arrive in prison.</P>
    <P>Under the current reception process, a prisoner has to strip and take a shower, after which he is weighed and his belongings are checked before he is put away. However, a reception process that would ascertain what are a prisoner's needs and what is his background would form an assessment and it could be determined from the beginning how an individual should spend his term in prison. He should be prepared for his release from the day he enters prison.</P>
    <P>If a prisoner's criminality is associated with a drug problem, he should immediately be offered the option of taking up a drugs programme within or without the prison walls or a combination of both. If a prisoner has poor skills, has received little or no training and has poor employment prospects, a range of options should be provided for him. That is not happening and there is no movement in that direction. These programmes should be geared towards release so that there is a link between what happens from the moment an individual sets foot in the prison system and the moment he returns to the community. Unless one adopts such an integrated approach one will <Col N="1173" /> not be successful. There has been little preparation for a move in that direction.</P>
    <P>I am delighted there is a plan to develop a therapeutic process for sex offenders. It is only a few years since prison authorities said there was no reason to put such a programme in place because sex offenders were not amenable to it. However, they now say they will provide a programme but it still has not been undertaken. Sex offenders comprise a large portion of the prison population.</P>
    <P>The drug rehabilitation programme is not adequate. Thankfully, the health boards are being brought on board and I hope a programme similar to that run in the education system will be adopted so that the treatment provided to drug offenders in prison will be available when they re-enter the community.</P>
    <P>A full-time inspector of prisons has still not been appointed. I have had a motion in this regard on the Order Paper for some time. An independent inspector is needed on a full-time basis. I still receive many complaints about what is happening in prison. Only yesterday a mother informed me about a senior officer in one of our main prisons. Her young son was being taunted and the other prisoners were told that they could get drugs from him. He had been off drugs for three years and was determined to stay off them, yet he was being presented as a drug pusher.</P>
    <P>The composition and operation of visiting committees must be changed. It is absolutely incredible that the best people on the Mountjoy Prison visiting committee come from the kingdom of Kerry. That is not the way it should be. Many issues have yet to be addressed. The Minister could usefully consider a package which would include a much wider range of measures than prison building or prison refurbishment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In the limited time at my disposal I aim to make three points. I am satisfied with the Minister's account of his work to date. The building programme he has undertaken has provided the opportunity for a much more benign prison regime. For example, he pointed out that the revolving door syndrome had been brought to an end. That at least will mean that prisoners will be given the time and space to be rehabilitated rather than releasing them unprepared for the outside world. That is a plus and a move in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the provision of the new extension to the women's prison in Mountjoy. I visited the prison on two occasions and I had nightmares when I saw the layer of despair that had settled over the lives of young women there who were wasting away, without rehabilitation of any consequence being provided. Life prospects have been changed for such women and I hope in their new environment they will at least be afforded an opportunity to look forward to a decent, ordinary <Col N="1174" /> life when they leave prison. We have created the conditions for that and it is a major step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Connect project is the correct project. It is an integrated project which prepares prisoners to change their ways so that they can live an ordinary, decent life when they leave prison, but I caution that there is a great need to put a halfway house in place. No matter how systematic or rigorous is the education programme people cannot be transported from the rigid structured day to day routine of prison to the outside world. There is a gross need to follow up on the Connect project, which is well intentioned and well framed, by providing halfway house and hostel accommodation before prisoners are released.</P>
    <P>I appeal strongly to employers to provide job opportunities for people who have been in prison and to play their part in helping to rehabilitate them. I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Hanafin, is present. There should be a shift in emphasis in allocating resources. Resources are primarily provided for rehabilitating prisoners and preparing them to leave prison. More resources should be allocated to preventing people from entering prison in the first instance.</P>
    <P>In that respect I appeal to the Minister of State to use her influence to bring the juvenile justice Bill to fruition. I am deeply disappointed in this regard. In 1990 I was chairman of an all-party select committee on justice which spent 12 months formulating a report which we believed would be the basis of pending legislation. The report was published in 1991 and ten years later a juvenile justice Bill still has not been introduced. It is not to the credit of Administrations in the intervening period that such legislation was not brought forward and enacted. Any self-respecting society would want to put in place a juvenile justice system which would aim to protect young people, prevent them from lapsing into a life of crime and, if possible, keep them out of prison. Will the Minister of State bring forward that legislation?</P>
    <P>The entire philosophy of the legislation is very much in keeping with the committee's report. The concept of restorative justice is correct. Young people must be brought face to face with the consequences of their crimes and the victims of their crimes. That is the most important thing we could do for our young people. However, unless the law is introduced that will not happen. It is not to our credit that we still operate under children's legislation which was enacted before the foundation of the State in 1908. The Minister of State with responsibility for the protection of children should do her best to fast-forward that legislation.</P>
    <P>Moving forward, there has been a change in approach and attitude and it is nice to see that <Col N="1175" /> white collar crime merchants are taking their rightful place in prison.</P>

The motion should be taken seriously.</P>
      <P>A case was made to knock down all our prisons and leave the criminals out on the street again. We are the legislators. If those who said so do not wish to put people in prison, they should not on the next occasion criminal justice legislation is being debated seek a higher prison sentence or that a person should go to prison if he or she fails to pay a fine. That is exactly what they have been talking about, that these people, such as those who do not pay fines, should not go to prison. No matter what the Minister says or does, it will still be a bit of a joke in the eyes of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The Minister is committed to ending crime, if possible. He would be the happiest man alive if he could level every prison in Ireland and we could have a society free of criminals. Is someone trying to tell me that the murderers of Veronica Guerin should be released? Is that what Senator Norris wants? What about the people he complained about who urinated outside his door and whom he wanted put in prison?</P>

    <Title>Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill, 1998: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which will enable us to ratify the Hague Convention of 1996 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and co-operation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children. Why has there been a time lapse of two years in introducing the Bill in the Seanad? Is this due to the volume of legislation which has had to be processed before it?</P>
      <P>The purpose of the convention is to provide better protection for children under easily identifiable rules of private international law. The Bill will give the convention the force of law and will give effect to its provisions in their application in the State. The Bill and the convention do not apply to persons over the age of 18 years, paternity, adoption decisions, social security, general public welfare measures, criminal matters or asylum and emigration. The convention states that it will deal with rights of custody, relocation and visitation in so far as they are international. It does not deal with guardianship, fostering placement and matters relating to children's property.</P>
      <P>One of the most important aspects of the treaty is that it gives jurisdiction over custody to the country of the child's habitual residence. If the habitual residence changes, jurisdiction changes. For children such as refugees who have no habitual residence, the country in which they are located will have jurisdiction. All this is laudable.</P>
      <P>The treaty allows countries to transfer jurisdiction to other signatory countries and suggests that such countries might be those where the child has nationality &ndash; this is very acceptable &ndash; where a divorce case is pending between the child's parents and with which the child has a substantial connection. The most important aspect is that before accepting jurisdiction the new country is required to consider whether accepting the child would be in his or her best interests.</P>
      <P>Mary Banotti is rapporteur in the push by the French Presidency towards a particular regulation aimed at ensuring right of access for non-custodial parents. This matter is a source of some concern in a number of states, particularly France and Germany. Parents seem to be running into problems in this area. Justice Ministers may not agree on the issue. There is a meeting scheduled for 8 December in Nice. There is also a need for ministerial attention at the Council of Ministers in March to further develop the convention. I ask the Minister to attend and support the convention.</P>
      <P>Parental alienation syndrome, the alienation of one parent from the child, has come to the fore in the United States of America. It is given a high status in court in cases where there is a denial or change of custody. In some states this is a criminal offence.</P>
      <P>For some time we have had a central authority dealing specifically with all issues relating to child abduction. I have the figures up to and including 1998. The total number of cases dealt with under the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991, was 1,016, of which 584 were the subject of application to the central authority. Many of the cases related to abductions between the United Kingdom and Ireland, nine related to other EU member states and 9% to the United States. I am glad Ireland was one of the first countries to deal with the issue and is to the fore in handling such cases, many of which are referred to the High Court, the judges of which are <i>au fait</i> with the procedure involved. This is not always the case in other countries where cases are dealt with by a more minor magistrate who would not be<i> au fait</i> with the procedure involved in what is a very delicate and sensitive area.</P>
      <P>The national children's strategy was launched recently on which I laud the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin. I would prefer the establishment of a full ministry for children to the establishment of a Cabinet sub-committee of relevant Ministers chaired by the Taoiseach to ensure its implementation. While I appreciate that this is a justice issue and that there is an overlap &ndash; this is reflected in the fact that I am speaking as my party's spokesperson on health and children, was preceded by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and will be followed by the Minister of State &ndash; fragmentation could be avoided by the establishment of a ministry for children. I accept there is a need for an ombudsman for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> Because this is such a positive Bill I am very anxious that it proceed. We are already two years behind. I hope it will have a swift and speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, and commend this very important legislation to the Seanad. I compliment my colleague, Senator Jackman, on being brief and to the point. In researching the issue, I read extracts of some of the contributions in the Lower House where the debate ranged from paedophile rings and child sex abuse to homeless children and related matters. By comparison, the contribution of my colleague was to the point and remained within the scope of the legislation, which has nothing whatsoever to do with paedophile rings, child sex abuse or homeless children. It purports to deal with civil law, not criminal law, and it is important to make that distinction.</P>
      <P>The Bill will enable us to ratify the Hague Convention of 1996 on jurisdiction and other matters concerning the protection of children. This is crucially important when one considers that we are dealing with such matters as guardianship and the custody of infants and access to children, which is defined in the Bill to mean people of 18 years or younger.</P>
      <P>The crux of the matter is that within the European Union &ndash; this is a UN convention which applies across the world &ndash; there are many different systems of law. For example, like the United Kingdom, we operate the common law system. On the other hand, French, German and Italian law is based on the Napoleon code, a system of civil law of slightly different complexion. This highlights the need for coherence, consistency and synchronisation of law across the European Union in dealing with matters of jurisdiction. The scope of the Bill is confined to a number of prime issues. One is to determine the state whose authorities have jurisdiction to take measures directed to the protection of the person or property of a child. This is important.</P>
      <P>Another central issue is to ensure and determine that any issues regarding the protection of children or of property related to children will be dealt with concisely and in an efficient manner and that the vulnerable person who is the subject of any such application, being the child or a person of minor age, would not be thwarted or frustrated by the various jurisdictions, laws and courts. This also applies to orders made by health boards. The convention will determine which law is to be applied by such authorities in exercising their jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention uses the term &ldquo;habitually resides&rdquo;. That is the crux of the issue. The jurisdiction where the child habitually resides will determine which jurisdiction or state will take precedence when dealing with the issue of domi<Col N="1182" /> cile. We are familiar with the terms &ldquo;normally resident&rdquo; or &ldquo;usually resident&rdquo; but the phrase &ldquo;habitually resides&rdquo; is new to me and denotes the domicile for the purposes of which state law comes into effect.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman mentioned the delay of over two years since this matter was debated in the Lower House. It is important to note, however, that only two states, Switzerland and the Czech Republic, have adopted the convention. Ireland is ahead of other European countries. This is an important issue and we should not drag our heels when dealing with it. I presume the Bill will become law prior to the Christmas recess or early in the new year. The Hague Convention follows on the 1991 convention which deals with the abduction of children. Ireland ratified it and it is working well.</P>
    <P>There is another important aspect to the Bill which should be noted, the establishment of the central authority for the purpose of assisting children who are involved in these legal wrangles involving different states. The world's population is relatively mobile and there is free movement of persons within the EU. There is freedom to travel from eastern Europe to the British Isles and throughout the Mediterranean countries. In such circumstances, it is possible that one parent might live in Italy, for example, and the other might live in Ireland. A row could develop where one parent might have custody and control of the child and the other is seeking a basic right, such as access. It is in that type of environment one can see the importance of this Bill.</P>
    <P>To ensure the Bill is effective, all EU countries and other international states should adopt the convention. If the convention is not adopted by a country, it cannot be a player when dealing with cases of custody, parental responsibility and related matters. I welcome this timely legislation. It deals with another strand of the child care issue. Various Ministers in this Government have taken a keen interest and a progressive and proactive role in producing an atmosphere of responsibility and care for our young people.</P>
    <P>This Bill highlights the rights and privileges of people under 18 years of age and in that context it is most important. I hope it will get a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with parental responsibility. I have been grateful to the Minister of State in the past for the concern she showed about the movement of children around the world who were the responsibility of people other than their parents. Two years ago, when the Minister of State was newly appointed, I brought it to her attention in the course of an Adjournment debate that adoption agencies from third countries were operating in this country. I suggested that this was undesirable and that only our adoption agencies or adoption agencies in the <Col N="1183" /> child's country of origin should be involved in the adoption of children. I was extremely grateful for her immediate action on that issue.</P>
      <P>I have just returned from eastern Europe where I had the privilege of giving a lecture. To my horror, people there are most concerned about the trafficking of children, particularly children from Russia. On television I watched the arrest of a man and his mother who were the uncle and grandmother of a five year old child who was being sold for $90,000. Bizarre suggestions have been made that the child, who was shown in the car with the people who intended to drive him away, was being sold for his organs. I cannot say whether this was correct. I watched it on television in Bratislava and it was recorded in Russia. It is difficult to think that children who are in orphanages could be so vulnerable.</P>
      <P>This legislation is more than welcome but a great deal more time and thought must be given to the trafficking of children. The Minister of State will be aware of the arrests which took place recently in Italy where a huge paedophile ring was exposed involving children who had been trafficked from Russia. I am most grateful for the interest she is taking in this issue.</P>
      <P>The most frequent occurrence is the removal of children by an aggrieved parent, who is in dispute with the other parent, from one jurisdiction to another. Of course, we must sign this convention. I congratulate Senator Quinn on bringing to the attention of the Leader of the House the fact that the Bill had languished for a long time on the Order Paper. I am sure the Minister of State would have liked to have pushed it forward as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary to think that there are between 100 and 200 of these cases in this country every year. About the same number of children come into the country as are removed from it. It is not, therefore, a distant problem. I am concerned, however, that the Bill appears to apply only to marital children. I note that the Minister of State's official is shaking his head. I am delighted. Many children are born outside marriage so I am relieved that it applies to those who have parental responsibility for the child. That is most important. Otherwise a large number of children would not be covered by the legislation.</P>
      <P>The free travel area between Ireland and Great Britain means it is particularly easy for people to come here with children. It is also easy for people to move around in the Schengen agreement area. Sometimes children are taken extraordinary distances. Mary Banotti, MEP, who is the President's adviser in this area, had to go to Western Samoa at one time in pursuit of a child who was the subject of a dispute between an Irish mother and a German father. Court orders are easily ignored by parents when they are intent on scoring points off each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> I have no desire to delay the House any longer. I wish, however, to congratulate the Minister of State on the firm action she has taken in respect of the areas to which I refer. I hope that, at any ministerial meetings she attends in Europe, she will do her utmost to ensure that the trafficking of children from eastern Europe is given careful consideration. This problem is of great concern to people living there who are anxious, particularly in light of the advent of a new and enlarged European Union, about children who might be transported through their countries on their way to western Europe where, unfortunately, most of the money is to be made from these appalling transactions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this legislation which provides for mutual contact between contracting countries in relation to the care and welfare of children, makes particular provision in respect of parental responsibility and sets out other measures for the protection of children. Most of us are disappointed that the Bill, which was debated in the Lower House last year, is only coming before the House now. We often bemoan the fact that so much legislation passes through this House only to gather dust while waiting to be dealt with by the Lower House, but the reality is that there is far more legislation passed by the Lower House which is awaiting introduction in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>This important issue was dealt with under the heads of a Bill prepared by Mervyn Taylor in 1996. The previous Administration's legislation dealing with this matter was almost ready to be introduced when it left office. That would have been apt, given that the Hague Convention had only been agreed and its measures could have been incorporated into law at that stage. The substance of the Bill before us had already been agreed by the time the current Government entered office.</P>
      <P>It would have been good if we had been able to ratify the convention in law at an earlier stage in order that we could take the initiative in respect of the protection of children. There is not much point in our introducing legislation to ratify a convention unless there are other contracting countries. The Minister of State provided no indication of the number of contracting countries that exist. Unless we have a reciprocal arrangement with other countries, any measures we introduce will be irrelevant. We cannot deal with children who pass into our jurisdiction from another unless that jurisdiction has passed this convention into law. Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate the other countries that have signed up to the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed Ireland is quite far behind other countries in terms of making statutory provision for the protection of children. The Minister of State will be aware that we are still awaiting <Col N="1185" /> the introduction of the juvenile justice Bill which will replace the 1908 legislation. Perhaps she will indicate when that Bill will come before us. It is outrageous that almost a full century has passed since the area of juvenile justice has been tackled by the Legislature. In addition, it is scandalous that the age of criminal responsibility still stands at seven.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen introduced a Bill dealing with this matter in 1996 but its passage was never completed. Four years have passed and the Government has neither re-introduced that Bill so that it could be amended or produced its own Bill. I understand the Minister of State intends to introduce legislation on this matter. Will she indicate when it will appear because a serious lacuna exists in terms of the lack of provisions for children at risk?</P>
    <P>There are serious difficulties in the area of juvenile justice, particularly in terms of parental responsibility. There are far more dysfunctional families now than was previously the case. The Garda Síochána is constantly complaining about its inability to encourage parents to become involved in caring for children who are at risk.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the most advantageous approach might be to incorporate in the Constitution the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Perhaps that could be done by means of a constitutional amendment which would mean that the rights of children would be enshrined in the Constitution. We would then be well to the fore in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>A tribunal is currently investigating incidents of child abuse, some of which were highlighted on the television programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;. We have not fully dealt with the problem of child abuse in this jurisdiction. We have been slow to deal with matters involving the protection of children and there are a number of actions pending in relation to children who were in the care of the State, which did not exercise a proper level of responsibility in dealing with them. We must put our own house in order in respect of this area and we will then be able to deal with matters involving other contracting countries, as envisaged under the legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of free legal aid must also be considered. If free legal aid is not available, parents who are poor will not have equal access to the law. I am concerned about the legal aspects of establishing a central authority. I am also concerned about the question of parental responsibility. What is the position <i>vis-à-vis </i>providing free legal aid to someone taking a case in a country adjacent to Ireland, such as Northern Ireland or England, or one farther afield in Europe or elsewhere? Travel is part and parcel of people's everyday lives and children move between jurisdictions in greater frequency and in larger numbers than heretofore.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> I welcome this legislation which places on the Statute Book a measure which should have been there a few years ago. There are many other matters which should also be dealt with by way of statute. The legislation will not have much meaning unless we put in place other legislation that enshrines in law the aspects of parental responsibility we consider important. We cannot very well deal with contracting countries without that level of concern and provision being expressed in statute. We must know precisely where we stand and we should no longer rely on provisions that were put in place almost a century ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh, agus gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí uilig as an méad a dúirt siad.</P>
      <P>Even though this legislation is restricted, it encompasses many areas. We could discuss a number of those areas at length and I thank the Senators for their comments in respect of them. The debate has shown that the international dimensions of child protection are becoming more acknowledged whether they arise in the context of runaway teenagers or otherwise displaced children, the cross-frontier exploitation or abuse of children or the breakdown of international marriages.</P>
      <P>As the preamble to the convention indicates, its provisions were framed to take into account the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which was ratified by Ireland in September 1992. The recent publication of the national children's strategy goes a long way towards fulfilling our role in implementing the convention in relation to the rights of children. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in effect, a bill of rights for children, and the Hague Convention of 1996 promise to form one important strand in the legal fabric required for the effective international protection of children.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman referred to the 1980 convention. Article 50 of the 1996 convention, which we are discussing, provides that the 1980 convention, which as Senator Jackman pointed out has worked well, has priority over the present convention in abduction cases. When a child has been wrongfully removed the return of that child is still the main priority. Article 50 is given effect by section 12 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jackman asked for figures on the child abduction central authority. I do not have those figures to hand but I will ensure they are forwarded to the Senator. The Senator also referred to the draft EU regulation on the mutual enforcement of access orders. Some time ago the House passed a motion approving Ireland's opting into consideration of this measure. The significance of the draft regulation is that an access order of one EU state would be enforceable in another member state without the need for a declaration of <Col N="1187" /> enforceability in the latter state. This is not the case with the present legislation. Under section 3(2), the request for the enforcement of foreign orders, whether regarding access or other matters, must be made to the District Court.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello and Jackman raised the time lapse in bringing the Bill to the House. The Bill was published in 1998 but only passed through the Dáil in April 2000. Senator Costello rightly said that the pressure of the parliamentary programme delayed the Bill. However, Senator O'Donovan pointed out that the fact that only two states have ratified the convention means we are still ahead of the posse.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman expressed disappointment that the children portfolio is not a full ministry. Much as I would like to be a Cabinet Minister, even I must admit it is not possible to take responsibility for children away from Departments dealing with education, the family and health. At the launch of the national children's strategy, the Taoiseach pointed out that creating a Minister for children would lead to a Department comprising three quarters of the Government. The Cabinet sub-committee and the national children's office, which will be a permanent office established on an interdepartmental basis, will carry out the co-ordinating role we have all recognised as essential for dealing with all issues regarding children. The fact that this office will come from and work with different Departments will ensure that each Department plays its role in implementing the strategy. The expanded role of the Minister of State with responsibility for children will be to ensure that the strategy works, and I will see to that.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to our joint concern about adoption agencies. I visited some of the orphanages in Russia and welcome the Russian Government's decision to clamp down on the system in that country. This decision makes it difficult for us to facilitate adoptions for Irish parents in the interim. However, once the system has been properly worked out it will guarantee that Russian children who are available for adoption and who come to this country will do so with the full consent and legal backing of Russia. This is very important in the interests of the child and protecting children.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello asked about the Children Bill. This is very important legislation under which detention will be a last resort. The Bill is on Com<Col N="1188" /> mittee Stage in the Dáil. The committee is to hear submissions from a number of groups next week and the week after and will then debate the Bill. This Bill is at quite an advanced stage in the Dáil and I look forward to debating it in this House as it is important legislation which will overhaul our juvenile justice system.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello also raised the possibility of a constitutional amendment. One of the suggestions of the constitutional committee some time ago was for an amendment to the Constitution to underpin the rights of children as children, and not as citizens. This is also one of the recommendations of the national children's strategy. Copies of the strategy were circulated to Senators and we might have an opportunity to discuss it at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The points made concerning child abuse are important and valuable. Real progress has been made regarding the publication and implementation of guidelines on child abuse, its detection and how to handle such cases. These guidelines are being used by all those who come into contact with children. The White Paper on mandatory reporting is being completed in my Department and is almost ready to go to Government. These two measures, in addition to the child trafficking Act, will ensure we are introducing strong measures to protect children at all stages.</P>
    <P>We share concerns about children and the protection of children at national and international levels which we are discussing in the context of this Bill. We recognise that the international community has a role to play. Legislation such as this Bill and the ratification of conventions reflects our intention to protect children in all situations. I thank Senators for their comments.</P>
