	<P>I have received notice from Senator Thomas Byrne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to give an update on plans for a playground at Oldbride House, County Meath.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh of the following matter:</P>

        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at 3.45 p.m. and conclude not later than 5.45 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minute and those of all Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 5.35 p.m., and No. 2, European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at 6.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 8.30 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 8.20 p.m.</P>
        <P>As Senators will be aware, we are sitting earlier than usual as Committee Stage of the Gaeltacht Bill 2012 was due to be taken following the Order of Business.  It was agreed last week that amendments to the Bill could be submitted up to yesterday morning.  However, owing to the volume of amendments received and the fact that many were tabled in Irish and needed to be translated, I was informed by the Bills Office yesterday that it would not be in a position to publish them in time for today&rsquo;s sitting.  I propose, therefore, that we commence Committee Stage on Thursday afternoon and, if not concluded, that time be set aside in the schedule for tomorrow week to complete it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for his clarification of the position on the Gaeltacht Bill.  That makes a great deal of sense and it affords proper time for an important Bill to be discussed.  I remind colleagues that it will disenfranchise people living in Gaeltacht areas and remove their right to elect people to represent them in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Senator&rsquo;s interpretation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien to continue, without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not my interpretation; it is the view of the thousands of people who live in Gaeltacht areas.  I watched with great interest the Minister of State with responsibility for Gaeltacht affairs, Deputy Dinny McGinley, defend the indefensible in the House last Thursday.  Therefore, I look forward to the resumption of the debate.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader update the House on when the pyrite report will be published?  Will it be published before the summer recess?  If so, will he afford time for it to be debated?  It is dragging on and on and I am like a broken record asking about it, but it is too important to let go.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Minister for Justice and Equality that the personal insolvency Bill will be brought to the Cabinet today and published before the end of the week.  Does the Leader have any information on the process from there?  Will the Bill be introduced in the Oireachtas before the summer recess?  It is urgent legislation and this side of the House would certainly facilitate a late sitting to deal with it.  If we need to extend the time the House needs to sit after 19 July to pass this important legislation, we will absolutely support the Leader in so doing.  If, closer to the date, it does not appear that it will be passed, we will be calling for an extension.</P>
        <P>With regard to the HSE and the Department of Health, we are all concerned to read that the level of over-expenditure in the five months to May stands at &euro;300 million.  If one takes into account the fact that the hospitals will be busier in the approach to the winter, it appears the Minister for Health is to preside over over-expenditure in the region of &euro;1 billion by the end of the year.  He may talk all he likes about what the HSE needs to and should do, but I remind him that it is his health executive.  He sacked the previous board and the appointees are all his.  What is he doing about the matter?  Last week we saw the number of hospital beds not being used.  Waiting lists to see consultants are growing day by day.  The figures are the worst we have seen in the past five or six years, which implies circumstances are actually getting worse.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister in the next week or so, specifically on the HSE service plan.  The Minister should clarify his comments and those of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  They seem to be endeavouring to scrap the Croke Park agreement which was signed by the previous Government with the public service unions.  It is delivering value and should be allowed to run its course.  I actually agree with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s statement that he would prefer if individual Ministers did not get up every morning and express a point of view.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is wont to do so regularly.  Surprisingly, he was preceded by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government last Sunday.  This House needs a full and proper debate on the Croke Park agreement in the company of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  We need to know whether the Government is actually committed to the agreement.  I thought it would have learned a lesson last year when it flew numerous kites before the budget about various developments that could and would happen if people did not toe the line.  I remind the Minister for Health that he was the worst culprit in that regard.  It blew up in his face and he is flying kites again, although we are only at the end of June.  If we are to have such circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.  Rather than spending his time flying kites, the Minister should enter the House to explain his position and state whether he and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport are committed to the Croke Park agreement.  The person who can tell us this is the Taoiseach.  In 16 months he&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to know when the Taoiseach is coming to the House.  He has not once addressed it since it was formed.  He saw fit to come here to address the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which is fine.  He spoke to Members from the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, Wales and Scotland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to ask the Taoiseach to come to the House to confirm whether the Government is committed to the Croke Park deal.  When he said he would come here, he wanted to discuss Northern Ireland issues.  I would prefer if he discussed issues pertaining to the Republic of Ireland.  When is he coming here?  He has made a commitment to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator proposing an amendment to the Order of Business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I can if the Cathaoirleach wants me to, but I was not going to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I was delighted to agree wholeheartedly with Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien when he said he agreed with the T&aacute;naiste on the Croke Park deal.  The T&aacute;naiste stated very clearly the Government&rsquo;s position on the deal, which is that it stands.  Irrespective of whatever kite-flying may be engaged in by individuals, that is the Government&rsquo;s position, on which the T&aacute;naiste has been very clear.  We had a full debate on the Croke Park agreement in February, but nobody on this side is against having another debate on the matter.  As I said, the Government&rsquo;s position is very clear &mdash; the Croke Park deal stands.  This has been stated at the highest level.</P>
        <P>There are a couple of good news stories today that the House should welcome.  The first is that house prices in Dublin are increasing.  This is both good and bad news, depending on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s stance on socialism&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should allow me to finish.  There is clearly both good and bad news.  It is not such good news for those seeking to buy a house.  If we take this statistic as a sign of generally increasing confidence in the economy, we can take it is good news, despite deploring price rises for house buyers.</P>
        <P>It is worthwhile welcoming the fact that Nuance International has announced the creation of new jobs in Ballsbridge.  This is very welcome news.</P>
        <P>I seek a debate on companies which are not abiding by Labour Court resolutions.  I refer, in particular, to H. W. Wilson.  A number of colleagues were outside Leinster House some weeks ago with the H. W. Wilson employees recently made redundant.  H. W. Wilson is an American publishing company which had an office here.  It made its employees redundant and is not abiding by Labour Court recommendations on redundancy payments.  We have had a number of such cases in recent years and months.  We might debate this issue in the House.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a further debate in the autumn on the criminal law on prostitution.  I welcome the publication last week, on 22 June, by the Minister for Justice and Equality of his discussion document on the future direction of legislation on prostitution.  We have had a number of debates in the House initiated by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees&rsquo; group, including Senator Katherine Zappone.  We are all very pleased that the discussion document has now been published, as promised.  It will be referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.  Senator Katherine Zappone and I have both been involved in its hearings.  Other colleagues are also members of the committee which has been given until 30 November to report on the discussion document, having heard from interested groups and members of the public.  It would be very useful for the House to have a debate based on the report the committee will be producing following the publication of the discussion document.  I hope we will see a clear way forward for legislation after the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the publication of the consultation document on the criminalisation of the purchase of sex which I believe is the result of the motion the Independent group brought before the House on two occasions.</P>
        <P>Last Friday, 22 June, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, signed a statutory order to remove section 11(1)(<i>e</i>)(iii) of the Ombudsman for Children Act which excluded children detained in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution from the complaints remit of the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan.  The order will take effect from 1 July.  I warmly welcome this move which I do not believe received much publicity.  Prior to this, children held in prison, children in the Defence Forces and children involved in dealings with the Garda were the only three groups of children excluded from the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.  However, there is an ombudsman in place for both the Defence Forces and the Garda.  It followed from the announcement of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on 2 April that the detention of children in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution would end on 1 May for all newly remanded or sentenced 16 and 17 year olds.  They will now be detained in Oberstown.  These two measures mark significant progress in the treatment of juvenile offenders and the observance of children&rsquo;s human rights.  However, I am mindful of the fact that there is still no independent, fair and impartial complaints mechanism for adult prisoners.  Concern has been expressed in this regard by both the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the inspector of prisons, Mr. Justice Michael Reilly, in his annual report for 2010.  In Mr. Justice Reilly&rsquo;s report he refers to a deficiency, to be rectified by 1 July 2011, in the following of proper complaints procedures, with supporting documents.  I look forward to seeing what progress, if any, is recorded in his next annual report.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House to confirm when the annual report of the Office of the Inspector of Prisons for 2011 will be published.  I understand it was sent to the Minister on 17 April.  I ask that we have a debate on how best an independent, transparent and accountable prisoner complaints mechanism can be established in the prisons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the minutes of meetings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be circulated.  I am interested in its decisions.  I assume that what is minuted by it is its decisions.  We are all entitled to know what decisions are taken in our name by a body on our behalf.  However, this has not happened and it is an abuse of democracy.</P>
        <P>I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is for the Taoiseach, that the meeting that was held here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann to discuss the question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No. 21, motion 9.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach.  I appreciate his help.  The more important matter is the significant discussion that was held here.  Leading academics and commentators from all over the world were invited to this Chamber.  I welcomed them here.  It was an interesting, lively and informed discussion.  I compliment the Members of the Seanad who were either invited or participated spontaneously from the floor.  They distinguished themselves.  However, it is important to register that when they were asked on a vote, 90% of those taking part supported the retention of the Seanad, but with reform.  The remaining 10% simply abstained.  The bad news for the Taoiseach is that, from a distinguished panel of international experts, not one person supported the position he took.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader of the House explain why, if the facilities of this House were being used &mdash; there was, apparently, an involvement of this House in it as a kind of subterfuge which, happily, backfired &mdash; if it was a serious situation and although there were two members of staff at the desk, no attempt was made to make a record of the proceedings?  There is no transcribed record and it is only of use to those who have a memory of what happened.  That is lamentable.  If one was serious about it, such a record should have been provided.  Perhaps it is just as well because they did not get the response they wanted.</P>
        <P>The second point I want to make is connected.  I rearranged my diary for this event, because I believe in freedom of thought and freedom of expression.  I did not know what would come out of it but I am happy with the result.  I took over the Chair from Dr. Maurice Manning who could not be present because he was involved in the launch of the report on the Irish Human Rights Commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>An eminently suitable substitute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Dr. Manning was the Fine Gael leader in this House.  It is interesting that, although he is a diplomatic person and did not come into direct conflict with the Government, he raised some worrying issues.  He made the suggestion that there is a gradual move to absorb the Irish Human Rights Commission into a Department and not to respect that distance that must exist between human rights organisations and Departments.  What was highlighted in particular, and most astonishingly, was the violation of the Paris Principles, the very principles in the United Nations to which Ireland signed up and which are being violated by this Bill, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill, that will be presented before this House.  I refer in particular to head 17(5) which states: &ldquo;The first Director&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Has Senator Norris a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking when this Bill will be taken in the House because we need to discuss it because of the disgraceful material contained in it.  Head 17(5) states: &ldquo;The first Director of the Commission shall be the person who on the day prior to the establishment day is the Chief Executive of the Equality Authority and her contract&rdquo;.  One should note the words, &ldquo;her contract&rdquo;.  The Government is directly nominating its own person in advance of the composition of this new arrangement.  This is something I raised when Fianna F&aacute;il tried it on the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  The Government side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Has Senator Norris a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to know where the principles of those on the Government side are.  Why have the parties in government changed since they have gone into government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Senator Paul Coghlan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>When in opposition, they attacked this corruption of independent bodies.</P>

	<P>Senator Norris is way over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;has raised these serious questions.  Where are the principles of those on the Government side?  When will this Bill be brought in?  Will they withdraw from this shameful abuse of democracy?  Where is the openness, transparency and accountability we were promised from those now in government when they were in opposition and of which there is now not much sign?  Those on the Government side are like provisional Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The entire House is happy and, despite what we heard on the last day we met, is glad to note Senator Norris&rsquo;s happiness regarding the meeting with the academics.  It is good to hear from him that he is happy and content about it.  That is good and represents progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is interesting that they were allowed to speak in this Chamber and Senator Paul Coghlan was not.  He did not open his mouth.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wanted to refer to the contribution of my good friend and colleague, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  I thought his endeavours to appear overexcited were rather pained or strained.  Perhaps he has not had the practice that some of his other colleagues behind him have had at the Abbey school of acting.  Nevertheless, he and the House should be assured&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Coghlan note potential there?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste are <i>ad idem</i> on some of the matters to which he referred.  As I have often preached in this House, and in regard to Senator Norris&rsquo; excitement on the other issue, let us be calm and, in Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s instance, await Cabinet discussion and decision because nothing has changed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>That is great advice.</P>

	<P>It always is.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Leader will agree with me that there are signs of confidence slowly creeping back in, especially in respect of house prices, to which Senator Bacik referred.  I accept the increase has been tiny and marginal and that we would want to wait another two periods at least.  The point is that we should be calm and measured and should not be getting overexcited needlessly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to express my deep concern about the operations of a body that usurps its powers and functions regularly, that is, An Taisce.  It is not subject to freedom of information requests and gets mandatory notice of every rural planning application in Ireland.  It had the audacity recently to challenge the autonomy of Cork County Council and its manager in respect of that organisation&rsquo;s policy on one-off housing, which challenge was substantially and unequivocally rebuffed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is no transparency.  There is a Chinese wall of secrecy around the organisation.  It has many members in west Cork, yet there is never a public meeting or an AGM.  No one can ascertain the membership of this body.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

	<P>Why is it not?  What has it to be afraid of?  I have made this point publicly.  My difficulty is not with An Taisce protecting our heritage but with its interference in issues, whether in Donegal, Clare, Mayo or wherever, often by those who do not even know the sites concerned.  I compliment the county manager in Cork, Mr. Martin O&rsquo;Riordan, who, most unusually, made a public pronouncement in the past week of his disgust and disdain for what An Taisce is trying to do in respect of one-off rural housing.  There should be a full debate in this House to lift the veil of secrecy surrounding An Taisce.  Let us take away the mask and see who they are.</P>

	<P>Before raising an important issue, I commend the CEO of ISME, Mr. Mark Fielding, and Deputy Michael McGrath of Fianna F&aacute;il on backing my calls to have Ulster Bank waive its fees to customers and to have the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform use its powers to deal with this issue.  I seek also that the Minister for Finance would come to this House to debate the fiasco at Ulster Bank and the impact it is having on the lives of those 100,000 people who do not know whether they will have wages or social welfare entitlements in their accounts this week.  I seek the Minister&rsquo;s presence in the House in circumstances where the bank&rsquo;s response to this debacle has been lamentably poor and his intervention in the matter is needed.  I have been waiting for days for Ulster Bank and its parent company, Royal Bank of Scotland, to respond to my letters.  If neither is prepared to respond to me with urgency, what hope do we have they will resolve this matter quickly?</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister to come before the House to debate three specific issues, namely, the need to address charges for accounts at this time, the need to address the issue of customers&rsquo; credit ratings and the need to reimburse costs incurred by customers when contacting the Ulster Bank helpline.  Several days after this fiasco commenced, it is still impossible for customers to see up-to-date balances.  The bank has also warned of the possibility of further bumps on the road.  Short of running out of money, it is difficult to think of a more serious issue for the bank.  This is the most widespread customer service failure in my memory and the bank&rsquo;s reaction to it thus far has been a disgrace.</P>

	<P>I thank the technical staff for repairing the translation equipment during the debate on the Gaeltacht Bill.  The staff who serve this House always deserve thanks for showing patience and professionalism.</P>
        <P>There is still a problem with the Gaeltacht Bill.  There has been a view in the permanent Government for some time that one cannot have elections in the Gaeltacht areas.  The previous elections to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta were postponed two years ago.  This issue predates the decision on D&aacute;il by-elections reached in a case taken by the then Senator Pearse Doherty.  I  wonder if the Government can persist with this position, given that the decision by Mr. Justice Kerins in the Doherty case was that elections were not discretionary.  In the case of Gaeltacht elections, the proposal disenfranchises 91,000 people, of whom 23,000 are living in County Donegal, 1,000 in County Meath, 43,000 in County Galway&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for discussion on Committee Stage of the Bill which will be taken on Thursday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>While I thank the Cathaoirleach for his advice on this matter, further points arise in this regard.  A regulatory impact assessment was not carried out, as is the case when human rights issues arise.  The decision of the court in the Doherty case should also be assessed.  As Senator Paul Coghlan stated, the Bill deserves more consideration at the Cabinet than appeared to have been the case when it was brought before the House last week.  Two days will not be sufficient to remedy the defects in the legislation.  I ask the Leader to raise the matter with the Cabinet and request that it consider the serious flaws identified in the legislation when it was brought before the House last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the views expressed by my colleague, Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan, on An Taisce.  The Senator is correct that the same rules should be applied to An Taisce as to other organisations and that it should come within the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.  Some years ago in Cork the taxpayer had to pick up the &euro;20 million in additional costs incurred when a project in which the State was involved was delayed as a result of one person lodging unfounded and unreasonable objections with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This issue needs to be debated.</P>
        <P>I raise the issue of the attitudes of final year medical students about to graduate from medical school towards working in the health system.  In recent years there has been a major drain of junior doctors from the health system.  A study produced recently by the University of Limerick shows that within 12 months of graduating 66% of students or graduates will not be working in hospitals and that more than 50% will have left the country.  The annual cost of educating a medical student at university is approximately &euro;25,000 per annum.  If it costs &euro;125,000 per student for a five-year course and 600 students are graduating in medicine each year, the annual cost of medical education stands at &euro;75 million.  Within 12 months &euro;35 million of this investment will have been lost.  We need to consider the reasons medical graduates are leaving Ireland so quickly.  I, therefore, ask for an urgent debate with the Minister for Health on this matter because it is imposing a substantial cost on taxpayers.  While I accept that medical graduates are leaving the country for genuine reasons, we have failed to address these reasons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to put pressure on the Government to block the payment of &euro;1.14 billion in bonds which the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation is due to repay on 26, 27 and 28 June.  Of the four separate bonds, two were held previously by Irish Nationwide Building Society and two were held by Anglo Irish Bank.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long argued that these bonds should not be repaid in full and that a significant haircut should be imposed on senior bondholders.  Our view is now shared by a chorus of voices outside the State, including the International Monetary Fund, the OECD and the European Commission.  Many are conscious of the impact of asking taxpayers to repay bank bonds &mdash; debt that is not theirs &mdash; and increasing the national debt.  This is not the right thing to do and I ask the Leader to put pressure on the Government to cease making these repayments.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on the launch yesterday by the Claiming our Future group of its Plan B strategy.  Many Senators have asked political parties and organisations to propose an alternative to the Government&rsquo;s economic policies.  Now that a group of civic minded people has published one such alternative, the House should do it justice by debating the proposals it has made.  We must debate the real alternatives people are putting forward.  Many of the ideas included in Plan B are similar to ones Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed in recent years, including in our pre-budget submissions.  Plan B has secured some trade union movement support, including the endorsement of SIPTU, backing from a number of significant organisations and individuals.  In the light of calls made by many Senators for people to present alternatives to the Government&rsquo;s policies, the House should debate Claiming our Future&rsquo;s alternative strategy.</P>

Mr. Moloney worked hard throughout his life and had just finished working when he was murdered.  On behalf of the House, I extend sympathy to his family and friends.</P>
        <P>I offer some reassurance to Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien who became excited about the issue of personal insolvency.  He and his Fianna F&aacute;il Party colleagues are not the only Senators who are more than willing to sit longer hours or later to ensure legislation is passed.  It struck me that the Senator might have been trying to create the impression that his party was the only one willing to sit longer and later to deal with urgent or relevant legislation.</P>

Particular concern has arisen over the rights of older people, an issue discussed by the House at the most recent meeting of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  The loss or absence of the liaison group at this time will make this debate more difficult.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the views expressed by Senator Sean Barrett who has done the House a particular service in seeking to have a solution found to problems identified in the Gaeltacht Bill.  If legal and constitutional issues arise with the legislation, it would be better to have them addressed before Committee Stage is taken on Thursday.  People living in the Gaeltacht have been waiting for the Bill for a considerable period and there is no doubt they believe they are being deprived of an established franchise.  It seems that Senator Barrett has done his homework pretty well on this.  There is much logic in what he is saying and it is backed up by a judicial decision.  The Leader might take this on board in a positive way from this side of the House and address the matter because if there are constitutional issues and if it follows that there is a constitutional challenge, that will put this Bill into abeyance for a long period.</P>

	<P>A second issue relates to planning in rural areas which has been raised by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.  It is important to have a debate if there are issues to be discussed.  It is not a matter of taking shots at An Taisce or anyone else.  I do not believe any fair-minded person wants to see the countryside destroyed in any way, but on the other hand, there are a lot of questions to be answered and we get those on the ground.  For instance, I have seen several cases where a family member could not build a house on their own land.  One must bear in mind that would mean a young couple would have their children close to their grandparents.  It is a big social issue.  I have seen too many cases where permission has not been granted.  In many of those cases An Taisce has had an involvement.  I do not wish to take from the good work it does.  It is a very important body and it must remain in existence.  In this day and age it must also be answerable for any stance it takes.  I find it difficult to get any response from An Taisce on the issues I have mentioned.  I hope the House can play a role in some way either by asking An Taisce to come and discuss the issues with us or by giving us an opportunity to bring it in to provide information.  We are entitled to freedom of information in such cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure if the Reclaim the Future people are in some way related politically or otherwise to the Reclaim the Streets people but I welcome the fact the group is presenting an economic alternative.  I suggest to the Leader that we would have a thorough debate at the earliest opportunity on the current state of the country from an economic perspective and the possible options which will be considered and taken on board or otherwise by the Government in the December budget.  Two or three years ago when I was on the Opposition side of the House when the economic crisis was profound, I regularly called for such debates because there is a duty on all political parties to present their economic view and options well in advance of budget day.  We must move beyond the traditional method of the Minister announcing the budget on budget day and the Opposition saying it has a better idea.  If people have ideas, they should be heard on the floor of this House and the other House and presented well in advance of the budget decisions of December.  Such a debate on the economy would be useful.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Colm Burke&rsquo;s comments on medical students.  He has presented his case very well.  Our country has invested significant sums of taxpayers&rsquo; money in putting a proper training structure in place for those students.  I am sure the majority of them would aspire to pursue a medical career in this country.  We must investigate why it is not proving possible for so many of them to do that.  I support Senator Burke&rsquo;s request for a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Leader would bring the following comments to the attention of the Minister for Health.  First, I wish to talk about sin.  The capital sin in a recession is not the spending of money, it is the wasting of money.  A hugely wasteful spend is occurring in our health service right now.  Figures emerged last week that showed 350,000 Irish citizens on some type of waiting list for hospital care.  When one does the arithmetic, that works out at about 8% of the entire population being on a waiting list.  That is simply staggering by international standards.  When one considers we also have a much higher than average percentage of patients in this country with private health insurance &mdash; there are waiting lists in the private sector as well &mdash; the number of public patients who do not have a private option, who are waiting for public health care at any given time is probably something in the order of 11% to 12%.</P>
        <P>We have all been through the moral, societal and ethical issues, but I wish to put one other thought into the Minister&rsquo;s head.  There is an economic imperative to reform the health system and rid us of this problem.  How many patients on waiting lists are out of work because they are waiting for medical care to go back to work?  How many children are not able to hear what their teacher is saying because they are on eight to ten month or one year waiting lists to get their hearing tested?  How many elderly people need a family member to care for them because they cannot see while they are waiting to get a cataract dealt with or cannot walk while they are waiting to get their hip replaced?  Such a family member is a potential economic contributor to society who is taken out of the workforce.  How much more expensive is it to deliver care when that care is delayed?  We have hard figures which show that the average Irish child who needs corrective spinal surgery for scoliosis and kyphosis &mdash; diseases of curvature of the spine &mdash; has 10&deg; more curvature than their European peers.  What about the economic cost of the under-use of staff who are sitting around because wards have been closed and they cannot process patients through an operating theatre because it has been closed?  All of those pathologies are due to the primary funding mechanism of the health service and its bureaucratic structure.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to bring these problems to the Minister&rsquo;s attention because, to date, the political response has been to impose further bureaucracy and not to deal with the fundamental problem.  I am concerned that the visceral reflex of the people who run our health service &mdash; the bureaucrats &mdash; to the other figures on health service overspends we have seen emerge will be to close wards and theatres, curtail services and lengthen waiting lists rather than increase efficiency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to send our condolences to the family of the young Irish supporter, James Nolan, on his sad death in Poland.  As a fan I experienced the highs and lows of Euro 2012 but the low for most people was the untimely death of James Nolan.  I stayed in the city of Bydgoszcz and the people there were very friendly.  They appreciated the arrival of Irish people there.  I wish to put on record the sad passing of young James Nolan.</P>
        <P>The second issue I wish to raise relates to the matter raised by Senator Barrett on the constituency review.  He mentioned Donegal in particular.  It would be better served as a five-seater than as two three-seaters.</P>

	<P>I propose that the report of the Constituency Commission would be discussed at some stage, especially as it pertains Donegal.  Perhaps I misunderstood Senator Barrett.  In Donegal the area of St. Johnston is adjacent to Derry city, yet electorally it is in the south west of the county.  The nearest Deputy is approximately 60 or 70 miles away.  A debate on this aspect would be welcome in the context of the constituency review, albeit that part of Ballyshannon and Bundoran have been moved into Sligo.</P>

	<P>While my party might have some quibble about the wording of the motion tabled by Senator Norris in terms of how it would be implemented, we support the broad thrust of it and, therefore, I formally second his proposed amendment.</P>
        <P>I raise an issue which was reported in yesterday&rsquo;s national newspapers on the IDA policy on the location of jobs and industries throughout the country.  A parliamentary question tabled by my party colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, elicited the information that the IDA had focused almost exclusively on attracting foreign direct investment into specific areas: Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford and, to a lesser extent, Limerick.  What was more astonishing, and not at all revelatory for those of us who have been fighting the case with the IDA for many years, is that some counties, such as my county of Leitrim, Longford, Wexford &mdash; strangely enough &mdash; and Roscommon, have received no visits whatsoever from potential foreign direct investors.  The argument the IDA put forward in the written reply from the Minister was that it had to take account of the facilities and services that were available and population density.</P>
        <P>This is all r&aacute;im&eacute;is that has been going on ever since the IDA started.  It is far past time that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, came to the House to indicate what Government policy is in terms of dispersal into the regions.  I am realistic enough, as is everyone in this House, to know that IDA Ireland cannot force any potential investor to locate in a certain place.  However, it is obvious from the answer elicited by Deputy Michael McGrath that it is pursuing a policy of focusing on the main areas of population to the detriment of those in other parts of the country.  What was astonishing about the reply was the mention of population.  If there are no jobs being created in counties such as Leitrim, Cavan, Longford and Roscommon, as well as other parts of the west, people &mdash; particularly young people &mdash; have no chance of finding work and they will emigrate.  My own daughter is in Australia.  Our football team has been decimated.  Senators may have read about this in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last week under the headline &ldquo;The team who disappeared&rdquo;.  Of the 31 members of the Leitrim football panel in 2010, 20 are gone.  From one parish in my county &mdash; Drumreilly outside Ballinamore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;17 youngsters are gone.  The club is struggling.  These are the facts and it is time the Government grasped the nettle.  I am not suggesting it should force industries which want to locate in this country and provide valuable jobs to locate in particular areas; nor am I in any way casting aspersions on those areas in which jobs have been created.  What I am saying is that the Government has a responsibility to do something, as did the last Administration, which failed miserably in that regard by bringing forward a spatial strategy that was never really implemented.  I know the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is amenable to coming to this House on a regular basis.  I, therefore, ask the Leader, the next time the Minister comes to the House, to alert him to the fact that we want to talk to him about industrial policy and dispersal to the regions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>As Fine Gael spokesperson on the environment, I would like to mention an important document, Ireland&rsquo;s Environment: An Assessment 2012, which was published by the Environmental Protection Agency and launched yesterday by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  It is a most comprehensive evidence-based assessment of the state of our environment.  I ask the Leader to arrange a discussion on this document which is published only once every four years.  We should be informed by its assessment and recommendations in every decision we make as legislators.  As well as the environment, our economic growth depends on it.  Ireland is known for its good environment and, thankfully, the report states our environment is generally in good condition.  However, it highlights some formidable tasks ahead of us of which we should all be aware.  As legislators, we must make critical decisions on behalf of our constituents on our environment and we want to make sure it is in good condition when we pass it on to the next generation.  Because Ireland is uniquely noted for its green and clean image, our economic growth also depends on it.  Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan mentioned An Taisce, but that body should be dealt with in a separate debate.  I understand from where the Senator is coming; An Taisce does a good job, but there are issues in certain areas that need to be debated.  However, that should be the subject of a separate debate; it should not be lost in the debate on the EPA report or<i> vice versa</i>.  Even though one could say they are interlinked, they are separate subjects.  I ask the Leader to hold that important debate.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom tac&uacute; leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag mo chomhleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir Barrett, maidir le Bille na Gaeltachta agus maidir leis an gceist faoi thoghch&aacute;n &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; an ceart ar fad aige faoin cheart at&aacute; ag muintir na Gaeltachta v&oacute;ta a chaitheamh i dtoghch&aacute;n &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go dtabharfar aghaidh ar sin sula dtiocfaidh an Bille ar aghaidh ar&iacute;s.  Ba mhaith liom freisinf&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an cinneadh an-stairi&uacute;il agus an-mhisni&uacute;il at&aacute; glactha ag Ard Chomairle Shinn F&eacute;in go gcasfaidh Martin McGuinness le Banr&iacute;on Shasana am&aacute;rach agus gu&iacute;m gach rath orthu sa mh&eacute;id sin.  F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m freisin roimh na teachtaireachta&iacute; eile at&aacute; ag teacht &oacute;n bpobal ar fad, n&oacute; an chuid is m&oacute; d&oacute;ibh, sa Tuaisceart ag cur f&aacute;ilte roimh an cruinni&uacute; seo.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il againn go mbogfaidh s&eacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; chun cinn agus ceapaim go gcuirfeadh chuile Sheanad&oacute;ir sa Teach seo f&aacute;ilte roimh sin.</P>
        <P>Yesterday a number of Senators attended an interesting presentation in Galway which was given by representatives of community employment schemes across the county.  It was a positive way of dealing with their worries about cutbacks to the schemes.  They presented information on their work, which covers such a broad area it would take too long to go into.  Will the Leader clarify when the review of the report on community employment schemes is to be published?  In conjunction with this, if it is to be published before the recess, can we have a debate on the value of the schemes across the country?  We need to be able to discuss the points raised with us yesterday, including the fact that capital grants are to be cut.  Training grants are also to be cut for those participating in schemes.  This is a retrograde step and we hope it will be reversed based on the review.  This is an important issue, particularly at a time when we are seeing increasing numbers of unemployed persons and in view of the great value we get from community employment schemes across a wide range areas, including the upkeep of civic amenities and the servicing of youth facilities and facilities for older people.  It is important that we recognise the work done by the schemes.  We need to have a debate on this issue as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>Having attended the same presentation as Senator Trevor&Oacute; Clochartaigh yesterday, I strongly agree with him that community employment schemes, certainly those in my county, have done invaluable work in recent years.  I hope to see them go from strength from strength and that the resources required to achieve this will be made available.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I support the call made by my colleague from Galway East, Senator Lorraine Higgins, for the Minister for Finance to clarify the position on the Ulster Bank fiasco over the weekend.  If ever confidence in the Irish banking system was severely damaged, it was over the weekend when so many people throughout the country were severely discommoded.  There is major uncertainty, with people worried about their credit ratings and the costs they may incur.  The bank needs to clarify the position and the Minister who has a major involvement in the banking sector with the Governor of the Central Bank needs to allay public concerns because of the damage that has been done.  In addition, we want to make sure, when this matter has cleared up, that nobody is out of pocket, that people&rsquo;s credit ratings are intact and that confidence in the banking system is restored.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to highlight a problem that has arisen in the medical card applications office, although perhaps this time it is not of its own making.  It has come to my attention that child care expenses will not be taken into consideration in processing medical card applications unless a registered childminder is used.  We all know that in Ireland there is a long-standing tradition of childminding by family members &mdash; grandparents, aunts and uncles &mdash; for small remuneration.  The Minister needs to review this criterion and allow such child care expenses to be taken into consideration because it is affecting people, especially in rural Ireland where proper child care facilities are practically non-existent or, at least, very scarce.  It is okay in the big urban areas in which people who are working can take their children to dedicated facilities, but in rural Ireland this is very difficult.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister to come to the House to discuss the issue or provide us with his views on this matter.  I also ask that he review the criteria in respect of child care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the news that a single Government-funded body is to be created to oversee the retention of human tissue samples, which has been called for by a number of groups, not least the Adult Stem Cell Foundation of Ireland which not long ago made a presentation to Deputies and Senators.  This is a welcome development, one we should debate in the House at some stage.</P>
        <P>It is a welcome development and should be debated in the House at some stage.  Senator Crown and I are not <i>ad idem</i>, but I always listen to him with great interest, as his comments are carefully thought through.</P>

        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bradford&rsquo;s call for a debate on the economy.  I do not know why the T&aacute;naiste appeared to get upset when he was somewhat impaled by the comments of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, on increments.  I thought of &ldquo;Varad the Impaler&rdquo; this morning.  It is revealing that the T&aacute;naiste resorted to suggesting that Ministers should not come out with the latest fresh idea on a Monday morning.  This is exactly the type of debate we need.  Unless we subscribe to an authoritarian vision of a lone voice at all times, we cannot but welcome fresh thinking.  The Minister deserves credit for being willing not just to come up with ideas off the top of his head, but to say what needs to be said.  It is good that the T&aacute;naiste was challenged by journalists about the Minister&rsquo;s proposal, be it right or wrong.  As far as the Croke Park agreement is concerned, we are not at a stage in this economic crisis in which we can afford to have any taboo subject.  Everything must be on the table and the agreement must remain under review.  If sacrifices are to be made by postponing increments, I hope that the lower paid will be shielded, but the proposal must be on the table in respect of some earners in the public sector.  Fair play to the Minister for being willing to say so.  I was surprised by the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s defensive reaction.  He must maintain the Government line, but he should not resort to grumbling about the fact that Cabinet colleagues might show some independence of thought and be willing to say what they believe.  It will be a bad day for the Government when those kinds of comments are prohibited.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien raised the issue of the pyrite report, which I understand will be published by the summer.  If so, I will endeavour to arrange a debate on it.  The personal insolvency Bill will be published, but I do not know whether it will be introduced in this Chamber before the summer.  I will facilitate time if the Government wishes to move the Bill in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be supported.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We will provide time, be it at the end of July or in August.  I am willing to facilitate the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader might relay our support for expediting the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the overspend in the health budget, ten Members contributed when the House debated the HSE&rsquo;s service plan on 14 February, including Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  If we need another debate, we will try to arrange one in the autumn.</P>
        <P>The Croke Park agreement is referred to on the Order of Business from time to time and we debated it on 9 February, when the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, gave a thorough and comprehensive update on its implementation.  Only ten Senators participated in that discussion.  Recent reports suggest that the agreement is working and delivering a leaner public service without industrial unrest, which is in everyone&rsquo;s interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>True.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask the Minister of State to return to the House in the autumn as the budget process takes shape to provide a further update on the agreement.  The Government is committing to fulfilling its objectives as set out in the programme for Government.  Budgetary decisions will be taken by the Cabinet and I will not speculate on what they might be.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik mentioned a company that is experiencing difficulties with redundancy payments.  It is of paramount importance that workers&rsquo; full redundancy rights are met.  I am sure that the Senator will raise the matter with the relevant Minister.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik and van Turnhout mentioned the publication of a discussion document on criminal law and prostitution.  Everyone welcomes the document, which will be debated by the justice committee.  The Minister for Justice and Equality committed to its publication at the earliest possible opportunity when he attended this House.  I am glad that he has honoured his promise.</P>
        <P>We would all agree with Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s welcome of the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to encompass children detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  I will find out for the Senator when the publication of the report of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention is intended.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris asked about No. 21, motion No. 9 on the Order Paper, which asks that the minutes of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, be published.  I will not agree to that motion being taken at this point.  Publishing the minutes could compromise the committee&rsquo;s work.  The CPP is arbiter of Seanad procedures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be happy if the Leader could give a commitment on a decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I might answer his question.  For example, the committee is involved in litigation that is due before the Supreme Court.  Each group has a representative on the committee.  That person is responsible for communicating decisions of the committee to his or her group&rsquo;s Members.  If there is no communication, Senators should raise the matter with their representatives.</P>
        <P>I assure Senator O&rsquo;Donnell that any decision agreeing to a request for the use of the Chamber should and will be circulated to all Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Paul Coghlan was calmness personified when addressing the matters raised by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Donovan, Burke, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Norris asked why An Taisce was not subject to the Freedom of Information Act.  Although many Senators would agree with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s comments, an equal number would not.  Perhaps we can arrange a debate on the issue later this term.</P>
        <P>Senators Higgins and Mullins raised the regrettable and deplorable Ulster Bank situation.  It is a matter for the bank to rectify, but the Government has expressed its concerns.  No one should be out of pocket because of the bank&rsquo;s problems.  The bank will ensure no one is.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett asked about the Gaeltacht Bill 2012.  Members are being fed information by Conradh na Gaeilge and many other organisations, many of the concerns of which are appearing in the form of amendments.  I have been assured that the Department will examine the sections that the Senator believes are unconstitutional.  He made a number of points in this respect last week and the Department is anxious to discuss the matter with him.  Committee Stage will be held next Thursday.  Concerns regarding legislation are referred to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  If necessary, the Senator&rsquo;s questions about the Bill&rsquo;s constitutionality can also be referred to that office.</P>
        <P>Senator Colm Burke commented on the junior doctor issue.  Some 66% leave the health system.  That is a matter which has been addressed previously by the Minister for Health, but we should have him before the House again to discuss that and other issues raised by various Senators.</P>
        <P>Senator David Cullinane asked about the Government&rsquo;s position on banking, which is very clear.  We are attempting to negotiate with EU colleagues on the restructuring and alleviation of bank debt and the Government will continue the process until the matter has been rectified.</P>
        <P>As Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe noted, we extend our sympathy on the death of the journalist Eugene Moloney.  I will make inquiries of the relevant Minister of State about the non-governmental organisation liaison group.</P>
        <P>Senator Labhras &Oacute; Murch&uacute; also mentioned the possible constitutional challenge to the Gaeltacht Bill.  All legislation is presented after receiving advice from the Attorney General, but the Minister is willing to listen to the case that will be made.  The Minister of State made an impassioned speech in the House last week; it was one of the finest we had heard in a long time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It was totally as Gaeilge and he did not interrupt one speaker.  Unfortunately, that was not the case when he spoke.</P>
        <P>Senator John Crown spoke about the overrun in the health service, the under-use of staff in the system and the need to achieve efficiencies.  I am sure he has made such issues clear to the Minister, but I will raise them again with him.  If we can get the Minister here for a debate, I am sure the Senator will have avail of the opportunity to raise them with him.</P>
        <P>As Senator Jimmy Harte mentioned, we join in the vote of sympathy to the family of Mr. James Nolan, the youth who died by drowning in Poland.</P>
        <P>Senator Paschal Mooney spoke about the focus of IDA Ireland on Dublin, Cork and Galway.  It is only lately that Waterford has come into the picture.  There were few, if any, visits by officials in IDA Ireland to Waterford and the south east in recent years.  We welcome any change as unemployment is a significant problem, not alone in the south east but also the length and breadth of the country.  I recognise there are problems in Senator Paschal Mooney&rsquo;s area and will endeavour to have the Minister come here to discuss industrial policy and employment creation, if possible.</P>
        <P>Senator C&aacute;it Keane mentioned the state of the environment report which should be debated in the House.  I will try to arrange it.</P>
        <P>It is welcome that a member of Sinn F&eacute;in will shake the hand of the British Queen, as mentioned by Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  It is not before time and is part of the ongoing process of peace and reconciliation on the island and between Ireland and its closest neighbour, Britain.</P>
        <P>Senators Michael Mullins and Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of the review of community employment schemes.  When we receive the report, I will ask the responsible Minister to debate it in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Marie Moloney mentioned medical card applications and a review of the criteria applied in respect of child care.  She should make this point either in an Adjournment debate or a note to the Minister.  I will also raise the issue with the Minister.</P>
        <P>I have addressed the question of the Croke Park agreement, as raised by Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen.  I welcome the setting up of one body to deal with the issue of human tissue samples.</P>

	<P>Senator David Norris has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, &ldquo;That No. 21, motion No. 9, be taken today.&rdquo;  Is the amendment being pressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader has very graciously gone a considerable way towards meeting my concerns.  Perhaps he might go a little further and allow us to see the decisions which are not of a controversial or legal nature.  Perhaps he might circulate decisions which he has been advised do not have legal implications.  If he does this, I will happily withdraw the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The House has already given permission to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to take decisions on its behalf.  There are problems, particularly in preparing legal briefs for court cases, etc.  It can be problematic in deciding which matters have legal implications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not seeking a discussion of the issues involved, as those outlined by the Cathaoirleach should be confidential.  I completely accept that confidentiality should be preserved in that regard.  However, if the Leader can go a little further&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might discuss the matter and revert to the Senator on it.  Changes to Standing Orders are always placed before the House and Members are written to when they are to be implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, the Leader has given an undertaking that the minutes, at least in one area, will be circulated.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking for consideration to be given to further matters, information on which could be safely made available.  I am not looking for anything that would prejudice legal cases or put the House in jeopardy.  I am not seeking discussions on issue but information on those decisions which may be of interest to Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be a matter for the committee to decide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am afraid the Leader has backtracked into the Jesuitical business of indicating that the representatives will let us know about such matters.  That is not a good answer.</P>

	<P>I ask the Cathaoirleach to raise the issue.  If information on further matters can be made available, it should be as we want greater transparency.  I agree that An Taisce should be open and above board but so should the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as much as possible.</P>

    <Title>European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012: Second Stage</Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I outline the purpose and contents of the Bill, I thank the Seanad for agreeing to discuss it today.  I look forward to a constructive debate on the legislation and the ESM treaty.  Although a short Bill, it is of critical importance to the public finances and to our country.  Enactment of the Bill is required to allow Ireland to ratify the ESM treaty which was signed by euro area member states subject to ratification on the 2 February 2012.</P>
        <P>With regard to recent developments, Ireland has made significant progress in implementation of its EU-IMF programme of financial support.  Our programme is on track, we have met all of our commitments and exceeded many while completing more than 100 actions to date and we are on track to reduce our deficit to less than 3% of GDP in 2015.  We have also negotiated a number of improvements to the programme since taking office, including the reduction in the interest rate, reversal of the minimum wage cut, the jobs initiative, the deferral of the promissory note payment and, most recent, the agreement to reinvest at least 50% of the proceeds from the sale of State assets into viable projects.  However, we all know significant external challenges remain.</P>
        <P>The Government believes the recent positive vote to approve the ratification of the stability treaty reflects a desire on the part of the people to take another step on the road towards economic recovery.  The stability treaty will not solve all Ireland&rsquo;s problems but it is one of the many foundation blocks we need to put in place to ensure our economy will stand on the ground for the future.  The people of Ireland have recognised the importance of restoring confidence in a stable euro and ensuring Ireland has the assurance of access to EU funds under the ESM treaty, should this be required.  They also recognise the importance of good housekeeping for our economy.  We cannot continue to spend more than we raise in taxes, thereby increasing our debt and draining the resources intended for stimulating economic growth, job creation and public services.  In order to service our spiralling debt, we must manage our economy and debt.  Ratifying the stability treaty would demonstrate a commitment to doing just that.</P>
        <P>More broadly, the economy needs an effective resolution to the eurozone crisis as the crisis has weighed on economic growth over the past year.  The crisis has been the principal reason for all forecasters to revise downwards our economic growth forecasts, and their assessment of our ability to return to market-based funding.  In striving to meet the growth challenge for Europe, the Government is convinced that it will not have finished its work until what has become the major source of the loss of confidence in the eurozone, namely, the crisis in the banking sector, is addressed.  Too many banks in Europe are responding to the crisis by tightening credit conditions for enterprise, thus damaging investment and job creation.  As Senators will be aware, the European Council is to meet later this week.  Developing a credible growth strategy agenda for Europe will be the foremost item for discussion.  We will participate proactively in that discussion to agree a credible solution.</P>
        <P>Turning to the ESM, the Government believes the availability to Ireland of credible funding backup, as provided by the ESM treaty, will be very important in respect of market re-entry and leaving the EU-IMF programme of support.  Enacting this legislation and ratifying the treaty will ensure that Ireland will have access to this funding safety net if its efforts to re-access the markets are delayed in any way and it needs to resort to further assistance.</P>
        <P>The effective lending capacity of the ESM will be &euro;500 billion.  Following the euro group meeting held on 20 March last, it was decided that the EFSF would remain active until July 2013.  The ESM will be the main instrument to finance new programmes from July 2012.  The EFSF will, as a rule, remain active only in financing programmes that have started before that date.  For a transitional period until 2013, the EFSF will engage in new programmes in order to ensure full, fresh lending capacity of &euro;500 billion for the ESM.  After 2013, the EFSF will continue in an administrative capacity until all outstanding bonds have been repaid.  In this context, there is provision that the ESM may assume the rights and responsibilities of the EFSF.  Such an event would not, however, affect the existing terms and conditions of our EFSF loans.</P>
        <P>Turning to the ESM treaty and its provisions, the treaty set out in the schedule to this Bill was signed by euro area member states on 2 February 2012.  The original version of the treaty was signed on 11 July 2011 but was subsequently modified to incorporate decisions taken by the euro area Heads of State or Government on 21 July and 9 December 2011 aimed at improving the effectiveness of the mechanism.</P>
        <P>The ESM will perform the same activities as the European Financial Stability Framework, which it is to replace, namely: issue bonds or other debt instruments on the market to raise the funds needed to provide loans to countries in financial difficulties; intervene in the primary nd secondary debt markets; act on the basis of a precautionary programme; and finance recapitalisations of financial institutions through loans to Governments, including in non-programme countries.</P>
        <P>All financial assistance to member states will be provided under appropriate conditionality, appropriate to the financial instrument chosen.  The ESM will use an appropriate funding strategy so as to ensure access to broad funding sources and enable it to extend financial assistance packages to member states under all market conditions.</P>
        <P>As Senators will be aware, there has been considerable attention on the challenges facing the banking sector in Europe in recent weeks.  There are increasing calls for the ESM&rsquo;s tools to be extended to allow the ESM directly recapitalise systemically important financial institutions rather than recapitalisation through loans to ESM members for the purpose of recapitalising its financial institutions, thereby not adding to national debt by separating sovereign and banking debt.</P>
        <P>As well as aggravating the financial crisis, the insistence to date that taxpayers in each member state must stand behind the entire liabilities of banks regulated in their jurisdiction has damaged the Single Market.  The solution, in the Government&rsquo;s view, is to accelerate moves to develop a joint response to the banking crisis in Europe.  It is important from here on in that we avoid the mistake of allowing bank crises in individual countries develop into sovereign crises in those countries and beyond, by way of contagion.  Ireland has painful experience of that approach.  It is not the best way to help recovery.  What we need, as we stated before, during and after the election of last year, is a pan-European political solution to this banking crisis.</P>
        <P>Europe badly needs a success story as it seeks to recover.  Ireland can provide that success story if the correct framework is put in place.  We will continue to monitor closely developments in Spain and elsewhere and we will seek a solution that works for Ireland &mdash; that assists our economic and financial recovery to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s bank debt is made more sustainable.</P>
        <P>I want to make it abundantly clear, as has the Minister for Finance, that if the terms and conditions change in respect of any of the programmes for applicant countries concerning bank recapitalisation, we will demand as of right that those terms and conditions be made retrospective in respect of our situation.  If the terms and conditions improve for other countries, they must improve for this country.  The Minister for Finance, as late as last week and in the previous conference call of eurozone Ministers on the previous Saturday week, made that perfectly clear to colleagues across the eurozone and the European Union.</P>
        <P>The ESM treaty will enter into force as of the date when instruments of ratification, approval or acceptance have been deposited by signatories whose initial subscriptions represent no less than 90% of the total subscriptions set out in the treaty.  To date, France, Greece and Slovenia have ratified the ESM treaty and the remaining euro area member states are on track for ratification and the coming into force of the ESM by 9 July.</P>
        <P>The ESM treaty provides that the granting of financial assistance in the framework of new programmes under the ESM will be conditional, as of 1 March 2013, on the ratification of the stability treaty by the ESM member concerned and on implementation of the balanced budget rule as specified in the stability treaty within the agreed timeline which is one year after entry into force of the latter.  The stability treaty contains a mirroring provision relating to the grant of assistance under the ESM.</P>
        <P>As Senators will also be aware, the linkage of both the ESM and the stability treaty refers to new applications for assistance under the ESM and will not affect the transfer to the ESM of undisbursed amounts under the EFSF to Ireland and other programme countries.  Thus, while the ESM will replace the EFSF and may assume the rights and obligations of the EFSF, this will not affect the terms and conditions of any amounts consequently transferred to the ESM and subsequently disbursed to Ireland.</P>
        <P>To put this in straightforward terms, the terms and conditions applicable to Ireland under the EFSF will continue to apply once the funds transfer to the ESM.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>To obtain the highest possible credit rating the capital structure of the ESM will have total subscribed capital of &euro;700 billion, of which &euro;80 billion will be in the form of paid-in capital by the euro area member states to be paid in five equal instalments from July 2012.  The balance of &euro;620 billion will be callable capital.  The contribution key for each member state is set out in Annex 1 of the treaty and based on the European Central Bank capital contribution key.  For Ireland, the key is 1.592% of the total paid and committed capital.  Ireland&rsquo;s share of the &euro;80 billion in paid-in capital, based on the contribution key, will be slightly above &euro;1.27 billion.  We will pay this into the ESM in five equal instalments of &euro;254 million.  The total contribution will be paid before the end of the first six months of 2014.  Unlike the EFSF, there is no &ldquo;stepping out facility&rdquo; in the ESM when members enter a programme of support.  Every ESM member must, therefore, contribute its paid-in capital.</P>
        <P>The ESM will fund any programme through borrowing on the financial markets and lending the funding to programme countries.  The capital base, both paid in and callable, provides the backup for the borrowing.  The capital base is not used to directly lend to programme countries.  The &euro;80 billion sum will be used as leverage to obtain moneys on the money markets which can then be used for the disbursement of funds to successful applicant countries.</P>
        <P>The ESM is being established as an intergovernmental organisation under public international law.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution will be treated as a financial transaction.  This means that while it will impact on Ireland&rsquo;s Exchequer borrowing requirement, it will not impact on the general Government deficit.  Ireland&rsquo;s share of the &euro;620 billion callable capital is based on the same key, that is, 1.592% of &euro;620 billion, making the callable capital &euro;9.87 billion, which will be accounted for as a contingent Iiability on the State.</P>
        <P>Following the decision of the euro group on 30 March, the paid-in capital will be made available more quickly than initially foreseen in the original ESM treaty.  Two tranches of capital will be paid in 2012, the first in July and the second by October, with another two tranches to be paid in 2013 and a final tranche to be paid in the first half of 2014.  In line with the ESM treaty, the payment of the capital will be further accelerated, if needed, to maintain a 15% ratio between the paid-in capital and the outstanding amount of ESM issuances.  Any decision to change the authorised capital stock of the ESM will require a unanimous decision of the ESM&rsquo;s board of governors.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, will be governor for Ireland at the board &mdash; I am sure he loves that title &mdash; and will serve to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s interests are represented.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012 is to further facilitate, in the public interest, the financial stability of the European Union by establishing a permanent stability mechanism to assume the tasks of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing, where needed, financial assistance for euro area member states.  For the information of Senators, I have provided a brief note on each of the sections which we can discuss in greater detail on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a constructive debate on the Bill.  This is a time for unity among euro area countries to ensure financial stability in the euro area.  The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the stability of the European Union and the safeguarding of the euro area as a whole.  Ireland must play its part as it is in its interests and those of the eurozone.  For this reason, I urge Senators to support the Bill.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the positive comments that had been made by the Leader of the Opposition and others who have agreed to fast-track the legislation and to take it in the manner set out for today and tomorrow.  We appreciate the co-operation and support which is very much in the national interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not detain the House.  The establishment of the ESM was central to the debate on the referendum.  The stabilisation of the European situation is something all citizens want, regardless of their political allegiance or whether they agree or disagree with the recent referendum or with the stability treaty itself.  It could be said that the treaty and the Bill which reinforces the European Stability Mechanism is a step.  It is not the solution to Europe&rsquo;s problems.  I agree with most of what the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, said.  The ESM is required as a permanent stability mechanism for EU member states.</P>
        <P>I urge those who are of a mind not to support the Bill to reflect on the benefits that would be evident if a mechanism such as the ESM were in place when we introduced the bank guarantee scheme in 2008.  Already that will be clear to the Spanish who did not have a blanket guarantee and whereby the &euro;100 billion they are now securing from Europe will sit on the sovereign.  The Minister of State is aware that further work must be done.  He referred at the end of his speech to solidarity among European citizens, which I share.  All of us know the difficulties Irish people are going through as well as those in Greece and other countries, including Cyprus as of yesterday.  That is not something we want to see because on balance the European project over the past 35 years has been a positive force.  I accept we have had a global financial crisis, a failure of the banks and regulators and, in some instances, governments.  That is something we do not wish to repeat.</P>
        <P>The lack of pace in dealing with the crisis is of concern to me, as I am sure it is to others.  The crisis has been going on for three and a half years.  I have discussed previously with the Minister of State on numerous occasions the degree of urgency evident from governments in central Europe, particularly Germany, which has a different view on the matter and is very important to the stability of Europe.  I understand that states cannot go in with a big stick and demand certain things but I would expect the Government to have a negotiating position that is more than just to give us the best deal equivalent to what some other country gets.  Perhaps the Minister of State would reflect on that.  It is the one criticism I have.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the negotiations are not easy, but it is not a sustainable position for the Government to state that we are going to insist upon the best deal that other countries get.  I would like to think that we would have a position ourselves and that we would look for a better deal on the basis of the fact that our citizens in the past four years have taken on the burden and seen their standard of living reduced substantially.  People are paying extra taxes and suffering the cuts that have been imposed and they are doing it in the main in a way that implies understanding if not acceptance.  We have not seen the type of unrest we have seen in other European states.  It is commendable of people in this country but it is extremely difficult to look forward to the next three or four years.</P>
        <P>The ESM will make a difference.  That is why I and my party support the Bill and supported the referendum.  We will facilitate the expeditious passing of the Bill through this House as much as possible because it is crucial, but it needs additional amendment.  We must expand the ESM so that it can inject funds directly into banks that require help.  That will happen but it is a pity it is not happening yet.  Everyone can see that as the situation evolves and gets worse, neither Germany nor Europe will not be able to hold off.  It is inevitable that it is coming down the track but it is a pity it is taking so long.  We need the ESM to go hand in hand with pan-European regulation of the banking system.  I do not fear oversight of the banking system at a central level.  That should be done properly.  There is nothing to be feared from that.  It is not a diminution of sovereignty.  We are ensuring that we work together as best we can for the good of our citizens.  We do need a Europe-wide deposit protection scheme.  That was a promise the Government mentioned before the election.  A mechanism absolutely needs to be put in place whereby senior bondholders share the burden of the further debt that will be foisted upon European citizens and that has been foisted upon our own citizens.  It is as plain as the nose on one&rsquo;s face.  The Greek people were able to secure a write-down, but I would not want to be in Greece.  I am not saying it was to their advantage, but if it had not been arrived at, the situation in Greece would be even less sustainable than it is now.  Our citizens, Government and Oireachtas may be able to move forward with budgets that bridge the deficit between what we spend and what we take in, but we can still call for a write-down and for burden-sharing in the banking sector.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister knows what else needs to be done in Europe.  I have outlined, from my own party&rsquo;s perspective, areas in which we feel Europe needs to strengthen legislation and regulation and, more importantly, to allow a wider remit for the ESM and the ECB in dealing with the banking crisis.  The most important message for the Minister is that I do not believe that simply waiting for another state to get a better deal and then piggybacking on that is the best negotiating position.  We should have a position.  I will not go back over the phone call with Chancellor Merkel and what transpired there.  I have spoken about that in the House on a number of occasions.  I would like to think the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach have a real position that is not simply an intention to wait and see.  We need to be securing allies across Europe among the smaller and peripheral states, but in addition, the larger states need to understand that this country and its citizens, back in 2008, saved the euro and the European banking system.  Anyone who looks back at the events of 2008 and everything that has happened since then &mdash; events that have hurt our citizens immensely and resulted in a significant drop in our cost of living &mdash; will see that the position taken by Ireland, whether we agree or disagree on it in hindsight, was that no bank should fail.  That is what we were told at the time.  The previous Government was bounced into a deal at that time and was bounced into taking the external assistance.  I would like to see Europe acting much more quickly, without waiting for other countries.  We should consider what happened with Cyprus last night.  If it is the case that nothing will happen until a German bank is threatened with failure, that is not sustainable.</P>
        <P>There could be more to the stability mechanism Bill.  In addition, there should be more to the European Stability Mechanism, and I think there will be more to it.  However, our Government needs to press more in that regard and to seek the things I and other colleagues are asking for today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>Without the referendum, we would not have this Bill.  Much work was done by Fine Gael and the Labour Party to get the proposal passed.  That tends not to be noticed, because the expectation is that Government parties will get a proposal over the line.</P>
        <P>I have long been critical of the stance Fianna F&aacute;il has taken on various issues, and I have always believed its members put Fianna F&aacute;il first, rather than the nation.  That was not the case on this occasion.  After 2011, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party put the nation first, which was the right thing to do on behalf of the people of this country.  I say that in a very earnest way.  Unfortunately, there is a new Fianna F&aacute;il, and it is also unfortunate that its representatives in this Chamber are not present to hear what I have to say, namely, the new Fianna F&aacute;il is Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in is the new Fianna F&aacute;il on the basis that it puts the party ahead of the nation.  That is not good for any political party.  I do not say this lightly, as I respect Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s three representatives in the Chamber.  They are people of ability, but anyone with ability could see that passing the referendum was the right and intelligent choice on behalf of the people.  There is a problem within the party, in that the emperor of Sinn F&eacute;in is wearing no clothes, but everyone in the party is too afraid to tell him.  It needs to be said within with, as it is no good coming from me.</P>
        <P>The main question is not about the Bill before the House &mdash; it must be passed and become part of the armoury to address the fiscal insanity in Europe &mdash; but about whether the European Stability Mechanism will be given a banking licence.  This question has been asked by many academics across the world.  If it is given a banking licence, will it be allowed to capitalise financial institutions directly?</P>
        <P>Five countries require funds from their European counterparts.  Cyprus, Spain and Ireland have suffered banking meltdowns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome him to the Chamber.  It is good to see that he is wearing clothes.</P>
        <P>Three of the five countries that have required funding to date did not experience deficit-led difficulties but banking difficulties.  The banking institutions within Europe managed to ensure the sovereigns took on the debts and were locked out of the market.</P>
        <P>It is clear that we will contribute &euro;1.27 billion of the &euro;80 billion in cash that will be held on account for the ESM.  Will our contribution form part of the general Government deficit or will it form part of a contingent liability external to the general Government deficit?  A further sum of &euro;9.87 billion could be called on.  If it is, will it form part of the general Government deficit?  We need to consider this question, given our deficit targets stemming from the referendum result.</P>
        <P>According to certain commentators, if one tells the markets the size of a firewall, how much will be available, what the collateral will be and the amounts to be lent, the people working against Government agencies will know how much they will need to attack currencies, as occurred previously.  Is the firewall large enough?  The funding that will be required by Ireland, Spanish banks and, potentially, the Spanish sovereign is in question.  People wonder whether a sum of &euro;500 billion will be enough.  If we tell the markets that this is the amount being put up, they can claim it is not enough.  If the ESM was allocated a banking licence, it would have the firepower of the European Central Bank available to it.  According to commentators, the bank&rsquo;s funding can be limitless, if it so chooses.  Owing to the German psyche and political circumstances, however, there appears to be no willingness to take that route.  If the fund needs to be increased, will the governors of the ESM have the authority to do so?  Must it revert to the parliaments which passed this type of legislation?  Will each country&rsquo;s parliament have a veto?  What happens if a country says &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  My reading of the legislation is that this process must be unanimous with Ministers, who are the governors.  If it must be unanimous among governors, does it also need to be unanimous within all the member states?</P>
        <P>There is a question regarding the inviolability of ESM staff with regard to prosecution.  I understand this is the case with other lenders of last resort, specifically the IMF.  Does this meet with other international norms or the provisions of other international treaties?  There is a similar question regarding tax exemptions.  Are the tax exemptions similar to those in place for other personnel?</P>
        <P>There are a couple of quotes which are very relevant to where we are as a Continent.  It has been said, specifically about Spanish banks, that a short-term fix could store up longer-term problems.  Spanish banks took ECB money and may well use it to buy more government debt.  That is what can be described as the loop of doom, with weak banks propped up by weak sovereigns and falling value.  That must be broken.  If we do not break that cycle, who knows where we will end up.</P>
        <P>There may be geopolitical consequences in this process that we cannot yet predict.  There was only one world war in the last century, as opposed to two, as World War I was paused for a little over 20 years because one of the nations became impoverished.  Europe has been shown to be more savage than any other continent in fighting wars, and unless the ECB and government institutions sort out these issues once and for all, we do not know where this will end.  I do not say that lightly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State as I always look forward to his visits here.  As noted, this is a moment of crisis.  We were bounced into the bank rescues, which brings us back to the design faults in the euro in the first instance, with no banking regulation, exit mechanism or anything to protect small countries like us from tsunamis of credit from large countries like Germany, and the one size fits all interest rate policy.  Fiscal transfers and fiscal federalism were not enough.  I wonder if, despite the best efforts of our Minister, we are getting any closer to the solution.</P>
        <P>A German court in Karlsruhe last Thursday asked German President Gauck not to sign the legislation for a permanent bailout until judges ruled on several constitutional complaints likely to be filed as early as next week.  A report in <i>The Irish Times</i> notes that eight countries besides Germany have yet to ratify the legislation.  There is the list of countries in serious difficulty, including Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Cyprus.  How long can we continue to hold this show together?  Did we confuse the European currency &mdash; the euro &mdash; with the European ideal that Senator D&rsquo;Arcy spoke about?  Was it a step too far and has it created more problems than it solved?  As has been noted, it certainly has for this country, as we were put on the front line to defend the banking system and bounced into saving outfits like Anglo Irish Bank.  One doubts, in rational discussion, if anybody would have recommended such action, and it is a pity we did not have a chance to explain to our German colleagues that the bank really was not worth saving or any good to us.  It was not worth saving and would not have done much good for us.  I do not know in what direction the future of Europe will go.  Of the northern countries with which Germany compares itself, Norway, Sweden and Denmark did not join and it is likely that Finland might leave along with Switzerland right next door.  How far Germany is willing to go to pay for this operation has to be dealt with and we await what the constitutional court says.  Chancellor Merkel has been heavily criticised but what she says makes a great deal of sense to people in Germany.  The worry is that despite so much effort being expended and so many summits &mdash; the Taoiseach must attend another at the end of the week &mdash; Europe is not able to resolve the underlying design faults in the euro.  While most of us were not in the House at the time, on joining the euro, we should have debated these issues and perhaps some of the problems we have encountered might have been foreseen.  I wish the Minister of State well in his efforts and I acknowledge his request for support from all sides of the House.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Brien on that as well.</P>
        <P>Ireland is required to put in &euro;254 million but we do not have it.  That is our problem.  If we had &euro;254 million, many Members would be delighted.  Is it a design fault that countries that have been rescued are being asked to contribute to their own rescue?</P>
        <P>Political union is seen as the solution, particularly by Germany, but that will raise problems in many countries.  Fiscal union raises problems for us because we want to preserve our low corporation tax rate but Germany does not want monetary union until a political union is in progress.  We have an ongoing crisis and I wish the Minister of State and the Minister for Finance the best of luck in trying to deal with it but we are in such choppy waters that it is distracting from long-term discussions about where Europe should be and what kind of Europe people want.  It is difficult to see when we are dealing with a failed European project, that is, the currency, how more fiscal and political union is the answer when we are trying to absorb the consequences of a failed policy.</P>
        <P>Going back to day 1 in case anything like that ever happens again, we should have put the bankers who arrived at 8 p.m. at the Department of Finance on the planes to Frankfurt and Brussels.  We did our country a great deal of harm and Europe a fair amount of good, as Senator D&rsquo;Arcy said, by taking on that burden ourselves but we have borne it for the best part of four years and it has held the country back.  The next time round we will have to know which problems are domestic and which are European to distinguish between the two.  We also will have to have a plan B if the eurozone breaks up because many people outside the continent think it will not survive and that is the message the markets are sending.  The German Government is paying others to take their bonds while other countries are being charged 6% or 7% to have their bonds purchased.  The markets, therefore, have decided that the German way of running public finances does not extend throughout the eurozone and, until that is resolved, a heavy penalty will be paid by countries in deficit, of which we are one through no fault of our own.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State success in dealing with this dilemma which is the major reason the composition of the both Houses of the Oireachtas changed so much following the last election.  We have inherited this problem and we all have to work together to find a solution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The recent referendum campaign offered us a good opportunity to have a robust debate about the ESM and, at times, it seemed the treaty we were debating was the ESM treaty as opposed to the fiscal stability treaty.  We should not rehash what was said at that time but it is sufficient and important to note there was much misinformation circulated.  I hope the sovereign voice of the Irish people will put an end to this type of politicking.</P>
        <P>I was not sure at the time and am not sure now how anybody could have proposed a position that would see us turning our back on a fund we might need if we cannot return to the markets next year.  In the next couple of months, when the NTMA floats three-month money, we will determine whether we will be successful and see how the markets react.  If the transaction is successful, we will have an indication as to how the markets will view us next year when there is a more substantial auction of Irish debt.  I expect we will be successful and that this will facilitate a return to the markets and, consequently, a return to our economic sovereignty, which was given away so casually and carelessly through the policies of the previous Government.  This will be a massive step in our gaining control of our economic sovereignty.</P>
        <P>We will be successful in our return to the markets and will not require the assistance of the ESM, but access to the ESM will act as a fallback position in our negotiations.  Can one imagine the position, in the approach to 2014, if we did not achieve a return to the markets or pass this legislation, thereby shutting ourselves out of the ESM?  In January 2014, a sovereign bond worth &euro;11 billion is due for repayment.  I refer to the so-called funding cliff.  To this, we can add perhaps &euro;8 billion or &euro;9 billion in borrowings to fund the gap in the public finances.</P>
        <P>If we had no access to the ESM, we would have two choices, the first of which would be to return to the market at punitive, unsustainable rates that would risk a return to pre-2008 figures, thereby devastating the economy absolutely and the slow and painful progress made to date.  The other option would be to find the money among the moneys available for current expenditure.  We can see the difficulties facing us this year as we try to save &euro;3.6 billion.  There would be a social catastrophe if we had to find a figure a multiple of that sum.</P>
        <P>Even if the opponents of the ESM could convince me that there is another funding route available, we should still pass this Bill and play our part as full partners in the EU project.  People stated during the course of the treaty debate that the IMF would fund us.  This is contested.  As we know, we have already borrowed up to 1,200% of our IMF quota.  Normal conditions require that IMF funding be no more than 300%.  Consider the view that the IMF, which relies for funding on members, including those countries which are considered to be part of the Third World, would come to our rescue and offer us up to 5,000% of our quota.  Suggesting this is a viable alternative in the absence of passing this Bill is certainly to misunderstand the functioning of the IMF and, perhaps, to delude oneself deliberately.</P>
        <P>It is stated that for the ESM to be established, there is a requirement to amend Article 136 of the TFEU.  This could well be so but there is also a school of thought that the ESM is established outside the architecture of European law, which would require that the European courts would not be the final arbitrators at all.  The establishment of the ESM by way of an international treaty could come under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.  Therefore, the argument about Article 136 is uncertain, to say the least.</P>
        <P>I have heard strange arguments as to why we should not pass this Bill or sign up to the ESM.  Some ask whether we would not be better off keeping our money rather than putting it at risk and whether it would be best to spend it on ourselves.  They ask why should we give money to Greece, Spain, Portugal Cyprus or any other country.  Their talk seems strangely similar to that which I hear from the more bellicose or belligerent German commentators, who are making exactly same case for not funding Ireland.  That is a little ironic.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage, I will have a few questions for the Minister of State, particularly on the stepping-out mechanism found in the EFSF.  In regard to Article 9(4), there may be some flexibility.  Tomorrow, we will hear some of the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on this.  It is important that we pass this Bill.  It is vital to our economic well-being and recovery.  I look forward to discussing it further on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I remember when he was an active participant in this House and a valuable contribute and I congratulate him on his appointment to such a significant post.</P>
        <P>As he might imagine, I have certain questions about this entire arrangement.  I sympathise with him and the gradualist position of the Government, in holding its nerve and incrementally improving the position of Ireland.  It is morally repugnant that Ireland, which has obeyed all the rules, met every request made of it and conformed to everything demanded, still is consistently punished.</P>
        <P>What has happening here in Europe is analogous to what happened in the Famine, where there was a doctrinaire rigid economic theory imposed from a central authority on the satellite areas of a large and powerful political entity.  Germany is imposing such an arrangement on us against the wishes of the people.</P>
        <P>The difficulty is that one will always get into a mess, if one starts with the establishment.  Every decent Government should start with the welfare of the people, assess the impact of measures taken to protect the welfare of the people on the system and adjust the system accordingly.  That is particularly true when we have got to the sophisticated stage in the 21st century where money is notional.  That is quite clear from the operations of the ratings agencies.</P>
        <P>I know not how the ratings agencies have the cheek to continue operating because they helped precipitate this entire crisis.  They put the skids under the world economy and it is still apparently tolerable that they are rating.  It is appalling that they derated 19 banks in Spain yesterday.  I reiterate my call here for an international financial court to try individuals, companies and groups for economic crimes against humanity because companies such as Goldman Sachs and the ratings agencies have certainly done so.</P>
        <P>I understand what the Minister of State means, and it is part of this gradualist approach.  I hope it works but I do not believe it will.  Of course, he is correct in stating, &ldquo;There are increasing calls for the ESM&rsquo;s tools to be extended to allow the ESM directly recapitalise systemically important financial institutions&rdquo;, and that the sovereign people should be absolved.</P>
        <P>However, there are aspects of the treaty itself that are completely laughable.  The opening, &ldquo;THE CONTRACTING PARTIES, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Estonia, Ireland, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Republic of Cyprus, .  . &rdquo;, is a list of countries, half of which are bust.  We are contributing, and we have no money.  We are agreeing to put &euro;11 billion in.</P>
        <P>I recall asking in this House during one of the first bailout situations what our ultimate exposure could be and being told it was &euro;400 billion.  When I asked what was our gross national product, they did not know.  The Department officials had to go out and make a telephone call to find it was &euro;200 billion.  I stated even I could see it amounted to everything we would have for the next two years and asked what would happen if they called in the chips.  There was no answer, except that it could not happen.  It did happen.</P>
        <P>That is why I say there is no vision.  There is no leadership in Europe.  We are still tinkering with the system.  The fiscal treaty requires not 12 of the 25 European Union members, but 12 of the 17 euro area members.  The Minister of State has not made that mistake but many other commentators, including members of the Government, have made that mistake publicly.  The entering into force of the ESM treaty requires, as the Minister of State stated up-front, ratification by those contributing 90%.  That means the eight largest economies in Europe can trigger it.  It requires not 12 but eight, which represents half the eurozone and one third of European Union membership.  It is a minority controlling matters.</P>
        <P>I would like a little openness every so often in the middle of all the financial gobbledygook that is contained in this Bill.  I like things that are accessible and which people can understand.  I can understand very well what is being done on page 52 of the Bill and have tabled a series of amendments to address this.  Article 32.3 of the treaty states, &ldquo;The ESM, its property, funding and assets, wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall enjoy immunity from every form of judicial process&rdquo;.  This is an horrendous provision.  Do people realise that the ESM is not subject to the law?</P>
        <P>Article 32.4 states, &ldquo;The property, funding and assets of the ESM shall, wherever located and by whomsoever held, be immune from search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation or any other form of seizure, taking or foreclosure by executive, judicial, administrative or legislative action.&rdquo;  Where does this leave us?  I would describe this as a dictatorship.</P>
        <P>Article 32.5 reads, &ldquo;The archives of the ESM and all documents belonging to the ESM or held by it, shall be inviolable.&rdquo;  Article 32.6 reads, &ldquo;The premises of the ESM shall be inviolable.&rdquo;  Where does this stop?  It means there is absolutely no accountability in this body into which we will shove as much as &euro;8.5 billion.  The first tranche will be more than &euro;1 billion and this week we will squirt away another &euro;1.5 billion when we pay the bondholders.  This is madness.  There is no radical thought evident throughout Europe and I wish to God there was.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his indulgence.  We are witnessing the death throes of capitalism, a kind of slow motion mortality, and I wish they would hurry up and get on with it.  Let capitalism die and get off the stage in order that we can get back to human values.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and extend best wishes to him in his efforts.  As he outlined, the delicate position in the eurozone and a lack of growth are creating an obstacle for Ireland as an exporting nation.  While Irish exports are doing well, the eurozone crisis needs to be addressed in order that we can explore the potential to open up new markets.</P>
        <P>The Minister provided figures on the sums Ireland must pay into the European Stability Mechanism.  I understand Ireland&rsquo;s total paid-in capital will be &euro;1.27 billion to be paid in five equal instalments of &euro;254 million, although Senator Norris referred to a figure in excess of &euro;11 billion.  This strikes me as similar to how Anglo Irish Bank conducted its business in that we will borrow money to make these payments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate, however, that we must stay in the game.  After all, where would we be without EFSF funding and the European Union?  The Government&rsquo;s preferred option is to re-enter the bond markets in the second half of 2013.  While no one is willing to say this, the alternative to re-entering the bond markets is to seek a second bailout.  If funding is available to Ireland at an interest rate of 1%, even on condition that we obtain a second bailout, why would we contemplate returning to the markets where we may have to pay interest of 4% or 5% to borrow money?  I seek clarity on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill he has introduced.  It is unfortunate this Bill marks another small step when giant steps are needed to address Europe&rsquo;s economic problems.  It has not reassured the markets and one wonders what ultimate policy initiatives will achieve that end.  I spoke informally to someone earlier and I predict that it will happen in approximately 2020 when it will dawn on politicians over a prolonged period that these minor steps will not achieve the outcome they seek and we will have had a decade of stagnation at that stage.  I do not say that lightly or with any degree of exaggeration.  When all of this happened in 2008 it was unprecedented since the Wall Street collapse of 1929.  Both the bureaucrats and politicians right across the globe, not just in Europe &mdash; the same could be applied in the United States &mdash; have failed to grasp the seriousness of the issues that face us.</P>
        <P>I hold the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, in high regard but I am concerned about some of the decisions made by his more senior colleagues.  I am a critic of the Department in which the Minister of State serves and in particular of the senior Minister.  The previous budget was nothing short of disgraceful.  It failed to grasp the seriousness of the issues.  The soft options of cutting capital expenditure and increasing VAT by 2% were taken in preference to taking the fundamental decisions that needed to be taken in the economy.  I do not just say it now.  I said it when we were in government that our salary levels are far too high both in the public sector and in the private sector.  Public sector salaries are in excess of private sector salaries.  It was a serious mistake to have allowed it to happen.  There has been no recognition of that.  We must have an ongoing debate on cutting social welfare rates &mdash; it is not popular for politicians to say it and very few are willing to say it &mdash; and cutting public service salaries, from which I benefit myself.  It is my only source of income, as is the case with many Members of the House.</P>
        <P>Correspondingly, we must bring the cost of living in this country under control.  I would have thought it would be a priority for the incoming Government to establish a new Department of competitiveness and consumer affairs.  If we had done that we would have driven down excesses which occurred in many particular areas of the economy.  We have often referred to the legal profession in this House and I will not chase after that chestnut now but it is an example of the abuse of privilege within our economic structures.  Politicians of all hues seem to be afraid of tackling it.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett posed the interesting question, which if it was made two years ago, people would have scoffed at, but nobody is scoffing at it now, namely, whether the euro will survive, and if the European Union will survive.  He asked what damage the collapse of the euro would do to the Single Market.  We are at a crossroads.  What we are doing is introducing a series of minor adjustments and meeting each crisis with the minimum required to prevent going over the precipice.  When we had to borrow we were followed by Portugal and Greece.  Subsequently, Spain has met with serious difficulty.</P>
        <P>The ESM is interesting.  It is a good initiative which has a significant difference for us to its predecessor in that countries in the bailout were not expected to subscribe to the fund from which we borrowed.  That is a significant and substantial difference.  This time we do contribute and the amount is in the order of &euro;1.25 billion.  The question is this: is &euro;700 billion, of which only &euro;500 billion can be lent, anywhere near adequate?  I do not believe it is.  The amount required by Spain alone, if it needs to be bailed out, will exceed that figure.  When I expressed my opinion recently, one of the other Ministers said I must have read it in the <i>Financial Times</i>.  It is true that I came across it in certain articles written by economists.  I am no expert in the area, but from my own business experience, the one thing we need to do is to get ahead of the curve.  The minimum required to get ahead of it &mdash; it might not even achieve this &mdash; is &euro;2 trillion, or three times the amount planned for the ESM.  The reason for not doing it is the imposition it would place on certain countries.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the Bill, we need to do far more.  Although the Minister has the support of my party, it is clear from contributions on all sides of the House that there needs to be a recognition within the Government and the European Council that unless we are to leave the European economy to stagnate and act as a drag on the global economy for at least a decade, much more significant measures need to be taken to tackle what is admittedly an unprecedented economic and financial crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State for this important business.  During the referendum campaign many people to whom I spoke while canvassing asked what the ESM proposal meant.  The best way I could describe it was based on my own insurance business.  Let us imagine someone comes into my office and says, &ldquo;I am not going to insure my house next year because it probably will not burn down and even if it does, my neighbours are all very good and they will probably help me out.&rdquo;  We all know that when the event does happen, the neighbours have the same problem as the person who does not want to insure his or her house.  Many believed the misconception propounded by those on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side that we did not really need this measure because, if the worst came to the worst, the European Union would help us out.  The best way I could explain it was that the measure was an insurance policy.  Most Members in this Chamber and most people in the country will never have a major insurance claim, but if the house burns down, we will need that backup.  One could use another analogy: if a person is going to lend me money to buy a house, he or she will say I need to insure the house because, if anything happens, I will need money to replace it.  It is simple economics and common sense.</P>
        <P>Many used the referendum campaign for different purposes such as electioneering and to propound their own views.  It got to the stage where people were saying they would not vote for the treaty because their neighbours did not cut the grass.  There were so many excuses.  It is a very simple treaty, but until we passed it, that insurance policy was not in place.  It was a lot to ask of people and many voted without knowing exactly what they were voting for, but they trusted the Government.  They also trusted Fianna F&aacute;il in opposition, the members of which, as Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy said, stepped up to the plate.  They saw the merits of the proposal and did not use it as a political trick to gain a few extra points in an opinion poll.  Everyone recognises this and I commend them for it.</P>
        <P>In its present form, the ESM may not be perfect, but it is like any house insurance policy.  It cannot be exactly as everyone wants it; there are always bits and pieces that might not be covered.  However, the ESM is the only show in town.</P>
        <P>As to where the EU will go from here, like many people I attended the European football championship in Poland and I read about the country&rsquo;s history during the Second World War.  More than 6 million Polish people died during the war, the highest <i>per capita</i> loss of any European country.  That conflict came about because of hundreds of years of war in Europe.  This financial battle does not compare with the First World War or Second World War.</P>
        <P>The European Stability Mechanism, ESM, is only one part of the solution and the situation will work itself out in the long term.  Without the ESM and like Greece, investors would not view Ireland as a country with a future.  Greece&rsquo;s write-down of approximately 53% had consequences in that public spending and wages were cut.  Many people point out that Greece received a write-down, but it was severe.  Although it cut the debt, it cut the standard of living and wages as well.  Now that our referendum has passed, a more measured debate can be held without a septic tank element being thrown into every argument.  I commend the Minister of State, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the rest of the Government on their work.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is concerned with building expectations and hyping considered responses from our European leaders, the inevitable fallout and policies that are being put in place despite their not meeting the needs of Europe or the Irish people.</P>
        <P>One month after the austerity treaty referendum, we are entering another period of negotiations that, as the Minister of State will accept, will see a shift in authority and sovereignty away from the people of this island.  Sinn F&eacute;in contends that Ireland is giving power to unaccountable and unelected EU bureaucrats.  Our negotiators&rsquo; attitude has not changed and the focus of this and previous Governments has been on protecting the system of international capital above and beyond ordinary working people and their daily needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>They are all elected Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>This attitude is inherent in the design of the proposed ESM.  We should have a financial mechanism on which countries that need help can call for support in difficult times.  We also accept that we need a mechanism that protects the integrity of the euro.  However, of more importance is protecting the livelihoods and standards of living of ordinary Europeans, be they working or unemployed.  However, the ESM as constituted and as outlined in this Bill does not meet these needs.</P>
        <P>I will address our five chief concerns quickly.  First, there should be an explicit option to use ESM funds to invest in job creation and growth measures as part of a credible deficit reduction strategy instead of maintaining the current focus on austerity.  Our European leaders have spoken a great deal about the need for growth.  We welcome this and wish to be part of the solution.  We must ensure growth across Europe, particularly in Ireland.  Continuing austerity would make it more difficult to deal with the economic situation.</P>
        <P>Second, there should be an option for direct European Central Bank, ECB, funding of the ESM to provide the necessary firewall to stabilise the euro while limiting the liability of taxpayers and individual member states.</P>
        <P>Part of the remit of the ESM is not just to bail out troubled states but to bail out banks.  The ESM will be used as a mechanism for states to apply for funding which they, in turn, will give to the banks.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>On three days this week, four separate bond payments relating to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide will be paid, costing the taxpayers &euro;1.15 billion.  I mentioned the emperor having no clothes and we know that Cyprus and Spain need to be bailed out and Ireland is in a bailout programme.  Italy may also need assistance.  There is no doubt this stability mechanism will not work and it is the wrong approach.  It is nonsensical to continue to heap more debt on countries, as we are doing, or seeking countries, especially those in a bailout scenario, to contribute to this fund.  We are also calling for a clause to ensure programme countries are not required to contribute to the fund, as is the case with the European financial stability facility, EFSF.  It is bizarre that countries in a bailout position are borrowing money to put into the fund from where they will borrow again.</P>
        <P>There must be a requirement to carry out strict stress tests and provide for a write-down of toxic debt as a pre-condition for ESM funds being used to recapitalise banks, either directly or indirectly via loans to governments.  We could have a position where banks are essentially seeking more money from taxpayers, either directly from the ESM or through the Irish Government repaying bonds.  It still amounts to governments using taxpayers&rsquo; money to put into banks and bail them out.  There is no conditionality attached to the process and toxic debt is still serviced, with bondholders receiving repayments with no significant haircuts.  Significant haircuts should be part of any solution.</P>
        <P>There is a need for greater accountability at EU and member state level, and the immunity granted to the fund and its board members should be removed.  Senator Norris raised this point a number of weeks ago, even before the Bill came before the House, when he indicated that there is a democratic deficit and accountability issue.  Will the Minister of State respond on why those immunity protections are in the Bill and what they mean?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is welcome.  He gives much of his time in this House, which we appreciate.  I welcome the Bill and the establishment of the ESM, and during the course of the treaty referendum campaign it was the key selling point of the treaty, even for me.  It is another piece of the puzzle in stabilising our currency and the Irish and eurozone economies in order that we can get on with the business of growth.  We know this will not be the panacea for all our problems but last week it was said we have a week to save the euro.  It is a concern.</P>
        <P>I read in the <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> that there is speculation that the ESM will not meet its effective lending capacity of &euro;500 billion due to the fact that countries like Spain, Greece, Portugal, Cyprus and perhaps even Ireland cannot possibly meet the required contribution to the fund.  Figures from that newspaper a few days ago suggest the ESM might have a lending capacity closer to &euro;420 billion.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?  We are all tired of relying on market reactions &mdash; the markets have too much power &mdash; but the reaction to the ESM being launched with such a shortfall might be dangerous for the eurozone.  Germany is unlikely to contribute the balance to the fund due to the effect it will have on that country&rsquo;s bonds, and another potential problem is that investors may not be quick to invest in the bonds guaranteed by countries whose own bonds trade at unsustainable levels.  The Minister of State might comment on those issues.  Despite the fact we are in shifting sands all the time, we need to ratify the treaty even if markets react badly at the launch.  This is the safety net we need for confidence, and its lending capacity will still meet the eurozone&rsquo;s needs, despite the problems I mentioned.</P>
        <P>Is there a maximum figure that Ireland can draw down from the ESM fund and is it based on input?  Are there limitations on what the money can be used for?  For example, could the money be used for investment in youth and employment or as a jobs stimulus?  I share concerns about the secrecy and immunity from prosecution or law for the governors of the fund.  Despite the comments of the previous speaker, these are elected officials, as they are Ministers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that but how is this provision healthy?  There is no point in us looking back in ten years and asking how we let that pass us by.  The Minister of State might comment on it.  Senator D&rsquo;Arcy touched on the next issue.  Will the ESM will get a banking licence and will it have an independent regulator?</P>
        <P>These are the questions for here and now.  Others have referred to the bigger point about the need for a long-term view on the euro.  I am concerned and, having canvassed in the recent referendum campaign, I know the Irish people are concerned.  We are tired of hobbling from one crisis to the next.  We need a political as well as an economic solution for Europe.  We need a ten year economic plan to save the euro, and that will require leadership.  I am not so sure where that leadership is in Europe now.</P>
        <P>When we take on the European Presidency on 1 January next, we must be magnanimous and think of the entire Union.  There is no doubt that Chancellor Merkel has a great opportunity to give that leadership, but we have not seen it.  Helmut Kohl showed such leadership when he reunited Germany, and we should remember that Chancellor Merkel comes from the former East Germany.  It is not easy to lead when one is looking behind at people, trying to keep them happy, and we should remember that Germany makes up a third of the eurozone.  Will the Minister of State comment on the political leadership needed in Europe and where he believes it is coming from?</P>
        <P>I know our position and was delighted to hear our Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, talking about the need for a European banking union.  It is long overdue and if we have a common currency, there should be a common banking union.  Our people want renegotiation of our banking debt and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is working very hard on the promissory notes issue.  It is very important for us to focus on the growth and jobs agenda but we need a loud and assertive voice to wield that weight in Europe and shift the narrative away from Chancellor Merkel, as I do not see the leadership there.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s views.  We will have an excellent opportunity on 1 January with the European Presidency and we can step up to the plate as a country.  Perhaps we can provide the leadership Europe does not have right now.  Although we do not have all the money, we can provide the inspiration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the legislation before us.  We supported the Government&rsquo;s position on the treaty and the establishment of the ESM, which will certainly give us options other than entering the bond markets again as a guinea pig to satisfy the egos of the people in the NTMA or Europe.  If money is available at 3% interest, I would prefer that to funding at 7% interest.</P>
        <P>I apologise for not being present for the entire debate but I was listening to it on the monitor.  I have an issue with our negotiating position, and the Minister of State mentioned that if anybody else gets a better deal, we will look for the same one.  This is a wait and see approach of noting whether other parties get concessions or more favourable terms.  We should be pioneering in this regard, trying to design our own deal.  There is no question that the bank debt will be added to.  We are a number of years down the line from where Spain is now, Italy is probably next and then Portugal after that in a larger way.  There are banks in France and possibly even in Germany that are at risk.  Going back to Senator Walsh&rsquo;s point, &euro;500 billion will probably not be enough.  The Irish position should be to build alliances to secure a pan-European bank debt pooling resolution organisation to take the debt off the heads of people in the programme countries.  We all hope something comes out of the summit later this week.</P>
        <P>Some people might laugh at the concept of debt write down.  I am not an economist but we managed as one of the wealthy nations of the world, as we thought, to cooperate with people from the world of celebrity in lobbying for the write down of debt in developing countries.  It was done and that was appropriate.  We will kick the can down the road with band aids such as the ESM, which is needed, until we get an overall solution to this crisis.  For political reasons in certain countries, we are some distance away from that.  The Irish Government should lead on the position of trying to develop a situation that is better for us and that will ultimately put the people front and centre.  We have all said that the banks still seem to be problem, and the bondholders are foremost in everyone&rsquo;s minds.  Everyone wants the people to be put first and in that context the solution must look at sovereign debt write down.</P>
        <P>There might be economic implications if that is done in a particular way but if it can be done with agreement on a pan-European basis, it could take ten years from a crisis that could be 20 or 25 years long.  That should be done.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt the Minister of State will check the record to ensure he heard everything I said.  Rather than waiting, however, to see if Spain gets a better deal, or if Italy does better, or to see the circumstances in Greece, we should be leading the way, saying we have done all we can in terms of austerity and to facilitate the European process.  We want a situation that will be better for the people.  Nothing that is currently being proposed will make much difference to the people on the street.  We can then get into the issue of the mortgage and debt crisis here as opposed to the country&rsquo;s debt in European terms.</P>
        <P>It is almost a year now since the Family Home Bill but we still have nothing concrete from the banks.  Senator Barrett&rsquo;s backstairs to the Department of Finance for the bankers seems to be alive and well.  Solutions that are coming to the surface are bank-driven.  Parts of loans will be shelved for a number of years.  I would support that but the banks are going to charge interest on the loan.  That is ridiculous.  Do we want to help people or is this another way of creating a complexion that the banks are doing something to help when all they are doing is helping themselves while giving a false impression that they are trying to help people?</P>
        <P>At European level we must lead, not wait, on what can be done in the context of adjusting the deal open to us, come up with a new deal, look at pooling the bank debt, at sovereign debt write down and at the growth programme.  On a national basis, the Minister should take the initiative back from the banks and take control of the situation of mortgage arrears and the debt crisis, and put in a place a programme where people could shelve part of their mortgage for a period without being charged for it.  What is the point of that?</P>

	<P>This has been a useful debate and I thank colleagues for their interesting observations on this legislation.  Tomorrow we can get into the detail of the Bill on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a small country and our ability to get out of this difficulty depends in the Government&rsquo;s view, and I suspect in the view of the great majority of the Houses, on negotiating our way out and using the opportunity we have to resolve the problems we face.  We are not going to do this by taking some dramatic unilateral position.  That is the view of most moderate people in the country.</P>
        <P>We face a very challenging situation.  I agree with the comments about the appalling financial crisis we face.  It is the view of the Government that a broader, pan-European solution to this problem is required.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the T&aacute;naiste and others are on record as looking at what would be required for a banking union.  Any cold, calm assessment of a banking union would give three answers.  It inevitably requires a degree of supervision across the entire banking system within the eurozone at a much heightened level of integration than has been the case up to now.  That is inevitable.  There would have to be some form of deposit scheme as a bedrock for the banking system.  It would also require a form of bank recapitalisation by European authorities where banks get into difficulties.</P>
        <P>I want to be clear about this Bill in case there is any confusion.  The ESM as currently constituted does not provide for that banking resolution.  It does not provide for funds in the ESM to be directly used for recapitalisation purposes.  If, in the future, it was chosen to be the vehicle for such bank recapitalisation, it would require a change to the treaty and at the very least a change to primary legislation in these Houses.  People who talk about this being a vehicle for bank recapitalisation must understand the facts.  It is currently not that vehicle, despite the growing body of opinion across the eurozone that to break the link between bank debt and sovereign debt, a fund authorised by the European authorities to fund bank recapitalisation is needed that is then not placed on the sovereign.  That is the fundamental problem we have been foisted with and that resolves itself in other countries, Spain being the latest.  Even though it has used a new vehicle to fund recapitalisation, the debt still lies with the Spanish sovereign.  Until there is a change in policy, and not just in Germany but in Finland, Austria and the Netherlands, that will remain the case.  We might want that to occur, as articulated consistently by the Government.  In the most recent conference call of eurozone Ministers, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, made this patently clear.  If there is a change in that policy, we will be seeking a change in terms and conditions also.  However, our wanting it to happen and it actually happening are two separate things.  We need to be honest in this debate about where we stand.</P>
        <P>We are moving towards much closer integration, particularly in the area of banking.  The current policy has not worked.  Let me consider the view expressed, referred to by some Senators, of the &euro;170 billion write-down for Greece.  I was at the eurozone meeting representing the Government on the night the second Greek bailout was agreed.  Senator Jimmy Harte was absolutely right that there was public and private sector involvement and an agreed debt write-down of &euro;170 billion.  One must ask, however, whether this has actually worked.  One could argue it worked for two months until the problem in Spain re-emerged.  I ask whether the arrangement has worked because there is a default position among commentators that if there is to be a radical write-down of debt, it will allow us to recalibrate economies, increase demand and get people back to work.  That is a presumption people make at their peril because there is no evidence that such a radical course of action across the eurozone &mdash; one could argue that there was a Lehman Brothers mark 2 in Greece &mdash; would actually solve the problem we face.  Those who speak with certainty about what is required also need to understand the depth of the crisis.  It is not just an economic crisis but also a political crisis.  I say this in all honesty to those who recognise it as such.</P>
        <P>The great problem we faced in the course of the past 12 months was that of the gigantic game of catch-up.  Last July we took very clear positions.  Then people in Europe went off on their holidays to the Mediterranean and came back in August and September only to wake up to the next phase of the crisis.  We said we would put together a firewall.  That is what we are now discussing.  It is what we said we needed last October&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We are putting the firewall in place and it will happen.</P>
        <P>It is a genuine criticism that up until now, where solutions have been found, they have not been implemented.  One could argue we are putting the firewall in place and that we have the fiscal treaty in place.  The latter sends a very important signal on all the issues Senator Sean Barrett raised in regard to his fiscal responsibility Bill, the debt brake and the clear view on bringing deficit budgeting to an end.  However, we have been very slow to react to these events.  We have been behind the curve, as some Senators stated and I very much agree with them.  That is why it is crucial for a small, open economy such as Ireland which does not have much leverage or room for manoeuvre to implement the various measures proposed as quickly as possible to obtain the certainty required to put our house in order.</P>
        <P>There has been an air of despondency in the House today, which I can understand given the crisis we face, but it must be noted that the position we face is better than the one we faced last year.  Our bank recapitalisation plan has been a success in that not only have we had tier capital ratios significantly higher than those of other countries, our banks are also better capitalised than Swiss banks.  We have also saved a lot of money.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt the Senator.</P>
        <P>It is arguable that our banking position now is better than that in Spain which is facing a crisis.  It will actually have a lower tier capital ratio than ours.  It is experiencing what we experienced 12 or 18 months ago.   I refer to the process started by the previous Government.  At least we should recognise we have gone through the process and put our banking pillars in place.  It has been cheaper than we expected, albeit at huge cost to the taxpayer.  Importantly, we are making a success of our programme.  Not every country can say this; Greece cannot do so.  Another country is now involved in a programme.  We are doing what we must do, irrespective of finding the bigger solution to the eurozone crisis; namely, fixing the deficit.  We have a big, fat deficit, less than one quarter of which is banking debt and the great majority of which is due to our overpaying ourselves and not raising the requisite capital through taxation as a means of funding services.  While we are making considerable progress, let us not forget that the majority of the debt we must pay has nothing to do with the banks.  It is due simply to the fact that there is a fundamental disparity between tax revenue and expenditure.  We must get this right over a number of years.</P>
        <P>I do not want to comment on Article 136 which was referred to by number of colleagues, not least because the matter is before the courts.  I have far too much respect for the concept of the separation of powers to intervene in an issue being adjudicated on by the courts.  I will address a number of the points raised by colleagues.</P>
        <P>Senator D&rsquo;Arcy raised the question of our contribution and asked how it would be treated in the accounts.  It will have an impact on the Exchequer borrowing requirement but not on the general Government deficit.  The callable capital will be accounted for as a contingent liability.  In the worst case scenario, if the money was called in, it would be a contingent liability carried by the State.  There are other aspects also, about which I will talk later.</P>
        <P>The Senator also asked whether a unanimous decision or legislation would be required to increase the authorised capital.  I understand to increase the authorised capital stock of the ESM a unanimous decision of the ESM&rsquo;s board of governors will be required.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, an increase in the authorised capital that should increase Ireland&rsquo;s contribution or subscription above the threshold of &euro;11 billion would also require an amendment to the legislation before us.</P>
        <P>On the question of immunities, I listened to what the Senators had to say and the doomsday scenario.  The same rights, privileges and immunities under the ESM apply under the United Nations, the World Bank and the European Commission.  These are international bodies corporate and there is no distinction between the immunities, rights, privileges and protections that apply to them and those that will apply in this instance.  To present the ESM as some kind of mad 007 agency that will follow a trail of mad financial destruction across the world is to reflect the desire in all of us for a thriller, but the reality is that the agency is no different an animal from any international organisation.  It has been set up as an international organisation because it will have leverage to borrow money on the international money markets at a rate that will probably be more credible than that which can be obtained by many sovereigns.  We can discuss this issue further tomorrow.</P>
        <P>On the stepping-in and stepping-out facilities, Senators are correct that under the EFSF scheme, one no longer makes contributions on becoming a programme country.  In the case of the ESM, however, the stepping-in and stepping-out facility will apply.  Irrespective of whether one is a programme country or obtaining funds, one must continue to make a contribution.  It is like a gigantic credit union, although I am sure the credit union will not like me comparing it to the ESM.  In order to draw down funds, one must put funds in.  That leads to my fundamental point, that if anyone can show me a part of the world where we could obtain money at a rate of 3% or less, he or she should do so.  Senator Marc MacSharry who thinks I was not listening to him made a valid point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State can multi-task.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator asked why would we put at risk the prospect of being able to draw down money at a rate of 3% or less.  Effectively, when we put money into the fund with all other countries to a maximum of &euro;80 million, the fund will borrow money in the money markets which will then be lent to countries for the purposes set out.  A tiny margin will be charged on that money.  Why would we want to resist this &mdash; a question posed before the referendum &mdash; particularly when one looks at our ten-year bond yields which have not gone down?  Our ten-year bond yields are static by comparison with those of other countries, which, in itself, sends a message.  Why would we want to resist the opportunity of obtaining money at a rate of 3% or less when the markets are charging 7%?  It is a no-brainer.  If one stops paying money into the fund, one will lose one&rsquo;s voting rights, which also would not make sense.  Why would we not want to have an Irish person as a board member of the new body?  That is an issue to which we can return tomorrow also.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many colleagues have asked why the institution is so unique.  We will be putting in &euro;1.27 billion between now and the first six months of 2014.  There is another &euro;9.87 billion that is callable, which leaves a total liability of &euro;11.1 billion.  It is no different from the World Bank or the Asian Bank.  Ireland is a member of the World Bank, to which it contributes money.  In circumstances where the World Bank was subject to extraordinary exposure, it would call on all of its constituent member banks to give it more money.  We are not expecting such a situation to emerge, but the system that will apply to the ESM is no different from the one that applies to the two banks mentioned.  That is a fair analogy.</P>
        <P>We will have an opportunity tomorrow to go through other points colleagues want to make and I look forward to dealing with them.  As I stated, there is no magic bullet to solve this problem, but we must incrementally work with our partners to ensure we arrive at a better place.  If I learned anything during the most recent referendum, it was that the people had given us a mandate to continue to negotiate to try to get the country to a better place.  They recognise and will stay with this process as long as we can see light at the end of the tunnel.  Who knows where we will end up.  No one can speak with certainty about what the outcome will be.  Certainly, it is the view of the Government and I suspect of everyone in this House that a much bigger pan-European solution &mdash; it will take some time to work out the details &mdash; is required, but it is in our interests to stay in the game and continue to do what we can to improve our situation by having access to relatively cheap money in circumstances where the country cannot borrow in the international money markets at sustainable levels.  That is our objective in putting this mechanism in place and looking for the support of colleagues for it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be in this House to introduce the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012.  This Bill is but the most recent revision to the European Communities Act 1972.  Each such revision has, in turn, gone a long way to bringing home to the Houses of the Oireachtas and Irish people at large key developments taking place at European Union level.  Successive amendments to the European Communities Act 1972 have served to bring into the domestic law of this State significant instruments which Ireland has freely agreed with our partners in the European Union.  Thus, the Bill before us has good pedigree.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss developments in the European Union in the House.  This is an important means of continuing to communicate Europe to our people, which is something we all need to do more of, not only in advance of referendums.  Clearly, this debate takes place in the wake of last month&rsquo;s referendum.  The Bill was originally published in early May in accordance with our overt commitment to make available, well in advance of the referendum, all legislative proposals which were in any way related to the proposition put to the Irish people on the stability treaty at the end of last month.  The Government made very clear, prior to the referendum, its intention to legislate for the amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to provide this legal underpinning to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  It was with this knowledge that our people voted and resoundingly approved the stability treaty.  The Bill thus forms part of the legislative follow-up to the direct expression of the people&rsquo;s will.</P>
        <P>I welcome and appreciate the decision taken by the Irish people.  I welcome it because I earnestly believe it was the right decision for Ireland and Europe and I appreciate it because I am acutely aware it was not an easy decision for anyone.  The hardships our people continue to endure are real and painful, yet they appreciated that the stability treaty would form an important part of finding a sustainable solution to the crisis.</P>
        <P>Throughout the referendum campaign, the Government consistently stated that the passage of the stability treaty would not be a panacea to all the ills of the euro area.  While that is certainly the case, the treaty is a critical piece of the jigsaw.  Equally critical, in my view and that of the Government, is the need for a growth agenda to complement and balance the stability agenda on which we have been working.  It is the growth agenda to which we will turn in Brussels at the end of this week when I will accompany the Taoiseach to the European Council summit meeting.  We are working to ensure the European Union will adopt a compact for jobs and growth.  The new compact sets out a range of actions to be taken at the level of the member states.  Importantly, it also sets out in a clear and comprehensive manner the contribution European policies can make to growth and employment across the Union.  These will include efforts to get investment flowing to where it is needed, be it through the European Investment Bank, project bonds or the reprogramming of Structural Funds.</P>
        <P>At the same time, concrete steps will be taken to capture the significant additional growth potential in the Single Market, including the digital single market.  Similarly, trade offers us a real engine for growth which can yet be tapped.  At European Union level, we need to make more progress in opening up key international markets to European and Irish goods and services.  This will be one of the priorities of the next Irish Presidency during the first half of 2013.</P>
        <P>I will now turn to the purpose and contents of the Bill.  The European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 is brief and relatively technical in its nature but no less important for that.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the European Communities Act 1972 to do a number of significant things.  It provides that the following shall form part of the domestic law of the State: the protocol amending the protocol on transitional provisions annexed to the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community; the European Council decision amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for member states whose currency is the euro; the treaty concerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union, done at Brussels on the ninth day of December 2011; and the protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, done at Brussels on the 16th day of May 2012.  If the Bill is passed, these four instruments would, upon ratification by Ireland, become a part of the domestic law of the State.</P>
        <P>I will set out briefly what is involved with each of these four instruments.  The first instrument is a protocol to the EU treaties which provides for a temporary increase in the number of MEPs.  This arrangement applies only for the life of the current European Parliament, which runs up until 2014.</P>
        <P>This protocol arose from the fact that elections to the European Parliament of 2009 took place before the Lisbon treaty had entered into force.  Under the Lisbon treaty, 12 member states were to be represented by an additional 18 MEPs.  Given that the Lisbon treaty entered into force on 1 December 2009, EU leaders agreed that these member states should have the benefit of their full complement of MEPs for this session of the Parliament, thus bringing about this protocol.  As I have noted, the effect of this protocol is strictly time bound, and consequently this element of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 is effectively a matter of good housekeeping.</P>
        <P>The second instrument this Bill seeks to include in the domestic law of the State is the European Council decision of 25 March 2011 amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU.  This decision was introduced with a view to providing a legal underpinning to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  The change to Article 136 of the TFEU is separate and distinct from the ESM treaty but the two are evidently related.  Members will note the entry into force of the ESM does not require the prior entry into force of the amendment of Article 136.  This is emphasised by the fact that the target date for the entry into force of the ESM treaty is next month, while the amendment to Article 136 of the TFEU is expected to enter into force in January 2013.  It is the Government&rsquo;s strongly held view that it is entirely in national interest of Ireland to have established an ESM which is as strong and robust as is possible.  The amendment to Article 136 of the TFEU makes a contribution to that end.  For this reason, I believe this change to Article 136 of the TFEU is also in our interests and should be incorporated into our domestic law.</P>
        <P>The third instrument provided for in this Bill is the Croatian accession treaty.  This treaty was signed by EU leaders, including the Taoiseach on behalf of Ireland, as well as by Croatia on 9 December 2011 in the margins of the December European Council meeting.  The enlargement of the European Union is a policy Ireland has consistently supported.  It was among the first countries to benefit from the enlargement of the Union almost 40 years ago.  The Union has served this country very well in the intervening decades and we are happy to see that, even at a time of severe challenge for Europe, the powers of attraction remain undimmed.  I look forward to welcoming Croatia as a member state of the European Union from the middle of next year and to working with the Government and people of Croatia across the wide range of policy areas in which EU member states engage and co-operate with one another.</P>
        <P>The fourth and final instrument covered by the Bill is the Irish legal guarantees protocol.  Members will recall that in June 2009, EU leaders agreed to provide Ireland with a series of legal guarantees on a range of concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon, including on the right to life, family and education, taxation and security and defence.  These legal guarantees were originally agreed in the form of a legally binding decision.  EU leaders also agreed that at the time of the conclusion of the next accession treaty, the provisions of the decision would be set out in a protocol to be attached to the EU treaties.  Consequently, work on the Irish legal guarantees protocol was linked in time to the Croatian accession treaty.  On foot of the signing of the latter last December, work was progressed on Ireland&rsquo;s protocol, which was opened for signature on 16 May.  I am happy to report to the House that all member states have now signed this protocol and will now begin their respective national ratification processes with a view to Ireland&rsquo;s protocol entering into force in the middle of 2013.  This development is a reminder, if any were needed, that the European Union keeps its word and delivers on its undertakings.</P>
        <P>As this Bill was originally published on 8 May and the Irish legal guarantees protocol was only opened for signature on 16 May, the Bill as originally published provided for the first two instruments only, namely, the MEPs protocol and the amendment to Article 136 of the TFEU.  The additional two instruments, that is, the Croatian accession treaty and the Irish legal guarantees protocol, were added to the Bill during its Committee Stage reading by the Select Committee on European Union Affairs.</P>
        <P>Before concluding, I wish to record my appreciation for the manner in which this Bill has been considered thus far by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There has been widespread support for this Bill and its contents from almost all shades of opinion and I look forward to its positive consideration by this House as well.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an T&aacute;naiste and note there is a great deal of history surrounding this legislation, not least the historic moment occasioned by the presence of Her Excellency, the ambassador of Croatia.  As someone who was a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1995 to 2007, approximately, I visited Croatia a number of times.  When Slovenia, in the eyes of the Croatians, went ahead of the game by receiving its accession protocols, it created many internal difficulties within Croatia and a view arose that it had somehow been left out and there was a lessening of enthusiasm for the European ideal for a short time.  However, I am glad that Croatia persisted.  It certainly had a friend in Ireland, going back to the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, who made it clear from the outset that Ireland, as an open trading economy, would welcome an expansion of the European Union and that it would be of mutual interest to both the Irish and Croatian economies.  Whenever they visited here to appear before the joint committee, the Croatians were never slow or reluctant to point out the great similarities between the two countries, especially in respect of their religion and history.  In representing her people, I am sure the ambassador is particularly gratified and pleased she is present today to witness this legislation going through the Upper House of Parliament.  I wish her well and endorse everything the T&aacute;naiste has said.  Moreover, I look forward to continued strong relationships, as well as the pursuit of issues of mutual benefit to our two countries, especially within what is the broad alliance of the European Union.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The legal guarantees to which the T&aacute;naiste referred represent a throwback to recent history, that is, to the Lisbon treaty, and to the second referendum on that treaty in particular.  They are an indication of the Government&rsquo;s struggles to ensure the passage of the second referendum because, as had happened with the first referendum on the Nice treaty, a great number of extraneous issues were debated and discussed to the point at which the people became somewhat agitated that the proposals contained in the treaty somehow were not to the benefit of the broad mass of the people.  The previous Administration is to be commended, and the T&aacute;naiste by extension, on acknowledging these legal guarantees are being included.  Moreover this is acknowledged by the support the legal guarantees have received, and at that time, the Labour Party was fully supportive of and actively involved in ensuring the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty would pass.</P>
        <P>The most central part of the legislation concerns the amendment of the protocols, going back to the European Communities Act, under which Ireland entered back in 1973.  This forms a third element of the historical nature of this legislation.  However, and the T&aacute;naiste has touched on this point, in the background to all this is what will happen next.  The legal architecture is in place but the question remains as to what will happen next.  The T&aacute;naiste might expand a little on references he made to the growth initiative on which he and the Taoiseach have embarked and which will continue at next week&rsquo;s European Council meeting.  As Members are aware, representatives of four leading member states met in Italy.  Angela Merkel and representatives from France, Italy and Spain met in Rome last week, and one figure to emerge from that discussion was a sum of &euro;180 billion that was to be set aside for a growth dimension to the ongoing euro crisis.  The T&aacute;naiste touched on a point that is in the public domain, which is that some of the money is to go towards the provision of a growth initiative would come from unspent Structural Funds from the European Investments Bank.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste should elaborate a little more in this regard.  Does the Government have in place a plan whereby Ireland will seek access to these funds?  I am thinking of large-scale infrastructure projects in Ireland and of metro north in particular, of which I have been supportive from the outset.  This is because it would provide jobs in the construction phase and because, once completed, it would sustain jobs that would benefit the immediate greater Dublin area and the wider economy.  It would be of benefit with regard to access, and benefits would accrue to tourism as a result of having a direct link from the airport to the city centre.  Ireland is alone in Europe in having a capital city lacking such direct access.  Quite frankly, it is disgraceful that we have not.  I know of the arguments being put forward about money not being available, investors&rsquo; money drying up and so on, but I suggest that this is an ideal opportunity to put forward specific infrastructural projects that would generate real jobs in the construction phase and sustainable jobs in the future.  I am also thinking of the money being used for the road maintenance programme across Ireland.  The many unfinished road projects that have been deferred as a result of the economic crisis could also be completed as part of the access to this &euro;180 billion.  I would be grateful if the T&aacute;naiste could outline what plans, if any, the Government has on how to approach the summit and the spending of this money.</P>
        <P>Even the dogs on the street know that we can no longer continue with an austerity-only project; growth must be linked to it.  In fairness to Angela Merkel, she has made that quite clear all along.  I also share her view that we cannot continue to borrow to the stage where we are permanent borrowers.  We must try to pay our way.  If every country within Europe was to adopt an approach whereby there was a reconciliation of bank balances within national economies, then we could move to a much more prosperous period.  This requires strong leadership and I would like to think that Ireland has been used as a guinea pig to some degree over the last two to three years.  Europe muddled its way through the various crises that befell us going back to 2008 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which is now accepted by all as the beginning of the current recession.  Mr. Barroso lost the cool to some extent when he attended the G20 summit in Mexico last week, because he was quite rightly resentful of the view taken by the Americans that Europe should be getting its house in order.  He pointed out to them the historical reality that Lehman Brothers was an American bank and that the toxic contagion which emerged as a result of poor regulation in the American banking sector extended into Europe and has given us the current recession.  That is what we are trying to cope with.</P>
        <P>It seems unfair to me that money was given to recapitalise Spanish banks that will not impact on Spain&rsquo;s national debt, yet we in Ireland have had to take the burden of bank debt which nobody asked for and nobody wanted, and which forms part of what we have to pay back.  What credence would the T&aacute;naiste give to extending the loan well into the future?  There is no question we will have to pay back the money, but what credence would he give to us extending the loan and to fighting that particular cause in Europe?  After all, the Germans only completed their reparations payments two years ago for the First World War.  What goes against the notion of Ireland extending its loan over 20, 30 or 40 years?  It would lessen the immediate impact on any government having to come up with continuing austerity measures and budgetary reductions that will ultimately affect those who can least afford it, namely, the lower paid and those who are the most vulnerable in society.  This has already been indicated in the public pronouncements from some of his own Ministers in the last few days.  I would be grateful for the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s observations on these points.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in welcoming the T&aacute;naiste.  I also welcome the Croatian ambassador and I wish her and her people well in future.  In voting for the stability treaty in the recent referendum, Irish people made a significant decision to remain at the heart of Europe, and gave the Government a mandate to work with other EU governments to resolve the many problems that are impacting on the lives of so many of our people.  Senator Mooney already spoke about that.  Our experience has been very positive since our accession back in the early 1970s.  We had much debate in the course of the referendum on the stability of the euro, on the availability of funding in the future, on a growth agenda to tackle unemployment and particularly youth unemployment, and the need for more international investment.</P>
        <P>This week the Oireachtas will enact some Bills that will underpin the decision of the Irish people.  One such Bill is the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012, which we are discussing this afternoon.  As the T&aacute;naiste indicated, the European Communities Act 1972 needs to be amended to provide for four separate developments at EU level, in order to ensure that these four instruments shall form part of the domestic law of the State.  These four elements are the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, underpinning the legal standing of the ESM, a protocol on the adjustment of the number of MEPs, Croatian accession and the legal guarantees that were given to the Irish people in the Lisbon treaty.  Each of these elements is different from the others and each stands on its own.  While these elements are separate, it makes good sense and good use of Oireachtas time to deal with all four as a package.</P>
        <P>The amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union will underpin the legal standing of the ESM.  Having a functioning ESM is strongly in the interests of Ireland and the eurozone.  This is not because we want to draw from it, but if in the event of Ireland requiring a second bailout, it certainly is an excellent insurance policy.  There was much debate on this during the course of the recent referendum.  The very existence of the ESM lessens the chances of another member state having to draw on it in the future.  The ESM is also part of the eurozone&rsquo;s firewall against contagion.  The agreed aim of the eurozone governments is to have the ESM in place in July.  The ESM and the instrument to amend Article 136 are both separate and contain their own requirements for entry into force.  The amendment to Article 136 will come into force when ratified by all member states of the EU.   As the T&aacute;naiste said, the target date is 1 January 2013.  It is very much in Ireland&rsquo;s best interests for both changes to come into force as soon as possible, as it is desirable to deal with both instruments in parallel from a policy and efficiency point of view.  Not ratifying Article 136 will not prevent the ESM coming into force once the necessary conditions are met.</P>
        <P>The protocol on the number of MEPs is a technical, housekeeping matter.  The last European elections took place in June 2009, when the Nice treaty was still in force.  In line with the Nice treaty, 736 Members of the European Parliament were elected and are now in office.  However, the Lisbon treaty entered into force on 1 December 2009, allowing 751 seats in the Parliament.  The treaty gives 18 additional seats to 12 member states, while Germany loses three due to the new thresholds in the treaty.  Spain will get four extra seats, Austria, France and Sweden will get two extra seats, while Bulgaria, Italy, Latvia, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia and the UK will get one extra seat each.</P>
        <P>Croatia is due to accede to the EU on 1 July 2013 provided all the instruments of ratification have been deposited before that date.  The accession treaty was signed on 9 December 2011 in Brussels, and the Taoiseach signed on our behalf.  Croatia currently holds active observer status and is represented on all Council bodies, including the European Council.  Following the situation that developed in Greece, there probably are concerns when a new member state joins the EU.  Some safeguards have been put in place and the T&aacute;naiste might like to comment on some of them.  I understand that there is a general economic safeguard clause, an internal market safeguard clause and a specific justice and home affairs safeguard clause.  There are other issues that are likely to arise in respect of Croatia that might cause some concern, such as judicial transparency, corruption, minority interests, refugee return issues and full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am pleased the T&aacute;naiste has confirmed that all 27 members states have signed the protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon.  Europe is delivering to the Irish people.  In 2009, Ireland was given legally binding assurances on areas of importance, such as tax, neutrality and family matters.  While these guarantees have legal effect already, it was agreed they should be attached to the EU treaties as a protocol at the time of the next accession treaty.  The protocol confirms that nothing in the Lisbon treaty, giving legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union or dealing with justice and home affair matters, affects in any way the scope and applicability of the protection of the right to life, the family and education provided by the Constitution of Ireland.  The protocol confirms that nothing in the Lisbon treaty makes any change of any kind for any member state on taxation.  This is obviously of vital national interest to Ireland, especially our corporation tax level of 12.5%.  Investment by multinational companies is critical for our economic recovery, and our tax rate is one of our competitive advantages.  The protocol also mentions that the Lisbon treaty does not affect Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of neutrality.  It confirms there will be no conscription or European army.  We all remember the scaremongering about conscription, the loss of our neutrality and the establishment of a European army during debates on the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>The European Communities (Amendment) Bill, as the T&aacute;naiste has said, is significant legislation.  It is another piece in the jigsaw of our efforts to bring stability and cohesion to the European Union.  I take pleasure in supporting it and I commend the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on his excellent work in the Department.  My party will be happy to support this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the Chamber.  This is yet another historic day when Her Majesty, the Queen of England is visiting County Fermanagh, another part of our island.  That is a tribute, as I said during our last discussion on foreign affairs, to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his Department.  It was not that long ago that officials had to live under dangerous conditions in Maryfield, Belfast and now we have better relations between Ireland and the UK and between North and South than ever before.  I note the T&aacute;naiste got Mr. Peter Robinson to give the Edward Carson lecture in his Department.  I think we will welcome members of the Orange Order to the Seanad next week.  That is an area of our foreign policy where matters are in superb hands.  Our relationship with the United States has never been better and that is also a tribute to the T&aacute;naiste and his officials.</P>
        <P>I will now deal with the part of our foreign policy in which we are experiencing difficulties.  I support this legislative measure but there are difficulties.  The creation of a single currency, the euro, was a leap in the dark and nobody ever though we would end up with 50% youth unemployment in both Spain and Greece and 25% unemployment overall in those two countries, and that the adjustment mechanism for Ireland would increase our rate of unemployment from 4% to 14.5%.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste on addressing these issues because public faith and belief, perhaps naive in the past, in the omniscience and omnipotence of the EU institutions has been seriously weakened.  We need reforms, not least in the design flaws of the currency and the problems to which this has led to for all.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is reassuring that the ambassador for Croatia is here and her country wants to join the EU.  That shows there is a future.  There are eight other countries which joined the EU but have not yet adopted the euro.  The caution would be to stay with their own currencies until we sort out these design problems in the currency because it has had a consequence for all of us that we never planned for and did not foresee.  I do not draw fault on that, as I did not see the faults either.  Obviously we need a banking regulation system to stop tsunamis of credit coming into small countries, as happened in Ireland, and destroying the banking system and those states being stuck with that debt.  Reforms must proceed to try to make Europe work.  It did work for a very long period &mdash; five decades &mdash; as a free trade area.  Perhaps the currency has been one step too far, particularly the concerns in German public opinion that the single currency is not working from their point of view.</P>
        <P>In considering some of the points made by the T&aacute;naiste in his speech, I wonder if at the beginning a bicameral European Parliament would have been a good idea.  I think the former Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, has asked if there should be an European Senate in which each of the member countries would have representation.  There is a feeling in Ireland of being overwhelmed by the large countries.  That was not what the founders of the European Union intended, as the T&aacute;naiste knows, but it seems that Germany and France have taken a very strong role and the Union has lost sight of the opinions of the smaller countries such as Ireland and, perhaps, Croatia.  It is probably too late at this stage to propose a different structure for the European Parliament which would incorporate a structure similar to the United States, with a Senate with equal representation from the member states and a structure based more broadly on a population basis which would take the place of the current European Parliament.  I support the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s adjustment concerning the Parliament.  I support also his point on the Lisbon agenda, the Treaty of Lisbon and the other measures in the Bill.  I think he will find that it has support throughout the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where do we go at this stage?  I think the debt mountain must be addressed.  We have spoken about it at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  The difficulty with Keynesian economics in the current situation is that there is an inheritance of debt because property prices rose so rapidly.  The debts of government and the debts of households have to be considered.  It is not a traditional Keynesian economics starting point, where one is trying to solve a recession and there is capacity to do that.  We have a financial system with personal and government finances in fairly dire straits.  Thought must be given, and I know the T&aacute;naiste has expressed his concerns in the referendum, to the kind of growth agenda we require, and much more in-depth economic analysis has to take place in determining it.</P>
        <P>There was a lot of kick and hope elements about making Europe the most advanced technological economy in the world.  We spent a great deal of money and it is very difficult to see the return on it.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, is working on that but we did engage in substantial outlays.  I served on the Culliton committee in the 1990s and we were concerned at the time that, in many places, instead of growth promotion as one would wish, there was the so-called free money from Brussels syndrome, where that money was taken and wasted on projects.  As the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, pointed out previously, about one quarter or so of our debt is due to the banking situation but the remainder is due to projects that accumulated debt mountains and did not increase the GDP afterwards, hence the debt to GDP ratio increases.  Were we unduly generous with Structural Funds towards the construction industry, which accounted subsequently for so much of our difficulties?</P>
        <P>I would tend to disagree with my colleague, Senator Mooney, on metro north.  I would want to see the studies on projects like that to see if they are worthwhile.  There is no point in saying again that it is free money from Brussels and let us go ahead with the project.  It has to yield a constant stream of benefits that more than cover the cost of carrying it out, even if one gets assistance from friends.  One of the bodies that was criticised for its spending of the free money from Brussels was F&Aacute;S, where we spent &euro;1 billion a year in an economy with full employment.  What were the actual results of that spending?  There were two kinds of money, one from Brussels and the other that was raised from the domestic taxpayers, and there were no proper standards of expenditure appraisal or cost-benefit analysis.  It was a kind of misguidedKeynesianism.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste has our support for his efforts to build a growth agenda, but we must do better than previously because our previous efforts have contributed to the position in which we now find ourselves.  The European Union needs reform, but it will be difficult.  Given the presence of people from Croatia, it is important to indicate to the T&aacute;naiste the support of the House for measures to reform the European Union because it has not been at its best for the past four or five years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins"><NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Croatian ambassador to Ireland.  I wish her, her government and country the best of luck on the road to accession to the European Union that will happen next year.  I also welcome the T&aacute;naiste and thank him for his detailed and informative contribution.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to lead in the Second Stage debate on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 on behalf of the Labour Party group in the Seanad.  It is always welcome in this Chamber to discuss and debate European Union matters as it allows for our full engagement on the issues which, by virtue of our membership of the Union, are of paramount significance to Ireland.  It is always of critical importance that this Chamber, in particular, spends time discussing EU matters and it would be of great assistance if we had a enlarged role in this regard.  I fully expect that this evening and tomorrow we will have a varied and diverse debate on the matters involved.</P>
        <P>The debate is taking place in part as a consequence of the unequivocal acceptance by the people of the stability treaty on 31 May.  On foot of that result the European Communities (Amendment) Bill is the necessary legislative facility to allow for an amendment to the domestic law of the State to reflect the decision taken by the people.  Throughout the month of May all parties of different creed and views engaged in an energetic and lively debate on the provisions of the treaty and their purported application to this country.  I am delighted that the citizens of Ireland, in particular in my constituency and the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s former constituency of Galway East, responded in such a clear and unambiguous manner in carrying the referendum.  A clear message was sent that they saw the treaty as part of the solution in addressing the economic and financial imbalances that have afflicted Europe for several years.</P>
        <P>It always has been and remains part of my party&rsquo;s argument that it is essential the overwhelming result in the passing of the treaty by the people be accompanied by a growth agenda.  As the only member country that put the treaty to the people, we must be rewarded with a real plan to achieve economic growth, create jobs and secure a reduction on our bank debt.  We must give voters something to be confident about and nothing enhances confidence more than movement on the three issues mentioned.  I am glad that the Government has shown a strong commitment to date that it will work hard to gain support for these ideals among European leaders.</P>
        <P>In amending the European Communities Act 1972 the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 provides a means of incorporating a number of measures at European Union level into the domestic law of the State.  One of the main purposes of the Bill is to provide for legal underpinning of the European Stability Mechanism for all member states the currency of which is the euro.  The ESM will open for business on 9 July, which is why the Bill was published on 8 May with the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012.  The Government wanted citizens to be fully aware of the facts pertaining to the stability treaty before they voted in the referendum on 31 May.  It believes, without hesitation, that membership of and access to the ESM are in the economic and fiscal interests of the country.  The ESM is an insurance policy for the nation such that should we ever again find ourselves in economic turbulent times we will have access to moneys in the fund at favourable interest rates.  I say this as a caveat: it is not expected that we will need it, but it is important that we have access to it should we so require it.  While we have passed through financially unstable times, the Government can be particularly proud of its role in making Ireland a financially stable location in which to do business.  The claim that it is now fiscally stable will be further bolstered by our membership of the ESM that will act as our financial safeguard.</P>
        <P>While the primary function of the Bill is to establish the European Stability Mechanism to assist such member states which may find themselves in financial, fiscal and economic difficulty, it will also facilitate the enlargement of representation within the Union in order that a further 18 Members of the European Parliament may be appointed or elected.  This is necessary as a consequence of an ever enlarging Union and an essential democratic mechanism.</P>
        <P>The Bill will ultimately provide for the protocol to meet the concerns of the people about the Lisbon treaty that was signed in Brussels on 16 May to form part of the domestic law of the State.  The protocol recognises and acknowledges the concerns expressed by the people about the treaty with regard to the right to life, family, education, taxation and security and defence matters.  My understanding is that it will confirm but not alter the content or the application of the treaty.  It is a welcome step to finalise the treaty and legally secure the guarantees the Government of the time obtained on the issues mentioned.  I particularly welcome this amendment as a further building block in our relationship with the European Union.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill provides for the accession of Croatia as the 28th member of the European Union and gives us the power to proceed to ratify its membership.  Croatia&rsquo;s accession process is not yet complete, but passage of the Bill will go some way towards bolstering its position within the Union.  It will be required to satisfy the European Commission on a number of grounds such as reform and the introduction of new laws before it will be fully ratified as a member in July 2013.  While there are outstanding issues, its membership plans remain on track and I commend the country and its government for their resilience in this regard.  With Ireland holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013, I look forward to it playing a prominent role in smoothening the road to accession for Croatia.  It is heartening that despite the problems with economic contagion in recent times, this has not acted as a deterrent to new countries in seeking accession to the Union.  Membership of it clearly remains an attractive prospect, as there are many benefits to membership.  There is freedom for member states to access the open markets of most of the world&rsquo;s economies.  It facilitates the free movement of people and investment across the 27 member states.  More importantly, it asserts important human rights principles and democratic processes.  Unfortunately, in recent times such founding principles of the Union have been jettisoned in favour of economic correction, but I look forward, when the economic balance has been redressed, to reverting to the qualities, ideals and beliefs that brought the founding countries together many years ago to embark on the project of integration.  I look forward to further consideration of the Bill on Committee and Remaining Stages tomorrow and commend it to the House.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Teach chun an Bille t&aacute;bhachtach seo, Bille na gComhphobal Eorpach (Leas&uacute;) 2012 a phl&eacute;.  The Bill has four component parts and I shall deal briefly with each of the instruments mentioned.  The first, as the T&aacute;naiste pointed out, deals with the increase in the number of MEPs from 736, I think, to 751.  I do not welcome such a move because the European Parliament is far too large, but it was interesting to hear my colleague&rsquo;s comments on introducing a bicameral system.  Any House with that number of Members will tend to find it difficult to be effective and operate efficiently.  I know from talking to Members who serve there that the restrictions on contributions prohibit the Parliament from achieving its potential.  Given what is happening economically with the ESM and that we are moving towards greater fiscal and political integration, it is essential that we have strong, robust and democratic structures to cope with increased responsibilities.  I know, however, that states have a tendency not to devolve such powers to elected institutions.  The ambit of the political structures in the European Union must be placed under the microscope urgently as we move towards greater economic integration, assuming this country or the European Union does not implode in the meantime.  </P>
        <P>The second instrument deals with the ESM.  An amendment has been tabled to Article 136 to provide for legal underpinning of the European Stability Mechanism that will only apply to 17 of the 27 countries.  Is this the first time we have seen such fragmentation of the European Union?  It is a significant issue for us and must have implications and ramifications for the operation of the Single Market.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste has pointed out that the result of the referendum was the right one, but it is not a panacea.  I agree with him.  It was probably a move in the right direction, although I have some reservations about the structure of the ESM and its capacity to deal with the crisis.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste might comment on this.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the need for a growth agenda.  While we would all subscribe to that, the policies being pursued by the Government are very pro-cyclical and the policies that contributed to exaggerating the difficulties were also pro-cyclical.  There were tax incentives at a time when we should have been dampening down the economy, especially the property bubble.  With the advent of the universal social charge, the increase in value added tax in the last budget, the property tax and water charges, more money is being taken from hard-pressed householders, which has the effect of dampening down the economy and either stagnating us or putting us into recession.  That is the single biggest bar on creating growth.  Internationally we do not have any control.  Our exports will depend on the international markets but we have some control over trying to generate and stimulate the domestic market.  That is a difficult task but it can be done by creating the climate rather than taking money from the pension pots.</P>
        <P>With regard to the European Stability Mechanism, we have made a commitment of &euro;11 billion for the &euro;700 billion that has been agreed as part of the ESM fund.  Many economists argue that it should be three times that amount.  Certainly, if Spain and, subsequently, Italy are to be funded from that scheme, it will have to be multiples of what it is at present.  While our capacity to meet that is impossible, how many other countries will find it difficult?  There are serious question marks about it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the accession of Croatia to the EU, which will take place next year.  Croatia is a beautiful country.  Its recent history has been sad because of the Balkans war.  I have some affinity with it in that all my family, together and independently, have had holidays there and my daughter got married there in the past two years.  That whole coastline on the Adriatic is very nice.  I wish them well and expect it will be a valued member of the European Union.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the legal guarantees secured by the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, on the right to life, family and education, and taxation issues, those, as the T&aacute;naiste rightly said, were guarantees on the basis of a range of concerns that led to the first defeat of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  My earnest appeal to the T&aacute;naiste is that the Government would give the same priority to the protection of those concerns as we go forward.  I am concerned as to whether he will do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House and thank him for giving leadership in the referendum treaty and making a major contribution to ensure the right decision was taken.  It was a very positive decision from an Irish point of view and copperfastens our commitment to involvement in Europe by leading the way in terms of the European agenda.</P>
        <P>Speaking in Cork last week, Bill Clinton remarked that Ireland is the only EU country that has a younger population than the US.  That is an interesting point.  It is clear from the growth in the birth rate in the past ten years that the number of births per annum has increased from 55,000 to 75,000.  As there are major challenges ahead, the importance of the growth agenda is very important.  Senator Paschal Mooney referred to the need to take on major infrastructural projects to create jobs in the short term.  There is a need also to do much more in the long term, particularly in the area of research and development.  The EU is very much about working together in this area.  Are we doing enough in this area?  I said previously that 75% of those involved in research and development are from outside the EU and want to progress and end up working in the US.  That is the reality.  We need to give leadership in this area.  In areas such as health care, there is little real co-operation in respect of the sharing of services across Europe, whereas in the US and China there is much more co-operation within those areas.  That is an area we need to grow and develop.  We can play a major role in giving that leadership.</P>
        <P>When I was a Member of the European Parliament from 2007 to 2009, cross-border health care was agreed.  This was an agreement whereby members of one member state could travel to another member state for health care purposes if it was not available in their own member state, provided it was part of the policy of their own member state.  I understand that agreement will be transposed into Irish law in the near future.  A great deal more could be done in respect of the sharing of information and services within the EU.</P>
        <P>If we are talking about a growth agenda, we must give leadership not only in the area of job creation, we must begin also to look at the long term.  That is where research and development can play a major role.  While we are doing a good deal, there is a need for much more co-operation and long-term development in the EU.</P>
        <P>As a country, we can be the net beneficiary because we have a young population.  Even though we have a good education system, one of those involved in &ldquo;Dragons&rsquo; Den&rdquo; has said there are many jobs here for which we do not have the people with the necessary qualifications to take them up.  People with those qualifications are available from outside Ireland and the EU.  We need to examine that area which would create the spin-off jobs if those people are working.  In the financial services area in Dublin, it has been stated that there are of the order of 1,600 vacancies for which the relevant personnel are not available in Ireland to fill them.  That is an issue that needs to be examined.  We need to focus not just on short term but on long-term job creation and be part of the agenda in the EU for next 12 months in planning for the next five, ten or 15 years.</P>
        <P>I again thank the T&aacute;naiste for bringing forward the Bill which has the full support of the House.  It is just another part of the jigsaw in our involvement in the EU.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House.  I do not envy him his role in government.  It is an especially difficult time for anybody in government and must be very wearying.  I am, by nature, a contrarian.  I remember P.G. Wodehouse describing himself as a performing flea of English literature.  I suppose I fulfil the role of a gadfly in Irish politics.</P>
        <P>I will not repeat everything I said this afternoon on the European Stability Mechanism.  Following on from what previous speakers have said, I wish there was a population stabilising mechanism.  I do not gloat in the fact that there is an increase in the Irish population.  I have spoken about world population, and I include Ireland in that.  Every single person born here does about 100 times more damage than a person in India.  I am not thrilled by it and it creates problems and stores them up for later.  I would like to see stabilisation.</P>
        <P>I do not believe in growth.  Growth is a load of rubbish.  I am delighted the T&aacute;naiste has a smile because I intend to cheer him up further, as a good socialist, by saying that what we are witnessing is the death of capitalism.  It cannot come quickly enough as far as I am concerned.  The reason is simple.  It is predicated on the complete contradiction of infinitely expanding markets on a planet that is demonstrating its finite nature day by day.  Therefore, fiddling around does not do an awful lot of good.  Trying to preserve the system at the expense of people is a waste of time and grossly immoral.  I am ashamed of the way Greece was treated and in which Germany dictated that democracy should be extinguished there.  Although I know it is controversial to say this, it has wrecked Europe twice already and is going to do so again.  The disease of angelosing merkelitis is spreading.  It is the equivalent of ankylosing spondylitis in the human frame.  It creates a curvature of the spine in order that everyone becomes supine in the face of circumstances.  That is what is occurring and it is appalling.</P>
        <P>Let us look at the German example and, forgetting about the wars it started, how the whole thing was created.  Look at Bismarck and Germany.  A nebula of small dukedoms and princedoms started the Zollverein, just as we are doing.  That released centripetal and centrifugal forces that led, inevitably and inexorably, towards one of two conclusions &mdash; fiscal unity and an empire or an explosion.  The same force has been released in much greater form within the European Union and will lead in the same direction.  The conclusion will be an explosion.</P>
        <P>I see and hear, on television and the streets of Dublin, of people suffering.  It is disgraceful, in 21st century Europe, that people should be starving and living in boxes off Syntagma Square.  None of us can feel proud of this.</P>
        <P>Like me, the Minister is a forthright man.  He said he was open about the Government&rsquo;s intention to legislate for the amendment to provide for legal underpinning of the decision of the people in the referendum.  That is true up to a point.  He said it was with this knowledge that the people had voted and resoundingly approved the stability treaty.  Come on.  He told the people he would give them a black eye if they did not vote in favour of the amendment.  They were terrified.  On every radio programme people were saying they did not want to vote in favour of the amendment, but they were frightened not to.  They were frightened into it.</P>
        <P>I was working hard in my office because I am not one of those one-and-a-half day Senators about whom some have spoken and listening to my colleague, Senator Se&aacute;n Barrett, who said there was room for more democracy and, perhaps, a European Senate.  A little accountability would be good.  It is what we have here.  Yesterday there was a meeting of international scholars who were smuggled into this House like a Trojan horse.  It was feared they would up-end us.  At the end of their session 90% of these international scholars said this place should be retained, while 10% abstained.  Not one single person supported the abolition of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>We are looking at a two-speed European Union.  This Bill will implement it.  The European Union is becoming less and less democratic.  The mechanism can be triggered, not by 17 member states or even by 12, but by eight &mdash; Germany, France and the other large economies.  One third of the eurozone countries or one quarter of the member states of the Union can dictate this, which is dangerous.  Tomorrow when we consider the ESM, we must look at what we are walking ourselves into.  The ESM will be inviolable and immune from examination by audit bodies, the police, the Legislature and the Judiciary.  How can it possibly be democratic?  I do not understand it.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister is pleased that we will be seeing the death of capitalism.  Perhaps we can build something a little more human.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I have discussed this with the ambassador.  As I said, I welcome the accession of Croatia.  Even Mr. Haughey did not claim a foot in it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill.  Until Senator David Norris spoke, there was a deafening consensus of support for it.  Even he gave it qualified support.  He certainly supported the accession of Croatia.</P>
        <P>There are many aspects to the Bill and the amendments to be made to EU treaties.  The focus has been on the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, which generated considerable debate during the referendum on the stability treaty.  Like others who canvassed door-to-door in Dublin and colleagues who canvassed all over Ireland, I am aware of the heated and intense debate that took place, a large part of which concerned access to the ESM, which was a core issue.</P>
        <P>I take issue with Senator David Norris&rsquo;s assertion that the people voted for the stability treaty out of fear.  There was also hope that we would find our way out of the economic crisis in the country and the eurozone.  There was hope the stability treaty would form not a panacea but a piece of the jigsaw puzzle in resolving the economic difficulties.  I encountered much hopefulness among those voting in favour of it.  There was hope we would not need access to the ESM, a pragmatic recognition that it was in our interests to ensure it would be available as a safety net should we need it and an understanding the Government was working hard to ensure we would not.  All of these attitudes were evident in the debate.</P>
        <P>The debate on the Bill is more muted.  We have had the big debate on the stability treaty and the ESM.  We are all glad to see the emphasis being placed on the growth agenda, to which the T&aacute;naiste referred.  The socialist victory in France has brought it much more to the fore than when we first debated the treaty in isolation.  We all want to see a growth package alongside the stability treaty.</P>
        <P>Others have spoken about these aspects of the treaty.  I also want to refer to the part of it that will have the most impact on Ireland.  I had somewhat mixed feelings about the protocol to meet the concerns of the people following the Lisbon treaty referendum and the legal guarantees contained in it.  I did not believe much of the anti-Lisbon treaty rhetoric about the threat it posed in terms of our children being conscripted into a European army, for example.  There was a sticker on a lamp-post near my home, &ldquo;Vote &lsquo;No&rsquo; or your children will be taken into a European army&rdquo;.  The rhetoric used was very misleading.  I considered that some of the legal guarantees were unnecessary.  The protocol was, essentially, a tidying-up exercise.  I am glad to see the taxation element of the protocol, as there did seem, at certain points, to be more of a threat.  Therefore, the people will be reassured to see this aspect.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, the fact that the protocol is being inserted in the treaties shows that the European Union has fulfilled a promise made at the time and that commitments given are being met.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill, the happiest part of which is the forthcoming accession of Croatia.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim c&eacute;ad f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus fearaim f&aacute;ilte roimh an T&aacute;naiste, a bh&iacute; anseo roimhe.  Is bre&aacute; an rud an T&aacute;naiste a fheice&aacute;il sa Teach. T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go gcuirfidh s&eacute; focal i gcluais an Taoisigh agus an bealach anall chomh fada leis an Teach a thaispe&aacute;int d&oacute;.  T&aacute;imid ag s&uacute;il len &eacute; a fheice&aacute;il.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte, chomh maith, roimh a Soilse, Ambasad&oacute;ir na Cr&oacute;ite.  I apologise in advance for my terrible Croatian: dobro do?li, Ambassador Ognjanovac.  It is very good to see you here.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the accession of Croatia to the European Union, with a word of caution that we should be careful what we wish for.  Many of the promises we were given were not fulfilled.  However, that is the subject of another day&rsquo;s debate.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in, although not happy with the way the Government has gone about bringing forward this legislation, will support it because it supports some elements of it.  Lumping together measures aimed at the facilitation of a financial mechanism, the accession of Croatia, a change in the number of MEPS and the approval of the Irish protocols in the Lisbon treaty is bad practice, as it does not allow each aspect to be considered and voted on separately.  Nevertheless, as Sinn F&eacute;in does support each aspect we can therefore support the Bill.  On the most important element of the change in Article 136 to allow for the creation of a stability mechanism, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the amendment as we agree with the concept of a mechanism which countries in need can access.  We are, however, opposed to the ESM in its current form and will vote against the ESM Bill.  We have already placed on record our reasons for not supporting the ESM and explained what our preferred way of doing things would be.</P>
        <P>We have no objection to ratifying the membership of Croatia.  The Croatian people have voted to join the EU and we respect their decision.  They meet the criteria as laid out in law and we welcome them into the Union.  I take this opportunity to put on record Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view that Croatian workers should not be discriminated against in the EU and should be allowed to go where they wish as other EU citizens do.</P>
        <P>After the first rejection of the Lisbon treaty, Sinn F&eacute;in warned that vague promises or protocols would be added to help the Lisbon treaty to pass on the second attempt.  We were right and it is those protocols that we are now accepting.  They are largely meaningless and do not change anything in EU law or the law of this State.  For that reason we do not oppose them.  The change to the number of MEPs has been agreed and is a technical issue to which we do not object.  It is our hope that by ratifying this Bill the EU is empowering itself to construct a genuine instrument of solidarity that can provide stability for the euro in the medium term.  Unfortunately, that does not seem to be on the cards at the moment.  Our support is based on the hope that the tide which is turning against austerity will reach the shore, and that changes to or a replacement for the flawed ESM can be facilitated through the support of the Oireachtas today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of my outstanding memories of the Lisbon treaty was the posters that said &ldquo;Vote Yes For Jobs&rdquo;.  I wonder where all those jobs have gone that we were promised during the Lisbon treaty.  I was lucky to be in Lisbon a week and a half ago.  It is a beautiful city which has two sides to it at the moment.  It has a beautiful side with much history, fantastic architecture, great buildings and wonderful people.  However, there is also a very poor side.  I was taken aback by the amount of people sleeping on the streets.  I call it sleeping on the streets as opposed to sleeping rough because there were obviously many people who were well educated who were finding life difficult and had no other option but to sleep on the street.  I was there at the invitation of the GUE-NGL grouping in the European Parliament to speak at a rally.  It was an interesting occasion with MEPs from France, Germany, Portugal, Ireland and representatives from our sister parties in Greece.  The story being told was of the effect of austerity in all of those countries, how it is affecting people on a human level and how the austerity programme that has been introduced is not helping people.  We might find that we are the best children in the class when it comes to following the rules but the human cost of austerity in this State is one we should not pay in order for European banks to get away scot free from piling their debts onto the citizens of this State.</P>
        <P>The visit was also important in that there was a huge rally in Lisbon on the Saturday organised by the trade unions.  It was very different to the type of rallies we have in this country.  No political speeches were allowed.  That might be something on which we should legislate in this country.  I am sure people would welcome that measure if it were introduced in a referendum.  There were 30,000 people at the rally from all the various unions making their protest against the cuts that have been introduced.  It is important to keep that in mind.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, is very welcome.  It is nice to see him in the House.  I especially welcome him as a former Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs.  It is interesting that we are debating the European Communities (Amendment) Bill.  We in this House live through history.  We have seen a lot happen in a few years.  Since I came to the House we have had the Lisbon treaty and now this Bill, which examines legal concerns.  That is important.  We previously discussed the ESM treaty and the Bill, which was critical to the passing of the recent treaty.  I wished to mention both of those treaties.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to welcome Ambassador Jasna Ognjanovac, and her official, Wanda, from Croatia.  Both are regular visitors to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  I have come to know both of them very well and I am delighted to see them present.</P>
        <P>I compliment and commend Croatia on its courage.  While many of us question whether it is safe to be in the euro, ask what we are part of, and display a general nervousness about Europe, it is a country that has moved forward unrelentingly.  Croatia has said without a shadow of doubt that it wants to be part of the European Union and the euro.  Croatia is displaying a great deal of courage.  For that reason I invited the Croatian ambassador to Oranmore recently to address us on the treaty.  I wanted the Irish people to get that angle as well.  Unfortunately, she was not able to take up the offer at the time but it does not mean there will not be another opportunity.  It is good to know that there is much hope in existence also.  We have been living in fear and with great uncertainty because of what happened to our country and the way everything toppled so quickly but those countries that were not immediately affected by that look on Europe, the European project and the euro with different eyes.  I congratulate Croatia and wish it well.  I will celebrate with it on 1 July.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On people&rsquo;s legal concerns about the Lisbon treaty which also forms part of the Bill, we discussed the matter in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in the Minister of State&rsquo;s presence.  I am happy with a number of elements in the treaty, in particular the breathing space it gave this country to discuss legislation and directives coming from Europe which is 75% of our legislation.  However, as I set out previously, I am not happy with the amount of time given to scrutiny of legislation and directives coming from Europe.  A proposal was made by Senator Colm Burke that this House would be used to scrutinise legislation.  He suggested that one day or afternoon per week would be devoted to that purpose.  I urge the Minister of State to seriously consider the merit of such a step.  I observe how unhappy Irish people are with the number of directives that are not adequately teased out.  I refer in particular to the over-regulation of small business.  In the past we have been overly zealous in our implementation of European directives and legislation without adequate discussion.  That must stop.  It is wrong and unfair.  In Spain the regulation of food preparation and presentation is different.  It might not all be good but there must be uniformity.  If we are members of a union we must buy into certain rules.  We cannot just agree with everything without having adequate discussion.</P>
        <P>As we pass the Bill the main issue we must discuss this evening is where we go from here with the European project.  We need a long-term plan for Europe.  The piecemeal approach must stop.  We must put our best foot forward.  We have been looking around us in Europe at the big players such as France and Germany.  The inspiration is not coming from there.  Mr. Hollande spoke about the jobs and growth agenda, which I support, but inspiration can come from the smallest member.  Ireland has an ace card in its hand come 1 January when we take up the European Presidency.  We must talk about a long-term plan to save the European project and to save the euro, which is our currency.  That is the case even for those who had the greatest fear of it.  The Greeks have now voted for the euro.  As well as needing a long-term economic plan we need a long-term political plan and a vision for Europe.  We cede much power to Chancellor Merkel because Germany makes up one third of the eurozone.  I am now of the view that that is a mistake.  That inspiration can come from anywhere, not least from Ireland.  I would like the Minister of State in his reply to give his view on how much Ireland&rsquo;s voice is being heard in Europe.  How much leadership are we able to give?  Does he think we have a significant role to play in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I support this Bill, which contains a number of different provisions.  I would like to add my voice to those who have welcomed our Croatian friends, and I welcome them in advance to the European Union.</P>
        <P>I was one of the people who took part in the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs which discussed Ireland&rsquo;s future in Europe.  I was asked to join the committee after the first Lisbon referendum by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  It is true that during debates about the various European treaties there has been a degree of bogus argumentation on all sides.  I agree with what has been said about arguments about conscription and so on.  I think it was Senator Bacik who referred to that.  However, I do not think we should rewrite history.  There has been legitimate concern over the years about competence creep within the European Union, whereby the EU, having powers and competence in one area of national life &mdash; such powers having been given to it by virtue of treaties agreed between the member states &mdash; makes decisions that encroach on other areas in which it has no competence.</P>
        <P>There can be interconnection between areas of competence and areas of non-competence.  There were real concerns about the legal content and status of the Treaty of Lisbon that rightly led people, including myself, to seek guarantees that there would not be any inappropriate encroachment on the operation of Ireland&rsquo;s constitutional provisions with regard to education and the family.  It is worth recalling that in Europe, abortion was at one point defined as a service.  Particular credit is due to those who negotiated the original protocol to the Maastricht treaty, not deciding the merits of that particularly difficult and sensitive issue one way or the other but ensuring it would be the Irish people who would decide.  That notion of subsidiarity should always be at the heart of the European Union.  What was done originally in securing that protocol was a patriotic thing indeed, because it secured, in that most sensitive area, the right of the Irish people to determine the matter.  There is nothing worse than unexpected court decisions unaccountably reshaping laws over the heads of people.  That can happen, and that was why the protocol was sought.</P>
        <P>For the same reason, people had concerns that in certain areas unexpected decisions might be more likely to arise under the Lisbon arrangements, particularly with the appending of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that might encroach on the operation of the Irish constitutional provisions.  It was entirely appropriate that guarantees were sought in those areas.</P>
        <P>With regard to the stability mechanism, it seems to me that it is a no-brainer.  This is something we must have, and we must facilitate it by amendment of Article 136 of the treaty.  One of the great regrets I have about the European project at the moment is that it is harder than ever to love Europe now.  In the same way that people rightly had concerns about encroachment on subsidiarity when these past debates were taking place about social issues in the context of various European referendums, what we see now is a European attitude that seems to regard differently the concerns and interests and even the dignity of smaller states.  I am worried about that aspect of the direction in which Europe is going.  If we are to achieve solidarity, it will come at a price.  We get little hints of this in various ways.  An example is the repeated leaking of details about our financial and economic affairs to the Bundestag, a foreign parliament, with no great concern about what that might say about the way in which smaller countries and their interests are regarded by greater and more powerful forces.  This stability mechanism will hopefully be all about solidarity &mdash; for larger countries, but also for smaller countries.  However, we must continue to examine the culture of the evolving European Union.  I hope Croatia will be among our allies in this regard.  Senator Norris referred to Bismarck earlier.  We do not want to take that route in terms of the attitude to smaller states and entities.  There should be an ongoing concern for the distinctive needs and cultures of smaller states.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  I have listened with interest to the wide-ranging views of speakers over the past half-hour, and one of the messages that comes through clearly is the need to maintain a substantive debate on the future of Europe and Ireland&rsquo;s place in Europe.  This is a specific Bill, but the ongoing project of European development needs a significant degree of political input from us.  Here in this House of the Oireachtas, the space should be available for us to have a rolling debate on the European project.  Senator Colm Burke has been pressing strongly, as Senators know, to have the various EU directives and proposed legislation debated here in the House.  That is a subject worthy of consideration.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames talked about the next step for Europe.  I welcome the fact that our Croatian friends are here as they take another step towards becoming a member of the family of Europe.  The steps that Europe will have to take &mdash; we do not have time to go into them this evening &mdash; will be brave and possibly lengthy.  One might say it will be very difficult, but when we cast our minds back to the Europe of 1973, when Ireland entered the then European Economic Community on 1 January, we can see the tremendous changes that have occurred over the past 40 years.  It is possible that we will see similar dramatic progress over the next decade or so.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In 1973, Croatia, from a geopolitical perspective, no longer existed as a country.  It was behind the awful line that divided Europe, the Iron Curtain, where hundreds of millions lived under a Soviet system or, from the point of view of the Croatians, the slightly less austere but still dictatorial rule of Marshal Tito.  All of that changed when the Berlin Wall fell and Europe came together.  Is it not impossible for the same sort of generosity of spirit and courage to present itself again and for us to take the necessary steps into the future to ensure that Europe, regardless of how we term it from a political perspective, will unify itself in even greater fashion and ensure ongoing peace and progress?  We should not be afraid of the future or the steps we may have to take, because we need only look to where we have come from to see how much more peaceful and progressive Europe now is.</P>
         <P>I was interested in the comments of the previous speaker, Senator Mullen, about the various directives.</P>
        <P>Sometimes, we wonder what we need from Europe.  In recognising what Europe has given us, we should ask what we can give to Europe.  Although it will not be billions of euro, we can offer a certain life and social philosophy.  There was a time when Ireland&rsquo;s only exports were its missionaries.  Those days are long gone, but we can export to the EU, the Continent and beyond a life philosophy in which a general respect for young and old, born and unborn, is sacrosanct.  We can sell this strong Irish statement to the Continent.  We must not keep this asset, but expand upon it.</P>
        <P>That the House has had two substantive debates on the EU, its mechanisms and future today shows that we are not bound in a fearful sense to Europe, but how we must interact with the politics and structures of Europe daily.  More building is necessary, but we should not be fearful.  Consider from where we have come.  The EU used to be the European Coal and Steel Community, ECSC.  Less than one century ago, the peoples of this Continent were spilling one another&rsquo;s blood in two world wars.  Notwithstanding the financial, banking and political crisis, we remain a continent at peace.  We can be proud and look forward with confidence to a fine future for Ireland in Europe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators who made contributions before and after my arrival.  The support for the legislation across the political divide is heartening.  I did not hear a harsh word against it.  Some concerns were expressed, but there was strong support for this Bill.</P>
        <P>I recognise the presence of the Croatian ambassador, Her Excellency, Ms Jasna Ognjanovac, who I have known since my time as Chairman of the then Joint Committee on European Affairs.  She participated in our meetings regularly.  I am delighted that her country will join the EU on 1 July 2013.  It would have been great had that been scheduled during the Irish Presidency &mdash; the day before would have sufficed &mdash; but we cannot have that.</P>
        <P>I was also heartened by the fact that almost 67% of Croatian people voted in favour of joining the EU in January before its accession was ratified by its Parliament in March.  Despite our economic difficulties, the people of Croatia believe their future lies with the 27 member states of the EU, which is welcome.  From an Irish point of view, Croatia has always been welcome to the EU.</P>
        <P>I will address a number of points that were raised during my presence.  Difficulties concerning scrutiny under the Lisbon treaty were mentioned.  The treaty may have faults, but it provides for a greater level of democracy and transparency in EU institutions than used to exist.  Decisions by the Council of Ministers must be made in public, which was not the case previously.  MEPs, who are directly elected by member states, now have decision making powers equal to those of the European Council, which comprises Heads of State and Government.  Extra powers have been granted under the treaty.  For example, new powers were granted to the Oireachtas and other parliaments in respect of the Commission&rsquo;s agendas.  Under the treaty, we have the power to introduce material prior to the annual programme&rsquo;s drafting, to scrutinise and to hold the Commission to account.  If we utilised these powers to their fullest, they would be even greater.  I would welcome this development.</P>
        <P>Our programme for Government clearly outlines a greater level of scrutiny.  Senator Healy Eames claimed that there was too little scrutiny.  Under the programme for Government, we abolished the old scrutiny sub-committee of the Committee on European Affairs to ensure that each line ministry took responsibility for dealing with the issues relating to it.  For example, European matters relating to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are scrutinised by the Department as well as its Oireachtas committee.  This is the proper and local approach.  Under it, there should be a greater level of informed scrutiny of directives and matters coming from Europe.  This was the intention of the Lisbon treaty and the programme for Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take on board Senators&rsquo; comments regarding the long-term plan for Europe&rsquo;s future.  In particular, Senator Bradford referred to the need for a substantive debate.  Such a debate in both Houses would be worthwhile.  Revisiting the principles under which the EU was founded would be useful.  They were principles of solidarity between all of the countries in Europe after the devastation of the Second World War, which destroyed many people&rsquo;s lives.  It was a peace process.  John Hume has put on record his belief that it is the greatest peace process that the world has ever experienced, bringing together countries that had been at one another&rsquo;s throats.  It is also a mechanism for achieving prosperity on the European mainland and islands through pooling the resources and sovereignty of its states.</P>
        <P>The Bill will transpose into the law of the State significant developments at EU level.  I welcome this opportunity to debate important EU instruments in the Oireachtas.  There is no more appropriate place for such a debate.  The purpose of the Bill as originally tabled by the Government at the beginning of last month was to amend the European Communities Act 1972 to provide for the protocol amending the protocol on transitional provisions annexed to the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, agreed in Brussels on 23 June 2010, and for the European Council decision of 25 March 2011 amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for member states whose currency is the euro.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, the Select Committee on European Union Affairs adopted a number of Government amendments, the purpose of which was to provide that the treaty concerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the EU, agreed in Brussels on 9 December 2011, and the protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, agreed in Brussels on 16 May 2012, will form part of our domestic law.  Thus, with the passage of this Bill as amended, these four elements would, upon ratification by Ireland, become a part of the domestic law of the State.</P>
        <P>At the time of the Bill&rsquo;s publication at the beginning of May, the protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon had not yet been signed.  Each will now begin their respective national ratification procedures.  All the concerns of the Irish people appended at the time of the Lisbon treaty and which were to be introduced as part of a protocol to the next treaty have now been signed off by the member states and will shortly be ratified.  That relates to taxation, family matters and neutrality, and the three protocols will be part of the treaties when this process is completed.</P>
        <P>When the EU Heads of State and Government agreed on the terms of the Irish protocol at the June 2009 European Council meeting, it was indicated that at the time of the conclusion of the next accession treaty, the provisions of the decision on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon would be set out in a protocol to be attached to the EU treaties.  The Irish protocol and the Croatian accession treaty are thus linked in time.  It is for that reason that these elements were not included in this Bill as originally drafted and why the Government moved the amendments to incorporate both these instruments into this Bill on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The resulting amended European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 before the House remains a brief and largely straightforward Bill, although those qualities should not take away from its significance both for Ireland and for the European Union.  The amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union will provide the legal underpinning to the permanent European Stability Mechanism, ESM, which is to enter into force next month and which is the subject of a separate Bill, the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012, which is also under consideration by these Houses.</P>
        <P>The MEPs protocol provides for 12 member states to have due levels of representation in the European Parliament as provided for under the Lisbon treaty in the current term of the Parliament, from 2009 to 2014.  The effects of the MEPs protocol will thus be entirely temporary, impacting as it does only the composition of the current European Parliament, which was elected some months prior to the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.  Ireland&rsquo;s number of MEPs is unaffected by this protocol.</P>
        <P>The Croatian access treaty paves the way for Croatia to join the European Union as a new member state from the middle of next year.  Ireland has long been a solid supporter of the EU&rsquo;s enlargement policy and Croatia&rsquo;s accession to the European Union is an extremely positive development for the country and the EU.  It is profoundly encouraging that even at a time of major challenge for the European Union, European countries continue to see their future within the Union and go to great lengths to prepare themselves, their markets and their people for EU accession.  The Government warmly welcomes Croatia and applauds the significant strides it has taken.  We look forward to working very closely with Croatia in the years ahead as a new EU partner.</P>
        <P>The Irish legal guarantees protocol, as promised to the Irish people in June 2009, is now delivered by the European Union precisely in accordance with the timetable agreed in 2009.  The legal guarantees were important for Ireland and the Irish people and a concrete reflection of the Union&rsquo;s willingness to listen to members and citizens, and respond constructively.  The transformation of these legal guarantees into a protocol to the European treaties is hard evidence that the EU delivers on its promises in this instance to the Irish people.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned at the outset, I warmly welcome the broad cross-party support for this Bill and the positive and constructive engagement with it by the Members of this House.  The Government looks forward to continuing the engagement of the Houses of the Oireachtas in all the relevant business of the European Union.  The Treaty of Lisbon has given national parliaments a greater and more defined role than ever in the business of the Union; that is as it should be.  Those responsibilities are taken extremely seriously by the Houses of the Oireachtas and I commend this House for the role played in the process.</P>
        <P>On the part of the Government, we are committed to engaging with the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Irish people on European Union business to the greatest degree possible.  We have done so to a very significant extent since coming to office last year but engaging with the Irish people on EU affairs is something that will become all the more important over time, and especially as we seek to navigate a stable and secure future for our common currency and our Union over the months and years ahead.  Democratic legitimacy and accountability are equally critical at the EU and national level.  The Government will be steadfast in seeking to ensure that what is done at EU level also meets those benchmarks.  The role to be played by the Houses of the Oireachtas will be central in that regard.</P>
        <P>Our debate in the House on the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2012 plays a part in this important process of engagement and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

        <P>I am raising an issue pertinent to the schools building programme.  The Minister might agree that over the past number of years we would hear from the Department of Education and Skills that there has been an underspend in the capital programme, with moneys not fully drawn down for different reasons.  Projects may be held up, stalled or experience problems with planning permission.  In these times of fiscal constraint we do not want to be in a similar position at the end of this year.  I am asking the Minister for information regarding the capital build programme to date for this year and if it can be compared with 2008 to 2011, inclusive.  Where do we stand as we are half way through the year?  My understanding is that we are approximately a third of the way through the budget.  Any good accountant would consider the projects and how many will come to fruition, along with any technical or other difficulties with other projects.  That person may also consider if there is a plan B to ensure the money allocated to capital building will be spent by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>It is particularly important this year, as there has been much controversy over the capital build programme, with many schools left out of it.  We welcome that a number of schools are still in it, and it is important from the perspective of creating employment and providing proper accommodation for school children that we have a capital programme.  It would totally unacceptable if we got to the end of the year and the Department told us all the money had not been spent.  There are many worthy projects out there, and I would add the likes of Clifden community school in Connemara or Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh in Galway, as well as a number of other schools that we could all mention from our own constituencies.  These projects are almost shovel-ready, at stage 2B of the planning process, and could proceed if allowed to go to tender.</P>
        <P>What is plan B?  If there is a likelihood that a number of the projects might fall by the wayside or behind schedule, with some funding remaining unspent, is there an alternative plan?  Would the Department allow some of the schools that are just off the list to go to the tender process and talk to builders?  If they have tenders ready, they should be given the go-ahead to start building, although we know money is tight and that it is important to manage budgets well.</P>
        <P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus t&aacute; m&eacute; ag s&uacute;il go m&oacute;r leis an bhfreagra at&aacute; aige agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh freagra dearfach aige d&uacute;inn anocht.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it affords me an opportunity to outline to the House the current position on the schools capital building programme to date in 2012.</P>
        <P>The capital allocation available in 2012 under subhead F01 for primary and post-primary schools amounts to &euro;357 million, of which almost &euro;149 million has been expended to date.  This level of expenditure at the halfway point of the year is over &euro;12 million ahead of the profiled expenditure to the end of June.  In percentage terms, expenditure has reached 42% of the 2012 allocation and this compares with an expenditure level at the end of the equivalent month in 2011 of 34%, in 2010 of 18%, in 2009 of 23% and in 2008 of 50%.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The expenditure incurred to date on the various sub-programmes that constitute the overall capital programme is as follows: on large-scale projects, &euro;104.7 million; site acquisition, &euro;7.4 million; additional accommodation, &euro;20.7 million; emergency works &mdash; &euro;3.3 million; pre-2012 schemes &mdash; summer works, jobs initiated, etc. &mdash; &euro;9.5 million; furniture and equipment, &euro;1.4 million; and miscellaneous items, &euro;1.7 million.  The expenditure on large-scale projects which stands at almost &euro;105 million will continue throughout the second half of the year.  I can inform the Senator that there are 61 large-scale projects on site, while 11 have reached substantial completion so far this year.  In addition, the Senator can be assured that in the months ahead further projects will also advance to construction and incur expenditure.</P>
        <P>In view of the need to ensure every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  The five year programme announced in March is focused on meeting these demographic needs.  All school building projects will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available.  Schools which have not been included in the five year construction programme but which were announced for initial inclusion in the building programme will continue to have their projects progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to the Department in future years.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Skills is satisfied that the capital expenditure on schools to date in 2012 is performing ahead of expectations.  At the beginning of 2012 a total of 60 major large school projects were under construction and last December details of a further 56 major school projects that were planned to advance to construction in 2012 were announced.  Already 17 of these projects have commenced on site, while a further eight constitute schools bundle 3 under the PPP programme and will not incur expenditure in the subhead until completed.  With 31 major school projects still to advance to construction in 2012, there are sufficient projects positioned to incur expenditure throughout the remaining months of the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked for a breakdown project by project, but it was not available.  Perhaps I might receive it by email when it is available.  </P>
        <P>I note that all school building projects will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available.  For the projects about which I am talking substantial funds have been collected locally.  They would be willing to agree to tender documents if the Department gave permission to do so.  Perhaps the Minister might ask the Minister for Education and Skills if a school such as Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh which has money in its coffers and could go to tender, without prejudice to the capital moneys available, can be given permission to do so.  If any of the projects was to fall behind, the school would at least be in a position to follow through in the future.</P>

    <sTitle>Draft Building Regulations</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Priory Hall residents never had a desire to become experts on building regulations, but, having been to hell and back in the last few years and studied and traced how these fire traps &mdash; their apartments &mdash; were allowed to be built in the first place, they have gained huge expertise.  Apart from wanting to see their current problems solved, they are determined to do what they can to highlight the need for the regulations to be changed to prevent other families from ending up in a similar position.  They have read the draft building control (amendment) regulations published by the Department and the chairman of the residents&rsquo; group, Mr. Graham Usher, has contacted me and also written to the Minister about them.  In tabling this matter for discussion on the Adjournment I sent the Minister a copy of the email I had received from Mr. Usher who raises serious concerns about the draft regulations.  In his view, the Department has not learned the lessons of Priory Hall.  I wish to state these concerns and hear the Minister&rsquo;s response to them.</P>
        <P>Mr. Usher argues that the proposed amendments still focus on local authorities accepting and filing certificates of compliance.  He points out that the relevant certificates for Priory Hall were filed and that this failed to prevent the problems from occurring.  Under the 1990 Act, local authorities have the power to inspect works in progress.  Clearly, they have not availed of it.  It is the view of the residents that legislation should be used to turn this power into a statutory duty.  In the past local authorities claimed they did not have the resources to carry out inspections of new developments, despite receiving huge amounts in development levies from residents.  The levies in respect of Priory Hall came to huge amounts for a building in which the local authority failed to carry out its functions properly.</P>
        <P>It is never acceptable for a building to be built without being properly inspected, or for a fire safety certificate to be issued before a brick has been laid, as happened in the case of Priory Hall, but that excuse should not stand up today, given the far lower level of development taking place and the availability of personnel to carry out inspections.  I call on the Minister to ensure that under the new regulations, all buildings will be inspected and that if financial arrangements must be made to cover the cost, this will be done.  The least families deserve after paying so much for their homes, particularly to the State in the form of stamp duty and levies, is that the building has been properly inspected to ensure it is safe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mr. Usher argues that if a decision is taken not to inspect all developments, at the very least, a targeted approach should taken, rather than maintaining the current system that appears to be random in nature.  The decision to inspect should take into account the past history of the developer and any other available information that indicates there may be potential problems with a development.  This would necessitate the sharing of information between 37 local authorities and any other State body involved in the construction process, possibly through having a centralised database, in order that the information available in one local authority would be available to all others.  If such a system had been in place, it would have flagged the fact that the developer of Priory Hall had had problems with other developments.  We saw how Ms Theresa McGuinness, a victim in one of McFeely&rsquo;s developments in County Louth, had to chase him over to London.  It would also have flagged the fact that the Health and Safety Authority in 2006 had sought a High Court order to close the Priory Hall development owing to safety concerns.  All of this information should have been flagged in making sure the local authority did its job and inspected the site.  It seems, however, to the Priory Hall residents that the regulations still do not include a requirement on local authorities as the relevant fire safety authority to ensure compliance with the fire safety standards.  Given that the chief fire officer for Dublin City Council has stated a fire could spread throughout the entire Priory Hall development within minutes owing to an absence of fire protection measures, it is a source of huge concern that a more proactive approach to fire safety does not seem to be central the draft regulations.</P>
        <P>There is a chance to engage in a root and branch review of the current system.  That is certainly the purpose behind the Minister&rsquo;s exercise.  It is important, however, to ensure all the relevant safeguards are in place and that we do not opt for a stop-gap half measure.  It is time to get it right in this area and ensure families can, at least, be assured their properties will be safe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have read with interest the correspondence received from the former resident of Priory Hall.  I acknowledge and commend his constructive contribution to the ongoing process of amending the building control regulations.  Coming from someone who is, like many others and through no fault of his own, living with the agony and distress caused by the failure of others to abide by their statutory responsibilities, the contribution is welcome, valid and, given the individual&rsquo;s own particular circumstances, remarkably well balanced.  I have set in train my intention to change the building regulations before any matters came to light regarding Priory Hall.  Therefore, my <i>bona fides</i>oo are quite solid.</P>
        <P>I respectfully counter the assertion that the proposed changes to the building control regulations fail to address the building failures we have seen in housing and apartment developments in recent years.  Notwithstanding this, the correspondence in question clearly identifies many of the shortcomings in the current arrangements for building control which the package of measures I announced in July 2011 are intended to and will address.  Broadly speaking, these measures include mandatory certification by competent professionals, lodgement of drawings and more meaningful oversight and inspection of building activity by local authorities and private sector construction professionals.</P>
        <P>The key step will be the early introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance confirming, with appropriate documentary evidence, that the statutory requirements of the building regulations have been met for the building in question.  These certificates will not resemble the opinions of compliance referred to in the correspondence, which are currently provided for conveyance purposes and which are not a part of the statutory building control process but are often misrepresented as being such.  Mandatory certificates will mean what they say and will be signed by professionals who understand and accept their responsibilities and the liability that goes with the consequences of failing to meet them.</P>
        <P>Mandatory certification, of itself, depends on the integrity of those concerned and must, therefore, be coupled with more rigorous oversight of construction activity.  I have, therefore, approved proposals devised by my Department and County and City Managers Association representatives that will achieve the following: involve more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector; standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions; and better support the further development of the building control function nationwide.  This will ensure more effective and meaningful oversight and inspection of building activity, and will facilitate the move to a more risk-based approach by local authorities, which the correspondent correctly identifies as being necessary.</P>
        <P>From a regulatory perspective, there is much that can be done to improve the system, and this is receiving priority attention within the Department.  It is only right and proper that any moves to strengthen the system to ensure the burden of compliance with statutory requirements rests with the responsible parties and is not invidiously pushed on to the consumer or State.  There is an urgent need for the professions in the industry, and builders and contractors and their representative groups, to step up to the plate when delivering on their obligations to provide a reliable level of professionalism and quality for consumers.</P>
        <P>I thank the correspondent for his constructive and thought-provoking contribution.  As the Senator knows, the proposed building control (amendment) regulations were released for public consultation.  This consultation period closed just a few weeks ago on 24 May 2012.  Some 500 submissions have been received and are currently being reviewed by my Department with a view to having a final set of regulations providing for mandatory certification and lodgement of drawings ready to be signed into law in the coming months.  I assure the Senator I am making changes to the building control regulations that will be very different from those agreed by my predecessors, the latter having contributed to problems like those in Priory Hall.  Nobody should doubt my determination in this matter.</P>

	<P>I will reserve judgment until we see the final draft.
