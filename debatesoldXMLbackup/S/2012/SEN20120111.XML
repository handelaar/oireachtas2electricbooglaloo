      <P>I wish everyone a happy new year.  I have received notice from Senator Deirdre Clune that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social Protection to ensure that redundancy payments due to the Vita Cortex workers in Cork are paid.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jim Walsh of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to meet the Nigerian ambassador to express serious concerns at the appalling murders and persecution of Christians living in north Nigeria, seek assurances that the Nigerian Government will take effective steps to prevent the Islamic organisation, Boko Haram, from continuing its appalling campaign and, if necessary, prevail upon it to seek international assistance to protect the Christians who are under threat.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jillian van Turnhout of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to clarify if he accepts that there is a clear case for the provision of rehabilitation services for stroke survivors and others with neurological conditions in light of the recent Irish Heart Foundation report on the cost of stroke in Ireland and the need to allocate the necessary funding thereto.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">Le fiafr&uacute; don Aire Cumars&aacute;ide agus Acmhainn&iacute; N&aacute;d&uacute;rtha ar &uacute;s&aacute;id an tAire riamh, n&oacute; an bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist aige &uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as a chuid cumhachta&iacute; faoi roinn 16 den Acht um Fhorbairt Mianra&iacute; 1979, le hacmhainn&iacute; mianra&iacute; neamhfhorbartha timpeall na t&iacute;re a athgh&aacute;bh&aacute;il don St&aacute;t agus go h&aacute;irithe iad sin i Leitir N&uacute;is, Conamara, Contae na Gaillimhe, R&eacute;imse Oscailte 3928.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Thomas Byrne of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to outline any proposed structural changes to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in County Meath in terms of Garda district boundaries.</P>
      <Col N="546" />
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mark Daly of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to detail the efforts being made to ensure the passing of the current legislation being proposed in Washington regarding visas for the undocumented Irish in the United States.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to clarify the reason he is targeting small rural schools for increased enrolments before the publication of the value for money review of small schools.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Clune, Walsh, van Turnhout and &Oacute; Clochartaigh and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
      <P>I have to inform the House that a letter dated 4 January 2011 has been received from the Secretary to the Government in regard to the reassignment of a Minister of State and the appointment of a Minister of State.  The correspondence will be published in the Official Journal of Proceedings of the Seanad.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins">
      <NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the report of the advisory group on small business, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 5.45 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply to the debate not later than 5.35 p.m.</P>
      <P>I would like to inform Senators that I have secured commitments from a number of Ministers to come to the House to debate various topics raised in the House in the last session.  These debates will be on the Irish language, foreign affairs, disability issues, media standards and children&rsquo;s rights.  I can confirm to the House that the Irish language debate will be held next Wednesday, the fisheries debate on 25 January and the foreign affairs debate on 2 February.  I do not have dates for the other debates but the Ministers have given commitments that they will come to the House to discuss the other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I wish the Cathaoirleach, the Leader and my colleagues a very happy new year and I hope they all enjoyed the break.  This session is an important one and I commend the Leader and the other members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for the changes made to the way the Seanad operated in the past session.  There have been very good and positive initiatives, although more are required.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In that vein, will the Leader consider the role of the Oireachtas in regard to the scrutiny of EU proposals which has been raised on a number of occasions?  The Oireachtas is deficient in the work it does in scrutinising proposed EU legislation.  The second Lisbon treaty referendum gave us the powers to scrutinise proposed EU legislation and we should do so if the other House will not do so.  I do not believe the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs does so in a detailed way, although it is no reflection on the members of that committee.  As I saw on previous occasions, it is effectively a rubber stamp.  Given that our interaction with the European Union is probably now more important than it has ever been, because we are in the midst of an EU crisis, it is crucial we are proactive in this regard. Will the Leader seriously <Col N="547" />consider this? There are a number of EU directives and there is proposed EU legislation on which we could start immediately, and we should do so.</P>
      
      <P Just="Left">On a number of occasions in the past three months, I asked when the Government would publish its mortgage arrears implementation strategy.  I remind my colleagues that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, gave a firm commitment in this House that it would be done prior to the budget on 6 December, but it was not done.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said it would be done before Christmas and that the Government would let people know what it would do with the 10% and upwards of principal private residential mortgages which are more than 90 days in arrears, but that was not done.  I heard in media reports that the Cabinet was to get a report last week or is to get one this week. When will the Government publish this long awaited mortgage arrears implementation strategy? It is almost three months since the publication of the Keane report but this report has still not been published. When will this report be published and when will there be some relief for mortgage holders?</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the commitments the Leader received from Ministers to come to the House in the next few weeks.  Will he ask the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to come to the House to discuss the 150,000 letters the Revenue Commissioners issued in the new year to senior citizens?  Everyone must be tax compliant.  There is no issue with that.  Of those 150,000, 15,000 will have tax taken from them and then refunded.  However, an issue arises whereby 115,000 of those individuals will have very small liabilities but I want to know &mdash; the Leader might be able to answer this question &mdash; if the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, or the Taoiseach knew about this initiative. It was interesting that in recent days Ministers and the Taoiseach said they were very concerned and they would talk to the Revenue Commissioners but did anyone talk to Revenue before the event? There is no way the Minister for Finance would not have known about this initiative from Revenue. Can the Leader confirm that the Minister for Finance did know of it? What advice was he given and what interaction did he have with the Revenue Commissioners before these letters were issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik">
      <NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I join others in welcoming everyone back after the break and wishing colleagues a happy new year and a busy and productive session ahead.</P>
      <P>I mention the untimely deaths of two very noted and respected journalists, Caroline Walsh of <i>The Irish Times</i>, and Mary Raftery, whose brave investigative work for RTE, and &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; in particular, exposed some shameful abuses of individuals, children and those with psychiatric illness in the past.  They are sad losses to note over the period.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the new jobs initiative announced today led by nine Departments.  It is vitally important that such initiatives are established, particularly given the news over the break of the difficulties experienced by workers who have lost their jobs in companies like Vita Cortex in Cork and La Senza at various locations around Dublin where workers were told of the loss of their jobs at outrageously short notice and are still owed back pay by companies which in other aspects are still trading.  It is an issue we need to debate.  The Leader has announced the debate tomorrow on the report on small business, which was sought at the end of the last session, and we will have other debates also on jobs initiatives in the coming weeks.  I very much welcome these debates because we must be creative in our thinking about job creation and trying to stem the rises in unemployment.</P>
      <P>As part of the debate on children&rsquo;s rights I ask that we also incorporate a debate on adoption.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is in Vietnam this week and I very much welcome the announcement that she is there to seek to conduct the <Col N="548" />bilateral agreement with Vietnam necessary for adoptions to continue from that country.  We had an excellent debate in the previous session of this Seanad on the  Adoption Bill which came into force at the end of last year but huge concerns remain.  Many of us will have heard from individuals who have friends or family who are very concerned about the issue of adoption and the way adoption law is now operating under the new and much more child friendly regime established by the Adoption Act.  It would be useful, given that the Minister will attend the House to debate children&rsquo;s rights, to also have her deal with the issue of adoption, particularly when she returns from Vietnam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone">
      <NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">Reports in the media this week indicate that women only shelters for those who are homeless in Dublin have been redesignated as mixed gender.  This is a cause of great concern to groups such as Sonas Housing which is working with vulnerable women who are now being accommodated in a chaotic, mixed gender dormitory situation.  I have a question for the Leader arising from that which also relates to some preliminary results of a study from Trinity College Dublin of women and homelessness.  The study indicates that 96% of homeless women have experienced violence of one form or another, with many experiencing incidents of violence while homeless, and 46% of those surveyed reported sexual abuse during childhood.  In the majority of these cases the women surveyed also indicated that the perpetrator of this abuse was a male family member.  The results of the survey confirm the need for female only accommodation services for very vulnerable women who may also be experiencing mental health or addiction issues.</P>
      <P>Dormitories are not ideal emergency accommodation.  Why is this happening now?  It did not happen in the past.  In 2009, in response to various evaluations on the issue of homelessness and service provision, the homeless agency partnership adopted Pathway to Home, a new configuration of homeless services in Dublin.  That reconfiguration involves moving resources away from providing temporary accommodation to longer term support for housing solutions.  This strategy, naturally, was broadly welcomed by the sector.  Concerns with respect to the implementation of the strategy have arisen, however.  The move to mixed-gender dorms appears to be part of the transition in implementing the new policy.  My office has conducted some research with the relevant advocacy organisations.  These groups have indicated that this situation can be described as the bad implementation of good policy.  The reform of public services is top of the Government&rsquo;s agenda.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has consistently said we have to deliver the same quality of service with less money.  I repeat that we must ensure no one is further harmed by the State&rsquo;s behaviour in implementing new policies in light of cuts, or current policies that have not yet felt the brunt of cost reductions.  I ask the Leader to raise this issue with the new Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.  The Minister of State needs to clarify the current accommodation situation for homeless women in Dublin and set out how the most vulnerable people will be protected while Government policy is being reconfigured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RonanMullen">
      <NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba bhre&aacute; liom beannachta&iacute; na hathbhliana a ghu&iacute; ar an Chathaoirleach agus ar mo chomhghleacaithe go l&eacute;ir anseo.  I thank the Leader for setting out with determination to arrange for discussions on a number of topics.  I acknowledge his efforts in setting dates for debates that have been requested by Senators.  I thank him for being so helpful.  I look forward particularly to the debate on standards in the media.  We have made progress with the conduct of debates in this House.  It is now possible to ask questions and receive answers from Ministers.  It strikes me that this type of approach will lend itself particularly to the debate on the media.  We should continue to explore how we can get the best possible <Col N="549" />exchange between the Government and the Seanad on some of the issues that need to be teased out.</P>
      <P>I want to support what Senator Bacik said about including the issue of adoption in our debate on children&rsquo;s rights.  I have been approached by a number of people who are interested in that matter.  It is important that we debate it.</P>
      <P>The issue of education is also important.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has come to this House on a number of occasions.  There are continuing developments in this area.  Over the Christmas period, I was quite struck by the number of people who contacted me to express concern about the change in guidance counsellor positions, which are to become ex-quota.  This is causing a great deal of concern.  I have noticed that, unusually, concern about this issue has been expressed by people who do not have a vested interest in the matter.  They recognise the important pastoral and personal support role that is played by guidance counsellors.  It is not just a matter of career guidance &mdash; it can be many more things than that.  In fact, I was approached on Sunday evening by a lay chaplain who wanted to express his concerns about this issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I noted RTE&rsquo;s report on the issue last week.  When we debate media standards, I will raise my concerns about the recurring tendency in RTE to try to create a church-State row when no such row appears to exist.  I do not think the case for maintaining guidance counsellors within quota should be made on the back of some kind of attack on school chaplaincy.  All of these services provide invaluable support.  I felt that Emma O&rsquo;Kelly&rsquo;s report on the matter on RTE was unhelpful.  This is an important issue.  We need to reflect on all the personal support mechanisms that are available to students, particularly at a time when the morale of people is being affected by so many challenges in society.  I would like the issue of the provision of guidance counsellors to be revisited in early course.  I hope the Minister for Education and Skills will come here soon in order that we can discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey">
      <NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I wish everybody a happy new year.  I look forward to working with every Member of the House in 2012.  The media has reported some good news about Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink exports.  Bord Bia revealed today that the value of such exports increased by 12% last year, to a total of &euro;8.85 billion.  This is very positive news for the agriculture and drinks sectors.  The more Irish producers expand their business plans, produce and export, the more jobs will be created.  It is noteworthy that the &euro;1 billion increase in this figure, by comparison with 2010, means that these sectors accounted for a quarter of the total increase in Ireland&rsquo;s export revenues in 2011.  The total value of exports designated for the UK market increased by 6%.  The total value of exports designated for other European markets increased by 16%.  The fact sheet for Bord Bia for 2010-2011 indicates the following trends.  The UK market is the primary destination for Irish agrifood and drink exports, accounting for nearly 44% of all our exports.  Some 34% of exports went to continental and EU markets, while 22% went to international markets.  The figures for 2009 show that Ireland&rsquo;s gross agricultural output was valued at &euro;4.73 billion.  In 2010, Irish dairy exports rose by an estimated 17% to &euro;2.3 billion.  During 2010 Ireland exported an estimated 36,500 tonnes of sheep meat which was valued at &euro;170 million.</P>
      <P>We should have a debate on Ireland&rsquo;s food and drinks industry in the context of job creation and in order that we can have a presence and sustain the margins in global export markets.  Irish firms need to work together as partners rather than as competitors.  There is a possibility to increase the number of jobs in this industry to more than 300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="550" />
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney">
      <NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I share Senator Comiskey&rsquo;s optimism about the agrifood sector but I ask the Leader to respond to what seems to be yet another sideswipe at the agriculture sector by those who seem to know very little about the difficulties that sector has been facing in recent years.  This has come about primarily because last week the IFA published up to date figures on farm incomes, noting they had increased by some 26% to 27%, which is very welcome.  The underlying reality is that although this income has shown a significant increase it is still well below the average industrial wage.  It is reckoned to be in the order of &euro;21,500 but in the media today there are suggestions that farmers should be prevented from buying farm diesel at a cheaper rate.  The attitude is why should farmers be subsidised when they are showing such a significant increase in income?</P>
      <P>I am sure the Leader will agree with me that the attitude should be &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; the farming industry.  Farmers have gone through a difficult period and it is a volatile industry.  In the past ten days the more serious commentators on this area who have analysed the increase in income have pointed to this volatility within the sector; one pointing out that milk prices can collapse overnight.  Farmers face that particular difficulty.  If people wish to make any comment about improvements in the farming industry they should compliment farmers on their hard work and note the achievements of their efforts.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I ask the House to take note of the sad passing of one of the original ambassadors of Irish tourism, the late Bridie Gallagher, who passed away this week.  Bridie Gallagher was the first tourism ambassador for Ireland in the 1950s when tourism was only an embryonic industry.  She brought out the music and song of Ireland and was a wonderful personality, showing the essence of Irishness to audiences across the world, so much so that I have no doubt that the Donegal tourism industry and that of the west in general, right down to my colleague&rsquo;s county of Kerry, benefited enormously from the considerable publicity she generated when she appeared at the most iconic attractions across the world, including the Sydney Opera House, the Royal Albert Hall in London and Carnegie Hall in New York.  I would like the Leader and the House to note her passing.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a h-anam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney">
      <NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, join my colleagues in wishing everybody a happy new year.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak about the staff of Vita Cortex in Cork, having visited that plant during the Christmas period and having met with the staff in a dark, lonely and cold plant where they were spending their Christmas.  This is a much wider issue than Vita Cortex alone.  The same situation is going on all over Ireland, in every town and county, where small businesses and operators are closing down one business but still operating another. I understand and appreciate company law is very complex but it is very unfair that a company can continue to trade another viable company, with the same people, owners and directors, making money from other companies while letting the State pick up the tab for the people they have cast aside, some after 40 years of loyal service to that company.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to intervene in this case?  The minute the insolvency fund pays out the redundancy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney">
      <NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this a separate issue from that raised by Senator Clune on the Adjournment.  The minute the money is paid out, the &euro;900,000 is gone because the company has claimed inability to pay despite making money across the country.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to intervene to break the impasse and assist the workers in question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn">
      <NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Bacik and Mooney referred to recently deceased persons.  I want to mention Mr. John McCarthy who died yesterday.  I got to know him quite well through meetings in Leinster House on several occasions.  He was the champion of those protecting depressed people forced to undergo electroconvulsive therapy which he himself suffered.  While I may not have always agreed with him, he was a reminder of the work we have achieved through debates here on mental health.</P>
      
      <P>I was delighted to hear the Leader received commitments from several Ministers to attend the Seanad in the coming weeks.  I would love if the Taoiseach addressed the House too.  I cannot recall if he has attended it since his election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">If we are going to work hard to ensure the benefits of a second Chamber are recognised, it must be done in the coming few months.  If we are going to succeed in this regard, we will have to change the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attitude to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Some months ago I raised the matter of illegal diesel laundering which has come to the fore again with the highly toxic sludge found on the M1 near the Border today.  Until I heard it on the radio, I had not realised the large sum involved to now remove this sludge and transfer it abroad for proper disposal.  While that figure is large, it is only a fraction of what the State is losing through its subsidies for diesel used by the agricultural community.  Other countries on the Continent subsidise their farmers for diesel use but in a considerably different way.  Our current system only encourages criminality in diesel laundering and forces legitimate companies out of business through unfair competition.  The Minister should be reminded this is not a time for talking about the problem but for action to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the significant appointment of Charles Brown as papal nuncio to Ireland and his recent ordination to archbishop by Pope Benedict last week.  Archbishop Brown worked closely with Pope Benedict for ten years when he was Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.  It shows how important Ireland is on the Vatican&rsquo;s map.</P>
      <P>The presence of our most senior and skilled diplomat, David Cooney, as ambassador-designate to Rome, at the ordination ceremony is equally significant.  It augurs well for the future of relations between Ireland and the Vatican.  We must remember there was no diminution in those relations as full diplomatic relations have been retained.</P>

      <P Just="Left">I wish all Senators a happy new year and genuinely hope it will be a good year for everybody.  Unfortunately, we know this will be a tough year for many.  It could be the toughest year yet, socially and economically.  The budget cuts announced last year are starting to bite, the end of year Exchequer returns showed that the tax take for the year was down on what was expected and 445,000 people are out of work.  More people are out of work now than when the Government took office.  We have a jobs crisis and a social crisis because many people will live in poverty as a consequence of Government decisions.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome a number of the statements that will be discussed in the next few weeks but there are a number of glaring omissions.  A number of calls were made before the new year for a debate on job creation.  It remains the biggest issue affecting the State.  Too many people are out of work and the Leader will be aware that Waterford city has a disproportionately higher unemployment figure.  Health and education are critical areas and the relevant Ministers need to come to the House to take statements.  The Leader will also be aware of the impact health cuts are having on local and regional hospitals from his own experience in Waterford and of the impact education cuts are having on DEIS schools and on many others schools, which are losing teachers.  He attended a meeting in Waterford with teachers from the city and county.  The cuts announced in the budget are beginning to bite hard.</P>

      <P Just="Left">We all sympathise with the workers in Vita Cortex but the problem is once inability to pay clauses are inserted in legislation, these problems are created.  Let us remember that the Government plans to include similar clauses in changes relating to joint labour committees.  Members must be clear about what they are voting for when they are in government.  Some Government representatives spoke passionately about what is happening in this area but they should also remind themselves of what they are voting for when such legislation is brought forward.</P>

      <P>I wish fellow Senators a productive and busy year.  I would like to persevere with an issue I raised previously.  I asked for the terms of reference of the HSE&rsquo;s independent review of the Mayo abuse case to be made public.  I appreciate it is not that long since I made the request but there has been silence since then.  Perhaps the Leader might assist in ensuring they are made public.</P>
      <P>I take my leaf of perseverance from a woman who understood the value of perseverance, Mary Raftery, who sadly died yesterday.  She was a friend and colleague and I learned much from her.  However, we learned much for her.  She absolutely understood the value of truth and the pursuit of truth underpinned her work, even though that is, as we all know, a difficult thing to do.  She never let that stand in her way and she was vigorous in pursuit of things that she <Col N="553" />believed were important for us as a country to face up to.  If we do not face up to that which happened in our past, we will be unable to prepare properly for the future.  I would like to acknowledge the work she did and the loss her death will bring to all of us.  We should all aim to persevere when circumstances are difficult and, in particular, persevere for the truth.  She was a fine and shining example of that capacity.</P>

      <P>Ireland, no more than any other country, is not immune from the fallout from unrest in other parts of the world.  This perhaps is one of the reasons we in this House have on a constant basis supported the Palestinian call for full nationhood, and also for it to be accepted by the international community.  It is worth recording, therefore, that at the UNESCO General Conference, by 107 votes to 14, Palestine was granted full membership of UNESCO.  Only 12 of the 194 members sided with the US and Israel in opposing that membership and I am glad to say that Ireland supported the application on the part of Palestine.</P>
      <P>There is also a sad element to this, however.  As a result of that vote, the United States has now withheld funding for UNESCO which amounts to almost 20% of the total funding.  If that money is not restored within two years, and it is possible it will not be restored, this would mean the US losing voting rights in UNESCO and also losing its influence, which I do not believe is a good development.</P>
      <P>I can only see Palestine coming into UNESCO as helping world peace.  At the same time, it has failed to achieve membership of the UN.  The only reason it failed was that the Security Council would not recommend it to the General Assembly.  Palestine will now go a different route and will look for observer status, which will come down to a simple majority of the General Assembly.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Government the hope of this House that it would continue to support the Palestinian cause, as we have done in the past.  I also hope, even though it will require a change in legislation in the United States, that the United States will reverse that decision and will restore funding to UNESCO.  Let us get on with the real work of building peace in the world community.  Ireland has always been an honest broker in this regard and I hope it will continue in that role in the future.</P>

      <P Just="Left">I wish the Cathaoirleach and my fellow Senators a happy new year.  I am pleased to join Senator Ivana Bacik in marking how important it is for the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to be in Vietnam to renegotiate the bilateral agreement.  The House will recall the long and arduous hours we spent in the last session debating the new Adoption Bill, now enacted, and also the 20 families whose files are in Vietnam and who are waiting for their babies.  Progress was promised in the last session but it never happened.  The Minister&rsquo;s visit is good news.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I join Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe in her fine words on the early and untimely passing of that fine journalist, Mary Raftery.  Her work did so much for the advancement of children&rsquo;s rights and in many ways has led us to where we are today, on the brink of a referendum on that issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to attend the House.  The Minister today announced &euro;3.75 million for an initiative on the teaching of science that will revolutionise how science is taught in this country and it is important he tell us more about this project.  It is a lot of money in these times and, while I welcome it, I want to know whether this extends to the area of IT.  We know many graduates who are not getting jobs in IT because they are not adequately skilled; therefore, it is an area where we are losing in the midst of an employment crisis.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Much emotion was expressed over the holiday period in regard to education.  There were concerns about cuts to teacher numbers in small schools, on which we need clarification, and <Col N="554" />there was also a very emotive debate on career guidance.  The career guidance counsellor in a school is a teacher, like any other.  Up to now, they were ex-quota or outside the teacher allocation but the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has now put them inside it.  One might say that is not a bad thing.  I condemn in the strongest terms the words of an eminent career guidance counsellor in this country, who is a former president of the career guidance counsellors&rsquo; association, who stated that changes will cause suicide among young people.  There is no causal link between the provision of career guidance and youth suicide.  That is only inflaming the issue on something that is so sensitive and important.  If anything, what we need is the module on suicide prevention that is in the SPHE in secondary schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I also welcome all my colleagues back.  I want to start by briefly paying a personal tribute to the late Ms Mary Raftery, who I have known, off and on, since I was a teenage student in University College Dublin.  Her body of work speaks for itself and all I can say is if all lives were lived so well, the world would be a better place.</P>
      <P>I want to follow up briefly on the reference to Archbishop Brown and the fact that he used be involved with the office for the propagation of the faith.  To remind my senatorial colleague, that was formally known as the Holy Office of the Inquisition.  It had a name change at some stage.  Perhaps it might be a good idea if Archbishop Brown would bring some of the skill set from the history of that organisation here to conduct some of the investigations into the banking sector.</P>
      <P>On a serious issue, the debate about hospital services &mdash; local versus central, centres of excellence versus local access &mdash; is one that needs to be conducted in a calm and rational fashion.  With good heart, honesty and thoughtfulness, people will come to different conclusions.  It is something which should be decided, probably not in parliamentary chambers but in areas where experts and local representatives can come together and see the pluses and minuses of it.  I do not wish to get into it.  It is a major issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I feel strongly, however, about the issue of honesty in politics and I am sorry but there is a big, unhealed wound, which opened over the course of 2011 and was only really fully exposed at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on 8 December.  That refers to the promises which were made pre-election by the then designate Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health with respect to the retention of services in Roscommon County Hospital.  I do not wish to get into the rights and wrongs of whether those services should or should not have been retained.  Fine arguments can be advanced in good faith on both sides, but I am troubled by the sequence of events which, it has now emerged, led to the decision to make a U-turn from what were pre-election opposition party electoral promises to Government policy and which resulted in the 24 hour emergency services in Roscommon being closed.  It now appears that we are being told that the original decision was made by the HSE following a recommendation by HIQA. This decision was then supported by figures, which were reported by the Minister for Health in the other Chamber and in public, which suggested that the disparity of mortality for patients who were admitted to Roscommon or Galway hospital with a heart attack was 5% versus 20%, tying his hands and preventing him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We now know that the 20% versus 5% figure is wholly unsafe.  Dr. Jennifer Martin of the Department of Health, at the Joint Committee on Health and Children on 8 December, stated that they had originally, while looking at HIPE data &mdash; which are not data designed to assess the quality of care &mdash; to see that if the data keeping was good, noticed this unusually high mortality rate which alarmed them.  This, evidently, was communicated to the Minister who was making the decision about Roscommon County Hospital.  Dr. Martin then stated in the meeting on 8 December that when they re-reviewed the data, they were reassured.  I have seen data from Roscommon; they were wrong.

      <NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everyone else, I wish everybody a happy new year.  All the Christmas cards were very nice and I thank everyone very much.</P>
      <P>I want to raise an issue on health which I have raised on a number of occasions previously and which has been raised by many colleagues.  I refer to the delay in processing medical cards in the central processing unit in Finglas.  I read in the media a number of reports from politicians on all sides, including Deputies Kelleher and O&rsquo;Mahony, of horrendous cases.  In one case the individual was dead when the medical card arrived.  In another case an individual who applied in 2010 received a letter in December 2011 stating that the application was being given urgent attention.  In the north east, 100 GPs have withdrawn from primary care teams in protest against the delays in processing medical cards.</P>
      <P>Senators on both sides of the House have raised this issue repeatedly since July.  The Minister for Health stated that he was advised that 80% of medical card applications were being processed within ten working days.  Given that the biggest issues facing Members in their constituency work is the delay in issuing medical cards, it is strange that the remaining 20% are approaching all the politicians.  The numbers simply do not stack up.  There has been no improvement despite the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to intervene.  Two Ministers of State from my party have expressed concerns about the matter, namely, the Ministers of State at the Department of Health, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to arrange for a delegation from this and the Lower House to visit the central processing unit in Finglas to find out what is going on.  Officials in that building will not even take calls from public representatives.  All we can do is e-mail them, which is not good enough in this day and age.  People have been waiting longer than one year to have their medical cards renewed.  We were told locally that cards would take ten to 15 days and the Minister claims they are being processed within ten days but the truth is that they can take over a year.  I urge the Leader to arrange with the Minister for a delegation to visit the Finglas unit at the earliest opportunity in order that we can find out what is happening and foster a sense of urgency on the matter.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate with the Minister for Social Protection.  As Members are no doubt aware, a national review is being conducted of community employment schemes.  Cuts to the schemes were pencilled in but a review was announced on foot of the cross-party reaction.  I ask that all stakeholders be included in the review because I fear we may be penny wise and pound stupid.  Services are being provided throughout the country by those who participate in community employment schemes at a cost which the nation can afford.  Many of the lone parents who participate in schemes have been told they must opt either to receive the lone parents allowance or participate in schemes without receiving the allowance.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I also seek a debate on health.  I acknowledge health matters will arise tomorrow in the context of the debate on suicide but it has come to my attention that, as a cost saving measure, the HSE is not providing locum cover for consultants when they are on maternity leave.  This is another example of being penny wise and pound stupid, particularly in respect of Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Manorhamilton where locum cover is not being provided for a consultant on rheumatology who is to take maternity leave from this week.  Despite great strides in this area over several years, the policy will double existing waiting lists in the coming months.  On the issue of communications, Senator Landy referred to delays in medical card applications and we also had the letters from Revenue which were sent to pensioners.  The handling of the issue relating to pensioners amounts to elder abuse in the context of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am about to finish and appreciate the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s leniency.  When I telephoned the medical card helpline recently to protest about the delay in dealing with a client the person at the end of the line, who did not give me a name, informed me there were people on palliative care who had been waiting for a medical card since July 2011.  It was as if this in some way justified the level of mediocrity people have been forced to accept.  I ask the Leader to address this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, extend best wishes for 2012 to the Cathaoirleach and my colleagues.  I concur with Senator Landy on the issue of medical cards.  We are all aware that the service is in crisis.  Those of us who were members of Health Service Executive forums two or two and a half years ago warned that this problem was likely to occur.  Unfortunately, we must make the system that is in place work.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement made by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, on a jobs initiative.  He confirmed that the Government is placing job creation at the top of its agenda for 2012.  The House should take every available opportunity to keep jobs at the top of its agenda.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s request to invite the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to the House to discuss children&rsquo;s rights, including adoption.  I raise this issue against the background of a report in national newspapers on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day that more than 1,300 children contacted the childline service on Christmas day, an increase of 40% on the same day in 2010.  It is worrying that on what is supposed to be the happiest and best day of the year for children and families such a large number of children found it necessary to seek help.  Financial pressures and difficulties have been cited as part of the reason for the increase, as have alcohol and drug abuse in families.  A major debate is required on this issue, including on the wider issue of parenting.  If such a large number of children believe it is necessary to seek help on Christmas day, something is seriously wrong in society.  We pump large sums of money into training people for all sorts of careers and jobs but pay little attention <Col N="557" />and allocate few resources to parenting.  The House should discuss this issue with the Minister and I look forward to doing so in 2012.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite">
      <NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw attention to the ongoing cuts in primary school education.  I specifically highlight west Tallaght, including the areas of Fettercairn, Brookfield, Jobstown and Killinarden, where ten primary schools are designated as disadvantaged.  The proposed cuts will result in schools in the area losing 25 teachers and 18 special needs assistants in a three year period.  The area has ten special support teachers who play a critical role in helping children who have emotional and behavioural problems.  Such problems can arise when parents are unemployed and families are in poverty.  The ten teachers in question will be lost to the children in question.  The 1916 Proclamation states that we cherish all of our children equally.  I am at a loss to understand the current cuts, particularly those in primary schools in disadvantaged areas which are cutting off those in society who experience the highest levels of disadvantage.  Where are truth, integrity and the belief that we should cherish all of our children equally?  Unfortunately, income inequality is increasing and society is becoming more rather than less unequal.  I would like an urgent discussion on the growing income inequality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKelly">
      <NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by my colleague, Senator Denis Landy, that a deputation visit the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in Finglas to see what is going on in regard to the processing of medical cards because it was big topic of debate on every local and national radio station over Christmas.  Yesterday, I received a call from my local radio station, which incidentally is the same as the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s, to remind me that I said on radio 12 months ago that this would not work.  Judging by the number of telephone calls coming in, it is simply not working.</P>
      <P>I will give one example of someone who had cancer.  I told the person to give me the renewal form and that I would send everything to the PCRS with a covering note to ensure it would not get lost.  Within three days, I received an acknowledgement from it by e-mail with the name of a person and a reference number.  That was followed two weeks later by a letter to the family asking why it had not renewed its medical card.  I telephoned the PCRS a few days later but it could not find anything in regard to the family.  The reference number it had quoted in the e-mail did not relate to the client whose information I had sent in.</P>
      <P>A week later somebody else telephoned me about the matter and said that the medical card would be rolled over for one month while the PCRS tried to find the details.  The PCRS came back to me three weeks later to ask that the person send in all the information again.  I said that under no circumstances would the person go to all that bother again.  Whether the PCRS found the details after that or not, the person eventually received a medical card which was rolled over for 12 months.</P>
      <P>There is something scandalously wrong with the way things are being done.  There should be a dedicated section to deal with urgent discretionary medical cards.  Bearing in mind that the Minister for Health said in this House that he was told by the PCRS that 85% of medical cards are straightforward and are dealt with in ten to 15 days &mdash; I do not believe that &mdash; I call on the Leader to ask the Minister to call for an internal audit of those figures based on the last six months of 2011.</P>

I wish to follow up on what Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien said in regard to our dealing with EU legislative proposals.  We are only 50 weeks away from taking over the Presidency of the European Union on 1 January 2013.  It would be appropriate for us to have a very proactive role in what the <Col N="558" />agenda will be in 2013.  It is an ideal opportunity to use this House to highlight issues with which we could deal.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien in calling for priority to be given to setting aside time to deal with EU matters.  I met the Government Chief Whip on the matter.  If we want to deal with EU matters, additional staff would have to be assigned to deal with them and I understand that is being considered.  We should not leave this issue in mid air.

      <P>I wish the Cathaoirleach and everybody else a happy new year.  Senator Marie Moloney&rsquo;s contribution in support of the Vita Cortex workers in Cork was very welcome and I add my voice to it.  However, I draw the attention of the House to the plight of the Cork-based Bowen construction workers.  Some 92 workers have been left without any final payments or redundancy payments because NAMA refused to facilitate them.  In June of last year a liquidator was appointed and during the application process the High Court judge recommended that the Bowen Construction workers be paid what is owed to them.  However, within days of the liquidator being appointed, NAMA moved to appoint a receiver to the same company and the workers have now been left without their entitlements.  Those are just two cases where NAMA seems to be operating in a manner I cannot understand.  I wonder how many more workers are caught in the legal limbo land NAMA has created.  It is important that we ask the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Bruton, or the Minister for Finance, whoever has sole responsibility for the operation of NAMA &mdash; it is difficult to know even that much information &mdash; to the House for a discussion on this issue.  It appears many workers are being left in this legal limbo land but when it comes to dealing with other sectors of Irish society, we are quick to facilitate them.</P>

      <P Just="Left">I wish everybody a happy new year.  I am delighted we will have a debate on disability but that debate should be as informed as possible.  On her second visit to the House the Minister of State outlined that she was carrying out a value for money audit of disability service providers, in particular those who provide intellectual disability services, and the cost of running those businesses on a day to day basis.  I ask the Leader to use the auspices of his good office to ensure that report is made available to us prior to any debate in the House because relevant to the entire debate on the intellectual disability sector is the cost of the provision of service to that sector and its value for money.</P>
      <P>What also must be outlined is the payments to the chief executive officers and senior management within those organisations.  It is very important that those payments are put on the public record to allow us have an informed debate in this House.  In excess of &euro;1.2 billion is being provided for the provision of those services to what is a relatively small number of people.  We should not have a debate on the rights of people with disability, which is important, but on the quality and value for money of the service we are providing.  That may allow us provide a far better service with effectively the same amount of money.  I ask the Leader to write to the Minister to ensure we have that report prior to her arrival in the House.</P>

Everybody in this House recog<Col N="559" />nises what she has brought to the fore.  She lifted the carpet and exposed many serious issues, and I thank her on my behalf and on behalf of the people of Ireland for doing that.</P>
      <P>Regarding the furore over the pensioners tax issue, which somebody termed earlier as the abuse of the elderly, the way it was done was not right in that different language should have been used in the letters that went out.  I hope Revenue has learned a lesson in that regard but there should be a general notice for everybody, not just the elderly, that it is their duty to ensure they pay their tax.  People who are liable for tax must make sure they pay their tax but I ask the Leader to make it known to Revenue that it should put out a general advertisement in that regard because it was the elderly today who got this type of letter but it could be single parents or another category of people tomorrow who may not understand the letters.  The message should go out loud and clear that it is everybody&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure they pay their tax if they are liable for tax.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Government on having those operating the computers talking to one another because that is what unearthed the problem.  We have had criticism of Departments in terms of one Department not knowing what the other Department is doing.  It is a positive development to have those in the Revenue and the Department of Social Protection talking to each other but we should put Revenue on notice that everybody should be informed that it is their duty to pay their tax.</P>

I have a copy of the Commission&rsquo;s work programme which was secured for me by Senator Burke.  A number of items in it could be discussed by this House.  The official view is that the committees are dealing properly with the scrutiny of EU proposals.  I do not believe that is the situation.  I believe this House can and should be used for debates on the Commission&rsquo;s work programme and EU proposals.  As Senator Burke has said, the Government Whip has said staff would be required to allow the House to have such debates in order to ensure the proper information was available to us in advance of our discussions.  I hope we can move that on in early course and have these debates.  I assure the House that my office will not try to stifle discussion of these matters.  This is an ideal forum for debates on the Commission's work programme and EU affairs.</P>

      <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien and a number of other Senators referred to the letters sent to pensioners by the Revenue Commissioners.  I totally accept that the letters have caused confusion, anxiety and concern for some pensioners.  Obviously, this is an operational matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  They have an independent and legitimate responsibility to do their work.  I can tell the Senator that I am not aware of any contact between the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  There are lessons to be learned from exercises like those we have seen.  The Revenue Commissioners have accepted that the communication strategy in this regard should have been handled better.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As Senators are aware, officials from the Revenue Commissioners are meeting an Oireachtas committee to debate this matter.  I reject the criticism from some quarters to the effect that the political system should somehow be directing the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; operational issues.  Significant problems have developed in countries in which such direction takes place.  The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for ensuring people pay the right amount of tax at the right time.  The State entrusts that job to the Revenue Commissioners.  That is all I have to say on the matter.</P>
      <Col N="560" />
      <P Just="Left">Senator Bacik welcomed the new jobs initiative that was announced today, involving nine Departments.  I think everyone will welcome it.  It is something we should discuss in this House.  I remind the House that, following a request for debates to be held in this House without Ministers being present, Senators will be able to come up with job creation ideas and opportunities during such a debate next week.  Everybody in the House will have a chance to propose job creation ideas and suggest what we should be doing.  I will allow for an open-ended debate on the matter next week when I hope we will be bursting with job creation ideas.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senators Bacik, Healy Eames and Mullins raised the question of Vietnamese adoptions.  Reference was made to the fact that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, was in Vietnam.  It would be appropriate for us to have a debate on this issue.  We could also discuss the increase in the number of children calling the Childline service on Christmas day and throughout the Christmas period, which was mentioned by Senator Mullins.  I am sure the Minister would be quite willing to come here to debate those matters.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Zappone mentioned a very important issue, namely, a move to having mixed gender dormitories for homeless women.  The idea is there would be no female-only accommodation.  I do not believe it is acceptable there would be no female-only accommodation.  We will certainly raise the matter with the new Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, whom I will invite to the House to discuss the issues of housing and homelessness, as soon as she has a chance to brief herself.</P>
      <P>Senator Mullen spoke about guidance counsellors.  Other Members sought a debate on education.  I have asked the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, to come to the House and I await his response.  He will be present to deal with legislation in the coming weeks but I hope he will be in a position to attend for a general debate on education issues as raised by Members.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senators Mooney and Quinn mentioned diesel and the laundering of same.  There is no doubt this is a major problem and the cost to the Exchequer is enormous at this stage.  The matter has been brought up with the Minister on several occasions and I agree some action must be taken.  I do not believe there should be any question of removing the subsidy farmers receive for agricultural diesel.  </P>
      <P Just="Left">Bord Bia and the importance of agriculture were raised by Senator Comiskey. Agriculture is responsible for a good amount of our export growth and it is important that farmers be given every possible incentive to increase that growth. There was significant growth in incomes for the farming community last year but farmers had many years of poor incomes. As the average income is not yet up to the industrial wage, I do not believe there is any prospect of removing the subsidy for diesel for farmers.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senators Moloney and Gilroy mentioned the Vita Cortex situation which will be dealt with as an Adjournment motion today, raised by Senator Clune.  Senator Gilroy also raised the issue of workers in Bowen construction.  The protection of workers, companies that go into liquidation and the NAMA situation must all be clarified.  I agree totally with the Senators in that regard.  Workers should not be the ones who suffer as a result of problems that arise from the liquidation or folding up of a company, or its relationship with NAMA.  The Minister must deal with that issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn and a number of other Senators passed a vote of sympathy on the death of Mary Raftery.  Senator Quinn also mentioned John McCarthy, who was a champion of mental health issues.  Bridie Gallagher was mentioned, too, as was the literary editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>, Caroline Walsh.  All Members express their deepest sympathy to the families of the four people mentioned by various Senators on the Order of Business.</P>
      <Col N="561" />
      <P Just="Left">Senator Coghlan spoke about Archbishop Brown, the new papal nuncio.  I am sure we all welcome his appointment.  Mr. David Cooney is our ambassador designate and the Senator expressed the wish that we would once again have full ambassadorial status with the Vatican and that our embassy there would be restored.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Cullinane sought a debate on job creation and education, matters I have covered.  The House will have a very important debate on small businesses and the report of the advisory group on small business following the Order of Business.  I hope there will be many contributors to the debate.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe asked for the independent report on the Mayo abuse case to be published.  I will inquire as to its status in that regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the matter of Palestine having observer status at the UN.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will be in the House on 2 February and the matter can be raised with him then.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Healy Eames asked if the new &euro;3.75 million fund for the teaching of science, an important area, would include IT.  I will find out for her what the funding covers.  She also raised the debate on suicide which will be held tomorrow.  I originally envisaged it would involve only group spokespersons with a question and answer session at the end.  However, owing to the wide interest in the debate and the number of requests I have had for speaking time, spokespersons will now have eight minutes and other Members five minutes which they can share to allow in as many Members as possible.  That is why there may not be a question and answer session at the end.</P>

I agree with them that most applications are not processed within ten and 15 days, as has been claimed.  There is also the question of appeals which are sent to Sligo for processing.  I have heard of cases of files not being sent from the Finglas offices to Sligo.  There is a problem in this area and a need for improvement.

      <P Just="Left">Senator White raised the changes to the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme, an important issue for disadvantaged areas.  In all, 160 posts will be withdrawn next September, three quarters of them from DEIS programme schools.  These posts arise from earlier schemes to tackle disadvantage and were supposed to be withdrawn after the introduction of the DEIS programme in 2005.  However, this did not happen and several schools will lose some teachers in September.  The Minister for Education and Skills and theDepartment have informed me these will be treated sensitively through alleviation measures.  There is possibly a choice.  If there was a choice between increasing the pupil-teacher ratioand continuing the work in disadvantaged schools, I know what side I would come downon but it is a matter I will try to get the Minister for Education and Skills to address in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I thank the Acting Chairman for her best wishes which I would like to return.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the importance of the small business sector to the economy and to hear statements from Members on the report of the advisory group for small business, The Voice of Small Business &mdash; A Plan for Action, a copy of which all members received last December.  It is a clear plan of action.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for setting aside time to facilitate statements on the report and I look forward to the valuable input of Senators.  I will listen carefully to their comments.  I am sure members of the advisory group will be keen to hear their views and will reflect on them in the context of their future work.  That is why it is important that we debate the report and take on board the recommendation of Senators and their experiences in small companies.  Their comments will also be constructive in future discussions with Ministers and their officials in addressing the various recommendations contained in the report.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As Minister of State with responsibility for small business, I want to be the voice of small business to the Government to reflect the sector&rsquo;s concerns and bring forward proposals to assist businesses.  It is vitally important that, as a Government, we communicate on an ongoing basis what we are doing for small business and that we hear first hand what issues need to be addressed more urgently and what measures can be considered to further support small busi<Col N="563" />ness.  One of my first initiatives was to consider the need to have continuing dialogue structures in place whereby the concerns of small businesses could be brought to the attention of the newly appointed Government.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This led to the establishment of the advisory group on small business, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 16 June last.  In my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for small business, I chair the advisory group.  The objectives of the group are to facilitate structured and regular dialogue with representatives of the small business sector on issues of concern &mdash; the purpose of the debate is to ensure we take on board the issues and concerns of Senators who deal with business people on an ongoing basis; to promote the economic development and job potential of the sector having regard to the current restraints imposed on the national finances; and to recommend action points and follow-up for onward reference to Government.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In identifying members to serve on the advisory group, I paid considerable attention to having a well balanced representative group with an emphasis on individuals who had first-hand experience of running businesses, as well as including representatives of the key State enterprise support agencies.  Thus, the group&rsquo;s membership includes individual business people and representatives from Chambers Ireland, the Credit Review Office, the Irish Hotels Federation, ISME, the Small Firms Association, the county and city enterprise boards, Enterprise Ireland, Forf&aacute;s and officials from my Department.  Forf&aacute;s and my Department act as secretary to the group and Forf&aacute;s provide backup research and in-depth analysis.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the hard work and dedication of all those involved in the advisory group on small business.  Their involvement is entirely on a voluntary basis and involves no cost to the taxpayer.  I thank them for their work to date and look forward to their further contributions in following up on the report and in addressing new issues.</P>
      <P>The advisory group addressed some key issues it felt were important in assisting the small business sector to cope with the current economic crisis and to prepare businesses for future growth and job creation.  The group&rsquo;s report was finalised and submitted to the Taoiseach, and was published on 23 November 2011.  Senators will note that the report addresses some big ticket items as well as more focused issues.  The themes addressed include lending facilities and access to finance, labour costs and flexibility, local authority structures, costs of doing business, access to public procurement, the hidden economy, competitive practices, improving cash-flow, mentoring and advice, management development, access to information, and insolvency and debt resolution.  The advisory group has categorised recommendations under immediate, short-term, medium-term and long-term actions.  The Government is already working on many of the issues identified by the group and others will be fully considered and determined in the coming months.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">In regard to lending facilities and access to finance, the Government, through the Minister for Finance, has taken action to reorganise, recapitalise and de-leverage the domestic financial system in order to restore the banks to health and provide credit to business.  In addition, the Government is committed to introducing a temporary partial credit guarantee scheme and a separate micro-enterprise loan fund to supplement normal bank lending and to provide additional lending where specific measures are warranted.  The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, is working to implement these two initiatives.  Initiatives also taken by the Minister in regard to wage settling arrangements under EROs and REAs are addressing labour market costs and flexibilities.  Local authority structures and reforms are being advanced by the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As an immediate response to some of the other recommendations in the report, the Government has immediately committed to five recommendations for action.  These are pragmatic ideas which are capable of early implementation to help troubled small businesses obtain sup<Col N="564" />ports, address some of the challenges of the hidden economy, assist their cash flow by promoting prompt payments and seek ways to reduce administrative burdens.  The initial actions to be delivered are as follows.  First, to develop a simple one-page guide setting out warning signs to encourage small businesses to ask for help and outline services available.  This is aimed at supporting businesses that are in crisis and unsure where to turn for help and advice.  Second, to audit and review the multiplicity of licences required by businesses to assess the potential for discontinuing some licences and for amalgamating licences.  This will cut down the regulatory burden on companies and the level of inspections as well as the cost of regulation, which can be critical for companies which are currently over-regulated.  Third, to introduce additional scanning at ports to combat the illicit tobacco trade, which has such a detrimental impact on small retailers, as highlighted in a television programme earlier in the week.  This would be very cost-effective given there is currently a huge illicit trade.  All forms of smoking are detrimental to one&rsquo;s health but what is being imported is even more detrimental.  Fourth, to make available an official notice regarding the Government&rsquo;s current 15-day prompt payment practice to support full compliance for all public sector bodies and agencies.  Fifth, to develop a voluntary code of conduct on payments within the private sector, with the aim of reducing payment terms from the current average of 70 days.</P>
      
      <P>The remaining recommendations will be considered and discussed with relevant stakeholders to determine which ones may be advanced.  The report will also feed into the development of the action plan for jobs being finalised by the Minister, Deputy Bruton.</P>
      <P>In parallel with the establishment of the advisory group for small business, I have also established an interdepartmental SME liaison group.  This is to ensure that each Department of State clearly identifies the importance and concerns of the SME sector and ensures that actions taken have full regard for their impact on SMEs &mdash; the small business test.  This group will also focus on those recommendations of the advisory group which require cross-Government implementation.  In every Department, there is a small business element.  It is important to have joined-up thinking.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Government is fully committed to small and medium-sized enterprises, as evidenced by the programme for Government, the jobs initiative, budget 2012 and the Government&rsquo;s action plan for jobs which we will announce shortly.  The Government is acutely aware of the importance of the small business sector and its potential for generating employment.  Our challenge continues to be where to target our efforts and financial supports and interventions to best effect in the coming months.  When one considers the 200,000 companies employing 650,000 people in a &euro;90 billion economy, the backbone of this economy is small business.</P>
      <P>In these constrained economic circumstances, this requires difficult choices to be made in the face of enormous challenges &mdash; choices to ensure that we achieve change and make a real difference, not only to the business community but also to balance the human, social, and economic effects so as to protect and enrich the living and working conditions of all the people we represent.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On the importance of small businesses to the economy, my aim, as Minister of State, is to ensure that small businesses will continue to play a central role in our economic recovery.  Their ability to succeed and grow underpins our future potential for jobs, growth and prosperity.  As I stated, there are almost 200,000 small businesses in Ireland, involving a remarkable 650,000 employed throughout the country. That is why we want to get the views of every Senator here on how best we can strengthen that role. Encouraging even 25% of those companies to create one job each would create 50,000 jobs. Currently, small companies are the most effective way <Col N="565" />of getting people back to work. Small businesses are operating in a particularly difficult environment, and it is vital that we continue to focus on actions that achieve positive improvements in the operating environment for small businesses.</P>
      
      <P Just="Left">In the context of budgetary allocations for 2012, even at a time of declining resources, my Department&rsquo;s budget is being broadly maintained, with current spending at &euro;366 million slightly lower than the 2011 allocation but capital spending at a record high of &euro;514 million.  This will directly support the enterprise sector.  In the next two years, the Government will commit approximately &euro;1 billion in enterprise capital supports. It is a considerable amount of money for the area of investment in jobs and in the future of Ireland. The Government recently committed to a multi-annual action plan on jobs, with quarterly targets and a strict implementation process. This will be key to delivering a rolling set of reforms across the economy and Government to support the Government&rsquo;s first priority, which is job retention and creation.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Access to finance is the key issue for the small business sector.  We need a financial system that is better suited to the needs of our smaller company sectors.  Financing the productive capacity of the economy is critical to long-term economic success.  While large businesses have various options open to them, including the capital markets, small businesses are heavily dependent on the banking system.  The initiatives taken by my colleague, Deputy Noonan, Minister for Finance, to restructure and recapitalise the banking system were the principal responses to making credit available.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The recent restructuring of the domestic banking sector creates capacity for the pillar banks to lend in excess of &euro;30 billion over three years to the SME and other important sectors.  The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years from 2011 to 2013, inclusive. Both banks are required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. The banks have informed the Department of Finance that they expect to meet their lending targets for 2011. This will be independently benchmarked. </P>
      <P>A number of targeted initiatives are being developed by my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to build on the recapitalisation platform and ensure a flow of credit to businesses in order to sustain jobs and generate new employment opportunities.  These initiatives include the temporary partial credit guarantee scheme.  The introduction of a targeted temporary partial credit guarantee scheme was one of the commitments announced in the jobs initiative launched in May 2011.  On 22 November 2011 the Government approved the design of a temporary partial credit guarantee scheme and tenders have now been invited for an operating body for the scheme.  The invitation to tender was published on Monday, 5 December 2011 and we intend to roll out the scheme at the earliest opportunity.  In parallel with the procurement process the Minister is proceeding to draft the necessary legislation to underpin the scheme, which is designed to assist viable SMEs on the margins of commercial lending decisions to gain access to credit.</P>
      <P>In November 2011 the Government also sanctioned the establishment of a microfinance loan fund to generate up to &euro;100 million in additional micro-enterprise lending, which will benefit more than 5,000 businesses over a ten year period.  Loans of up to &euro;25,000 will be available in all industry sectors for micro-enterprises with up to ten employees.  It is the intention to establish this facility in the first quarter of this year.  Both schemes have been very effective in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The temporary partial credit guarantee scheme and the microfinance loan fund will not solve all the issues that arise in respect of access to credit but they will form key components in a suite of initiatives aimed at ensuring the flow of credit to SMEs to sustain and expand employ<Col N="566" />ment.  Both confidence and credit are needed to sustain the domestic economy, which is worth &euro;90 billion.  If people have confidence to spend in the economy, businesses will be more viable for lending.</P>
      
      <P>In conjunction with the Department of Finance I will be holding a series of regional meetings to discuss the issue of access to bank credit with local stakeholders.  These meetings will explore the findings of the recent Mazars survey of credit demand, which was published by the Department of Finance late last year, and consider options for Government action to improve access to credit for SMEs.  Mr. John Moran, the head of banking in the Department of Finance, will also attend the meetings.  We hope to engage with all SMEs, chambers of commerce and business people.  If difficulties arise on foot of the Government&rsquo;s recapitalisation of the banks, I want to hear about them first hand.  The dates for the meetings will be announced next week.  They will allow me to hear the views and experiences of local businesses and their representative groups.  Local bank representatives will be invited to attend and State agencies will also discuss access to bank lending.</P>
      <P>I ask Senators for their opinions on the issues that arise for small businesses.  Their recommendations will inform the Government&rsquo;s ongoing work on job creation and supporting small businesses.  This feedback will complement the information supplied in the Mazars survey and ensure future Government policies on credit to SMEs are based on as much information as possible and are implemented at the earliest opportunity.  We hear about people who are not getting credit.  We want to hear from businesses and representative bodies in a public forum.</P>
      <P>To assist the cashflow and working capital of small businesses, the 15 day prompt payment arrangements have been extended across the wider public sector for invoices received on or after 1 July 2011.  Central Government Departments have been paying their invoices within 15 days since June 2009.  The first set of returns from public sector bodies covering the period 1 July to 30 September 2011 has been collated by most Departments.  In respect of my Department, the first set of returns was published on the Department&rsquo;s website on 4 November 2011.</P>
      <P>As much as &euro;15 billion per annum is spent in the economy through public procurement.  Greater emphasis is being placed on making public procurement more accessible to small businesses, especially in seeking to foster greater small and medium enterprise, SME, engagement in developing innovative products and services to meet the needs of public bodies.  It is important, given that public contracts are subject to EU procurement regulations, that the tender arrangements in place facilitate and support Irish companies, especially in the SME sector which is a critical part of the economy.</P>
      <P>PRSI changes were made as part of the jobs initiative to encourage employers to recruit new employees.  Reviews of the sectoral wage agreements pertaining to hotels, restaurants, catering and construction are being carried out to improve competitiveness.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Small businesses are not only a vital part of the economy, they also play a vital role in our society and local communities as well as economic regeneration.  It is important that State agencies work with communities to create employment.  The Government will work with Enterprise Ireland to support more than 100 community based economic development companies which are doing a successful job.  I intend to continue to ensure the business environment is supportive of small business.  Our future economic prospects depend on sustaining our strong entrepreneurial spirit, even in the face of unprecedented economic challenges.  The Government is focused on ensuring small businesses are supported in every way to develop their business, increase exports, create jobs and rebuild the economy.</P>
      <P>Senators will have heard the good news today from Bord Bia that the value of food and drink exports increased to &euro;9 billion last year.  Enterprise Ireland companies increased the <Col N="567" />value of their exports to more than &euro;15 billion this year.  Foreign direct investment is highly effective but we need to lift the domestic economy, consisting of 200,000 companies employing 650,000 people in an economy worth &euro;90 billion.  The small business sector will create jobs and rebuild the economy.  The various Government initiatives I outlined and the work of the advisory group underpin this supportive business environment.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to come before the House with the report, which is an excellent document, albeit of a preliminary nature.  Having attended meetings around the country at which I listened to people involved in business, I know people want straight talk and action.  If people in small companies are supported, they will create jobs at little or no cost to the State.  I will listen to the ideas and recommendations of Senators and hope we will be able to work on them in government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite">
      <NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for circulating a copy of this exceptional document with a handwritten letter.  We have reams and reams of reports, some of which are boring and others very reasonable.  The document before us is top notch and I am highly impressed with it.  As a business person, I note it highlights the issues of importance to me.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister of State drew attention to the role of small business.  It does not do any harm to point out that small businesses are defined technically as companies which employ fewer than 50 people.  The vast majority of small businesses employ fewer than ten people.    The people who start up businesses, in particular small businesses, should become heroes in our community.  These people have taken a risk and have gone out on their own.  Starting up a business is very demanding.  I did so myself with my colleague, Connie Doody.  We worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 16 years.  We worked Saturdays, Sundays, Christmas Day and St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day.  It did not matter what day of the week it was.  That is what it took to get the business started.</P>
      <P>We started in Connie&rsquo;s kitchen and moved from there within three or four months.  Now more than 200 people are employed in Lir Chocolates.  It took perseverance and steel.  Every day we faced a mighty challenge which could have put us out of business but the two of us had a first class relationship.  We never fell out in those 16 years.  When I have differences of opinion with my colleagues in the Seanad, I comfort myself by saying that we succeeded in creating a very successful business.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity to congratulate my colleague, Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, who also started up a chocolate business and employs a large number of people.  She knows what I am talking about.</P>
      <P>When starting up a business, one must be like an athlete training for the Olympic Games.  People often ask me for advice on starting up a business and how to keep it going.  I know within five minutes whether or not they will succeed.  It is like people who want to be in politics; they are in love with it but they do not have the passion, the perseverance and the drive to keep going.  People used to ask me if I went into Lir Chocolates every day.  They thought it was like having coffee or playing golf.  I know within minutes of speaking to a person who wants to start up a business whether he or she has what it takes.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I do not know where we would be if we did not have the multinationals.  There is much more excitement in our local communities when a multinational comes in than when an Irish company increases its employment, yet millions of euro go into local communities from small companies.  The document states that there are 200,000 small businesses in the country employing 655,000 people.  People do not know that small Irish businesses employ that many.  They are involved in software, medical technologies, food production, tourism, retail and professional and personal services.  These small businesses are dispersed throughout the country <Col N="568" />and are keeping communities together.  Small business provides a good quality of life for communities.</P>
      <P>I refer to an important issue which has not really hit the radar and which I have noticed even in the city.  I am all for multiples like the one which was owned by Senator Feargal Quinn.  Senator Quinn and Tesco made our company and gave us the opportunities, in particular when Tesco took over Quinnsworth.  It brought us into the UK where it had 700 stores.  Practically overnight, we had access to a huge market in the UK.  The population is so large in the United Kingdom that one can cope with the recession there because so many people are willing to buy one&rsquo;s products.  There is an area of Rathgar where there are four or five small specialty shops but there is a supermarket opening right beside them.  They are the businesses about which the Minister of State is talking.  They are small retailers, the person providing professional services or quality food.  I do not understand why the planning authorities do not look at the community where new businesses are being opened up.  What will happen if the competition is so strong?  There is no question that the public flock to the new facility.  We cannot tell the people that they cannot go to the big multiple that will be on the corner but there is a problem with the planning permission, and I am talking about this city.  When planning permission is granted for something new to be set up, they should look at the existing services.</P>

In this particular community in the city it is possible that five shops will go out of businesses on one little street and therefore the sense of community and the sense of place will be gone.  I find it difficult coming here in the morning to buy the newspaper because all the small shops have closed.  I used to hear my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il going on about this over the years at parliamentary party meetings and I did not have much sympathy but it has got out of hand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune">
      <NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for coming to the House to debate his report.  Since his appointment, and prior to it, he has been focused on this initiative.  It is one of his main objectives and therefore it is welcome that he has got to this point.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We are discussing the first report, The Voice of Small Business &mdash; A Plan for Action, and the initiatives the Minister of State has undertaken to bring all the stakeholders around one table are important.  I do not believe in speaking through the media.  It does not work.  People need to sit down around a table and determine what are the problems.  I was particularly delighted that John Threthowan of the Credit Review Office was a member of that group and heard at first hand what people are experiencing, particularly those in small business, in terms of accessing credit and the deteriorating relationship many of them have with their banks for many reasons.  It is important to recognise also that the report states that small businesses must also address the problem and present credible business plans.  The banks lost contact with small business during the Celtic tiger era.  They did not develop the expertise to work with small business.  They failed to recognise the parameters that needed to be put in place when credit was being advanced to small and medium-sized businesses.  It was too easy for them to depend on property.  Everybody can understand how property is bought and sold.  If one buys a site, one can get planning permission to develop it and sell it on at a massive profit.  That is what happened over the years, particularly in the banking sector.</P>
      <P>I hope we are getting back to the point at which banks can operate properly once more.  It has been documented that they are training staff and getting to grips with the issues that face small business.  Every business works in a different environment and has different issues.  The institutions that lend to businesses need to get to grips with the environment in which those businesses work.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned the restructuring of domestic banking, which involves putting over &euro;30 billion into the banks for SMEs and other important sectors.  Last year, some &euro;3 billion was spent on new or increased credit facilities for small and medium-sized enterprises.  A further &euro;3.5 billion will be spent this year and &euro;4 billion will be spent next year.  Each bank has informed the Department of Finance that it expects to have met its lending targets for 2011.  I hope that will be the case.</P>
      <Col N="570" />
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s initiative in going around the country with representatives of the Department of Finance to meet individuals.  Members of this House and the other House who are looking on are concerned about the issue of access to finance for small businesses.  We have heard reports from ISME and the Small Firms Association and we have had direct engagement, rather than anecdotal evidence, from people in our constituencies about the difficulties they are experiencing.  We have been given counter-statements from the Irish Banking Federation that have blown what we have heard out of the water.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is important for the Minister of State to listen.  He intends to develop the structures needed to hear what individuals are saying.  Many viable businesses will go to the wall for the want of small amounts of finance.  We must recognise that some businesses are not viable in a recession, however, and may have to fold.  Many businesses will survive if they are given a small amount of support.  It is important that the Minister is taking to the road and listening to small business, which is the lifeblood of our society.  I commend him for that.</P>
      <P>The only positive thing one can say about the difficult economic period we are going through is that small business has come to the fore.  It did not have a voice before now, when it was all about property and multinationals investing in this country.  We tended to ignore small business and assume everything was rosy in the garden.  We did not take the contribution small business makes to our society, in every parish in the country, sufficiently seriously.</P>
      <P>If one travels from here to Galway, Sligo or Cork, one will see small businesses operating on every street one travels through.  They are employing two or three people.  Small and medium-sized businesses can employ up to 50 people.  They are and will continue to be very important.  It was clear when I read the report that those who have a great deal of entrepreneurial spirit, are willing to work hard and have ideas need to be supported.  Many of them are working alone or in isolated environments.  Small supports like access to mentoring and assessment of regulatory requirements are very important and need to be available.</P>
      <P>Local authority charges, which have been mentioned, are seen as a burden on small businesses.  Having been a member of a local authority, I would always have made the case for transparency in terms of charges.  I felt it was not there.  It is still not there.  I refer to water charges and commercial rates, for example.  The belief that the small business sector was an easy target in the community was well founded.  If the budget did not match up we would load another percentage onto the commercial rate.  Thankfully, those days have passed because of the work of Chambers Ireland and local business associations.  That voice &mdash; the impact local authority charges have on businesses &mdash; has been heard.</P>
      <P>An effort is being made to ensure that commercial rates will not be a target in the annual budgets of local authorities.  Nonetheless, we are moving towards introducing water charges.  For too long the commercial sector has had to bear the brunt of those, even in regard to domestic charges.  There has not been a contribution from national government for domestic water consumption, as there should have been.  One hopes we will have more transparency and efficiency because the private sector is paying for these charges.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I wanted to raise the issue of insolvency and debt resolution, to which the Government is committed.  Legislation will be introduced and it is becoming urgent.  I do not refer to the high profile cases, such as that of Se&aacute;n Quinn yesterday, or of other people who can go abroad and claim bankruptcy.  That is not what this is about.  It is about small people, individuals who have debts they cannot pay, as opposed to will not pay.  Examinership is not an option for them.  Perhaps there could be a facility for them away from the courts, where debts could be restructured and they could work with their creditors.  This might be under the umbrella of the courts but the people concerned would not have to bear the full cost of a High Court appearance, <Col N="571" />which is off-putting for most.  As things stand, they must face bankruptcy.  We need to be innovative and introduce structures that will help people.  I look forward to that debate at another time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for gathering the respective minds and the group representatives who worked within the small business sector to compile this report.  I welcome the opportunity today to discuss the report, given my personal background outside this House.  I am what is called a serial entrepreneur &mdash; it is all I think about.  I love business and have at least ten ideas a month for starting something new.  If anybody has any money they can come to me.</P>
      <P>Like many people in the business community, I have believed for many years that a proactive and, very important, a joined-up approach was required.  It is very important that it is not only this Minister of State, Deputy Perry, who is involved.  I hope every Department, every Minister and all his colleagues will join him.  The words I use are &ldquo;small business&rdquo;.  I used to think the appeal was chocolate and saucepans.  However, we are the life and blood of this country.  All Members have read the figures today and can read them in the report.  There are 200,000 of us, we employ so many yet we are going downhill.  This is not an easy situation.  It will take much more than Senators today to work it out.  It will take the entire Government to address this problem.</P>
      <P>The approach of the Minister of State is to involve representatives from the business world.  I like the notion of him travelling the country.  The formulation of this report is to be welcomed by all of us.  I strongly encourage the Minister of State to continue doing this in the immediate future and to feel the urgency we in the business community feel.  He cannot act quickly enough for us.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I will skim through some of the main points in the report, touching on lending facilities, the banks, the labour market costs, local authority structures, helping small businesses to compete on a level playing field and helping businesses to help themselves when they find themselves in crisis.  There is also the hidden economy.  None of these points is new to any of us who is a business owner.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I respect the Minister of State&rsquo;s report but I shall refer to the year 2008.  I believe it was February of that year that I froze the management team&rsquo;s salary.  That was a big deal.  By August I had frozen the salaries of the entire factory.  The word was, &ldquo;There is lovely Mary Ann, always so nice and for whom everything is wonderful, freezing our salaries.&rdquo;   In September&rsquo;s news, KPMG and Deloitte froze their staffs&rsquo; salaries and so it began.  I felt the chill very early on.  While I accept the emotional female charge, for the next eight months I cried most days and evenings at home.  A workforce is like a child but in this case it was 100 people relying on me.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Every Thursday, a wage bill of &euro;45,000 had to be met.  My main problem was with the banks.  I will not go into names as we are not allowed, a Chathaoirligh.  My business was viable and good but I had a cash flow crisis.  Before the credit crunch, I always received a stocking loan.  This time I did not.  Many businesses have since gone because of refusals for stocking loans by the banks.  I was lucky that Enterprise Ireland and a private investor lent me the money to tide me over.  They saw mine was a well run, sustainable and indigenous business.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Everyone hears the sums bandied around that the banks are supposedly lending to small and medium-sized businesses.  They are not lending such sums.  Out of 20 friends with good businesses, some have gone simply because of the banks.  The State owns the banks now so we must make them accountable.  I love horse racing and gamble much.  My bets on horses are on a par with the banks&rsquo; bondholders.  I wish I was a bondholder when I invested in property.  While I lost every penny in my investments, they have not.  We should be cushioning business <Col N="572" />owners as well as mortgage holders who have lost their jobs and who are in desperation as to how they will pay their mortgages.  It must be remembered they are the customers of the small businesses.</P>
      
      <P Just="Left">Small businesses create tax intakes for the Government which, I hope, it reinvests in the community which, in turn, spends in our small businesses.  However, this wonderful circle has been broken.  Our money is going to the troika, which kindly lent us all this money, and bondholders.  If we do nothing else this year, can we at least put up a fight?</P>
      <P>Last night I spoke to the president of RGDATA who informed me up to 300 retailers have closed in the past 18 months.  The brilliant economist Jim Power, who is passionate about buying Irish, a campaign which politicians are not supposed to talk about because of EU legislation, has stated money spent at a local family-owned store generates three times more in the local economy than money spent in one of the large multiples.  Like Senator White, I accept it is great the multiples came here and that they provide me with export opportunities.  However, at the moment we are trying to save Ireland.</P>
      <P>The independent retail, grocery and convenient sector consists of approximately 5,000 shops and is responsible for providing 93,000 full-time jobs.  It makes a total contribution to the economy of approximately &euro;3.6 billion.  I want to repeat that we should buy Irish.  Senators are a different breed.  The 60 Members should buy Irish produce at Tesco.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State have a discussion with the Minister for Social Protection on her proposed changes to the sick leave regime, which could seriously hamper small and medium-sized businesses?  I spoke to her previously in the Seanad about how her proposals continue to be a concern to me and other businesses.  This continues to worry me.  I love human beings.  Some are great and they are all different.   Some of us are brilliant engineers, mad entrepreneurs or good accountants but we are all human beings and I would love two or three extra weeks off a year.  I know some of my staff well and I said to them this morning: &ldquo;There are 100 of us.  Don&rsquo;t tell me that 50 of us will not go to the doctor to say I have a ferocious sore throat or a pain in my hip.&rdquo;  If 50 of my staff take three weeks off when this measure goes through, that will equate to 150 weeks or three additional salaries coming off the bottom line.  My company does not have fewer than ten or fewer than 50 staff and that measure will kill me.  I cannot cope.  I will have to try to meet the Minister of State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I refer to red tape and the labour laws.  I find it surprising that nowhere in this lengthy report is there a reference to employment tribunals or labour commissions.  They are the consistent sword of Damocles hanging over every business.  Employees&rsquo; rights must be at the forefront of every business and they must be protected and adhered to, but so must those of employers.  If I had gone out of business in 2008, I would have lost my house because my mortgage guarantees my business.  I would not have been eligible for the dole or free fuel.  The only thing I was looking at was saying goodbye to the house.  That is where the tears were coming from.  The scales of justice must balance evenly.  Currently, they are heavily tilted against the employer.  It is imperative that these tribunals and commissions be reformed from top to bottom, including the criteria applying to the selection of those chosen to sit on them.  If the Minister of State lifts this burden, the willingness to employ will be revitalised.  I cannot begin to outline the time an average business takes to comply with employment law.</P>
      <P Just="Left">A retailer friend of mine in County Cavan has 70 licences.  He needs a licence to sell stamps, salmon, organic salmon, farmed fresh salmon, free range eggs and so on.  An inspector from <Col N="573" />the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine checks the size of potatoes, while another examines the free range eggs and the dates on them.  He needs an entertainment licence in order that children can use the Thomas the Tank Engine ride outside his little supermarket.  This is crazy.</P>
      <P>I refer to the employment support scheme.  As I was on the verge of going out of business in 2008, this wonderful initiative was put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il.  The chocolate business is seasonal.  Come May, people are thinking about bikinis and salads and not buying chocolates for their family and friends.  I did not want to have to put my staff on a three-day week, as that could endanger a mortgage.  The employment subsidy scheme was introduced at this stage.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for attending and congratulate him on the report.  However, I have lots more to say to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKelly">
      <NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome the report and its recommendations.  As a businessman, he will be aware of the issues faced by this sector, including those mentioned by Senator O&rsquo;Brien such as the need for a licence to have a Thomas the Tank Engine ride outside his shop in Ballymote, County Sligo.  The first line of the advisory group&rsquo;s recommendation on commercial rates states: &ldquo;Although rates are generally a relatively small proportion of business costs for small businesses, they can be particularly burdensome for some small enterprises.&rdquo;  My experience is that rates are a huge issue for small enterprise everywhere I go around the country.  That is the main issue from a business perspective in my part of the country and I called on the Minister of State previously for a national revaluation of rates based on the pilot scheme in Dublin where three local authorities benefited to the tune of a 35% reduction as a result of a review.</P>
      <P>I welcome one of the recommendations in the report which states that the outsourcing of valuations should be considered.  My question to the Minister of State, bearing in mind we need to bring them into line with current market reality, is to whom can these valuations now be outsourced if we take the Valuation Office out of the equation.</P>
      <P>Another issue is the variation of rates from one county council area to another.  A plain example comes from my own area of Monksland, County Roscommon.  A person can throw a stone from Monksland across the River Shannon into Athlone in County Westmeath.  The rateable valuation in Monksland is &euro;74.34 per sq. ft. whereas in the thriving town of Athlone it is &euro;52.27, a difference of approximately &euro;22 per sq. ft.  This begs the question of why anybody would want to set up a business in County Roscommon when they can go across the river and set up for much less.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed nationally.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The report refers to a local government efficiency review group which could realise savings of &euro;511 million per year.  I welcome that and the recommendation that this &euro;511 million be passed on to small businesses, whether by way of rate reductions or otherwise.  However, I want to know where these savings are to be found.  The figure seems specific.  If the Minister of State said &euro;500 million, I would believe he had thought it up, but whoever came up with the figure of &euro;511 million must know that savings of that amount can be achieved.  I would appreciate it if we could discuss that issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am sure the Minister of State heard in his own home town during and after Christmas that every small business was going to close down.  In my own town, a number of pubs and small businesses have closed.  We spoke about this on the last occasion the Minister of State was in the House.  There is a need for a two-tier rates system, one for the blue chip companies, to which the Minister of State himself referred when I discussed this with him in the House, and one for smaller businesses.  If a small business employing one person has a rates bill of, say, &euro;4,000 and the books show it cannot pay it, what is the point in undue pressure coming from <Col N="574" />the local authority to lead it to close down a business, putting either one or two people on the dole at a cost of &euro;21,000 or &euro;42,000 a year to the taxpayer?  Where is the logic in that?  The Minister of State referred to joined-up thinking, which is an issue I raised with him on the same subject the last time he was in the House.  At the end of the day, we are pulling this money from one pot.  There is no point in shutting down a business over as sum of &euro;4,000 when it will cost us &euro;42,000.</P>
      <P>With regard to encouraging new business to set up, there is a need to consider giving a rates holiday to new businesses or else introducing a staggered payment structure at reduced levels, knowing we must also be careful to ensure this cannot affect existing businesses and cannot lead to displacement or undue competition.  Mindful of that, we talk a lot of how we need to promote tourism more and the great capabilities we have to do that.  I come from a town where the brand new hotel closed down last Christmas and did not open its doors prior to Christmas because of the bad weather.  It put 40 people on the dole and never re-opened, costing the taxpayer &euro;840,000 a year in social welfare payments, purely because it was not able to pay a rates bill of &euro;40,000 and a water rates bill of &euro;30,000.  Again, where is the joined-up thinking there?  It will cost us in excess of &euro;700,000 a year because nobody could see there was logic in doing business some other way.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State asked for ideas on how we can create employment.  I have said this several times in the House and will say it again.  In the context of the back-to-work scheme, as it costs &euro;21,000 a year to keep somebody on the dole, if we were to give &euro;10,000 a year to an employer to take a person off the dole, we would save &euro;11,000 a year for that personevery single year.  If we were to create 100,000 jobs per year in that way, we wouldsave &euro;1.1 billion on the social welfare budget, plus receiving extra tax, PRSI, universal social charge and every other charge of which we have recently heard.  This is a way that we need to start thinking because there is no other way.  The likes of Mr. Mark Fielding will agree with me, that one must give inducements to get people off the dole and to get employers to take them on.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I want to mention NAMA, although it is not something about which I know a great deal.  From my investigations over Christmas, apparently NAMA is concentrating most of its business in the UK property market &mdash; the figure is approximately 80% &mdash; and it seems to be ignoring what is going on in this country.  In this country, there are many auctioneers and estate agents trying to reactivate the business property market and they are in negotiations with NAMA for the purchase of many of its buildings.  In rural areas where buildings may not reach the same value as buildings in Dublin or in the UK, these auctioneers and estate agents have their i&rsquo;s dotted and t&rsquo;s crossed, and everything is done except for NAMA to sign off on the bottom line to state that the unit belongs to it.  These auctioneers have been ready to set up small enterprises.  They are ready to go.  They are six months waiting in many cases in County Roscommon for NAMA to sign off on property and nothing is happening.  It begs the question as to why we are paying somebody &euro;1,000 a day for 365 days of the year to run NAMA when it is forgetting about Ireland first?  I hope the Minister of State would use his influence and access to get the answer to these questions.  I would welcome his response.</P>

      <P Just="Left">I speak as somebody with experience of what is going on.  Let me tell the House a little story &mdash; I do not remember where it came from &mdash; about the burger seller in the United States.  He had a business that he had run for many years, a little stall from which he sold his burgers.  He <Col N="575" />did so well he was able to afford to send his son to college.  His son went to college and came back and said to his father, &ldquo;Dad, do you not realise there is a recession?  Would you not be wise to cut back on those burgers and not be stocking as many as you had?  Is there a need for you to work as many hours as you do?  There is a recession, Dad.&rdquo;  The burger seller cut back on the amount of stock he had and, amazingly, there must have been a recession because his business went down.  Therefore, he cut down a little bit more and the business went down more.  The burger seller said, &ldquo;My son was so wise to remind me,&rdquo; but, of course, the whole story came the other way round.  What we and the Minister of State must do is get us out of this situation where we are almost talking ourselves into the difficulty, and I do not know how he and we will do it here.  Let us establish confidence, however we do it.  It will not happen only from the Government, it will not happen from the Seanad and it will not happen from the media.  We are not only believing in good news for the sake of good news, but we do need to establish confidence.  We need to establish that one can do something with it.</P>
      <P>I spent quite some time lately in Drogheda.  I remember going to Drogheda on one occasion and meeting two men on the street who were unemployed and asking them how long they had been unemployed.  One of them said to me, &ldquo;I applied for a job six months ago and did not get it, but what else can I do?&rdquo;  I came home that afternoon and there was a knock on the door from two young men who had invested in a piece of equipment to clean cars.  They asked did I need my car cleaned.  My car &mdash; I do not have a look at it too often &mdash; needs cleaning quite regularly and I told them it would be great if I could get it cleaned there, just in front of my house.  The two boys gave me the set-up, cleaned the car and got paid for it.  They got four more jobs on our road that same weekend.  These were two students who started themselves.  They were not asking what more they could do.  They had gone out and did something about it, looked for a market, found it and were able to achieve it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have spoken previously about that young lady in County Kildare in transition year.  She attended one of the entrepreneurial classes that Jerry Kennelly ran in Kerry in the past four years and came up with a concept or idea.  The students were told one is never too young to be an entrepreneur.  She came up with the idea to produce a product that she could sell and now that she is aged 16 and in fifth year, she employs her father and sells the product over the Internet to customers in 22 countries.</P>
      <P>There are many more success stories.  I recently stepped down as chairman of Eurocommerce after serving in that role for several years.  Eurocommerce, which is based in Brussels, represents businesses operating in retail, wholesale and international trade.  There are 6 million outlets in the 27 member states of the European Union.  Some of them are failing or encountering difficulties but others are successful.  That is how we must sell ourselves.  People are finding ways of doing something different by looking for success stories.  Those 6 million outlets employ 31 million people in retail, wholesale, trade and commerce.  This is an area in which one can quickly get active because significant amounts of foreign direct investment are not necessary.</P>
      
      <P Just="Left">One way that we can expand the sector is by encouraging people to set up their own businesses, even if they are small.  I previously sat on a local partnership committee for one of our supermarkets.  The partnership aimed to create jobs.  Our supermarket had a number of windows which needed to be cleaned, as well as other tasks that could be performed locally but the majority of people who attended the meetings wanted to call on Forf&aacute;s or F&Aacute;S to assist them.  They were not thinking about doing it for themselves.  One young man offered his services to clean windows.  He had a ladder and a bicycle and he invested in a bucket to establish a window cleaning service which he sold at the end of the summer when he went to college.  The window cleaning business, which heretofore was supplied from another town, was <Col N="576" />still going many years later.  When a retired man asked me if there was anything else that could be done, I told him I would love to be able to provide salads on the spur of the moment.  He grew lettuce in his back garden in order that we could purchase from him if we ran out of supplies during the day.  I tell these stories because, while the report is very good, I hope the Government will be able to do something about it.  I hope it is facing up to the challenge of supporting small businesses.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers mentioned the issue of red tape.  The report states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The number of licences required by a single business, the cost, and the renewal process are particularly onerous.  Following on from this, the unco-ordinated manner in which a range of regulatory inspections is undertaken also places an additional burden on firms.  There is definitely potential for a more coherent approach among enforcement and inspection agencies.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have long argued for less red tape.  We should not tar every business with the same brush just because certain banks ran wild during the boom.  The report quotes a business person asfollows:</P>
      <P LI="1">In the waste collection business, I have to place an advertisement in the newspaper every time I have to renew a licence and go through the whole application process all over again.  The time and cost to small business is onerous and unnecessary.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">We should not be shy about buying Irish.  Some years ago, our company decided to do something about buying local.  This was a very interesting project because it brought the issue home to us.  We visited the various factories in the vicinity of our Finglas branch to find out how many they employed.  This reminded me about all the local factories that employed 30, 50 or 60 people.  Encouraging people to buy local will help to ensure the viability of many small businesses right around the country. </P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">Recently, in Drogheda, we got together a number of the local producers.  There were fish producers, meat producers, ice cream producers and cheese producers in County Louth and County Meath.  We brought them together with a group of &ldquo;eateries&rdquo;, a word I am not used to using which refers to delicatessens as well as little restaurants, coffee bars, etc.  We brought them in to the Scholars Hotel.  There were some 50 customers and 30 or 40 producers coming from the area.  A number of those customers or eateries promised themselves that by Friday they would guarantee they would always have two local products on their menu and each of the delicatessens were doing something similar.  Customers coming in to the shops or restaurants could see it was not merely buying Irish; they were actually buying from somebody up the road.  They did not realise that there was that cheese factory and somebody was making cheese there. </P>
      <P Just="Left">I believe the future can be bright for small business here, although it may not seem so at present. What many forget is that Ireland is experiencing the fastest increase in population in the European Union. That means there is a need for small businesses and jobs to serve that increase. Businesses must be ready to come out the other side, with the Government helping them to bring down costs and setting positive conditions to create jobs. It is amazing to consider it is forecast that by 2060 Ireland's population will have increased by nearly 50%, reaching the 6.5 million mark in the Republic, the biggest increase in the European Union.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the report on small business.  We must keep a perspective.  If the Government takes the right measures, there is some hope for the future.  The biggest thing we can do is <Col N="577" />instill confidence and state that the Government believes that we can do it.  If we believe in ourselves, we can achieve it. </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey">
      <NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is good to have him here.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the recent publication The Voice of Small Business &mdash; A Plan for Action, researched and published by the advisory group on small business.  During this challenging economic period it is imperative that small businesses are given professional direction and that we, as legislators and policy makers, can put in place the best mechanism possible in order to encourage and help existing small businesses and entrepreneurs who are considering starting a business in 2012.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and the advisory group for its comprehensive report.  I want to make some brief comments about the proposals in it.  With over 200,000 small businesses operating in Ireland, it is critical that the issue of access to credit is adequately dealt with.  I agree that the focus needs to be on the releasing of outflow of capital from the banks to small businesses.  If each of the 200,000 small business entrepreneurs in Ireland could hire at least one extra member of staff, this would immediately reduce the live register figures by nearly 50%.  Therefore, focusing on nourishing small businesses in 2012 should be pursued aggressively and without delay.</P>
      <P>I fully support the report&rsquo;s identified objectives for small business in Ireland.  For example, increasing the number of start-ups, survival rates and the number of exports, increasing international recognition for Irish businesses and higher levels of innovation will create a healthy climate for small businesses to flourish in the domestic and foreign markets.</P>
      <P>The EU has a combined population of over 500 million citizens.  Ireland is lucky to be part of this incredible international market and this should be taken advantage of by small businesses looking to expand abroad.</P>
      <P>It is positive to see the Government&rsquo;s National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 will aid economic recovery while simultaneously improving the economic situation of small businesses.  It is of paramount importance that we create increased certainty and a more positive disposition by the banking system towards small businesses.</P>
      <P>The report&rsquo;s immediate short-term proposals for small businesses should be considered by all businesses, for example, actively improving cashflow, seeking advice, managing development and accessing the current information from the correct sources.</P>
      <P>The proposal to create a web portal that would provide a one-stop-shop facility for business managers is a very worthy proposal and would centralise information for business managers.  Also, the proposal to promote a start-up business course would give young buddingentrepreneurs the confidence and the skill-set to conduct best practice in business from day to day.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I strongly support the commitment within the EU-IMF deal to provide for a new structure of non-judicial debt settlement enforcement system that provides the alternative to courts.  This needs to be advanced as a matter of priority.  I note Senator Quinn has a Bill before the House, and I welcome it.  Where small businesses are owed money or are sub-contracted by bigger contractors, it is important that the small businesses are paid.</P>
      <Col N="578" />
      <P>I agree also with Senator Kelly&rsquo;s view on the issue of rates.  I have been contacted by persons who are paying enormous amounts in rates and who are not able to continue to do so, and it would mean that they would have to close their doors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu">
      <NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, is here today because he has a practical knowledge and hands-on experience of his portfolio.  That is exceptionally important in any debate.</P>
      <P>Likewise, listening to Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, I found it inspirational.  It is an argument in favour of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  When somebody comes in from the coalface or the factory floor, whatever way we want to put it, and speaks such common sense, it is a great pity it is not being disseminated out into the general public.  I only wish that we could do something about communication.  I missed the contribution of Senator White who comes from the same background but with Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, I was exceptionally impressed, not only by her passion but by her knowledge and practical approach.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien used one particular term which is very important to this debate, that is, joined-up thinking.  She is 100% correct.  Incidentally, the joined-up thinking is in the report.  What we now need is joined-up implementation.  As one reads through the report, it is quite evident that there are many players in this area.  When we talk about small businesses, it could be very easily misrepresented as insignificant businesses.  When one considers that there are 200,000 of those in the country employing 655,000, that indicates how significant it is.  In a negative sense, the fact that we lost 105,000 employees in small businesses in a two-year period, which is roughly 25% of the live register, is indicative of why we should be taking this debate particularly seriously.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I also accept that when we talk about small businesses, there are diverse businesses of all sizes.  Many of the ones I have mentioned have fewer then ten employed but there are others which are much bigger than that.  I met a hotelier recently who has a moderately sized hotel in provincial Ireland.  He said to me that by the time he pays his rates, water charges, insurance and all the other bureaucratic charges he must pay, and before he starts making &euro;1 for his family business and for those employed, his expenditure is &euro;250,000.  This is where the joined-up thinking must come in.  I am saying, not that every local authority should make a decision straightaway to cut the rates to commercial outlets by 20% or 30%, but that those who represent small businesses should have an opportunity of having an input before any rate is struck to explain the dilemma.  It is easy when one is striking rates to decide to add 10% as if one is getting it from a bottomless purse.  I made the same argument here on VHI charges.  It is a matter of adding on 13% or 14%, but we seem to forget that at the end of the line it is an individual who is paying.  That is very true of small businesses.  I understand that the Minister of State intends to act immediately on the recommendations contained in the report.  Some of these recommendations are exceptionally comprehensive but I wonder about their foundation.  While I do not want another quango or sub-committee to be established, a county or city manager is attached to every local authority.  If we lose 105,000 employees in one sector alone, these managers should be brought in for a discussion behind closed doors with the Minister in order that they are made to realise this cannot continue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The report acknowledges that the lack of credit facilities is the greatest challenge small business faces.  The average person will never understand how we can recapitalise the banks with billions of euro without a price tag.  I do not understand even though I listen to all the debates.  We better start understanding the issue, however, in order to find out precisely what is happening.  Some &euro;540 billion was given out by the IMF to approximately 500 banks on the understanding that the money would create growth.  The danger arises that the banks which <Col N="579" />borrowed that money at low interest rates will use it to improve their own balance sheets.  It is time to call in the bank managers and tell them their jobs have been saved because we kept their banks intact.  They kept us on a string by telling us different stories every week.</P>
      <P>The report will lead to nothing unless the message is understood that we are finished with the fudging and are dealing with reality.  I have great regard for the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and I know what he has achieved at the coalface.  He is the person to bring that message back to the Government.  We are at the end of the line.  If that message is not acted on we will be back here next year with a further 100,000 jobs lost.  We should reflect the concerns of practitioners in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a small business owner.  I employed as many as 30 people at one stage, although I now employ five.  I have raised my concerns with the Minister on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>One case I encountered involved a young lady who sought to borrow &euro;4,500 from her bank to purchase a car and was quoted an interest rate of 14.4%.  The interest on that loan amounted to &euro;1,758.  When her father applied to the credit union she was able to get a rate of 6%, with &euro;248 to be paid back over a three-year period.  That was my daughter.  I wrote to the regulator on the matter and he thanked me for informing him about it.  Rather than his thanks, however, I want to know what he intends to do about it.</P>
      <P>If we want to get money into the domestic economy, we must fund the good credit unions so that they can provide loans of up to &euro;50,000 for small businesses.  They will be able to supply money to the local economy.  The manager and staff of the credit union will know the person to whom the loan is issued.  I acknowledge they made mistakes but all of us did likewise.  I guarantee the money will be out there within a couple of years.</P>
      <P>My bank manager will tell me that I can deposit as much as I wish but I will not be able to take anything out.  My bread man and my vegetable man have told me their overdraft facilities have been removed.  Their suppliers are looking for cash upfront.  If I do not pay cash, they will not survive.  The banks are supposed to lend &euro;10 billion over the coming years.  However, they will have to contact some muppet or actuary in Dublin before they can grant credit worth more than &euro;10,000.  The person in Dublin will not be familiar with the person who is running the business.  All of us have made mistakes in terms of investing in property but how can we get our businesses up and going again?  In five years time I would probably employ 50 staff if I could get sufficient funding.  The banks do not intend to lend large sums of money.  The credit union structure is solid and efficient.  Credit unions will get the money moving.  That might be a solution for small businesses.  Kilrush credit union is offering loans of up to &euro;30,000 for upgrading tractors.  That is the kind of thinking we need.</P>
      <P>The regulator has a job to do but he announced in Cork that he would introduce a code of practice on mortgage rates.  Saying and doing are two different things.  It is no good to make the statement.  We can get the economy moving if we can supply small amounts of money into Shannon, Sligo or Westport.  We do not have to loan millions or billions of euro because &euro;10,000 will allow most businesses to tick over or buy new equipment.  Given that nobody is leasing equipment, how are businesses to purchase what they need to expand?</P>
      <P>A garage owner in my locality employs nine staff but he gets walloped with rates bills of &euro;9,000.  If we can reduce the cost of rates, insurance and legal fees by 10% to 15% and get money into the credit unions, we will have a great opportunity to turn things around.  The banks have no intention of putting funds into this economy.  This has been going on for almost three years.  Most of the people working in the credit unions do so on a voluntary basis, which means they have a lower cost base than banks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout">
      <NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
      <P>Many speakers have advised shoppers to go local.  As Senator Mulcahy noted, credit unions also know their local areas.</P>
      <P Just="Left">All of us agree that small businesses are vital to our economic growth and recovery.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, on a new initiative to generate thousands of jobs but we have had a succession of job creation plans in recent years and I fear there is a disconnect between what the initiatives seek to achieve and the management of the environment necessary for their fruition.  If we really want to create jobs and retain existing employment, we need to nurture the capacity of small and medium enterprises, which account for approximately 54% of total employment in Ireland, or 900,000 people.  Frustration in the sector is increasing as it is becoming more and more difficult to operate and survive.  One hears talk of death by 1,000 cuts and I do not propose to list the problems facing small businesses as many have been noted by other speakers.  The current cost environment compounded by the difficulties experienced by small and medium-sized businesses as a result of the lack of finance available from banks and late payments is wholly counterproductive.  In this respect, I fully concur with Senator Mulcahy.</P>
      <P>In preparing for today&rsquo;s debate I tried to obtain accurate figures on small businesses.  While ISME provides a great deal of reliable data on the sector, I was disappointed by the lack of official statistical data on small business.  The Central Statistics Office has not published its annual small business in Ireland report since 2009.  I am concerned that the absence of an ongoing system for tracking the number, size, costs, ownership and trends in small businesses is impeding the introduction of effective policies.  Will the Minister indicate from where the Government sources its statistics on small businesses?</P>
      <P Just="Left">While we all welcome the report of the advisory group and its blueprint for action, it should be noted that companies, whether small businesses or multinational firms, would not only have a report but would draw up an implementation plan setting out clear target dates and identifying which members of staff are taking the lead on various measures.  With regard to the advisory group report, which Department is taking the lead, what precisely will be done and who will have oversight?  These questions have not been answered as the report does not provide an implementation plan.</P>
      <P>When will a solid timeline be provided for the roll-out of each of the proposed initiatives?  In keeping with the small business Act for Europe, does the Government intend to keep the &ldquo;Think Small First&rdquo; principle at the core of its implementation plan?  What funding has been provided for the initiatives set out in the document?  How does the Government propose to advertise them?  How will their success be measured?  How will we ascertain whether the plan has been successful?  We do not need further plans; let us implement this one.</P>
      <P>I welcome the plain English initiative.  In the past week, we have observed the confusion caused by letters sent to older people by the Revenue Commissioners.  Plain English, for which Irish companies have won awards, is required and the State should adopt it.  How will the Government effectively implement the report?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RonanMullen">
      <NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>As we embark on another year, it is appropriate to take stock.  Before addressing the report of the advisory group for small business, I will comment briefly on the macroeconomic position.  As everyone is aware, the domestic economy is in a poor state and employment continues to decline.  Coupled with the latest international forecasts showing downgraded growth prospects in key export markets, this must give all of us, especially the Government, cause for great concern.  Our trade with global markets has been our saving grace.  Without it, the economic decline would have developed into a sustained economic depression with reductions in growth of more than 10% per annum.  The weaker economic conditions in Europe will result in Irish export growth falling short of previous expectations.  A report from National Irish Bank, for example, suggests exports will grow by only 4.5% this year, down from an earlier estimate of 5.5%.  It is important to keep in mind the macroeconomic position to ensure we are able to see the real problems facing the country in their proper context.  As the international economy continues to show weak growth, we cannot be confident the domestic economy will recover in the short term.</P>
      <P>The advisory group report identifies 12 areas for action.  I will not discuss each of them in the limited time available but will focus on two issues, namely, access to finance and labour market costs and flexibility.  We constantly hear that access to finance and credit lies at the heart of the difficulties facing businesses.  We focused extensively on the measures the previous Government took to restructure and recapitalise the banking system to ensure it provides for substantial new lending in the economy.  However, we have not yet seen new finance reach the businesses that desperately need it.  Only today, I spoke to a gentleman in the restaurant business who has reached the point where his business is turning a small profit but is crippled by debt.  Having initially approved loans to allow him to refurbish his premises and get going, his bank later pulled back.  The restaurant owner, who had gone in hope in the meantime, now finds himself with heavy debt and experiencing great difficulty accessing credit, despite being in a position to make a go of his business.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Before Christmas I discussed with the Minister cases where Revenue was putting the squeeze on companies.  Even where banks were willing to provide a lending facility or lifeline for a couple of years, Revenue was foreclosing, as it were, on the companies in question.  I wonder about the short-term thinking displayed by the banks and, on occasion, the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s proposals under the jobs initiative include a commitment to ensure the Financial Regulator will rigorously monitor banks&rsquo; activities to ensure credit is available to borrowers who meet reasonable credit standard requirements.  Does the Minister of State have figures on the credit that has been made available to small and medium-sized businesses.  Unless we tackle the dire need for access to finance by such businesses, we will be in trouble.  I am aware of the work of the Credit Review Office which may challenge decisions by banks to refuse loans to businesses.  However, on 13 October last, the head of banking supervision at the Department of Finance stated that the Credit Review Office was the most under-utilised part of the financial system open to businesses.  How does the Government propose to increase uptake of this facility among small businesses?</P>
      <P>On the issue of labour costs and flexibility, while it may be unpopular to say this, we should not view the work being done in the area of unemployment regulation orders and registered employment agreements as the be all and end all.  I have no doubt this work will produce reductions in labour costs in the construction sector and some of the more labour intensive lower wage sectors.  It would be naive to believe, however, that it is only labour costs which hold back job creation in retail, hospitality and construction.  Market structure, a lack of con<Col N="582" />sumer demand, the availability of credit and, above all, the devastated personal incomes of people in employment whose taxes have increased and earnings declined are the main drivers of the problem of the lack of job creation in the sectors to which I referred.  While some people will regard the review of wage setting mechanisms as a priority, I am not sure it should be the highest priority.  We should at least be cautious about viewing labour protections as a barrier to growth.  An increasing number of voices in certain business and media sectors portray these crises as an opportunity to strip away labour market protections for the sake of flexibility, etc.  While I realise the importance of being realistic and reasonable and recognise that a balance needs to be struck, I am also concerned that the current trend may be misused.  For this reason, I urge the Government, in its zeal for reform, to avoid punishing workers unduly by removing hard-earned protections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The topic under consideration is the most important issue facing this country and one which the Government is taking seriously.  The jobs initiative is welcome but we need new jobs on the ground.  I am a parent of three children, two of whom have set up their own small businesses.  Our dinner conversation on Christmas Day was dominated by the directors of small businesses discussing the various things that could, could not or should not be done.  One of the issues discussed was the high potential start ups and the criteria used for defining same.  Perhaps a second leg could be added to the criteria given that it is ten employees with a turnover of &euro;1 million within three years.  There are many high potential start ups that would not have ten employees straight away but may have six, seven or eight.  That is an issue that would help the piggy in the middle bit of eight and nine.</P>
      <P>Many companies of high potential are seven or eight years old but because the regulation stipulates those less than six years old many are debarred from applying to be a potential start up.  Much has been said on the rates.  However, the review of the rates around the country is progressing at a snail&rsquo;s pace.  That it takes so long to do a rateable valuation is crazy.  South Dublin was the first to be reviewed after many years but it took a long time.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I received an e-mail today from a person in Tallaght which reads:</P>
      <P LI="1" Just="Left">I was in the process of starting a cr&egrave;che in Tallaght.  I had a lot of the groundwork done and was just waiting to work out a rental agreement.  That was until today.  When I rang the council, the small business rate I would have to pay would be &euro;8,083 per year which I would be required to pay the minute I open the doors, either paying this in one lump sum or monthly instalments of &euro;673.  I asked the council if we could do a different type of payment plan as it is a brand new business or a rate.  I want to pay my rates but not until I am six months into the business and then have a rate review &mdash; I was firmly told &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0" Just="Left">I find this very disheartening as my absence from my current employment would have created a job.  My business partner would have been signing off the social welfare and we anticipated employing at least two other staff from the social welfare who are qualified in child care by December of this year.  That is employment for four people that this business would have created.  However, due to those rates, those four new positions which could have been created will not be.  Is there anything you can do on this matter?  I would greatly appreciate it.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I will forward that e-mail to the Minister of State.</P>

      <P Just="Left">It is apt that we are discussing this issue but that is only one business out of 1,000 which are in that position.  One of the speakers recommended a holiday from rates.  I do not agree with that.  Businesses could be displaced by not requiring new business to pay up for six months. However, there should be an arrangement whereby when a business is three months on the road and has made a few bob it would be pointed out that it owes a certain amount of money.  If we are serious about this, four jobs could be created in Tallaght.  That will not happen if something is not done.</P>
      <P>In regard to access to public procurement for small businesses will the Minister of State make a statement on the changes made?  Given that public procurement businesses are put out in huge tranches it is much easier for small business to access these if they are cut down.  While there was an initiative to enable small businesses to export and do business in the BRIC countries I did not see anything about that in the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution.  Many small businesses are interested in the BRIC countries because they are the up and coming countries.  A flyer should go out to all small businesses on the initiative for the BRIC countries.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Many have spoken about the interpretation of EU legislation.  We always hear whether it is anecdotal or real.  If one were to sell fresh eggs, Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien referred to the 70 licences required.  Is it that we in Ireland are not noted for implementing the laws and doing it in accordance with the law for the EU?  It is clear that certain legislation should have been transposed into Irish law a long time ago. When it comes to selling food in Ireland we have a difficulty, yet the French can sell their cheese, wine and eggs in a different way.  I suggest that an analysis and an audit be conducted on the food commodities provided by small producers here and how that differs from the position in France.  The differences have been given as one of the reasons small businesses cannot sell their produce.</P>
      <P>We have had to adjourn the debate because of the amount of interest, rightly so.  One day for the debate would not be sufficient.  Everyone who has spoken has added much to the debate.  As another Senator noted, the Minister of State has taken copious notes.  If not this evening, perhaps he would come back with a follow-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly">
      <NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, I welcome the report of the special advisory group on small business.  In the midst of the current economic crisis anything that has the potential to create jobs must be welcomed.  This is likely to be a tough month and a tough year for business.  On 16 December, the CEO of Retail Excellence Ireland, in an interview on Newstalk said that a number of international retailers had privately told him they will be pulling out of Ireland in early 2012.  He also said that a number of smaller retailers were insolvent and would go bust.  In this month, the recession will begin to hit business hard and the effects of the budget will trickle down into the real economy.</P>
      <P>In reality, the report, following the budget, makes for frustrating reading for some of the authors.   It is called the Voice of Small Business but is there a danger that this voice will fall on deaf ears?  On the first page of the executive summary, in black and white, under Big Ticket Items, the primary demands and recommendations of the review group, as mentioned already, are listed as lending facilities and access to finance. It states that the fact remains that access to credit is the single biggest issue facing small firms today.</P>
      <P>Can the Government do anything about access to credit?  Of course it can.  The Government owns the banks and has the power and influence to direct them to increase access to credit.  The Minister of State said:</P>
      <P LI="1">In addition, the Government is committed to introducing a temporary partial credit guarantee scheme and a separate micro-enterprise loan fund to supplement normal bank lending and to provide additional lending where specific measures are warranted.</P>
      <Col N="584" />
      <P FLI="0">When will this happen and what is the timeframe for the implementation of same?  I recall the phrase &mdash;&ldquo;nearly never bulled a cow&rdquo;.  Businesses cannot function now on promises of availability of credit in the future.  They need access to credit now and the initiatives to be implemented as soon as possible.  Page 7 of the report refers to a targeted reduction in VAT in July and encourages firms to pass on the reductions.  However, such a reduction has been wiped out by the 2% increase in VAT announced in the budget.  This could exasperate the unnatural fluctuations in prices in the Border region.  We should seek to bring the VAT rate closer to that in the North and harmonise the tax rates rather than the opposite.</P>
      <P>Many businesses in the State, particularly in Dublin, are crippled with extortionate rates.  It is incredible that the Government has effectively ruled out doing anything to adjust upward only rent reviews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite">
      <NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot do it; it is unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly">
      <NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">This would have been of significant assistance.  It is in the programme for Government, yet the Government has ruled it out.  It has said that legal opinion on the issue is that it cannot be done.  However, many in the legal profession dispute this, correctly so.  We need solution-based governance and more &ldquo;is f&eacute;idir linn&rdquo; in the current climate especially in respect of small businesses.</P>
      <P>Opportunities to create jobs have been passed up given the slashing of the capital expenditure programmes.  This has had huge consequences for small businesses whereas it might have been the basis for creating employment.  The role of broadband is a perfect example.  As the report notes, competitively priced and high quality broadband are essential in today&rsquo;s business world.  However, rather than invest in broadband in a serious way we are cutting back the broadband expansion programme.  Investment in this area would have created employment and would have been an investment in business infrastructure making Ireland a more attractive place in which to invest.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the report deals with local authority structures at length.  Local government has a responsibility to progress economic development.  Section 4 refers to seeking measures to reduce local authorities&rsquo; dependency on commercial rates, allowing in the space to reduce the rates, but what has happened?  There was an astonishing &euro;190 million cut in local authority funding in the budget.  That is 84%.</P>
      <P>We keep hearing the priority is jobs but for many people, the priority seems to be austerity.  Austerity is not the only way and we should not just rely on that.  We cannot look at the supply side only when talking about business, whether medium or large.  Many Members are at the coalface of business but I am a consumer and know that if my income is slashed, I will not spend it in the local economy and will save my pennies for the rainy day when I cannot pay a bill or I must pay a mortgage, if I have one.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We must consider the demand side much more.  Since demand for many goods has dropped considerably, we must reintroduce it into our considerations.  The more money we take out of people&rsquo;s pockets, the less money they have to spend on goods and services.  As Senator van Turnhout said, we need to see the Minister of State and the Government take on this report now.  As the reality is that everyday small businesses close, time is of the essence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte">
      <NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the opportunity to speak.  As someone in the small business sector, I would like to make a contribution.  When the Minister of State came to Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce in Donegal last year, he flagged the issue of small business, which is very important.  Many of the businesses in Letterkenny had a better <Col N="585" />than expected Christmas because of the fluctuation in the sterling exchange rate but that could have been different if sterling had been weaker.  The economy in Donegal is very dependent on fluctuations in sterling.  However, it was welcome that Letterkenny and Donegal got business from the North and that people from Donegal did not travel to the North as much.  However, we cannot sustain that.  Next Christmas the situation could be different and there could be traffic jams on Lifford bridge with people travelling to the North rather than in the other direction.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report.  Those operating in the domestic economy are suffering no matter what business they are in, whether it is retail or services.  Anything that can be done to help them, whether accessing finance or otherwise, would be welcome.  I agree that rent reviews should have been addressed.  If it is a constitutional issue, perhaps someone will take a case, although I do not believe we can wait for that to happen.  I heard on radio today that the cost of commercial units has dropped by perhaps 90%, which is an indictment on the level of building.  However, it opens up opportunities for small businesses to come into the market.  They may not have to pay rent for one or two years out of five years which could not have happened five years ago because rents were so high.  Perhaps there are opportunities for fledgling businesses to take off.</P>
      <P>The big issue is still accessing finance.  That is the problem.  No matter how good one&rsquo;s ideas are, one cannot do anything unless one has money behind one.  The banks must provide finance with whatever support the Government can provide.</P>
      <P>I am fearful for many small businesses unless the domestic economy kicks in.  Businesses in County Donegal which are exporting are doing quite well and I am sure that is replicated throughout the country.  However, I hope that can feed back into the domestic economy, that people start to spend again and that people can survive the humps they are hitting.  I would welcome any help.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s hands-on approach to this issue.  With his background, he is aware of the issues.  All parties in the Seanad have the same aim to get local businesses up and running.  It is not a political issue and contributions from all Senators are welcome.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune">
        <NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter.  I am glad the Minister is here to respond.  I raise the plight of 32 former workers at the Vita Cortex plant in Cork.  These workers were told last September that they were to be made <Col N="586" />redundant and that the company was to close its Cork operations &mdash; it also has facilitates in Athlone and Belfast.  As business was no longer viable, it was to be shut down and on 16 December, the workers would be made redundant.</P>
        <P>The workers were told that the owner of the company did not have the funding to pay redundancy.  It was known within the company that there was an account with &euro;2.5 million in it to pay redundancies.  However, the owner of the business is in NAMA.  It is a complicated story and I do not know enough about it.  Too many people have an opinion on it.  The company is in NAMA and this account has been frozen.  NAMA says this is on foot of an AIB loan for &euro;10 million.  Therefore, funding, which was always thought would be available, is no longer available.  The owner says he does not have any money to pay redundancies.  These workers are looking for 2.9 weeks per year of employment which is &euro;1.2 million in total.  It is not a huge amount of money in the overall scheme of things but it is a considerable amount for these individuals, many of whom have up to 47 years experience.</P>
        <P>Since 16 December, the workers have staged a sit-in in the factory.  They are operating in shifts and are sleeping there.  They are getting support from the local community as well as from union representatives, in particular SIPTU.  Their plight has struck a chord with people because they feel the workers were entitled to the money that was there but now the workers have been left without any redundancy payment.  I acknowledge that the owner of the plant has applied to the Department of Social Protection to make redundancy payments because he cannot pay it.  The matter is now with the Department of Social Protection.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact the Labour Relations Commission is to meet workers and representatives of the company in Cork with a view to trying to thrash out the issues.  The sit-in is now in its forth week and the workers are coming to Dublin tomorrow to stage a protest to highlight their plight.  These workers will not pack up shop.  They need some acknowledgement that their plight has been recognised and they will receive the redundancy payments due to them.</P>
        <P>Over the Christmas period, they felt they were not getting much information.  Today I raise their case in this Chamber in order that they will hear the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I hope they will get some comfort from it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  During the Christmas period the Government has been actively engaged with the plight of the Vita Cortex workers.  We want to ensure that the workers of the company are in a position to access any redundancy payments to which they may be entitled.</P>
        <P>The officials from the Department of Social Protection have been in contact with the company and have now received the relevant applications from it.  The online application was submitted on 22 December 2011.  Hard copies and associated papers were hand-delivered on 4 January 2012.  At all times, my overriding concern has been to ensure that the employees are paid the relevant redundancy payment in a timely manner.</P>
        <P>I am also determined to ensure that the company in question complies with its statutory obligations and its duty of care and responsibility for its employees.  Responsibility for the processing of claims under the redundancy payments scheme transferred from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Department of Social Protection in January 2011.  Senator Clune will appreciate that the legal aspect of employment law is a matter for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Department of Social Protection took on responsibility for processing claims in order to reduce a then very large backlog in the time it took to process claims.</P>
        <Col N="587" />
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of the redundancy payments scheme is to compensate workers, under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2007, for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy.  Under the redundancy payments Acts an eligible employee is entitled to two weeks statutory redundancy payment for every year of service, plus a bonus week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  Employees must have at least two years&rsquo; service to be eligible for a redundancy payment.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the social insurance fund, SIF.  It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to employees is then entitled to a rebate from the State of a percentage of the relevant amount.  Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department of Social Protection that it is unable to pay the statutory redundancy to its employees, the Department will make lump sum payments directly to the employees and will seek to recover the debt from the employer.  Naturally, the Department wants to ensure that these payments are only made when the company has proved its inability to pay.  To prove inability to pay, the employer must submit documentary evidence, including accounts, that this is the position.  Where the Department pays the lump sum to the employees, the Department will seek to recover the relevant amount from the company.  Where the employer has proved to the satisfaction of the Department that it was unable to pay the statutory redundancy, the Department will seek to recover the amount paid, less the amount of the rebate that would have been payable to the employer if the employer had paid the statutory redundancy payment to the employees.</P>
        <P>Where it appears to the Department that the refusal or failure of the employer to pay the statutory redundancy was without reasonable excuse the Department may either withhold any rebate to which the employer would otherwise have been entitled or reduce the amount of that rebate to such extent as the Department considers appropriate and in either such case the amount of the Department&rsquo;s claim against the employer may be increased accordingly.</P>
        <P>Straightforward redundancy claims submitted since October 2011 are generally processed for payment within six to eight weeks but this can vary considerably depending on the complexity of the claims.  Let me assure the Senator that the Department will do its utmost to ensure that statutory redundancy payments due to the Vita Cortex workers concerned are paid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune">
        <NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
        <P>I thank the Minister for her response.  I agree with her.  I was glad to hear her say that she will do her utmost to ensure that the redundancy payments are paid.  I suspect this will be a complex case.  As I mentioned, the Labour Relations Commission is meeting workers and representatives of the company next week.  Will the Department of Social Protection engage with the commission or is it under the auspices of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is the Minister in a position to give these workers an indicative timeframe?  She has stated that it takes from six to eight weeks generally but as this is a more complex case, can she give an indication on the expected timeframe?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">As the Senator has stated, this is a very complex case.  Everybody has great feeling and sympathy for the workers involved, who were given to understand by their employer and the company that a particular set of circumstances applied to them and then seem to have been confronted with an entirely different set of circumstances.  The intervention of the Labour Relations Commission is a matter for the parties involved, that is the company and the employees and their representatives, including the trade unions to engage in that process.  The Senator is correct that the labour relations process is a unit of the Department of <Col N="588" />Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Certainly I hope that process will assist in a solution.  The Department of Social Protection will do its utmost to ensure the workers get their statutory redundancy entitlements.  I stated that the applications were lodged by e-mail in December, just before Christmas and the hard copy format was lodged in the new year.  Clearly, while there may have been a great deal of discussions between the employer and the company employees, the employer generated the notifications received by my Department in very recent times.  When we get an application, we must examine it and clearly we would like to do the best for the employees.</P>
        <P>The employer in this case has very clear obligations and we will be looking at the claims being put forward by the employer, who will be required, as is the norm in this kind of case, to give verification and proof of whatever claims it makes about its economic capacity.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Before I call Senator Walsh, on behalf of the House, I extend a hearty c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to the newly appointed Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Costello, a former distinguished Member of this House.  We are individually and collectively delighted that his outstanding contribution to public life has been acknowledged.  We wish him well in his very important portfolio.  He is very welcome the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh">
        <NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
        <P>I join the Acting Chairman in congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, on his appointment.  As the Acting Chairman rightly said, the Deputy served with distinction in this House.  I had the privilege to serve with him on committees of the Oireachtas.  There is no politician more dedicated or committed to the cause of human rights and the well-being of citizens than him.  I wish him well on his appointment, which is extremely well deserved.  He will serve with equal distinction in his new position.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister of State to meet the Nigerian ambassador urgently with regard to the murders of Christians being committed in northern Nigeria.  As he will be aware, they are being carried out by a group called Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist group that has been conducting a campaign.  I ask the Minister of State to call upon the Nigerian Government to take effective and immediate action.  If it has not the resources to do so, it should seek external assistance to prevent the ongoing murder of Christians in the northern party of the country.</P>
        <P>Nigeria, as we all know, is a very populous country.  Some 50.4% of the population is Muslim and 48.2% are Christian.  It is, therefore, evenly divided.  Christians tend to be centred in the southern part of the country whereas there is a Muslim majority in the north.  The Nigerian President, Mr. Goodluck Jonathan, who is Christian, is endeavouring to contain the situation but the federal Government is probably somewhat inhibited because of corruption.  Steps taken are seen as ineffective, and disputes over oil price increases have led to unrest.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I could point to a litany of atrocities and murders.  They came to a head when Boko Haram, a movement styled on the Taliban, issued an ultimatum to Christians that they should leave the northern part of Nigeria within three days.  Since the expiry of the ultimatum, there were attacks in towns in four states in north-eastern Nigeria, leaving at least 44 people dead and hundreds of Christians fleeing to the south.  This has been corroborated by the Red Cross.  Gunmen with Kalashnikovs have targeted church congregations and mourners at some events.  Gunmen opened fire in a hall in Mubi in Adamawa state on Friday, where a group of Christians had gathered to mourn the deaths of those killed in an attack on the previous day.  The death toll in these attacks has reached 21.</P>
        <Col N="589" />
        <P>On Saturday, sect gunmen shot and killed two Christian students who were attending the University of Maiduguri in the nearby state of Borno.  Residents in the capital of Adamawa, Yola, said gunmen fired on Christians leaving church on Friday, killing eight people.  A shooting at a church service in north-east Gombe on Thursday resulted in the death of six people.  A Christian couple were shot dead on Friday in the Mairi ward of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state.  This is the nucleus of Boko Haram&rsquo;s violence, particularly since the uprising there in 2009.</P>
        <P>Boko Haram apparently means &ldquo;Western education is forbidden&rdquo;.  The group has claimed responsibility for a series of bomb attacks across Nigeria on Christmas Day, including one at a church near the Nigerian capital, Abuja, in which at least 37 people were killed and another 57 were wounded.  Last year the group was responsible for over 510 killings, according to press reports.</P>
        <P>It is appalling that such sectarian hatred and violence obtain.  Now that we chair the OSCE, and are seeking to be part of the human rights committee of the United Nations, it is important that we bring these abuses to the fore.  We have talked previously in the House about the murder of Christians in Pakistan and across the Middle East.</P>
        <P>It is important that a Christian state stand up and have its voice heard strongly in regard to a breach of the most fundamental of all human rights, the right to life.  I urge the Minister of State to play as constructive and vigilant a role as he possibly can in this regard.  It would not be remiss of us to call on the human rights organisations and NGOs in Ireland which have been relatively silent on this issue, and also the leaders of the Muslim community who have also been silent.  There are many Muslims in this State.  We could look to them; they are treated well and see how a modern pluralist society can function such that members of one religion can respect that of others.  We should be endeavouring to have them carry back this message to their own countries.  We should urge them to do so.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Acting Chairman and Senator Walsh for their kind remarks.  It is a pleasure to be back in the House.  We soldiered here at the same time many moons ago.  The Clerk Assistant who is present soldiered in those times also.  It is good to be here in this wonderful Chamber and to have the opportunity to respond to some of the Senator&rsquo;s issues of concern.</P>
        <P>This issue is particularly important.  I am aware of Senator Walsh&rsquo;s long-expressed concern for human rights in Ireland, Northern Ireland and throughout the world.  I am delighted, therefore, to have the opportunity to reply to his query.  The Government shares the serious concern about the recent violence in Nigeria.  We condemn all acts of sectarian violence against any section of the population, whether Christian, Muslim or otherwise.  It is essential that the Government of Nigeria fulfil its obligations to uphold the rule of law and ensure the safety and security of all citizens in all parts of the country.</P>
        <P>Recent weeks have seen a series of horrific bombings and attacks on civilian populations in parts of northern Nigeria.  Responsibility for these has been claimed by the fundamentalist Islamist group Boko Haram, as mentioned by the Senator.  The group has been waging a campaign of terrorist violence for several years, stepping up its activity since 2009.  The group has been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of civilians and members of the Nigerian security forces.  It is clear that Boko Haram operates as viciously against Muslims opposed to its views as it does against Christian communities.  Among its recent victims was a senior Muslim cleric.  It is also suspected of killing moderate members within its own ranks, including a leading figure who was involved in peace talks last year with former Nigerian President Obasanjo.</P>
        <P>It seems the most recent Boko Haram attacks were deliberately timed to coincide with Christmas, targeting Christians and their places of worship.  Approximately 50 people were <Col N="590" />killed when bombs exploded outside St. Theresa&rsquo;s Catholic church in Madalla in Niger state, just 40 km from the centre of Abuja, Nigeria&rsquo;s capital city.  In other areas, churches were attacked, and worshippers and security personnel were killed.</P>
        
        <P>There were also serious attacks against Muslim communities and symbols, some apparently in reprisal for the Boko Haram violence.  On 27 December, a bomb was thrown at an Islamic school in the Niger Delta state, in southern Nigeria.  This left six children injured.  There have also been threats of further violence issued by some militant Christian leaders and groups, with a fresh report in recent days of an attack on a mosque in southern Nigeria.</P>
        <P>The latest violence has, rightly, been widely and unequivocally condemned both within Nigeria and internationally.  Senior religious leaders, including important Islamic leaders from across Nigeria, have also strongly condemned the attacks.  The attacks were also quickly condemned by the European Union High Representative, Baroness Ashton, speaking on behalf of all EU member states, including Ireland.  In her statement, the High Representative described the attacks as &ldquo;cowardly&rdquo; and condemned them in the strongest possible terms.  Similar expressions of condemnation were issued by many world leaders, including the Pope, who referred to the attacks in his new year message, stressing that such violence can never be justified on religious grounds and that it is, in his words, &lsquo;the antithesis of religion&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Boko Haram recently issued an ultimatum giving Christians and southerners living in the north three days to leave the region.  This type of intimidation is unacceptable, and indicates Boko Haram&rsquo;s strategy, which is to terrorise opponents and moderates in its northern strongholds in order to try to achieve control of increasing amounts of territory in northern Nigeria.  Ultimately, its aim is to gain power, through violence, in all of Nigeria.  During 2011, in Abuja, Boko Haram bombed Nigeria&rsquo;s police headquarters in June, and was responsible for the suicide car bombing at the United Nations headquarters in Nigeria which killed a large number of UN officials and civilians in August.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Nigerian Government faces a difficult challenge in responding to the threat posed by Boko Haram and is also facing the challenge of dealing with a number of other security threats, including from insurgents in the south of the country.  On 31 December, President Jonathan declared a state of emergency in four states and pledged that the Government would defeat Boko Haram. However, he has also acknowledged that Boko Haram is a strong and dangerous enemy and that it may have infiltrated the country&rsquo;s administration and security agencies. </P>
        <P>Ireland has an embassy in Abuja and our ambassador and his team there are monitoring developments closely and maintaining ongoing contact with the EU and other counterparts.  The EU has expressed solidarity with the Nigerian authorities in its efforts to combat all forms and sources of terrorism in that country.  Ireland fully subscribes to this position and we urge the Nigerian authorities to use all legitimate and lawful means to investigate acts of terrorism and violence, to bring the perpetrators to justice and to prevent further such acts in the future.  We continue to monitor developments closely, through our embassy in Abuja and in consultation with our EU partners and the Nigerian authorities.</P>

        <P>I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive response.  It clearly indicates that the concern is shared, as it should be, across all civilised society and civilised countries.</P>
        <P>Would the Minister of State be prepared to visit?  I note that we are monitoring the situation.  Rather than merely depending on the EU and Ms Ashton, who, I am sure, will pursue it, it would be good if we were to express the concerns directly with the Nigerian ambassador &mdash; I <Col N="591" />am sure the concerns I express would be supported unanimously, probably in both Houses &mdash; and perhaps urge that the Muslim community have its voice heard.  There is a need for the reasonable moderate voices within the Islamic religion to be articulated strongly on their position on these crimes.  That might be of some influence.  I am glad to note that that is happening and also that the Christian leaders in Nigeria are coming together for dialogue with the Muslim leaders with a view to trying to find a cessation and termination of the problems there.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I certainly have no difficulty in meeting the Nigerian ambassador and discussing the matter.  These are acts of terrorism.  As I stated, they are perpetrated not only against Christians but, particularly, also against moderate Muslims.  This has a wider thrust in terms of political targeting and the policy that is being operated by Boko Haram.  There is a much wider agenda than simply vulnerable groupings and communities that it is targeting, particularly around Christmas time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the first instance, obviously, responsibility rests with the security forces and the Nigerian authorities.  There has been no request to the international community from the Nigerian authorities to intervene or participate in a particular way.  We participate, as does the European Union and the international community, with a considerable amount of aid to Nigeria that is provided in many forms.  The European Union is particularly involved in that regard.</P>
        <P>We will continue to monitor the situation.  I will issue an invitation to the Nigerian ambassador to come and talk to me.  Under our chairmanship of the OSCE, we intend to have an international meeting dealing with religious tolerance.  That would also be a good opportunity for us to raise those issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout">
        <NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I raise the issue of stroke rehabilitation services.  An estimated 10,000 people will suffer a stroke in Ireland in 2012 and approximately 2,000 will die as a result, making strokes Ireland&rsquo;s third biggest killer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Stroke is the single biggest cause of severe disability and up to 50,000 people are living in communities with disabilities as a result of a stroke.  In September 2010, the Irish Heart Foundation published the &ldquo;Cost of Stroke in Ireland&rdquo; report, which was compiled by the ESRI, which showed that the wider availability of stroke units and clot-busting treatment countrywide would reduce the number of deaths and cases of permanent severe disability from stroke by at least 750 a year.  It would save the State approximately &euro;230 million in the next decade, mainly due to the reduced need for nursing home places.  These findings were accepted by the HSE and the Government and specific funding was provided by the HSE&rsquo;s 2011 service plan to pay for extra consultant, nursing and therapist posts to deliver significant improvements to acute services.</P>
        <P>The report also painted a stark picture of the deficits in community rehabilitation facing stroke survivors after their hospital treatment has been completed.  No action has been taken to rectify these deficiencies.</P>
        <P>The ERSI calculated that the direct annual cost of stroke is up to &euro;557 million, of which as much as &euro;414 million is spent directly on nursing home care.  However, only &euro;7 million is being spent on community rehabilitation services that could keep more of Ireland&rsquo;s 50,000 stroke survivors living in their own homes and, thereby, improving their quality of life and also reducing costs.  In effect, the vast majority of money for stroke is spent after the point at which it could help people the most.  An average of less than &euro;140 is spent on the rehabilitation of each <Col N="592" />stroke survivor which is only sufficient to pay for a couple of physio sessions each year for people with often very complex physical, communication and psychological needs.</P>
        
        <P>As no doubt the Minister will be aware, the National Audit of Stroke Care, which was also carried out by the Irish Heart Foundation, looked at the extent of effects of stroke on people.  It showed that almost half had a weakness on one side of their body, 22% were unable to walk, more than half needed assistance with activities in their daily life, 32% have depression and a further one third have cognitive impairment.  That clearly shows that, more than any other disease, stroke can strip away people&rsquo;s dignity and make them dependent on others, often to carry out basic personal tasks.</P>
        <P>The improvements to acute services are saving lives but we cannot ignore the quality of life of survivors when their hospital stay has come to an end.  In addition to the human implications, it does not make economic sense.  That is what surprised me when I looked at this issue.  This is not about increasing funding.  This is about where we are placing the funding.</P>
        <P>Those who have had a stroke and their carers need to be able to access a range of services after they have left hospital.  Many stroke survivors will need further community based rehabilitation such as physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, clinical psychology, and nutrition advice and input.  Currently, few stroke survivors have access to this type of care and, therefore, their lives are dramatically affected.</P>
        <P>My questions for the Minister are whether he accepts that there is a clear case for the provision of rehabilitation services for stroke survivors and others with neurological conditions and that the provision of such services would be cost effective.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, announced that there will be shortly publication of a neuro-rehabilitation policy, but will funding be provided for the implementation of this policy to accompany it?  If the funding is not provided, how will the policy be introduced and how will the suffering of stroke survivors and others in desperate need of rehabilitation be alleviated in the years to come?  Does the Minister intend to support the carrying out of research into the cost benefit of rehabilitation to follow up on the Irish Heart Foundation&rsquo;s Cost of Stroke in Ireland report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
        <P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, who unfortunately cannot be here.  She sends her apologies.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to the Senator for providing me with the opportunity to speak on the subject of rehabilitation services for stroke survivors and those with neurological conditions.  Let us start by declaring the key objective of rehabilitation which is to enable the person concerned who has survived grave personal events such as stroke to achieve the highest possible level of independence.  Desired outcomes range from a return to full independence in social and work activities to a person requiring long-term support and care but with a higher level of independence than in the absence of rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>With this in mind, let us now turn our attention to developments in this important area.  In June 2010, Changing Cardiovascular Health: Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010-2019 was launched.  This policy establishes a framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases which seeks to ensure an integrated and quality assured approach to their management so as to reduce the burden of these conditions.  It set out a model for stroke care, including rehabilitation through an integrated service.</P>
        <P>The national stroke programme was initiated in June 2009 to help lead and co-ordinate the development of stroke services in Ireland.  It now operates under the auspices of the programmes directorate of the HSE and the special delivery unit of the Department of Health.  The priority of the programme in the first 12 months was the development of acute stroke services, <Col N="593" />namely, to manage better, in the first few hours, patients who have just suffered a stroke in order to reduce mortality and disability.  While implementing these interventions, the HSE has been collecting data and developing plans to improve the treatment in the second rehabilitative phase of people&rsquo;s care.</P>
        <P>In addition to new appointments, the HSE has established two pilot early supported discharge projects in north Dublin and Mullingar-Westmeath to facilitate more rapid discharge of stroke patients from hospital and allow them to receive some of their therapy in their own homes.  In addition, and depending on the result of the two pilots and resources being available, it has plans for up to six more early supported discharge teams in populated areas.  It has also completed the largest survey of community rehabilitation in Ireland in 2011, especially in respect of stroke care.</P>
        <P>The HSE has also started a programme to up-skill nursing and therapy staff in hospitals and plans to extend this into the community in 2012.  It has commenced discussions with the rehabilitation, elderly care, rheumatology and primary care programmes to try to better co-ordinate the rehabilitation services across Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator also raised the question of the provision of rehabilitation services for others with neurological conditions.  Last December, the Department of Health published the report of the working group on the development of a national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services.  The report entitled, National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015, recognises that given the current economic climate, the focus in the short to medium term must be on reconfiguration of services, structures and resources and the enhancement of the skills and competencies required to meet the changing context.</P>
        <P>In this context, the clinical strategy and programmes directorate of the HSE, as part of its development of clinical care programmes, has established a rehabilitation medicine programme led by a team of national experts.  The three main objectives of the rehabilitation medicine programme are to improve the quality of care, improve access to services and improve cost effectiveness.  The HSE has appointed a clinical lead in respect of the rehabilitation medicine programme.  The HSE is committed to work with the rehabilitation medicine programme to support the development of an implementation plan based on the recommendations of the national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services.</P>
        <P>The focus for service development in the first three years of this policy and strategy will be: network development; integration of services; development of protocols that will have mandatory compliance across the delivery system; reconfiguration of existing resources; achieving greater cost-effectiveness through the development of greater competencies by those tasked with delivering services; increased teamwork using interdisciplinary approaches; and more inter-agency collaborative working.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many references have been made throughout the report to the need for an intersectoral approach if the full continuum of care is to be addressed.  The development of joint working or interagency protocols are a key requirement and will be central to its implementation.</P>
        <P>We face a challenging environment but with the commitment of all to our care programmes, we can achieve much in order to improve rehabilitation services so as to minimise the burden of stroke and other conditions and to promote a return to independent living and fuller participation in society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout">
        <NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
        <P>The reality is that funding is directed at primary care.  The Irish Heart Foundation&rsquo;s Cost of Stroke in Ireland report clearly shows how we can save money, which apparently is what we are about, and place the survivor at the centre.</P>
        <Col N="594" />
        <P>We take such a medicalised approach to health issues to the detriment of our health.  I have seen this with stroke survivors.  They need basic, simple things; it is not all about taking a medicalised approach.  I know the Minister of State is not putting that forward but we always get a medicalised response.  This is about people and we must have a human response.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report should be considered and we should put stroke survivors and those with neurological conditions at the centre and have rehabilitation care in the communities in which they live.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>

        <P Just="Left">T&aacute; creat rial&aacute;la chomhth&aacute;ite l&aacute;idir ag &Eacute;irinn a spreagann thaisc&eacute;ala&iacute;ocht do mhianra&iacute; at&aacute; freagrach agus a dh&iacute;r&iacute;onn ar fhorbairt a chla&iacute;onn le prionsabail na hinbhuanaitheachta.

Minerals exploration and development is regulated through a comprehensive set of legislation, mar a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir.  The Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999 apply to mianra&iacute; at&aacute; in ainm an St&aacute;it agus at&aacute; in ainm daoine pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha.  This is managed through the issue of prospecting licences, and leases and licences for State mining facilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All exploration for minerals in Ireland is undertaken by private enterprise under licences granted by the Minister.  Faoi l&aacute;thair, t&aacute; 558 cead&uacute;nas ag 40 comhlacht.  Cuirtear na cead&uacute;nais ar f&aacute;il i dtosach ar feadh s&eacute; bliana, agus d&eacute;antar athbhreithni&uacute; orthu i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  These prospecting licences can be renewed for a further six years and subsequently for terms of one or two years, depending on circumstances.  B&iacute;onn muid i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag faire ar conas at&aacute; ruda&iacute; ag dul ar aghaidh chun a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil an m&eacute;id airgid go gcaitear a chaitheamh &aacute; chaitheamh agus go bhfuil d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar na haidhmeanna eile at&aacute; leagtha s&iacute;os.  T&aacute; thart ar 60% de mhianra&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann in ainm an St&aacute;it faoi l&aacute;thair.  The Minerals Development Acts cover a wide range of minerals but exclude stone, sand, gravel and clay, and petroleum and natural gas.  N&iacute;l na ruda&iacute; sin faoi bhr&aacute;id an Achta &oacute; thaobh an St&aacute;it de.</P>
        <P>The main focus on exploration in Ireland is on zinc and lead, but there is also interest in gold and base metals.  There is active promotion of minerals in Ireland to attract new investment.  Data on exploration continue to be made available free of charge to incentivise exploration activity.  Cuirtear tuairisc&iacute; faoi conas mar a chuaigh ruda&iacute; ar aghaidh sa tr&eacute;imhse is d&eacute;ana&iacute; faoi bhr&aacute;id an Oireachtais gach s&eacute; mh&iacute;.  Regardless of ownership, the exclusive right of working minerals is vested in the Minister under the Minerals Development Act 1979, with the exception of a small number of mines of privately owned minerals that were already in operation in 1978.  This is the key point.  The minerals in question are registered as &ldquo;excepted minerals&rdquo; in accordance with the Act, subject to a right to compensation to private mineral owners when the minerals are extracted.  The term &ldquo;excepted minerals&rdquo; relates to minerals purely in private ownership that were being worked at the time of the statutory vesting under the 1979 Act and registered as excepted.  No State mining lease or licence is required to work these.</P>
        <P>The functions of the independent Mining Board, which was set up under the Minerals Development Act 1940, are to determine compensation in various cases and to decide what minerals are to be excepted from the State&rsquo;s exclusive right to work minerals under the 1979 Act.  Mar a luaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir, section 16 of the 1979 Act provides that the Mining Board may be requested by the Minister to satisfy itself in accordance with the Act that minerals are not being worked or not being worked efficiently, with a view to cancelling the registration of minerals as excepted minerals under section 14 of the Act.  I am advised that this provision has never been acted upon by a Minister.</P>
        <P>An application for a prospecting licence under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999 was received on 29 December 2010 in respect of coil&eacute;ar marmar at Letternoosh, near Clifden i gContae na Gaillimhe.  Following a technical assessment of this application, the Minister&rsquo;s intention to grant a prospecting licence was advertised in <i>The Connacht Tribune</i> on 10 February <Col N="596" />2011.  One objection was subsequently received by the Department.  Following consideration of this objection, a question arose over the ownership of minerals in the townland concerned.  The matter was referred to the Mining Board for its advice on the matters raised.  I understand that representatives for the applicant have been in contact with the Mining Board.  I also understand that the operator of an existing marble quarry at Letternoosh made an application to the Mining Board in respect of the registration of excepted minerals.</P>
        <P>The issue, therefore, is not one of deciding on a prospecting licence application &mdash; it has evolved into a question of whether the application covers excepted minerals.  It is a matter for the Mining Board to make such a determination and this is awaited.  Mar is eol don Seanad&oacute;ir, the Mining Board is an independent body and its determinations are subject to appeal to the High Court.  Therefore, I do not propose to make a further statement on particular aspects of the case in question at this time.  I cannot proceed with the initial prospecting licence application until the Mining Board has issued its determination.</P>
