	<P>I have received notice from Senator Katherine Zappone that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the followingmatter:</P>
        <P LI="1">In view of the substantial reductions in the budgets of the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority since 2008, the need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to indicate if he is satisfied that the funds available are sufficient to ensure the new body will achieve &ldquo;A&rdquo; status from the International Co-ordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to make a statement on the future of the Garda station at Ballydehob, County Cork, and confirm that a garda will be stationed in Ballydehob to replace the recently retired garda.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ivana Bacik of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify the number of certificates of Irish heritage issued and paid for since the certificate of Irish heritage programme was initiated.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to clarify the reason AIB which is effectively in State ownership operates its corporate service division from outside the country, with a subsequent loss of jobs in Ireland, and has commissioned a non-Irish company to operate its visa terminal service.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Averil Power of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to advise on whether he has investigated the proposal for a monster sewage plant in north Dublin as per his commitment to Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 22 November 2011 and the outcome of that investigation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ag lorg ar an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna athbreithni&uacute; l&aacute;ithreach a dh&eacute;anamh ar ch&aacute;s Phobal Scoil Gaoth Dobhair (Uimhir Rolla 91409A) agus go dtabharfar aitheantas di mar scoil DEIS ar&iacute;s agus, lena chois, go nd&eacute;anfar scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; ar leith a thairiscint do scol&aacute;ir&iacute; Gaeltachta, mar at&aacute; luaite go sonrach sa strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Mooney of the following matter:</P>

        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Katherine Zappone, Denis O&rsquo;Donovan, Ivana Bacik, Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan, Power and Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Katherine Zappone, Denis O&rsquo;Donovan, Ivana Bacik and Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.  I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Paschal Mooney as the Minister has no responsibility in the matter which is one for the local authorities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will agree that this House has a good track record in upholding human rights and highlighting human rights abuses across the world.  In that regard, I am honoured to welcome to the Visitors Gallery Dr. Nada Dhaif, one of the Bahraini doctors sentenced to 15 years imprisonment by the regime in that country, simply for providing medical treatment for persons protesting for human rights and democracy.  I also welcome Professor Damian McCormack, Ms Sheila Dickson and Ms Tara O&rsquo;Grady from the Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti-Violence Organisation.  Since February 2011 the Bahraini Government has been cracking down on pro-democracy and human rights campaigners, including the many doctors who have, as is their right and duty, treated people who were tortured and beaten on the streets of that country.  This coming Thursday 15 of those doctors will undergo a retrial in a civilian court, many of them having already received sentences of between five and 15 years on the most spurious of charges.  It behoves this House &mdash; Members of all parties and none &mdash; to show its total support for the persons being tried on Thursday.  Will the Leader raise this matter with the Taoiseach and ask the Deputy Leader, Senator Ivana Bacik, to raise it with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade?  They should, in advance of Thursday, convey our absolute abhorrence at the manner in which medical professionals, many of whom received their training in this country, have been treated by the Bahraini Government.  I ask that our entreaties be conveyed directly to the King of Bahrain and senior Bahraini Ministers.  It is my understanding a new Bahraini ambassador was appointed last week who will work out of Britain but deal also with the Republic.  There is no time to delay on this matter in which we have an important role to play.  It has been discussed by the Seanad on previous occasions and groups within the medical community, with the exception of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, have come out very strongly against the measures taken by the Bahraini Government.  The silence of some in the medical profession and politics on this matter can only be condemned.  Will the Leader and the Deputy Leader give a commitment to me, Dr. Dhaif and her colleagues who are in prison and awaiting retrial this Thursday that they will urge their respective party leaders &mdash; the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste &mdash; to do their utmost to raise this issue directly with the King of Bahrain and his senior Ministers to ensure justice is done for the medics in Bahrain who are being persecuted for doing their duty?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien that I will convey his comments directly to the T&aacute;naiste.  I join him in welcoming Dr. Dhaif and her colleagues and commend their bravery in continuing to stand up for human rights and the right of doctors to perform their medical duties in Bahrain under enormous pressure.  As he observed, we have raised this issue in the House on previous occasions.  I assure him that we on this side, together with colleagues on all other sides, will do all we can to ensure the oppression in Bahrain is brought to an end.  Given that the final verdict in the trials is expected this Thursday, I agree that there is urgency attached to the matter.  It was only following international pressure that the trials were moved to a civilian court.  We must have more of that type of pressure brought to bear on the Bahraini authorities.  As the Senator said, there is a particular reason for us to do so, given the very strong links between Bahrain and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland which has been rightly criticised by many for its failure in the past to stand up for the rights of medics in Bahrain.  I hope we will see a greater degree of courage in that quarter.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader allow for a debate on the upcoming constitutional convention?  Like others last week, I very much welcome the setting up of the constitutional convention, the idea of which was put forward by the T&aacute;naiste, as Labour Party leader, at the Labour Party conference in Galway in 2010.  It is very much welcome that it will be made up of 33 elected representatives, but with a majority of 66 citizens, who will examine a range of issues.  The first two issues will be the voting age and the presidential term.  I very much look forward to the broader range of issues which will be considered by the constitutional convention.  Some very important issues will be dealt with.  It would be worthwhile if the Seanad was to debate, perhaps in parallel with the convention, some of these issues &mdash; for example, amending the clause on the role of women in the home, greater participation of women in public life and the role which gender sensitive parliamentary procedures can play in encouraging more women to come forward.  There are some very obvious things we in the Seanad can do to assist and support the work of the constitutional convention.</P>
        <P>We all welcome the Leader&rsquo;s announcement that the Orange Order has been invited to the Seanad on 3 July.  That is a remarkable and historic step and it will mark a historic day for the Seanad.  Next Tuesday will be another historic day for the Seanad with the Seanad Public Consultation Committee having a second round of hearings in the Chamber, this time on issues around cancer prevention.  This week we will have a debate on the report the Seanad Public Consultation Committee produced on the rights of older people.  This is a change in procedure and a real break with the more traditional procedures of the past in the Seanad and it shows the real value and worth of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Seanad is honoured today by the presence of Dr. Nada Dhaif in the Visitors Gallery.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has dishonoured the name of Ireland by its inaction and the fact it dismissed some of its graduates in Bahrain at the instigation of the Bahrainian authorities.  That is absolutely reprehensible and it should be held to account by public opinion for this.  Dr. Dhaif is a woman of quite exemplary courage.  There is a principle involved here, namely, that doctors are required by the Hippocratic oath to assist people, regardless of where they come from or what side they are on.  Doctors and nurses are neutral; they treat the wounded.  We had a horrible example in this country of Jean McConville who was murdered by the IRA simply for giving a glass of water to a British soldier.  That was her right as a human being.  We must make a strong protest, in particular in light of the fact that the motivation of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland seems to be to protect its investment of &euro;17 million.  That is not a sufficient reason.  The same is true of Britain.  It has said nothing because it is involved in gigantic arms sales to Bahrain and I am against that too.  I would like an end to the silence of the Irish Government on this matter.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise a matter raised last week by Senator van Turnhout and supported by others who commended the PSNI and the Garda for a series of raids on what were described as &ldquo;brothels&rdquo;, the action we were told was against trafficking and so on.  I am glad to say I entered a hesitation about this because in this week&rsquo;s <i>Sunday Independent</i> Jim Cusack, who is a very highly respected writer and who has been writing for a long time on criminal matters, indicated that as many as half of the residences raided in Northern Ireland were not brothels and had no connection with prostitution and that in some cases it was done with invalid warrants.  One of the apartments in which the door was smashed down belonged to a young woman journalist and her partner who is a barrister.  They had nothing whatever to do with prostitution.  In another case, a door was smashed down and the officer involved telephoned the young woman who owned the apartment at work and implied she was involved in prostitution.  She was rightly horrified.</P>
        <P>It is a very serious situation in legal terms for the PSNI.  I understand the Garda is embarrassed about this situation and is concerned about the publicity generated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Have you a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on this issue because it is very important we have one.</P>
        <P>The Garda has stated that, despite the claims about organised prostitution rings, etc., each one of the 100 locations in the Republic was associated with single, young prostitutes.  The record needs to be set straight.  While I acknowledge the Switch off the Red Light and the Switch on the Blue Light campaigns, I suggest we switch off the sanctimony in this House and address the real issues for the vulnerable women involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to address a matter in the newspaper this morning, namely, the statement by the ESRI that there are thousands of people who would be far better off on social welfare than working.  I take issue with this statement because, while one can sit down with a calculator and calculate a few facts and figures and argue the toss about a few bob either way, the reality is that people are better off working emotionally, psychologically, culturally, etc.  Even if it costs money to work, people are better off working.  I encourage every citizen who has the opportunity to work to do so and not to take any notice of any ESRI report that might suggest it is not worthwhile.  The culture of work is one to which I subscribe and in which I believe.  The vast majority subscribe to it.</P>
        <P>The Leader has endeavoured to have Ms Aung San Suu Kyi come to the House during her brief visit to the country.  Her visit this month is to be very brief.  Perhaps the Leader might issue an invitation to her to return to Ireland at some other stage to address the House.  It would be very appropriate, given the welcome presence in the Visitors Gallery of the doctor from Bahrain, Ms Nada Dhaif.  It is an honour to have such a distinguished person in our presence.  I suggest Ms Aung San Suu Kyi receive a formal invitation at some stage in the very near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, to come to the House to consider the broken promises made in the general election of 2011?  I refer specifically to the 50 cent charge for medical card holders, introduced in 2010 because of the financial conditions at the time.  The charge, capped at &euro;10 per month, brings in revenue of approximately &euro;27 million.  The Minister made a commitment to the electorate in regard to the charge, with which commitment people were very impressed.  Having canvassed in Roscommon-South Leitrim, I realise the waiving of the charge was regarded as very important among medical card holders.  They considered it very unfair and were very impressed by the commitment given by Fine Gael.  The people gave Fine Gael two seats in Roscommon-South Leitrim, although it now has only one.  The Minister said in the House at the time that he condemned the charge as it was aimed at the most vulnerable, sickest and weakest.  Suddenly they were very well and did not seem to be affected at all.  Obviously, they are no longer as weak, sick or vulnerable because the Minister has not withdrawn the charge.</P>
        <P>The Minister closed the accident and emergency unit in Roscommon County Hospital in the approach to its first anniversary after having made a clear, unambiguous commitment to keep it open.  He did not restore cancer services in Sligo, which matter was highlighted before and after the general election by my colleague, Senator Marc MacSharry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I want the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister for Health to outline to the House the reasons for his backtracking and somersaulting on these commitments and the betrayal of the electorate.  There will not be a by-election shortly in any of the constituencies in the South, but if there were, it would present a great opportunity for the Government to put its mandate to the people again and determine the result.  Fine Gael will not be given a seat in any by-election held between now and the next general election.  There is no other mandate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden should not presume what the people will do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Only for my party&rsquo;s support on the fiscal treaty it would have been beaten because there was certainly an opportunity for the people to revolt in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Conway in his sentiments about the ESRI report.  I have concerns about the ESRI report and the entire premise of it.  If some of the members of the ESRI had to live on what social welfare recipients get, they might take a different tack.  We should be concerning ourselves with how we make life better and how we make it easier for persons to return to work, and that should be the focus of our discussions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>Many Members would have been driving during the Joe Duffy show today and I do not know if any of them heard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;a deeply distressing horrifying interview with an elderly lady&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Appalling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;who borrowed &euro;2,000 from a moneylender and was to repay &euro;5,000 at the rate of &euro;100 per week.  The moneylender concerned kept her social welfare card and met her at the social welfare office each week when she went in to get her money.  She paid for more than 30 weeks.  On, I think, the 32nd week, she was unable to pay the entire amount and he threatened to break both of her legs.  She has already pawned her furniture and sold her jewellery, and is in a desperate situation.  Whether what that moneylender is doing is beyond the law is not really the issue in this circumstance.  This lady is terrified and is afraid to go anywhere near the authorities.</P>
        <P>This raises the following issue for this House.  We live in desperate times.  People are doing desperate things.  I would ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister responsible for consumer protection and financial regulation.  We, as a Government, have a responsibility to ensure vulnerable persons are not prey to the likes of this ruthless, abhorrent person.  The elderly lady cannot be the only victim of this man&rsquo;s activities.  The Garda in that location must be aware of that man&rsquo;s activities.  I ask the Leader to put it to the Minister concerned that we need a national public awareness campaign of the dangers for ordinary people to go to moneylenders.  We must have also a campaign highlighting the value of credit unions to the vulnerable.  This is a dreadful situation and there are many more vulnerable people out there in this type of situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.  We might need legislation too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> has a headline, &ldquo;Higher level paper [in mathematics] called disastrous, traumatic&rdquo;.  That was the experience of 10,000 students taking that paper yesterday.  The article contains a quote that, &ldquo;Students&rsquo; nervousness in advance of this exam paper was well-founded&rdquo;.  We have discussed this on several occasions in the House.  It is a major problem.  Is project maths working?</P>
        <P>Are bonus points a good idea?  Did that cause some of the tension yesterday?  As we have asked here, what do the bonus points solve?  They give an advantage to the 20% who had a qualified mathematics teacher at second level or those who could afford grinds.  We need to examine this on a much wider sphere than merely giving bonus points to students.  In Finland, I gather, a teacher must have an MA in the subject in which he or she teaches.  That is what we are trying to compete with and we need the co-operation of teacher training and mathematics departments.</P>
        <P>I would ask that the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sean Sherlock, who is working in this area and deserves our support, come to the House to debate this vital issue, not least so that we could support him in implementing vital reforms in the area.  We must bring teacher training in mathematics up to international standards and not have the disastrous and traumatic experiences described.</P>
        <P>In the interests of balance, the <i>Irish Examiner</i> did not find that.  However, it is an issue that is worth our debating here.  I note how concerned the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, is about it.  In fact, he launched initiatives recently to try to make up for our national problems in mathematics teaching.  It is an issue that would be well worth debating in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien in welcoming our Bahraini visitors to the House and support the call for justice for the medics who are to go on trial later this week.  I am sure the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste would very much support the call being made in the House today.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, on a humanitarian basis, I wish to call for a debate in this House on the worsening situation in Syria.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We are all appalled by television images night after night showing loss of life, torture and the murder of innocent children in Syria.  We are seeing man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man at its very worst.  It is becoming apparent that the peace plan of UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, is not working despite the best efforts of his peace envoy, Mr. Kofi Annan.  As many commentators have noted, there is a real danger that should there be a sectarian civil war in Syria, it could be as bloody as what happened in Bosnia in the 1990s.  The efforts of the international community are totally insufficient.  Given that Ireland has some experience in resolving sectarian conflict, holds the chair of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and will assume the Presidency of the European Union in January, it would be appropriate for the House to discuss this pressing issue.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will be aware of the strength of feeling in the Seanad on developments in Syria.  We must do everything possible to bring about a peaceful resolution to the bloody conflict that has already claimed many thousands of lives and which will, if not resolved, result in an horrific, bloody civil war that could cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Dr. Nada Dhaif to the Gallery and offer my party&rsquo;s support to the medics in Bahrain who are facing trial.  I hope they will receive justice.  I also concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and others on this issue.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on poverty, an issue Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and I have raised on a number of occasions in recent months.  The third anniversary of the abolition of the Combat Poverty Agency, an organisation which measured poverty and studied its root causes, will take place on 1 July.  The agency did a great service to people who were suffering as a result of poverty.</P>
        <P>A number of important reports have been published on poverty recently, including one by Focus Ireland which shows that approximately 5,000 people are homeless at any given time, 100,000 households are on social housing waiting lists and one in seven of those using homeless services are children.  Another report entitled Understanding Childhood Deprivation in Ireland published by the ESRI found that in 2010, 8% of children were in consistent poverty, 30% of children lived in households which experienced some form of deprivation and one in five children had reported going to bed hungry.  That is the reality faced by many children and families.</P>
        <P>I concur with the comments made by Senators Hayden and Conway on another ESRI report which tracked low-income families and linked their earnings with potential social welfare payments.  While I do not generally defend the ESRI, it is not the case that its report advocates that people should not work.  We can disagree with the formula used in its calculations but I agree with the ESRI that many people are being driven into the hands of moneylenders.  If we were to hold a debate on poverty, we would have to conclude that Government policy has consequences for individuals and families and budget decisions are driving more people into poverty and into the hands of moneylenders.  We must ask why people are being forced to avail of the services of moneylenders in the first instance.  The answer is that Government policy is emptying their pockets.  Many low-income families are experiencing serious difficulties because their pay is so low.  There is a genuine need for the House to have a debate on poverty.  Given the abolition of the Combat Poverty Agency, the House could play a useful role in analysing the causes of poverty and proposing measures that could prevent people falling into poverty in the first instance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the doctors who join us from Bahrain and echo the sentiments on the issue expressed by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and other speakers.</P>
        <P>I welcome the introduction of the new central online system for student grant applications announced by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, this morning, which went live today.  In the past, students and their parents had to submit grant applications to their local authority or nearest vocational education committee.  The process was not centralised and each authority or VEC applied its own criteria.  The new system, known as Student Universal Support Ireland, or SUSI, will process all applications for student support and distribute payments to students for the coming academic year.   It is envisaged that this process will be much quicker and easier to use and end the long delays encountered by students.   Not only will the process be more beneficial to students, it will also save the taxpayer approximately &euro;5 million once the transition is complete.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the publication of the draft report on symphysiotomy, for which I have called on several occasions in the House.  It was prepared by Professor Una Walsh and will be the subject of a consultation process between now and 13 July, the final date for receipt of written feedback.  I ask my colleagues, if they know of any victim or interested parties, to alert them to the fact that the draft report has been published in order that they may submit responses which will inform the final report and ensure survivors of symphysiotomy will, I hope, receive redress and have closure for the dreadful act carried out on them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Senators in mentioning some high profile cases of illegal moneylending that have come to the fore in recent days.  I raised this issue some years ago as a problem in Sligo, while a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme was made about it in the past 12 months.  It is a serious problem that touches every community in Ireland, yet nothing is being done about it.  Some draconian measures need to be introduced by the Department of Justice and Equality, whereby a conviction can be secured by the sworn testimony of a Garda superintendent.  Everybody knows who the illegal moneylenders are.  Everybody knows where they are lending, how much they are lending and the damage they are doing to society.  Frankly, it is time the Government took action and introduced such legislation.  I ask the Leader to raise the issue specifically with the Minister for Justice and Equality in the hope that, once and for all, Irish society can be rid of the scourge of illegal moneylenders.</P>
        <P>We will bring forward a Bill in the early autumn to seek to bring down the maximum interest rate chargeable by legal moneylenders.  There are licensed lenders giving out unsecured loans and charging up to 200%.  When people are put under pressure to pay back the money at these rates, they are, in turn, forced to turn to illegal moneylenders.  As is often the case when independent Senators bring forward legislation, I hope this worthwhile Fianna F&aacute;il Bill will at least be accepted on Second Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the words of Senator Michael Mullins on the situation in Syria.  The fact that children are being used as human shields in war must make us all really cross.  We must stand together, as a House, country and Government, and use every ounce of our influence to have this stopped.  It is horrendous.  It is below awful.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to act urgently and use every ounce of influence Ireland has.  As we have always punched above our weight when it comes to human rights abuses, let us act now.</P>
        <P>I am shocked by the ESRI report which states thousands would be better off on the dole than in a job.  I hold the ESRI in the highest regard.  It is a State funded research institute, but is it propagating a social entitlement world?  I am not sure those in it fully understand what it takes to find a job.  People who stay at home do not have a hope.  Opportunity only knocks when they are outside it.  Many young people are in unpaid internships from which they are securing jobs.  I have created a number of jobs for young people in unpaid internships.  The matter is very serious.  If we look at a low paid job in a freeze frame moment, it might pay somebody to stay at home.  However, it is not about its low monetary value only.  It is about the future potential the opportunity provides, as well as the psychological and social value of a job to a person.  In every way it is better to work.  The Leader must look for an urgent debate on this issue with the Minister for Social Protection.  It is a serious report by a State-funded research institute.  I accept that there may be cost anomalies in the form of travel vouchers that might mitigate some costs but nothing militates against the value of a job.  I am pleased that the young people that were interviewed agreed with that.  However, I am concerned that this was a spin by the journalist or is it what the ESRI believes?  It is a serious statement and we deserve a response from the ESRI.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator O&rsquo;Brien and others have said in welcoming our Bahraini guests and to underline the importance of the Government not being silent on the issue.  I have mentioned in the past in the context of debates about China how there is a real danger at a time of economic pressure that this country would only consider issues through an economic lens.  There is a danger that our institutions and universities would fall into that trap as well.  It is important that we do not do so.  I support the calls on the Government to be clear on this issue, to intervene at the highest level possible and to apply pressure.  If our institutions are training medical personnel to work in other parts of the world then they have a duty to do whatever they can to ensure not just that their graduates abroad, but other people who practise in that field, are always respected, safe and treated as neutrals when they give the care to which every human being is entitled regardless of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P Just="Left">A relevant letter was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> the other day from Mr. PJ O&rsquo;Meara.  It made the point that while the Government has indicated its support for legislation to ban alcohol-based sponsorship of sporting events, we are still seeing such events being advertised and the announcement of forthcoming events.  As Mr. O&rsquo;Meara puts it in his letter, is it the case that the Government is happy to send out the message that it wants to end alcohol-based sponsorship of sporting events but is refusing to give us a timeframe?  It is important that we would hear from the Government on the issue and that we hear not just what it intends to do but when it intends to do it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins"><NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Seanad a matter I raised in the 2009 local elections when I ran as a candidate.  On that basis I seek that the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning would come to the House to debate the legislation on developers&rsquo; contributions.  Changes must be made to the rules and laws governing same, as right throughout the Celtic tiger era estates were popping up at almost the speed of light yet residents now find themselves without basic public services such as footpaths within their vicinity.  In particular I refer to the example of my home town of Athenry, County Galway.  I am aware that the trend is replicated right across the country.  In Athenry in particular we have a situation in the townland of Ballydavid where there are no less than nine estates which have no continuous pedestrian access to the town.  To exacerbate the problem there is a dangerous railway bridge located on a bend where pedestrians have to play cat and mouse with their lives against the traffic.  The lack of basic services is not just limited to the Ballydavid area.  In Raheen we also have a large number of recreational amenities in the area and yet no footpath leading all the way to them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins"><NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a matter of national importance.  To ensure that this never happens again it is essential that we legislate for a high percentage, if not all, of developers&rsquo; contributions to be designated for the area from which they are acquired.  It is essential for many reasons that people and towns benefit positively from development and, as a consequence, I call for a debate on the issue so that we can ensure that any future development in our areas will not come at a cost to our basic services and facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with previous speakers who spoke about the ESRI report.  The report concluded that four out of ten families would be better off, however one defines &ldquo;better off&rdquo;, on the dole, and that 44% of people with children are better off not working.  I do not want to be repetitive but from a psychological and social point of view it does nobody any good to be on the dole, sitting at home, having a reduced level of interaction with people and suffering  the loss of opportunities.  The list is endless as to the reasons people should be working and they could not be considered to be better off by being on the dole.  A debate covering this issue would be useful and I urge the Leader to ask the Minister, Deputy Burton, to come to the House for such a debate.  Perhaps we could be useful in putting forward suggestions or thrashing the matter out in ensuring this report is fully reviewed and discussed.</P>
        <P>I join in supporting previous speakers regarding the issue of moneylenders.  Vulnerable people are being treated in the way Senator Hayden described.  It is worrying that it is not shocking.  We hear of these types of instances all the time.  It is extremely disturbing.  I would welcome the introduction of legislation to cover this issue.  It is an issue the Department of Justice and Equality would have to prioritise.  There is a good deal happening in the Department, but this is an issue that could be put at the top of the list of priorities.  Linked to this issue is the area of debt collection.  It is another area that is quite unregulated.  Vulnerable people in similar circumstances are being approached by &ldquo;heavies&rdquo;, for want of a better word, who use threatening language&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice of welcome to the medics from Bahrain in the Public Gallery who are supporting their colleagues.  I support Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s request.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of diesel laundering.  This activity costs the country approximately &euro;150 million in lost revenue.  Illegal diesel causes many problems for motorists who use it.  When an agent is added to remove the dye from the diesel, it also removes the lubricants.  That damages the engines of cars.  If it is caught early, it can cost one up to &euro;2,000 but if it is not caught in time, it can cost anything up to &euro;16,000 to replace the engine in a car.</P>
        <P>This is a major issue.  Up to now we believed diesel laundering was prevalent in the Border counties but it has spread throughout the country.  It is to be found in every county and on the forecourts of petrol stations.  I request the Minister to redeploy more resources to the Customs and Excise and the Garda to deal with this problem and stamp out this criminal activity which has become a major issue.  The Leader might ask the Minister to come to the House in order that we can the debate what proposals he has to stamp out this activity.  Furthermore, it costs a great deal of money to clean up the sludge that is dumped following this laundering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like my colleagues, I would like to welcome the doctors from Bahrain and Ms Sheila Dixon, the head of the INMO, to the House.</P>
        <P>Members have spoken about illegal moneylenders but I want to speak about the legal ones, namely, to the two main pillar banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, which are struggling to meet lending targets of &euro;3.5 billion in new loans to small and medium-sized businesses.  Targets were set down for each lender and recently they have come forward for a second time to indicate they will not reach those targets.  The combined lending for small and medium enterprise loans during the first three months of this year was broadly similar to the figures for the first quarter of 2011 when they each had to sanction &euro;3 billion in new small and medium enterprise loans.  While I will concede that lending traditionally picks up in the second half of the year, it looks likely now that the Irish banks will not meet the lending targets set down for them by the Credit Review Office.  We must examine this issue.  I should not have to point out that credit is the lifeblood of small and medium-sized businesses throughout the length and breadth of the country and that they provide sustainable jobs.  The people own these banks and we should be dictating to them.  The banks are afraid to lend.  I know of businesses employing up to ten people which need between &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 to stay afloat but they cannot access this money, which is resulting in them going out of business and the unemployment figures increasing.  The failure of the pillar banks to lend money to Irish SMEs is costing jobs every day but we do not hear about it when only five or ten jobs are lost.  The SME sector comprises mostly small, viable, family-run businesses that are committed to providing long-term sustainable jobs in Ireland.  They need cash flow, not excuses.  The people who run them work up to 80 hours a week and they need cash flow.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Finance to the House to outline what measures are being put in place to ensure the pillar banks meet the &euro;7 billion lending target set for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Bahraini delegation and Ms Sheila Dickson from my town to the House.  The Seanad has a proud record which I have no doubt the Leader will deal with adequately in response to Senator O&rsquo;Brien.</P>
        <P>On the question of moneylenders, it is high time new legislation was introduced.  Will the Leader arrange to have the Minister for Finance before the House in due course?  There is no doubt, as has been highlighted, these unscrupulous, heavy-handed individuals should not be allowed to operate.  I take it they do not operate within the law and their rates are usurious. This matter must be dealt with urgently.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Sheahan regarding the pillar banks.  I was delighted with the recent report of the Credit Review Office and the credit reviewer, Mr. John Trethowan.  There are serious ongoing shortcomings.  I acknowledge the Minister for Finance will attend the House in early course but I have called previously for a specific debate on banking.  I do not know if that can be taken with the debate for which the Minister will be present but perhaps the Leader will address that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Like previous speakers I welcome Dr. Nada Dhaif from Bahrain and his colleagues and the members of the Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti-Violence Organisation.  Senator Crown and others have raised the issue many times in the House.  Today is not the first day the issue has been raised and I support Senator O&rsquo;Brien and what he has done today.  I am sure the Leader will respond in the positive.</P>
        <P>I seek a debate on auditors.  A previous speaker asked us to switch off the sanctimony.  I am not switching on sanctimony in asking for a debate on auditors because they happen to be in the news in connection with a certain politician in this House.  We are not talking about the elephant in the room but we must debate the role of auditors in examining businesses, banks, individuals and politicians.  When the banks&rsquo; auditors failed us, they were paid &euro;164 million.  The auditors to banks do not change often and we have seen where auditors have failed us.  They may fail individuals and I would like to know whether the legislation is strong enough in this regard.  The advisory group for institutional investors in England has urged a ban on non-audit activity because of the fear it compromises auditors&rsquo; independence and discourages them regarding the advice they might give an individual and what they may or may not report to the Revenue.  I would like clarification on this issue in the House.  Is our legislation strong enough to deal with auditors in order that if they spot something in the books of a company, individual or bank, they are obliged to report it?  If they do not report it, what are the consequences for them?</P>
        <P>In the late 1990s, two individuals working in banks blew the whistle internally but were forced out of their jobs.  I accept that the legislation on whistleblowers will address these issues.  However, I understand that Revenue investigations are conducted under a code of practice for Revenue auditors which sets out rules and procedures to be followed by officials in dealing with audits.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien in welcoming Dr. Nada Dhaif to the Visitors Gallery.  This House has already passed an all-party motion expressing our full support for the medical professionals who were sentenced to long periods in prison in Bahrain, in keeping with the Seanad&rsquo;s long tradition of supporting persons whose human rights are abused.  I assure the Senator and the other Members who raised this matter that I will convey their concerns to the Taoiseach later today.  I understand the T&aacute;naiste is currently out of the country, but I will raise the issue with his officials.  I accept the urgency attaching to the matter given that the retrials will take place on Thursday.</P>
        <P>Senator Ivana Bacik called for a debate in this House on the proposed constitutional convention.  I already gave an undertaking last week to arrange such a debate and will attempt to do so before the summer recess.  Senator Bacik also referred to the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, the first report of which, on older people, will be discussed in the Chamber next week.  The matter currently under discussion is cancer prevention, and we will have a full day of public consultation next week involving all of those who have made submissions in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator David Norris made several suggestions in regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  Perhaps the Senator will submit his queries for debate as an Adjournment matter, which will allow him to receive a reply from the relevant Minister.  That would be the opportune approach to take.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Martin Conway and others referred to the ESRI report on the cost of working in Ireland.  This is a welcome and useful item of research which broadens our understanding of the additional costs facing individuals when they avail of employment opportunities.  I agree with the observations made by Senators Conway, Aideen Hayden and others in regard to persons in receipt of unemployment benefit.  The role of the Department of Social Protection is to provide jobseekers with income support in the form of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  The conditionality associated with both of these schemes is that the individual must genuinely be in search of employment.  The great majority of people on the live register have a significant financial incentive to work, with some 289,000 of them, or 68%, having a total social welfare income of only &euro;188 per week.  While I acknowledge that individuals who have two or more children and are also in receipt of rent allowance or mortgage interest supplement may require a greater financial incentive than a person with no dependants in terms of availing of employment, it should be noted that this cohort represents only 3% of those on the live register.  The comments should, therefore, be considered in that context.  Perhaps we can arrange a date to have a discussion on that ESRI report in the near future.</P>
        <P>Senator Conway also raised the question of inviting Aung San Suu Kyi to the House when she comes back to Ireland.  We can certainly follow up that request.</P>
        <P>I am glad Senator Leyden welcomed the provision of the air ambulance emergency service last week which has already assisted several people.  I suggest to him that it is very dangerous to presume how people might vote in four or five years&rsquo; time.</P>

	<P>Senator Hayden raised the issue of unscrupulous moneylenders, which was also raised by Senators MacSharry, Noone, Sheahan, Paul Coghlan and other Senators.  It is a very serious situation.  As Senator Hayden mentioned, there is a need for a public awareness campaign to highlight the merits of the credit union movement which would prevent people from going to these moneylenders.  Senator MacSharry mentioned that legal moneylenders are charging exorbitant rates.  That is an issue I raised when I was on the other side of the House and I agree totally with him that there is a need for legislation to bring down significantly the rates charged by these so-called legal moneylenders.  I concur totally with Senator Hayden&rsquo;s remarks that a public awareness campaign should be undertaken and I will certainly approach the relevant Minister in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett raised the question of the higher level mathematics paper.  We heard various comments in regard to that paper yesterday.  Teacher training up to international standards is paramount.  The Minister for Education and Skills spoke in the House on training standards but we can invite back the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Sherlock.  He will be in the House to discuss the ASEAN-EU year of science, technology and innovation, and perhaps it could be raised in that debate.  If not, we can raise the matter in a specific debate on teacher training.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullins and other Senators referred to Syria.  Ireland has expressed, on a number of occasions, its absolute horror and revulsion at the recent course of events in Syria and at the escalating conflict which the UN estimates has claimed more than 10,000 lives in the past 15 months.  On behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, the T&aacute;naiste has condemned the appalling massacre in Houla on 25 and 26 May which resulted in the brutal murder of more than 100 people, including 49 children.  The Government has also condemned the mass killing of a reported 78 people in the village of al-Qabeer on 6 June, allegedly committed by Assad affiliated militias.  The atrocities provided further unwelcome testimony of the Syrian regime&rsquo;s utter disdain for human life and the welfare of its people.  Indeed, the use of children in war is a despicable practice about which we have spoken in this House on several occasions.  I can assure the House that the Government has made, and continues to make, representations in regard to this dreadful situation which we are witnessing in Syria and fully supports the UN in its efforts.  Kofi Annan has made efforts but the Government will continue to press for a solution to this dreadful problem.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane called for a debate on poverty, which we certainly can have.  We have debated the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 and the Minister for Finance will come to the House.  I can certainly try to arrange a debate on that subject, which I promised him last week.</P>
        <P>Senator Moran rightly highlighted the question of student grants.  The system is now centralised, which will ensure the delays of the past can be avoided.  The Senator also raised the draft report on symphysiotomy, which has been published, and encouraged people to come forward in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames&rsquo;s points on Syria and the ESRI report have been dealt with by me.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen referred to the banning of the alcohol-based sponsorship of sport and other matters.  We will try to find out the timeframe of the Government in that regard.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Cathaoirleach that the matter raised by Senator Higgins could and should be raised as part of the Adjournment debate, during which the Senator will get a more specific answer.</P>
        <P>Senator Noone referred to moneylenders and debt collectors.  I will raise the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  He will be present in the House today and, I can assure the House, on a number of other occasions over the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>I met the leaders today and gave them a draft of the business proposed for the next three to four weeks.  Spokespersons, in particular, will have an idea as to what we will be debating and an opportunity to prepare for the debates.</P>
        <P>Senator Moloney referred to diesel laundering.  Subversives, in particular, were formerly involved in this activity but they are still involved.  Fuel laundering is causing major problems for many motorists and the tax revenue of the Government has decreased as a result.  The cleaning up of sludge, etc., is also causing grave concern among many communities throughout the country.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities must pay for cleaning up.</P>
        <P>Senator Sheahan stated the targets of pillar banks in regard to loans for small businesses are not being met.  This is a matter of grave concern.  In the next couple of weeks, we will be dealing in the House with the micro-finance Bill and the Credit Guarantee Bill.  The Minister for Finance will be present in the House on 3 July.  There will be ample opportunity for the Senator to raise these specific and very important points when the Bills are being discussed and when the Minister is present in July.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan referred to moneylenders and banking.  As I stated, the Minister for Finance will be in the House for a general debate on the economy on 3 July.  If necessary, we can have a specific debate on banking also.</P>
        <P>Senator Keane referred to the role of auditors.  The bank auditors failed the taxpayers; there is no question about that.  We will have to find out from the relevant Minister whether our legislation is robust enough.  I assure the Senator I will raise this with the Minister.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 1</P>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo; &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; shall include for the purposes of this Act consensual, non-exploitative sexual activity where there is an age difference of not greater than two years between the parties;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister back to the House.  I also take the opportunity to welcome his decision to raise the minimum age of entry into the Permanent Defence Force to 18 years.  It is a hugely positive step in terms of children&rsquo;s rights in Ireland.  It will be welcomed on the international stage, given that we are advocating against the use of child soldiers.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister for initiating this extremely important legislation and engaging with and listening to the concerns of Members during the Second Stage debate on 10 May.  I commend the Minister on initiating this extremely important legislation and the clear commitment he showed during the Second Stage debate on 10 May to engaging with and listening to the concerns of Senators.  As I stated in that debate, I fully understand and support the purpose and intention of the Bill.  I have tabled only one amendment on an issue about which I wrote to the Minister on 29 May, namely, consensual, non-exploitative sexual activity involving parties where there is an age difference of not greater than two years.  This is a highly sensitive area and one which should be debated.  As someone who does not have a legal background, it took me a long time to draft the amendment and I remain open to discussing the possibility of finding a more appropriate means of addressing this issue.</P>
        <P>My main concern relates to sections 2 and 3 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 in Schedule 1, which deals with offences against children for purposes of an offence under section 2 of the Bill.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006, in sections 2(1) and 2(2) and sections 3(1) and 3(2), creates two offences of engaging or attempting to engage in a sexual act with a child, the first of which relates to the defilement of a child under 15 years of age, while the second relates to defilement of a child under the age of 17 years.  The Bill creates an offence of withholding information on certain offences against children and explicitly includes the two offences of defilement of a child.  Neither the 2006 Act nor the Bill before us makes a distinction between underage consensual peer sexual activity and child sexual abuse.  However, section 5 of the 2006 Act provides that a girl under 17 years of age &ldquo;shall not be guilty of an offence under this Act by reason only of her engaging in an act of sexual intercourse&rdquo;.  The Children First guidance and proposed Children First Bill take a different approach, chiefly by making a distinction between consensual peer sexual activity and child sexual abuse and they provide specific and welcome guidance on the treatment of the former category of cases.  Notwithstanding that the Minister has made clear that the Bill before us and the Children First Bill form part of a suite of legislative reform to strengthen child protection and the protection of vulnerable adults, the two Bills are at odds with one another on this specific issue.  If a conflict were to arise between them, it is likely that the Bill before us would take precedence over the provisions of the Children First Bill.  It is, therefore, critically important that this issue be resolved and the Bills made compatible.</P>
        <P>Although the average age of first sex is 17 years, a significant minority of teenagers &mdash; approximately 15,500 young people aged 16 years and below &mdash; are having sex before the age of consent.  The scope for negative sexual health outcomes, including unplanned and crisis pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, is serious.  If this Bill is to impose a mandatory reporting obligation to the Garda on all persons in respect of consensual and non-exploitative peer sexual activity between minors, as distinct from suspected cases of sexual abuse between minors, it will negatively impact upon the right of a young person to access sexual health services, advice and information owing to fear of investigation and possible criminalisation.</P>
        <P>In respect of teenage pregnancy, it is both worrying and significant to note that between 2000 and 2010, 7,224 babies were born to girls aged 17 years and under.  Many of the girls aged 17 will have conceived at the age of 16, which is below the age of consent.  While it is not possible to decipher from the CSO figures the age of the father in each case, we know from the report, The Irish Study of Sexual Health and Relationships, that the majority of underage sexual activity in Ireland is among peers.  The Minister spoke on Second Stage about people having an obligation to report to the Garda where they have knowledge of &ldquo;material evidence&rdquo; that a serious offence has been committed against a child.  In this specific context, what greater &ldquo;material evidence&rdquo; can there be than the birth of a child?  Are the parents of the boys and girls affected statutorily required under the Bill to report to the Garda the birth of a child as evidence of an offence?  Would such a requirement be practical or in the best interest of anyone involved?  I was alerted to this issue by anecdotal evidence provided by a number of sources that many young fathers are being advised by solicitors and others not to enter their names on the register of births or apply to become their child&rsquo;s legal guardian for fear of prosecution.  In such cases, children may be deprived of their right to identity and to have a relationship with their father and the family life of the young couple may be discouraged.</P>
        <P>I am very confident that the intention of this Bill is to protect children, but I feel this particular provision has the potential to jeopardise seriously their safety and well being.  I know that the issue of the age of consent for sexual intercourse is divisive, and I am certainly not advocating for the reduction in the age of consent.  I would like to believe that no children were engaging in sexual activity, but we need to ensure that the legislative basis accounts for the reality of what is happening and the evolving nature of our society.  Our priority must be the welfare of the young people in question, who are traversing their way into adulthood.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions use their discretion and tend to look at the overall circumstances of a relationship before deciding whether or not to prosecute.  I wonder whether the discretionary powers of the DPP for such decisions should be placed on a statutory footing, for example, no prosecution of a child under 17 shall proceed without the consent of the DPP.</P>
        <P>I would welcome any guidance or advice from the Minister on my amendment if there is a more appropriate way to deal with it.  However, I feel we need to make a clear distinction so that this Bill is in line with the Children First guidelines and that we are not sending out messages to young people not to go to a health practitioner for fear that they may be reported.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  I commended him for bringing forward the Bill on Second Stage as it is long overdue.  It is a complex issue that throws up many problems that are difficult to resolve through legislation.  That is a problem the Minister faced when framing this Bill.  This is one of those issues, but I have purposely not tabled any amendments because I will use the opportunity afforded me to speak on the sections and tease out some of my concerns.  Members have an opportunity on Report Stage and in the D&aacute;il to table amendments.</P>
        <P>I support Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s amendment, but this issue could be resolved if we reduced the age of consent to 16, which is something I would like to see happen.  It is interesting that peer-related consensual sexual activities between two teenagers aged 16 is illegal in this State.  It should not be a criminal offence for two teenagers of that age to engage in sexual activities, whatever one&rsquo;s view might be on it.  They should not be ostensibly criminalised for that practice.  The Ombudsman for Children dealt with this in a mature way in her report, and I would like to quote her.  The report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Sexual relations at such a young age are undesirable and to be discouraged, [which I would support] but this office does not believe that this is best effected through the criminal law.  Indeed criminalising such relations may make it harder to deal with other consequences of such relations, for example, in accessing health services.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Senator van Turnhout gave a number of examples of that.  If a pregnant 16 year old presents to a GP, must the GP presume that a crime has been committed?  The situation throws up these anomalies and the way to resolve many of my concerns in this area would be to reduce the age of consent.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman for Children advocated that section 4 of the withholding information Bill be removed.  She states the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">It should be clarified that professionals working with children under the age of consent who have engaged in non-abusive sexual relations should not necessarily have to report such incidents as instances of child abuse to the relevant statutory authorities.  It is important that medical professionals in particular have clarity on this issue and are supported in providing their services to young people in a manner that is consistent with their best interests.  However, if the professionals in question have any concerns regarding risk factors that are apparent or suspect that there may be an abusive element in the case under consideration, the matter clearly can be referred in the usual way.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There are issues here that need to be clarified.  I would welcome a response from the Minister.  We purposely did not table any amendments on this Stage because we will tease out our concerns during discussions on the section, and reserve the right to table amendments on a later Stage.</P>
        <P>I support the sentiments behind the amendment tabled by Senator van Turnhout.  We recognise the issue is complex and it is difficult to deal with many of the issues.  I will present many more scenarios on a later Stage on issues such as defence.  We accept this is a difficult way to deal with the matter through legislation.  We commend the Minister on what he has done and the efforts that have been made but we have concerns about the sentiment behind the amendment, which we support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I join Senator Cullinane in very much welcoming Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s initiative in tabling the amendment for debate.  I agree with her sentiments although, as Senator Cullinane has said, the issues raised are so complex I am not sure about the wording that has been used.  The amendment is welcome because it gives us the opportunity to debate a couple of issues.  The amendment tabled by Senator van Turnhout raises the issue around what she has described as consensual, non-exploitative sexual activity, essentially between teenagers where there is an age difference of not greater than two years.  This issue concerns the age of consent, which like Senator Cullinane I believe should be lowered to 16, not least because that is the age of consent to medical treatment under the 1997 Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, so it would tally with that.</P>
        <P>I was also very much encouraged in that view by a recent seminar on the age of consent that both the Minister and I attended.  The seminar, which was hosted by the Royal College of Physicians, was held a couple of weeks ago during the first sexual health awareness week.  At that meeting the issues Senator van Turnhout seeks to address were central to the debate which was led by young people in transition year who participated and who had mixed views about lowering the age.  Many of those present seemed to think 16 would be a more reasonable age.  That is somewhat different from what Senator van Turnhout seeks to do, but it is similar.  One of the difficulties with the wording is to say that this is consensual activity where in fact it is not legal currently if the teenagers concerned are younger than 17.  There are complex issues at play.</P>
        <P>A second issue that is raised in the amendment, which again is useful in terms of debate and which we debated on Second Stage and in the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, is that of reasonable excuse.  In section 2 the offence of withholding information provides that it is an offence to fail to disclose information without reasonable excuse.  One of the points the committee made in its report to the Minister is that many of those who had given evidence to the committee hearings had submitted that there should be a detailed list of what constitutes reasonable excuse.  In a sense, section 4 sets out a range of circumstances, essentially of defences, but what Senator van Turnhout is doing is showing us that there is not a definition of reasonable excuse itself currently in the legislation.  She has suggested one definition.  It is a complex area as to what should constitute reasonable excuse.  I raised a number of points on it on Second Stage.  I was reminded of it again this morning at a conference on mediation organised by the Legal Aid Board at which I was speaking about the heads of the mediation Bill that we are also dealing with in the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The Minister will be aware of the issues as he has great experience in this area.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>One of the points raised with me is that frequently in the course of family law disputes and in mediation on family law issues is that there is disclosure of abuse during the proceedings and the negotiations and that it can place practitioners in a difficult position, especially if they believe the disclosure is made for particular reasons.  I do not wish to press that point because I do not suggest that should be included within the definition of reasonable excuse, but for me it illustrated the practical difficulties the legislation will face in its implementation by such a wide range of people, not just counsellors and doctors who deal directly with children but also people who deal at arm&rsquo;s length with the parents of children where disclosures are made.</P>
        <P>These are complex issues and I do not have an answer, but Senator van Turnhout has done us a service in raising the issues around age of consent and the definition of reasonable excuse.  I would ask the Minister perhaps to consider whether there can be any way of constructing an amendment on Report Stage that would take account of some of the concerns that have been raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator van Turnhout on this amendment.  I also congratulate the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s office on the excellent advice it has provided Senators concerning the Bill.  Would it be possible for the Minister to consider the spirit of the amendment and table an amendment on Report Stage?</P>
        <P>The first of a number of important points is that the law should not be an ass.  This is not a debate on what constitutes good sexual practice.  As any parent knows and regardless of whether we like it, children under the age of 17 years are engaging in sexual practices.  This is the bottom line.  Even if we pick 16 years as a reasonable age for consent, there will still be 15 year olds having sex with 16 year olds.  We need a wider consideration of the matter.</P>
        <P>We do not want a situation in which a vulnerable young person will not access health services because of a law that is archaic and out of sync with the societal reality.  I do not know whether the answer lies in amending the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006, in which respect the advice from the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office was given.  Irrespective of whether the amendment should be considered in terms of the Act, this legislation or both, we should not put in place legislation that places requirements on people that will not be upheld.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a supplementary point, as I forgot to raise the issue of reasonable excuse.  The Bills Digest made an interesting point, in that a number of submissions called for a detailed list of what constituted reasonable excuse.  Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI, stated: &ldquo;The phrase &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; needs more elaboration generally, with an open list of situations which do provide a reasonable excuse, such as instructions from the victim that he/she does not want the information to be given to the Guards.&rdquo;  Concern was expressed about the lack of a definition of what constitutes reasonable excuse.  Perhaps the Minister might allay our concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senators&rsquo; comments and look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response to the amendment.  The amendment provides us with useful debating space.  The purpose of any legislation or proposed change is to improve the situation, in this case, children&rsquo;s lot in life.  In our efforts to bring about improvement, we must not cause further difficulties or doubts.  For this reason, our debate on reasonable excuse is interesting.  We may not be able to resolve the issue raised by Senator van Turnhout today, but it is worthy of serious consideration.  As Senator Hayden stated, we cannot legislate with our eyes shut.  We must take note of problems.  We are not meant to impose or propose a moral or code of the best way to live.  We are supposed to try to put in place a law that works and can be used to protect children.  At a minimum, will the Minister try to take the spirit of Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s suggestion on board?  There will be a short amount of time before Report Stage in which we can reflect further.  I will be interested in the Minister&rsquo;s initial observation, as the amendment raises a genuine issue.  We must deal with it in the best possible way.  I would be interested in the Minister&rsquo;s expert response to our amateur efforts in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views as he took part in a discussion of this matter at some length at an Oireachtas joint committee in the previous D&aacute;il.  While Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s amendment raises issues of profound import for society, I do not believe I would be carving out exceptions to this legislation unless we are making the policy choice in the general law.  That is not to say I do not agree with the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.  We have profound choices in society to make.  I am listening to this debate with some interest and to the views expressed on this issue.  I do not have fixed views on the age of consent issue.</P>
        <P>While it is well made, I do not accept the point that just because it is happening means it should be accepted by society.  Although I can see the rationale for that point of view, society needs to come to a decision as to what age and what circumstances are correct for consent.  It is not just about the age as is reflected in the amendment but about the difference in ages.  A 15 year old and a 24 year old having consensual sex is a different matter to a 15 year old and a 17 year old.  It raises more profound questions and we should be consistent with this in reporting legislation.  It should not interfere with the obligations of reporting.  The better course of action would be to change the general criminal law.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I thank Senator van Turnhout for tabling this amendment and all of the Senators who have contributed to this important issue.  It was discussed at great length at the Oireachtas joint committee that examined children&rsquo;s rights.  In addressing the sexual offences area, the committee recommended that the Government should consider decriminalising consensual sexual activity between young people of approximate age.  The approximate age that was suggested was two years.  The alternative, as opposed to simply changing the law, was that it should be left to the Director of Public Prosecutions to exercise a discretion not to prosecute where an individual over age has sexual relations with an individual under age.  For example, in the case of a 16 year old boy having sexual relations with a 15 year old girl, the girl cannot be prosecuted but the boy could be.  It was recommended that where it is consensual and there is an approximate age, there should not be a prosecution.</P>
        <P>I share the view that young people are sexually active, whether we approve or not.  When I was 15, young people of 15 and 16 years were sexually active.  I do not think the world has greatly changed since.  The older we get as adults, the more we tend to think we live in a world that is somewhat detached from reality.</P>
        <P>As I have informed the House previously, legislation is being prepared to consolidate our sexual offences legislation.  It has regard to the very detailed recommendations made by an Oireachtas committee in 2006 and recommendations made by a variety of groups and organisations.  I will shortly be bringing before the Government proposals in this area with regard to how we address the law and what reform may be required.  It is appropriate we deal with this issue in the context of sexual offences legislation, not in the context of this Bill before us.  There is a need to avoid criminalising our young people where they engage in consensual and non-exploitative sexual behaviour with members of their peer group as part of the normal process of growing up.  I emphasise my belief this issue would be dealt with more appropriately in the sexual offences Bill which I hope will be published before the end of the year.  There are decisions to be made on a number of issues relating to the Bill, while a suite of measures are being brought forward, including legislation being processed by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  That Bill deals with a particular aspect of these issues and is before an Oireachtas committee.  The suite of measures to deal with issues pertinent to young people and sexual conduct will include a sexual offences Bill, although that legislation will not be confined to issues relating to children.</P>
        <P>There are provisions in this Bill that have some relationship with the important issue raised by Senator Jillian van Turnhout.  For example, section 2(3) provides that the child against whom an offence is committed cannot be guilty of an offence of withholding information.  This means the child engaged in sexual relations cannot be deemed to be guilty of an offence of withholding information on the sexual relations in which he or she is engaged.</P>
        <P>Senator David Cullinane&rsquo;s comments are relevant to section 4(1), which is important.  Where the child makes known his or her view that the offence should not be reported to the Garda, this section provides a legitimate defence for any other person who does not report the offence.  The Senator raised the issue in the context of a very interesting analysis of the legislation carried out by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  There was a reference to this issue, but it seemed to miss the fact that this provision was expressly included in section 4(1).</P>
        <P>Since the behaviour referred to in Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s amendment is consensual, the child would not wish it to be reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A person who knows this is the child&rsquo;s view on the matter will have the specific defence included in section 4(1).  By way of example, a 15 year old girl may have sexual relations with a boy aged 16 and a half years.  The girl may not want to have it reported to the Garda by her parents because, although they may not approve, they are girlfriend and boyfriend.  The legislation is about making it a criminal offence not to inform the Garda, but if the young person does not want the offence to be reported, there is no offence under the legislation.  There may be an issue under current legislation and the boy in my example would be open to prosecution.  It is at the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions whether a prosecution should take place.</P>
        <P>There was a recent prosecution which involved the proximate age issue and there was a judgment of the Supreme Court upholding what was alleged to be discrimination between boys and girls; it indicated that the boy could be prosecuted, even where the girl was exempt, because girls became pregnant.  That was a reasonable issue to be taken into account by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Under this legislation, where the act is consensual and we talk about the offence being &ldquo;non-reporting&rdquo;, the girl will make her wish known that the act is not to be reported.  In other circumstances the boy may be the under-age partner and may not want to have the act reported.  No one can be prosecuted for not reporting the act in such instances.  That is substantially the answer to the issue raised by Senator van Turnhout.</P>
        <P>The issue as to what constitutes a reasonable excuse was raised by some and is dealt with in the next section of the Bill.  Senator Cullinane raised the issue in the context of the report from the Library, which had received a submission making the point that it might be a reasonable excuse if the victim does not want it reported.  Again, section 4(1) addresses that.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman for Children raised the other issue of spelling out all the reasonable excuses, but that is not possible.  There could be a litany of reasons it is reasonable not to report abuse, so it would be impossible to produce a definitive list.  This operates in the context of a possible criminal prosecution.  For example, I am being prosecuted for not reporting that a sexual offence has been committed and I have a reasonable excuse.  I could have a range of excuses.  My reasonable excuse might be that my life was threatened or the life of a member of my family was threatened if I reported the abuse.  Would a court regard that as a reasonable excuse if I managed to establish on the evidence that someone genuinely threatened to shoot me?</P>
        <P>There might be some other reason a person would not report.  I may be a 17 year old in a family who knows that someone has had sexual relations with my 15 year old sister.  My sister might not have told me that she does not want that reported but has said other things to me that make me conclude that I cannot report that.  Those other things may or may not be a reasonable excuse, but if we went round this House, we would probably have at least one excuse everyone could think of that had not been thought of by anyone else.</P>
        <P>The reasonable excuse provision exists in other, similar legislation and it has not given rise to difficulty, but it ensures an injustice is not perpetrated and someone is not convicted and at risk of a term of imprisonment in circumstances that would be grossly unjust and unfair.  It is a protective measure that exists in the 1998 legislation that deals similarly with a failure to provide information but which did not apply to the sexual offences we are addressing here.  That is why we did not spell out definitively what are reasonable excuses.  There was no point in producing legislation that states a reasonable excuse includes the following list.  That would be meaningless because there would be a range of others and it could just well be that something was spelled out that seemed reasonable in abstract but in a particular case should not provide a defence.</P>
        <P>There was a range of reasons for not going there, although I thank Senator van Turnhout for tabling the amendment.  It was an important issue to draw attention to and the problem that arises is substantially dealt with under section 4(1).  When we deal with the sexual offences Bill, which I hope to introduce before the end of the year to be debated next year in the Oireachtas, knowing the burden the Attorney General&rsquo;s office is labouring under at present, it will provide further clarity on the issue of young people of proximate age having sexual relations.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister and my colleagues.  This debate has been useful and I agree we cannot give a definition for all reasonable excuses.  In moving the amendment, I knew it was not necessarily in the right place but I believed it was important to lay down a marker on the issue.  I have a problem that there is a difference between the Children First guidelines and the Bill.  The guidelines make a distinction between consensual peer sexual activity and child sexual abuse and this is about a suite of legislation.  I am not fully satisfied because I feel there is a distinction.</P>
        <P>The difficulty for me is that we can talk about consensual activity, and I have talked to Treoir, which is dealing directly with the issue of young fathers being counselled not to put their names on birth certificates because they will be further criminalised.  I do not want the legislation to add to that opinion.  While at the time of birth it may be consensual, relationships break down, whether those involved are young or old, and people&rsquo;s perceptions afterwards of whether it was consensual can change.  I am concerned but accept the Minister&rsquo;s wisdom on the issue.  While I reserve the right to come back on Report Stage, I take on board what has been said on the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>This group of amendments provides clarification on the organisations and persons who may be prescribed under the Bill for the purpose of a defence under section 4.  As discussed during Second Stage, it is intended that there would be a defence available for those organisations and persons who provide counselling and other support services to victims of physical or sexual abuse.  In submissions to the Oireachtas committee, a number of organisations which provide counselling and support services to victims of sexual abuse made the point that they often have to work with victims for an extended period before the victim can reach a decision whether to report an offence to the Garda.  I am anxious that in such circumstances the victims are not discouraged from accessing supports which they need because of concerns that the seeking of such supports will immediately require a report of the crime to be made to the Garda.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 9 introduces a new section 5 which provides for prescribed organisations.  This amendment provides additional clarification on the types of organisations which may be prescribed under the Bill and the requirements which they must fulfil to be so prescribed.  Under the new section, the Minister for Justice and Equality may, if satisfied that it is appropriate to do so, prescribe an organisation or body for the purposes of section 4.  However, only those organisations which provide services to children or vulnerable persons who have suffered injury, harm or damage as a result of the abuse, may make application to be become a prescribed organisation.  Subsection (2) sets out the content of the application.  It requires the organisation or body to detail the nature and type of services provided by the organisation or body and the numbers of children or vulnerable persons who have received such services from the organisation, and to set out the code of practice, if any, of that organisation or body.  Subsection (5) defines the term &ldquo;services&rdquo; as relating to the resolution, through guidance, counselling or otherwise, of personal, social or psychological problems or the care of persons in need of protection, guidance or support.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 10 makes a similar provision in regard to prescribed persons.  A new section 6 is proposed which is directed at those persons such as counsellors who are within a prescribed organisation and providing the services directly to the clients.  A prescribed organisation may apply to the Minister for Justice and Equality requesting that a person or persons within the organisation may be prescribed for the purpose of the defence under section 4.  Subsection (2) sets out the information which is required when making such an application and includes information concerning the nature and type of services provided by the persons, their expertise and qualifications, the arrangements within the organisation for training and development of such persons, as well as the procedures and systems for assessing the services provided.  Subsection (3) confirms that only persons employed or otherwise engaged by prescribed organisations may be prescribed under the Bill.  As with amendment No. 9, this new provision clarifies the types of persons who may be prescribed under the Bill and the requirements which must be met in order to be prescribed.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 2 is consequential on amendments Nos. 9 and 10.  It deletes from the Bill the references to prescribed organisations and prescribed persons.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are also consequential on amendments Nos. 9 and 10 and update cross-references in light of the new sections.  I advise the House that I will propose some further minor amendment to the new sections 5 and 6 on Report Stage to provide a mechanism to revoke the designation of prescribed organisations or prescribed persons, where appropriate.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, subsection (17), line 29, to delete &ldquo;a psychologist and,&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to give some further thought to both those amendments.  I want to explain the background to them but I will not press the amendments today.  This is an issue that has arisen in other legislation.  I have raised this more to note it and, if need be, we will return to it on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>There is a very important reference in the legislation which details the various members of designated professions who may determine, in the interests of the welfare of a child or a vulnerable person, that information should not be given to the Garda.  That is it in a nutshell.  The subsection details that a member of a designated profession means: a registered medical practitioner; a registered nurse; a psychologist and, following the establishment of the register of members of psychologists under the Act of 2005, only a person whose name is entered on that register; or a social worker whose name is entered on the register of members of social workers established and maintained under section 36 of the Act of 2005.</P>
        <P>A concern was raised with regard to the fact that the provisions of section 36 of the 2005 Act relating to psychologists have not yet been brought into force.  In theory at least, individuals at present who are untrained can claim to be psychologists.  That was the reason for introducing the 2005 legislation in the first place.  We must remember that what we have here is something that can be utilised as a defence should one be prosecuted.  We do not want unqualified individuals self-proclaiming themselves to be psychologists without qualification who may try to utilise a defence to evade a successful prosecution and who should have reported the abuse of a child or a vulnerable adult.</P>
        <P>The other side of the coin is that there are many professional, well-trained, very experienced psychologists in the State who can point to their qualifications and who are working with individuals who are the victims of abuse.  The concern is that in the absence of this section of the 2005 Act coming into force, a blanket reference to psychologists, in the way we have it in the Bill, may make the Bill vulnerable to someone who is not adequately trained claiming to be a psychologist.  On the other hand, I do not want a situation to arise whereby psychologists working in this area would feel vulnerable to prosecutions in circumstances where they should not occur.</P>
        <P>One of the ways around this is that a psychologist could be a designated person under the provisions to which we made reference, the amendments we just included in the Bill, which upgraded earlier provisions.  On the other hand, psychologists working in private practice may have an individual who comes to them who has been a victim of a sexual offence and they may not be a designated person but may receive information and genuinely deal with the matter, know of the law but conclude it is in the interest of the welfare of the individual at that moment in time not to report.  They may conclude that the individual needs support, time and perhaps two or three more engagements before the possibility of reporting can be dealt with.  I am merely raising the fact that I am concerned about this because section 36 of the 2005 Act is not in force and this is a form of an amendment to which we may need to give some consideration.  I have some personal reservations about dealing with it in a blanket way and I will return to it.  I am conscious that, procedurally, I cannot return to it if i do not give notice of that for Report Stage and that is what I am doing.  Other than that, I intend to withdraw the amendment and not to press it in any shape or form today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a number of issues, the first of which relates to privilege.  I refer again to the submission made by the Ombudsman for Children who made a number of interesting observations and dealt with two forms of privilege &mdash; legal privilege and clergy-congregant privilege, an issue we discussed on Second Stage.  She called for section 2 to override legal professional privilege and stated something similar should happen with sacerdotal or clergy-congregant privilege.  The Bills digest states, &ldquo;The Bill makes no specific reference to clergy-congregant or sacerdotal privilege nor does existing Irish law.  The privilege between a priest or spiritual adviser and a congregant can take two forms: Confessional privilege . . . and Congregant privilege&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage the Minister said that if somebody came forward to a priest or anybody else in whatever setting, he or she was obliged to comply with the legislation and the fact that was not stated did not mean he or she was exempt.  That is my interpretation of his analysis, but it is interesting that the Association of Catholic Priests which represents 800 clergymen has stated it will not break the seal of the confessional.  The Auxiliary Bishop of Dublin, Raymond Field, stated, &ldquo;The seal of the confessional is inviolable as far as I am concerned, and that&rsquo;s the end of the matter.&rdquo;  We must make it clear to everybody, including the church, that children&rsquo;s rights and the laws of the land come first.  This should be crystal clear.  If that moves us to a point where people think the confessional seal is more important than dealing with information people might possess on vulnerable children in the appropriate way, as set out in the Bill, that is serious.  For the purposes of clarity, will the Minister deal with fears others and I have about this issue to ensure there will be no hiding place for anybody, including priests who may use the confessional seal to avoid coming froward with information?  We want certainty on the issue.</P>
        <P>On the reasonable excuse defence, I would like to outline a scenario because, as public representatives, we must be clear on what our duty is.  As public representatives, we must be clear on our duty in this regard, given that we deal with very complex queries on a range of issues from constituents.  In my own case, for example, during the years several people have divulged to me that they were abused in the past.  I dealt with one case in which an individual who was dealing with a number of complex personal issues informed me that she had been abused by a parent 20 or 30 years before.  This, she revealed, was one of the causes of the psychological distress she was experiencing and for which she was receiving treatment.  She did not want me to do anything with the information at that point &mdash; she had never informed the Garda and had no intention of so doing.  To go down that route, she believed, would cause serious problems for her family.  Many who have suffered abuse in this manner take the decision to deal with it on their own, as is their right.</P>
        <P>The difficulty arising for me from this encounter was my awareness that the alleged perpetrator of the abuse continued to work with children.  Such cases, in which an adult divulges that he or she was abused in the past but does not want to take any action in that regard and in which the public representative is aware that the alleged abuser has ongoing contact with children, point to the complexity of this issue and, as I said, the difficulties in dealing with it in legislation.  There must be absolute clarity on the responsibilities of public representatives in this regard.  In fairness, the Minister set out very clearly in his closing contribution on Second Stage what the Bill was designed to do.  One assumes most of it is common sense, that is, where one has reasonable cause to believe abuse is taking place, one should provide the information at one&rsquo;s disposal for the Garda.  This is not about third or fourth party information.  However, there are issues to be clarified such as in the case I referred to where one is not in a position to go to the Garda on a specific matter, but one is concerned that a particular individual is in contact with children.  What are the guidelines and responsibilities in such instances?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator David Cullinane has raised very important and pertinent points and I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.  </P>
        <P>It was somewhat unfortunate when the Bill was initially published, that the greatest part of the public debate and commentary associated with it was focused on the question of the seal of confession, as it became known.  The Minister&rsquo;s contribution on Second Stage was very fair and balanced in this regard, but perhaps he might remind us once more of the status of the confessional seal, as he sees it, following the passage of this legislation.  The public engagement with the Bill has mirrored the broader debate on the abuse of children within the Catholic Church following the publication in the past two or three years of such documents as the Ryan report which highlighted some of the horrific abuses that occurred in the past.</P>
        <P>This legislation seeks to solve a problem and prevent similar problems in the future.  Section 4 provides for a large number of what are opt-out provisions or special exemptions.  I agree that these are necessary in respect of health care workers, GPs, social workers, psychologists and parents, where they see fit.  On the other side of the equation, we have the seal of confession.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on from a decision made by the Government today, I wish to make an announcement to the House.  On behalf of the State, the Government apologises for the manner in which those members of the Defence Forces who left to fight on the allied side during the Second World War, 1939 to 1945, were treated after the war by the State.  The Government recognises the value and importance of their military contribution to the allied victory and will introduce legislation to grant a pardon and amnesty to those who absented themselves from the Defence Forces without leave or permission to fight on the allied side.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises the value and importance to the State of the essential service given by all those who served in the Defence Forces throughout the period of the Second World War.  They performed a crucial duty for the State at a time of national emergency and enormous difficulty.  The loyalty of the Defence Forces to the State is indispensable.  It is essential to the national interest that members of the Defence Forces do not abandon their duties at any time, especially at a time of crisis, and no responsible government could ever depart from this principle.</P>
        <P>In addressing the question of desertion during the Second World War, the Government acknowledges that the war gave rise to circumstances that were grave and exceptional.  Members of the Defence Forces left their posts at that time to fight on the allied side against tyranny and, together with many thousands of other Irish men and women, played an important role in defending freedom and democracy.  Those who fought on the allied side also contributed to protecting this State&rsquo;s sovereignty and independence and our democratic values.</P>
        <P>When, in August 1945, the Government of the day, through an emergency powers order, addressed the question of members of the Defence Forces who had absented themselves during the Second World War by summarily dismissing them from the Defence Forces and disqualifying them for seven years from holding employment or office remunerated from the State&rsquo;s Central Fund, individuals were not given a chance to explain their absence.  This remained the position following the transposition of the emergency powers order into an Act of the Oireachtas in 1946.   No distinction was made between those who fought on the allied side for freedom and democracy and those who absented themselves for other reasons.</P>
        <P>In the almost 73 years since the outbreak of the Second World War, our understanding of history has matured.  We can re-evaluate actions taken long ago, free from the constraints that bound those directly involved and without questioning or revisiting their motivations.  It is time for understanding and forgiveness.  At a time of greater insight and understanding of the shared history and experiences of Ireland and Britain, it is right that the role played by Irish veterans who fought on the allied side be recognised and the rejection they experienced be understood.   To that end, the Government has now resolved to provide a legal mechanism that will provide an amnesty to those who absented themselves from our Defence Forces and fought with the allied forces in the Second World War and to provide a pardon to those who were individually court-martialed.  This will be achieved without undermining the general principle regarding desertion.  The proposed legislation, which I intend to introduce later this year, will provide that the pardon and amnesty does not give rise to any right or entitlement or to any liability on the part of the State.</P>
        <P>In extending this amnesty and pardon, the Government would like to emphasise that it does not condone desertion and fully recognises, values and respects the contribution of all those who stood by their post with the Defence Forces and pledged their lives to defend this State&rsquo;s integrity and sovereignty against any and all aggressors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>We were having some general dialogue on section 4.  I made the point that while the exemptions and opt outs in section 4 are necessary and understandable, it reduces what we all thought would be the impact of the Bill at the time of publication.  We thought that this Bill would chart a new way forward and would state in black and white legislation that the withholding of information was wrong in all circumstances.  I understand why these opt outs and exemptions are necessary, but it is a little disappointing that we have to recognise that the reality and practice of law can sometimes be different to what we would aspire them to be.</P>
        <P>The initial stages of the public debate on the Bill focused almost entirely on one issue, namely, the seal of the confessional.  By virtue of what the Minister said on Second Stage and the further clarification we have received, that matter is being dealt with in a mature and sensitive fashion.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to comment on the overall impact of section 4.  I know it is not designed to reduce in any way the influence and the value of the legislation.  I must say that it is a little bit disappointing to come forward with legislation which we feel is strong enough in every respect to deal with the withholding of information, but then when we have to deal with it in the cold light of day, we see so many categories and areas where provision for an exemption must be made.  Perhaps the Minister could reassure us that the Bill is still strong and will be effective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will continue where Senator Bradford left off.  Is the Minister confident that the Bill is strong enough?  I read about regulations that came from Rome on the clergy-congregant ethos on the child protection guidelines.  It was in response to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which we know is answerable and where the boss is the Pope.  The document was drawn up in response to its call from Rome.  It concluded that there was no legal obligation to report abuse.  That is what bishops were told in Rome.</P>
        <P>Child protection guidelines issued this week by the Italian bishops conference concluded with an observation that there is no judicial obligation on bishops to report suspected cases of child abuse to the police.  That is not the case in this country.  I stress that it is in Rome, but we all belong to the same church, the Holy See, which is governed by Pope Benedict, who is the boss of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and we all have the same beliefs.</P>
        <P>A bishop holds no public office, nor is he a public servant &mdash; it is all &ldquo;hes&rdquo; because there are no &ldquo;shes&rdquo;, even though we saw a Catholic minister from a Methodist church in Ballsbridge today and I welcomed her.  Under Italian law a bishop is not obliged to report facts on sexual abuse?  People are concerned because the document relates to judicial matters.  If that is the case in Rome and our boss is there, is the Minister certain that it does not transfer to this jurisdiction?  I wish to ensure that we have all the t&rsquo;s crossed and the i&rsquo;s dotted.  I know the Irish bishops and I congratulate them on the regulations they have introduced.  My understanding is that the regulations in this country are different to those that pertain in Italy.  My concern is that the legal regulations we are drawing up will cover everyone in the same way and that the onus is on everyone to report suspected cases of child abuse and that children come first.  To put children first should be the first obligation before one&rsquo;s obligation to church and State or any other obligation.  We must ensure that the legislation in this country is strong enough to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I recall that we had a debate on the issue on Second Stage so I will not repeat what I said then.  I agree with Senator Bradford that the caveat could mean the public would not be fully informed of the intentions of the Bill.  That reinforces the need for a clear information campaign.  When the Bill passes through the Houses we must clearly inform the public so that there is no ambiguity on questions such as that raised by Senator Cullinane previously.  The reports that have been published, including the Amnesty International report, In Plain Sight, referred to societal responses and the number of people in general who were aware of abuse but did not report it.  I wish to ensure that the legislation we are discussing shines a light onto every shadow so there is no child who is at risk, that anyone who has any doubt would report it, and that we will not have situations such as that described by counsellors known as the &ldquo;resurrected father syndrome&rdquo; where one goes into counselling and claims the abuser has died.  As the trust is built up during the counselling sessions they are resurrected as such because it later transpires that they are alive.  There is a sensitivity around such counselling.  The Bill has clearly dealt with that.  We must ensure that we do not just talk about the confessional.  The Bill is about any citizen in this country withholding information which puts a child or vulnerable person at risk.  It is as simple as that.  We must ensure that is the message that goes out and not the caveats.  That is when we get into the detail but for me it sends a clear message which I welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I again thank Senators for their considered contributions.  I will first make a general point and then I will deal with the specific queries that have been raised.  I wish to be absolutely clear, because there have been interesting reports in the media.  I have seen two reports which contain a variety of different things.  In one case there was a suggestion that the entire clergy in the Catholic Church is exempt from the provisions of the Bill.  On the other hand I have seen articles saying that I am persecuting the church and that the clergy is bound by the Bill.  It is extraordinary how one can have such different views in print depending on the story one is writing.</P>
        <P>Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill set out clearly criminal offences which apply to children on the one hand and vulnerable adults on the other.  Should an individual know of particular offences, not just confined to sexual abuse or sexual offences, there is an obligation to assist the Garda by furnishing to it the information that is available to them.  If they fail to meet their obligations under the legislation they can be prosecuted.  No one is exempt from prosecution.</P>
        <P>There are defences prescribed by the legislation.  I heard my good friend and colleague, Senator Bradford, expressing some disappointment that the defences in some way &mdash; I paraphrase what he said &mdash; water down the legislation.  There are defences because, first, it is important that the legislation is fair and proportionate and, second, because this is legislation protective of children and vulnerable adults.  It addresses the position of children and vulnerable adults as victims and ensures that it does not erect any barrier to them seeking help in circumstances in which they require help.  Likewise, it does not erect a barrier which inhibits a parent making a decision in the interests of the welfare of their children.  This would be the case in circumstances where neither the parent nor any other family member is the perpetrator of an offence in any shape or form.  The Bill ensures that when they need and seek professional help, be it from the Rape Crisis Centre, some other counselling organisation, a social worker, psychologist or psychiatrist, there is no barrier erected to them seeking that help so they can get what assistance they require.</P>
        <P>In the same way victims should not feel under immediate pressure if they have a reservation about giving information to the Garda.  It is desirable that they would give the information.  However, they should know they have the space and that they are not required to give it.  This was a concern expressed in regard to the heads of the Bill by some of the organisations that provide these services.  The concern was that if people need help they do not fail to seek it for fear they will find themselves immediately in a Garda investigation at a time of enormous personal stress.  Having said that, it is desirable and of huge importance that any individual who is a victim of serious crime, including sexual abuse, report it to the Garda.  It is of huge importance that they co-operate with the Garda.  The Garda now has a special unit with individuals specially trained to deal with individuals who, sadly, find themselves the victim of such offences.  It is very important that the message goes out that the Garda is very well equipped nowadays to provide help.  People should not feel scared or intimidated by virtue of having a conversation with the Garda and advising garda&iacute; of what occurred.  At a time of enormous personal stress it is recognised that people &mdash; first and foremost, children and vulnerable adults &mdash; should get help if they require it and they should not feel there is a barrier to them getting that help.</P>
        <P>In a nutshell, that is what the defence provisions are about.  They are not about a third party being allowed to conceal something for some invidious reason.  They are all about the welfare of the victim or the vulnerable adult.  In this context, I draw attention to something that encapsulates the philosophy of the defence provisions very well.  Section 4(15) which deals with prescribed persons &mdash; we have dealt with who they are &mdash; reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">The defence provided for in <i>subsection (14) </i>shall be established only if&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the prescribed person concerned had reasonable grounds for forming the view concerned in relation to the child or vulnerable person concerned for the purpose of protecting the health and well-being of that child or vulnerable person, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the prescribed person concerned, in forming that view in relation to the child or vulnerable person, as the case may be, concerned&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) acted and continues to act in a manner, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) applied and continues to apply the standards of practice and care,</P>
        <P LI="2">that can reasonably be expected of a prescribed person forming such a view in the circumstances concerned.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This deals with the prescribed person in a designated organisation who is dealing with issues relating to vulnerable adults or children who seek his or her help.  It is particularly important that these provisions are in place, but they do not take away from the serious obligation imposed by the legislation on the generality of people to report serious offences, including child sexual abuse and other offences perpetrated on a vulnerable adult.</P>
        <P>There are two issues involved.  We will revert to the concept of reasonable excuse, referred to in sections 2 and 3, and the issue raised by Senator David Cullinane and others, namely, privilege.  Senator Paul Bradford is right, in that much of the public discussion on the Bill &mdash; it is not really a public discussion; it is a tabloid media discussion &mdash; has obsessively focused on the issue of either sacerdotal privilege or whatever other privilege there may be in the communications that take place between a member of the Catholic Church particularly, what is being focused on, and another individual.  I will emphasise this point and cannot say more clearly that the legislation contains no express exemption that applies to a member of a religious faith.</P>
        <P>The next question that arises is whether there is an implied exemption.  What is the law in this regard?  Could a priest say that, because Mrs. McGrath came to him to say Fr. Murphy had abused her son or daughter, being a priest exempts him from reporting it to the Garda?  I am saying nothing about the confessional.  By virtue of the individual being a priest, does he have an exemption under the legislation from applying its provisions?  Let us presume the individual is a bishop and Mrs. Murphy names the particular priest within a diocese who has abused the child.  She tells the bishop that it has occurred and that she wants him to do something about it.  Is the bishop exempt?  Under this legislation, he has no exemption, explicit or implicit.  That is absolutely clear.</P>
        <P>I have read with some interest much of what has been written about various court judgments.  There is a court judgment in the case Cook <i>v</i>. Carroll which has been produced.  Selective bits have been taken from it.  It was an interesting case in which judgment was delivered on 31 July 1945 by Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy.  For some reason, the law report carries two dates &mdash; 14 and 31 July.  The judgment was reported on page 515 of <i>Irish Reports</i> for that year.  I will explain it in order that Members of the House will know what it is about, as it has been referred to repeatedly in the media.  A parish priest interviewed together in his home a girl parishioner who alleged she had been seduced and the parishioner whom she held responsible for the seduction.  Subsequently, an action for damages was brought by the girl&rsquo;s mother against the parishioner and the priest was called to give evidence of what had occurred in the interview.  He refused to give evidence and claimed privilege.  It is stated in the headnote of the report that Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy held that his refusal to give evidence was justified and not in contempt of court, with the court expressing the view that &ldquo;communications made in confidence to a parish priest, in a private consultation between him and certain of his parishioners, are privileged, and that such privilege cannot be waived by a party thereto without the consent of the priest&rdquo;.  Let us assume that this is the current law which it is not for reasons I will come to.  This case involved a communication made &ldquo;in confidence&rdquo;.  It was described by the judge as the equivalent of a &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo; conversation with a priest who was trying to assist in solving a problem, either by the parishioner admitting paternity or the mother admitting she had made a false allegation.  Clearly, he was unsuccessful in both.  It was a confidential conversation, as everyone agreed at the time.  If Mrs. Murphy says to the bishop that Fr. So-and-so has abused her daughter and that he must do something about it, is the bishop obliged to report?  Of course, he is.  It is not a confidential communication, as Mrs. Murphy is making a complaint.  It does not fall under this umbrella.</P>
        <P>The case had nothing to do with the confessional.  Although Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy considered there was a need to stray off on a tangent and talk about the confessional, at some point even he admitted that the confessional was not an issue in the case.  What is interesting about this judgment is, in so far as issues arose, that it was speaking about confidences given outside the confessional and reference was made to how &ldquo;the inviolable secrecy of the sacrament of penance stands alone and unique&rdquo;.  He also talked about other things, but this was a conversation outside the confessional.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">I have to determine the issue raised in this case on principle and in conformity with the Constitution of Ireland.  That Constitution in express terms recognises the special position among us of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church as the guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of the citizens; and that special recognition is solemn and deliberate.  The same Constitution affirms the indefeasible right of the Irish people to develop its life in accordance with its own genius and traditions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This was a judgment based on the Catholic Church having a special position in the Constitution which, as far as I can recollect, we held a referendum to remove in or about 1972.  The basic philosophy behind this decision was that it derived from the constitutional peculiarities of the Irish church.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy explored English law, on which Irish law had previously relied, and noted that, under it, there was no such privilege granted to members of the Catholic Church.  He put this down, more or less, to the fact that England was a Protestant country, that this was a Catholic country and that we dealt with things differently.  He then tried to hang his hat on the principle he was enunciating on a very well written and famous book dealing with the Anglo-American system of evidence.</P>
        <P>The third edition was published in Boston in 1940 by Wigmore, an individual famous in the law of evidence.</P>
        <P>On whether privilege should be granted or not, Wigmore set out a series of principles which were elaborated in four headings.  It is worth drawing attention to these because of the superficial nature of the media coverage of this particular issue.  I will quote from the book from which Gavan Duffy quoted:</P>
        <P LI="1">Looking back upon the principle of Privilege, as an exception to the general liability of every person to give testimony upon all facts inquired of in a court of justice . . . four fundamental conditions may be predicated as necessary to the establishment of a privilege against the disclosure of communications between persons standing in a given relation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Before I go through the principles, Members should remember this is about privilege in the context of civil proceedings, not criminal.  The first principle is, &ldquo;The communication must originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed&rdquo;.  I approach the bishop and tell him that I want him to tell the Garda about an incident.  It is the exact opposite.  It is not applicable.  The second principle is, &ldquo;This element of confidentiality must be essential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the relation&rdquo;.  Mrs. Murphy does not care about the relation.  Is one supposed to look at the broader relation of the church with all of its communicants?  That is an interesting theoretical question but is not directly relevant to what we are dealing with.  The third principle is, &ldquo;The relation must be one which in the opinion of the community ought to be sedulously fostered&rdquo;.  That is an interesting one.  Would the community in Ireland now regard it as more important to protect the clergy from allegations of sexual abuse or more important that reports of abuse be given to the Garda?  Whatever they might have thought in 1945, I think we currently occupy a different space.  The clincher in the whole thing is the fourth principle which states, &ldquo;The injury that would inure to the relation by the disclosure of the communications must be greater than the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of litigation.&rdquo;  From the perspective of the church &mdash; this State does not legislate specifically for one church &mdash; it would see it as damaging that communications given to a bishop about sexual abuse would be given to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not believe the general community, nor our courts in this day and age, would take the view that the damage done to the church was of far greater concern than the likely damage done to the children who might be the victims of perpetrators of abuse.</P>
        <P>If one looks behind this judgment, the very principles prescribed from which this judge made his decision are the very principles which a modern court today would probably utilise to ensure in criminal proceedings that one would not have a defence for failing to provide information.  There is, of course, an issue that could arise which is the constitutional right to freedom of religion.  That, however, is circumscribed in a very specific way in the Constitution.  I believe the manner in which it is circumscribed deals adequately with this issue.</P>
        <P>As it has got some considerable mileage, it is worth drawing attention to another aspect of this particular judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy.  In it he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The relation that concerns me directly is that of the Irish parish priest towards two of his parishioners and theirs towards him at a crisis, in a moment of gravest anxiety, which he will often be in a much better position to relieve than anyone else.  As a rule, he is regarded as being truly the spiritual father of his people and his traditional devotion to the people through generations has won for him in Ireland the prerogative of an extraordinary moral authority; he is, therefore, more likely than others to get the truth in a matter of extreme delicacy and so was more likely to induce the delinquent here (seducer or calumniatrix) to make proper amends.  It cannot be taken as a matter of course that Wigmore&rsquo;s conditions, if they apply here, will apply to every confidential communication made by anyone to any priest or any clergyman as such, but I must not travel outside the relation constituted by the consultation in strict confidence of a parish priest as such by a parishioner.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Even Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy recognised in circumstances where the Catholic Church had a constitutional special position that every communication to a priest was not and could not be confidential and omitted from court proceedings.  That is absolutely clear.  What makes it very interesting is in the context of the final part of the judgment.  In it he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">[T]reating the question as one of substantive law, I hold that the emergence of the national Constitution is a complete and conclusive answer to the objection that I have no judicial precedent in favour of the parish priest.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Constitution has been changed since this particular judgment was delivered on in the context of communications that have nothing to do with the confessional and are made directly to a priest, rabbi or rector.</P>
        <P>What is particularly interesting is another judgment that never appears in dispatches, the High Court 1999 case Johnson <i>v.</i> Church of Scientology Mission of Dublin Limited.  In dealing with the issue of claims of privilege &mdash; the Church of Scientology tried to claim the same privilege the priest sought to claim in 1945 &mdash; Mr. Justice Geoghegan stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">It went beyond the relationship of parish priest and parishioner but on the other hand it seems to repudiate the idea that the priest counsellor himself could have a privilege which he would have to waive.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I think that the waters were muddied to some extent in <i>Cook &mdash; v &mdash; Carroll</i> with all respect to Gavan Duffy J. by the references to the confessor penitent relationship in the sacrament of confession and by references also to the then existing article in the Constitution referring to the special position of the Roman Catholic Church.  Gavan Duffy J. appears to have been of the view that there were constitutional and legal effects arising out of the so-called special position of the Roman Catholic Church.  However, in other decided cases the view was expressed that it had no such legal effect and that it was really nothing more than a statement of fact.  It being a fact, then as a matter of common sense and justice, it was reasonable for the Courts to revive what Gavan Duffy J. says was the pre-reformation common law protecting the seal of the confessional even against waiver by the penitent.  However, that is merely an opinion I express because I do not think it arises in this case.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He went on to state he accepted, &ldquo;there can be situations where a privilege may arise in relation to counselling by a priest or minister&rdquo;.  They are different where someone is providing counselling.  A privilege may arise if one seeks counselling.</P>
        <P>Where does that leave us with this legislation?  Yes, it is possible if a priest or bishop is prosecuted under this legislation that they may claim they are entitled to some form of privilege.  The legal basis for that claim, as detailed in civil proceedings by Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy and based on the special position of the Catholic church, no longer exists.  If they claim it is based on freedom of religion, the courts may be called upon to decide if it is an important matter of religious freedom to grant some general absolution to ministers of religion from ever reporting child abuse.  Will the courts take a view on the balance of society&rsquo;s interests, referring back to the principles used by Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy?</P>
        <P>Will the courts form the view that &ldquo;the injury that would inure to the relation by the disclosure of the communications must be greater than the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of litigation&rdquo;?  I do not believe that where a child or vulnerable adult has been a victim of abuse, the Irish courts will hold that it is of benefit to the State that those who know of abuse conceal it as opposed to it being of benefit to the State and in the interests of children or vulnerable adults that the information be furnished to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not see this in the Ireland of 2012 giving rise to a decision based on a civil case from 1945 based on the church having a special position.</P>
        <P>I apologise if that is a long-winded response.  I repeat that under this legislation there is no express or implied exemption granted to anybody.  I know capable lawyers can argue all sorts of cases but there is no need for us to address it any further than we have done in the legislation.  At some stage there may be a court case and Supreme Court judgment but with the balance of public policy, the interests in the welfare of children and the recognition that children have rights, which I hope will be copperfastened when we hold our children&rsquo;s rights referendum, will ensure that this, in practical terms, will not be an issue.</P>
        <P>One or two other issues were raised that are worth mentioning in passing.  I probably have covered much of what was raised already.  Senator Keane referred to a recent publication in Italy which appeared to come from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.  I know the Senator did not mean it in such a way but the reference was made to our boss being in Rome.  The boss, in the context of Irish civil and criminal law, is the Oireachtas and it does not exist in Rome.  It is for the Houses of the Oireachtas to prescribe what legislation should be enacted.</P>

	<P>On a point of order, the Minister may have misinterpreted what I said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Senator did not mean it in that way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I was indicating that the boss of all Catholics is in Rome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but not in the context of civil law, the role of the State and legislation.  The Catholic Church is entitled to have its own canon law and the Jewish religion is entitled to have its own tenets.  All of the Muslim and various Protestant faiths have different tenets and principles but when it comes to civil law, the State is agnostic of those.  The State&rsquo;s position is to enact laws in the interests of the people of this country.  This is a law to protect children and vulnerable adults.  Whatever is being said by bishops to other bishops in Rome or Italy, or whatever is said by bishops or other members of the clergy in Ireland, they are bound by our laws in the same way that all of us in this House are bound by our laws.  That is the position.</P>
        <P>I have not addressed another issue but it is important I do so.  Senator van Turnhout and Senator Cullinane raised some issues about the relationship between the Children First legislation and this Bill.  There are some differences.  Under the Children First legislation there may be an obligation to report to the HSE abuse of a child in circumstances where there is not an obligation to report an incident to the Garda.  The HSE would be perceived as providing supports and counselling but the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would put in place an investigative process.  There are certain differences and in certain circumstances it will become necessary to report to the Garda and possibly both in respect of legislation.</P>
        <P>For too long, too much abuse of children in this State has been hidden and inadequately reported.  We are creating a regime under the heads of the Bill being prepared by my good friend and colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and it will ensure a degree of synergy and coherence in the manner in which reports are made to the HSE by a broad range of bodies which have obligations.  The Bill before us is legislation that may apply to both professionals and the general public to ensure crucial information is furnished to the Garda and, where necessary, investigations and prosecutions can be taken.  It will also ensure those who prey on children or vulnerable adults are brought before the courts and not given impunity to prey on a series of different vulnerable individuals, which we have seen happen too frequently in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to sacerdotal privilege, the Minister illustrated at great lengths the provisions of the Cook <i>v</i>. Carroll case.  That did not involve the confessional but rather a meeting in the priest&rsquo;s office.  For the sake of argument, if an abuser in a family goes to a priest in a confessional, saying that he or she is behaving in a way that is wrong but the person cannot prevent the behaviour, is it correct to say that a disclosure made in the confessional while engaging in what the person in question would call the sacrament of penance is not privileged in the context of this Bill, according to the Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to comment on a number of points.  In his response, the Minister mentioned unhelpful media coverage and the range of different opinions expressed in the media.  I agree that these are unhelpful but that is outside our control.  In this House we are concerned about the direct question, and Senator Hayden&rsquo;s comments go straight to the heart of the issue.  The Minister stated earlier, quite emphatically, that there are no exemptions, which is important.  There must be clarity and there should be no grey areas.  The media may be reporting different views on either side of the issue, and it is important for there to be absolute certainty and clarity.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned sections 2 and 3, and I assume they apply to everybody, including priests and any reporting of abuse that may be made in a confession.  We are absolutely certain of that.  I do not know if there is an issue with the argument in the Bills digest, which is somewhat different from the Minister&rsquo;s opinion.  That document indicated that in Ireland, the courts have held that priest-congregant privilege exists in Irish law.  Judge Gavin Duffy held in Cook <i>v.</i> Carroll that a priest had sacerdotal privilege, which would give him a right to &ldquo;refuse in a court of law to divulge any confidential communication whatever made to him as a priest&rdquo;.  The document refers to the Wigmore principles mentioned by the Minister, although the wording may be slightly different.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>They are the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>They may be summaries.  Perhaps some of the uncertainty has come from us being guided by what is in the document.  The Ombudsman for Children and other parties have made submissions on this.  I fully accept the Minister&rsquo;s response, which was very comprehensive and should allay any concerns we have.</P>
        <P>Some states in the United States go further.  They specifically deny both clergy-congregant and clergy-confessional privilege.  The examples include New Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island and West Virginia which only recognise attorney-client privilege.  There are examples of it being made explicit in legislation in order that there is no ambiguity.  There are sensitivities surrounding the issue and we do not want to fuel a different debate that would bring us down a different path, although it is the way some in the media might want us to go.  I am comforted, however, by the Minister&rsquo;s response that is both emphatic and clear that there are no exemptions.  That clarifies the position for me.  Perhaps there will be a Supreme Court case at some point.</P>
        <P>I must go back to the remarks of the clergy.  The Association of Catholic Priests has stated it will not break the seal of confession and statements have been made in agreement with that position by some bishops.  The Minister cannot be held responsible for their remarks, but it is beholden on the Catholic Church to accept the Bill.   Once it is passed, it will be subject to it and cannot use sacerdotal privilege as a justification for not reporting child abuse.  That must be at the heart of what it does.  It might not accept this and we may end up seeing the legislation being challenged in court.  However, I am pleased with the Minister&rsquo;s response that this will hold up in any court case that may be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I find the Minister&rsquo;s response measured and reasonable.  On section 4, I have some concerns.  I understand why the defence has been inserted in section 4(1), whereby if a child or vulnerable person against whom an offence is committed makes it known he or she does not want the offence to be reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, this can be relied upon as a defence in a court case.  In many instances, victims do not particularly want the offence to be known; there is a reluctance as they endeavour to deal with it themselves.  It is a difficult issue which I have come across.</P>
        <P>My concern is that we are not just dealing with one victim.  As we are aware, paedophiles tend to repeat and have multiple victims.  In protecting a child we might be exposing others.  I canvass the notion that perhaps the defence might involve not exposing the victim&rsquo;s name but having an obligation to make it known to the authorities that there was an allegation that was believed to be true against a particular individual.  I do not know what they can do then, but at least the system should be triggered in some way to avoid a situation where, when we are rightly trying to protect the victim, we create more.</P>
        <P>Along the same lines &mdash; I have come across some good analyses of the fragmentation of families &mdash; it is interesting that children are at greater risk in particular family groups than in others.  The extreme example is that a mother of children cohabiting with a man who is not the biological father of her children.  The 1993 socio-scientific analysis carried out by Mr. Robert Whelan in his work, Broken Homes and Battered Children, based on studies conducted in Britain, outlines that a child in such circumstances is 33 times more at risk than a child living with his or her married biological parents.  Often times, in such situations the woman is financially vulnerable and, therefore, may feel inhibited in reporting the abuse of her children.  Children are easily led and can be made to say they do not want to report something.  The defence could be created within the unit, leading to ongoing abuse of a child.  There are other family units in which the risk is also much higher, but I will not go further. These are the two polar opposites in this field.</P>
        <P>We have spent a lot of time in the debate dealing with clerical sexual abuse.  It is an appalling vista and has occurred in the last five or six decades.  I recently saw an analysis that showed that it had reached its zenith in the 1960s and 1970s, but there was no plausible reason for this.  The highlighting of that fact will, I hope, lead to its decline and eradication.</P>
        <P>I am inclined to agree on the issue of congregant privilege.  The right of the child supersedes any privilege there might be between a congregant and a priest.  However, I do not agree on the issue of the confessional, as it is an important sacrament in the Catholic faith and, as I said on Second Stage, the issue is unlikely to arise in many instances.  As there is a degree of secrecy, often the confessor will be completely unaware of the identity of the penitent.  If he was so aware, he would be subject to his vows and not just to dismissal from the priesthood but also to excommunication.  If we have freedom of religion as a fundamental principle &mdash; we look at the number of Christians who are persecuted across the globe and those countries in which there is no freedom of religion &mdash; we transgress it at our peril in various ways.  Also, it is unlikely that someone who is a perpetrator will go to confession.  It would be wrong, however, to focus exclusively on this issue, as it is only a small part of the overall scenario.  Over-concentration on it may lead to obfuscation and others feeling they are not subject to the same critical levels of exposure.  It is important that people know that the law on this serious criminal offence is unrelenting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their thoughtful contributions.  In response to Senator Jim Walsh, I am also concerned that we do not over-emphasise this aspect of the issue.  We know there has been a series of horrendous incidents of abuse perpetrated by members of the church which have resulted in prosecutions, convictions and the publication of many reports.  To return to a point made during the Second Stage debate, we also know that children are far more likely to be abused in families by people they know and to a greater extent, the incidence of abuse is not as a result of anything to do with religious faiths, the Catholic Church or any other faith.  It is important to keep this in context.</P>
        <P>I also think the sacerdotal privilege issue is terribly interesting from a media perspective but is tangential to any of the issues we are dealing with.  I will return to my previous point on all the reports, including the Murphy report into the Archdiocese of Dublin and the Diocese of Cloyne, or Mr. Justice Ryan&rsquo;s report on the work of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  None of the investigations arose from abuse that was disclosed to a priest in confession that was kept secret.  It was all about abuse in all sorts of other circumstances that was not reported or abusers being in a position to continue abusing children and having multiple victims.  Abuse of the sacerdotal privilege is a terribly interesting theoretical issue that excites some people outside this House but is not central to the legislation.  It is a side issue.  The essential issue is to ensure that the legislation we are enacting makes it a criminal offence to conceal information regarding a serious offence committed against a child or vulnerable adult, including a sexual abuse offence.  That applies right across the board to everybody.</P>
        <P>Among the issues raised by Senator Jim Walsh was where a child is persuaded to say that he or she does not want to tell the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Of course, a child may be persuaded to say that now.  However, in the past the same child may equally be persuaded not to tell garda&iacute;.  It may never occur to the child that the matter should be reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We live in an imperfect world and one cannot solve every possible problem that arises.  We may have a case at some point in time where a person being prosecuted under this legislation makes a case for not reporting child abuse because the child did not want it reported.  However, the child may state that is not true and a court will have to decide who is telling the truth.  The woman cohabiting with another man who as a result of the pressure he puts on her does not report abuse has no defence under this Bill.  This Bill in defining family members makes it quite clear, that if a child is being abused by a family member, one cannot on behalf of a child determine not to report the matter.  A medical practitioner or a psychologist may for some reason temporarily not report the case, but if a cohabitant abuses a child, that does not give the parent an exemption to not report the case or exempt the parent from a possible prosecution.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the legislation is to put out a simple and coherent message that one has an obligation to report all instances of abuse.  Senator Hayden replied to the sacerdotal privilege and the confessional.  The legislation gives no exemption to anybody.  In the unlikely event of a paedophile exposing the priest to whom he or she made a confession of abusing a child in the confessional and did not report the matter to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I cannot guarantee  this will result in a prosecution.  This will not happen and this is why it is a theoretical issue in practical terms.</P>
        <P>Let us take the case of the serial abuser in Australia who kept on going to confession but continued to abuse a multiplicity of children.  At some stage it becomes known that a particular priest had known about what the abuser was doing for a very long time.  To respond to the question of whether the priest involved in this case could be prosecuted under this legislation when enacted, the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Will the priest argue the case and put up a defence?  He may well do and the Supreme Court will decide it.  It is not central to the legislation.  The claim being made that a priest or bishop who is made aware of abuse is generally exempt from giving information to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under this legislation is entirely wrong.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully agree with what the Minister said in his response, but there can be occasions where a child who has been abused may in the course of making his or her confession, confess that to a priest, and this is where a difficulty may arise.  Responsibility lies with the priest.  That was the point I was making, not that the abuser would report the priest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Then there would be the issue of whether the child wanted the abuse reported.  If the child wanted the abuse to be reported, the child could report it and would not need to tell the priest.  We can go round in circles.  This legislation is as robust as it can be.  I have no doubt that it may be tested in the courts.  It provides a robust criminal law to try to ensure crucial information is furnished to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by those who have such information.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 14 adds the offence under the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2012 to the list of offences in Schedule 1.  These offences are not being added to Schedule 2, as withholding information in relation to those offences against a vulnerable adult is already an offence under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.</P>
        <P>In the context of this amendment, I wish to address an oversight in the recently enacted Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2012.  The commencement provision contained in section 16 of that Act provides that &ldquo;This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may appoint by order or orders either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so appointed for different purposes or provisions.&rdquo;  However, it fails to clarify which Minister.  The reference to the Minister should be to the Minister for Health.  We are making this amendment in this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 16 is a consequential amendment to amendment No. 11, ensuring that the Long Title of this Bill is also providing for the amendment to the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) 2012 Act.

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a technical amendment to reflect the fact that the offences against children which are listed in Schedule 1 differ to a certain extent to the offences listed in Schedule 2 and which relate to vulnerable persons.  This answers Senator Bradford&rsquo;s question.  There are two reasons for the differences in the Schedules.  First, a number of the offences in Schedule 1 are children-specific offences and I think Senator Bradford anticipated this particular one.  Second, there are other offences contained in Schedule 1 that are not in Schedule 2, such as murder and manslaughter.</P>
        <P>The offence of withholding information under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 applies to serious offences, excluding sexual offences.  Consequently, the offences relating to murder and manslaughter of any adult, including a vulnerable adult, are covered by sections 8 and 9 of the 1998 Act.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House.  Last week I also raised this issue.  As the Minister is present, I welcome the publication of the heads of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill.  I acknowledge his commitment to establish the new body that will be strengthened in its ability to respect human rights and the equal status of everyone in our society.  I also acknowledge how swiftly he has moved in response to the working group&rsquo;s report that was grounded in a substantial public consultation process.  As the Senators and the Minister are aware, the report is based not only on insights from the public consultation process but up-to-date substantive literature regarding best practice of mergers within a comparative context.  What came through from the working group&rsquo;s report, particularly the executive summary, was that from almost every source, both the consultation and the theoretical literature, a recurring theme emerged that the new organisation must be independent and comply with the UN and Paris Principles.  My questions centre on the potency of the new body&rsquo;s effectiveness and its ability to operate with genuine independence. Resources play an integral part in both.</P>
        <P>I also raise my questions in the context of the &euro;3.4 million cut from the budgets of the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority since 2008.  As a former member of the Irish Human Rights Commission I saw at first hand how the reduction impacted on our work.  Even with the &ldquo;open for business&rdquo; approach that the commission&rsquo;s president, Dr. Maurice Manning, and the former CEO, Mr. &Eacute;amonn Mac Aodha, had after those cuts, without question the commission had to cut back in exercising its functions with the consequent effect of having less of an impact on the protection and promotion of human rights in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the effectiveness of the new body, I note and welcome head 28 of the Bill which stipulates, &ldquo;The Commission shall be provided with sufficient resources to ensure that it can carry out each of its functions effectively.&rdquo;  In regard to the independence of the new body I note that the working group outlined how financial security is a core component of institutional independence.    Given the restrictions on the budgets of the two bodies and the working group&rsquo;s assessment that neither body is able to carry out its full mandate in the light of these restrictions, how will the new commission achieve independence and effectiveness?  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, indicated recently that there would be an immediate saving of &euro;500,000 following the merger.  Where will these savings be made?  It does not appear we will go anywhere near ensuring the provision of proper resources to carry out the enhanced functions of the new commission in the context of what is provided for in the heads of the Bill.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s plans to ensure the new body will achieve &ldquo;A&rdquo; status from the international co-ordinating committee of the national human rights institutions and thereby indicate that we will comply with the Paris Principles, to which, of course, independence and effectiveness are central?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>I take the opportunity to emphasise the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to promoting respect for human rights and equality of opportunity in Irish society and the Minister&rsquo;s personal commitment to a successful merger of the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister who has been moving between the two Houses all day.  No matter how superhuman one is, one needs a food break.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister said last week when announcing Government approval of the general scheme of the Bill to create the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, our society will benefit from having a strong and effective human rights and equality body.  The two bodies mentioned have their strengths and the Minister intends that the new commission will combine the best of both.  By pulling the two together we are aiming to keep the strengths of each and build something new that will be more effective than the sum of the existing two bodies in pursuing its mandate.  The levelling up of powers and functions, the introduction of a new role in supporting public bodies to have due regard to equality and human rights issues in their work and the creation of a sliding scale of possible interventions and powers which can be exercised in a nuanced way commensurate with the nature of the problem, including as a last resort, an effective power of inquiry and powers to initiate court action will all serve to make this a more effective body than its two predecessors combined.  </P>
        <P>The Minister is aware of the history of funding cuts in the two bodies in the past four to five years.  He has made strengthening the new commission and ensuring it complies unequivocally with the Paris Principles a personal commitment in the preparation of the Bill to establish the new body and in the merger process.  He is of the view that it is of crucial importance to ensure the new body will achieve the highest international standing and domestic credibility for its independence and remit.  Accordingly, the general scheme of the Bill provides for an independent selection process to nominate people for appointment to the new commission and for their appointment by the President following the passing of a resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  For this reason, the general scheme of the Bill also strengthens the powers and functions available to the new commission, introduces a new role of supporting public bodies in having due regard to equality and human rights issues in their work and creates a sliding scale of possible interventions and powers.</P>
        <P>As the Senator has highlighted, the new commission&rsquo;s resources, used effectively, efficiently and strategically, will be one of the key factors in its successful establishment and future operation.  The working group set up to advise on practical issues in the merger recommended that the new commission, as a priority initial task, undertake a review of its staffing needs to compile the evidence for a business case to meet essential additional staff needs it may identify, over and above the staff complements of the existing two bodies which will transfer to it.  The annual financial allocation for the new commission will fall to be determined in the light of the budget for the relevant years and be announced in that context in due course.  The Minister cannot pre-empt the budget.  While stressing the seriousness of the fiscal situation we face and the severe staffing constraints that apply across the public service, he has asked me to reiterate his openness to have such a business case examined by the Department in as favourable a light as possible, even in current circumstances.  In significantly streamlining the complex governance arrangements of the agencies which comprised two chief executives and up to 16 board members of the Equality Authority and a 15 member commission, projected savings are in the region of &euro;500,000 per annum in related expenditure.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention that this money will be available to support the core work of the new commission.</P>
        <P>The Government is confident that the high standing and reputation the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority have each achieved internationally will be maintained by the new body.  The question of its accreditation is a matter for the new commission to pursue and the ICC to assess in due course.  The package of legislative proposals set out in the general scheme, as published, is a very strong foundation for the new commission.  The Minister&rsquo;s intention is that the Bill will be published and enacted in the course of 2012.  The question of resources will come into focus when the new commission prepares its assessment of its staffing needs.</P>
        <P>As the Minister indicated, the selection process for the new commission will commence shortly and the persons selected by the independent selection panel will be appointed to the boards of the existing bodies in order that the two organisations can start to operate as a cohesive whole, with a transition programme being prepared and put in place.  Therefore, the two boards, operating as one unit, can commence preparing a strategic plan for the new body and that work can be taken forward rapidly in the staffing review and other preparatory work envisaged in the working group&rsquo;s report.</P>

        <P>I again express my appreciation and that of the Minister to the Senator for raising this topic which is of great importance not only to the Government but also the entire country.  The Minister is keen to raise public awareness of the merger proposal and what it will involve, as well as the opportunities it offers in facilitating further public engagement on the broader human rights and equality agenda in Irish society.  For this reason, as he announced last week, he has asked the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to examine the general scheme and engage in a further focused consultation process with civil society and other interested parties on the entire range of important issues related to the establishment of the new commission.  Debates such as this help to ensure the public is fully aware of what we intend to do.</P>

	<P>I welcome the statement that there is an intent to level up powers and functions in the new commission, as there was huge concern on the part of the two bodies that there would be a levelling downwards rather than upwards.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I am a member, has been asked this week to review head 13.  May I take it that the saving of &euro;500,000 per annum will be made through consolidation of the commission&rsquo;s expenses?  For clarification purposes, what does the Minister mean when he says he is looking for a business case to provide whatever additional resources are required?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>Each Department, irrespective of the additional resources sought, must make its case to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in a businesslike fashion.  That is the Minister&rsquo;s intention.  We are all aware of the difficulties encountered in the two organisations as a result of the reductions in funding.  For example, there were certain projects they would have wished to undertake but could not do so because of a lack of resources in terms of expertise.  We understand there will be certain areas within the new commission in which there may be a lack of expertise.  That is what the Minister is talking about.  In the event that there are gaps in the organisation he has said that if a case is made to him, he will ensure it is looked on in as favourable a light as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s response is very helpful.  It is important to stress the gaps in expertise, particularly those related to the exercise of the functions set down in the legislation, as distinct from additional projects and other matters.  The bodies in question must exercise their functions to be effective and independent and ultimately to comply with the Paris Principles.</P>

    <sTitle>Certificate of Irish Heritage Scheme</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Costello, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for dealing with the matter I raise.  I am interested to find out how many certificates of Irish heritage have been issued and paid for since the scheme was initiated.  I fully support the Irish heritage certificate scheme, which is a positive and innovative initiative.  I am conscious that a number of high profile individuals have been recipients of the certificates, notably President Barack Obama, to whom a certificate was presented by the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and visiting Ministers during the recent St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period in an event that generated positive media coverage for Ireland.  The first certificate also generated positive coverage, although of a much more poignant nature as it was presented posthumously by the T&aacute;naiste in September 2011 to Joseph Hunter, a New York fireman who died tragically in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001.  The presentation to Mr. Hunter&rsquo;s family was a worthy beginning to the initiative.</P>
        <P>I am curious to learn how many other certificates have been issued and what system is used for issuing them.  I am conscious also that certificates have been presented to former President Bill Clinton and Lord Sebastian Coe.  I learned from the relevant website that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, issues a certificate on behalf of the Government.  Certificates are presented to those who have ancestors born in Ireland but not to those who were born here and recipients must be aged over 18 years.  People are also assisted in applying for certificates on the website.  I read some of the customer testimonials which are very nice and several make the point that the certificates encourage people to come and visit Ireland.  I saw one such testimonial from Argentina by a person who states, &ldquo;I would like visit your Country . . . our Country!&rdquo;  The certificates certainly help people to feel a sense of affiliation with this country and if they generate positive trade and tourism links, the scheme will achieve its objective.</P>
        <P>As I noted, I am curious to know how many certificates of Irish heritage have been issued and how many of them have been paid for.  I am conscious that there is significant value in awarding the certificates free of charge and I anticipate that a considerable number of them will have been awarded by the Government.  To give them away for free is in itself valuable if it generates positive publicity for us in other countries.  I presume President Obama and former President Clinton did not pay for their certificates.  There is immense value in having a facility to give away this type of certificate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman, Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill, and Senator Bacik for their words of welcome.  I also welcome Senator Bacik&rsquo;s remarks in support of the Irish heritage certificate scheme.</P>
        <P>Since coming to office in March 2011, the Government has repeatedly stated its belief that our diaspora can make a meaningful contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  The Gathering, the Global Irish Network, the certificate of Irish heritage, the emigrant support programme, Connect Ireland and our support for local initiatives such as Ireland Reaching Out, are central to our goal of strengthening our links with the global Irish.  The certificate of Irish heritage was developed in response to a strong demand from members of our diaspora.  The proposal was included in the strategic review of Ireland-US relations produced by our ambassador to Washington in 2009.  The idea was warmly received at the time by the Irish-American community and endorsed by participants at the 2009 Global Irish Economic Forum in Farmleigh.</P>
        <P>The first certificate was presented by the T&aacute;naiste in September 2011 to the family of Joseph Hunter, a New York fire fighter who lost his life on 11 September 2001.  Mr. Hunter symbolised many of the traits of our diaspora.  Although not born in Ireland, he embraced the heritage of his mother and father.  His reputation and honest work in his parents&rsquo; adopted home continue the trend of so many who went before him.  Since then, presentations have been made to a number of well known individuals, including former President Clinton, President Obama and Lord Coe in London.</P>
        <P>Vibrant Irish communities with a strong sense of their Irish heritage across the world have been essential in helping to rebuild Ireland in the past and I am sure they will continue to help in the current environment.  The certificate is an appreciation of the strong and enduring connection to Ireland felt by many people.  It is a sincere gesture on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland to reach out and acknowledge both individual connections, such as those of Joseph Hunter, and also the wider connections at community level.  The certificate provides an opportunity for people to engage with Ireland and discover more about their history, their heritage and the country.  We should encourage those families in the United States or Australia who want to sit down together and study the census records and birth certificates of grandmothers and great-grandmothers and see what their lives were like.  Applying for a certificate, either for oneself or as a gift, provides an opportunity to do this.</P>
        <P>To date, 682 certificates have been purchased and 58 have been issued as presentations or to competition winners.  Our follow-up contact with some of the early recipients has shown a very positive and emotional response, particularly as the certificate was an official recognition by the Government of the recipient&rsquo;s heritage.  The Irish abroad unit in my Department and Fexco, which operates the certificate programme on our behalf, remain in ongoing contact on the operation of the certificate and, in particular, to increasing awareness of its existence.  In response to market research, several upgrades have been introduced to enhance the process and product.  We will continue to work with all relevant partners to ensure the ongoing success of the certificate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his full response in providing the relevant figures and more information on the background to the Irish heritage certificates.  As I noted, the scheme is a worthwhile and valuable initiative.  The Minister of State referred to market research.  Is it planned to market and publicise the certificates more widely to encourage increased take-up from other countries?  I presume such efforts are being undertaken in conjunction with the Gathering event to be held next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>While I cannot provide a direct answer to the Senator&rsquo;s question, I will revert to her on the matter.  I presume work is being done on this issue.  A different Department is responsible for the Gathering and it deals with the marketing of the event.  Marking and highlighting the Irish heritage of people is integral to the certificate of Irish heritage scheme.  As the Gathering is focused on bringing people of Irish ancestry to this country, I expect the scheme to be a strong focus of the work being done in that area.  I will obtain the information the Senator seeks.</P>
