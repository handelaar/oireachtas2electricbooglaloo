      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the EU fiscal compact treaty (resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 12.25 p.m., if not previously concluded &mdash; this is to allow the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, to reply to the many questions posed during the debate; and No. 2, Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 2 p.m. and conclude not later than 4 p.m., if not previously concluded.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Last December my party colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, tabled an amendment to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2011 to give the Financial Services Ombudsman the power to name financial institutions in breach of codes of conduct.  Members will have seen the report for 2010 which states 7,200 complaints about financial institutions were made by members of the public, many of which were related to institutions not adhering to the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The problem that arises in this regard is that the ombudsman is toothless.  While he can publish a report, he cannot name the institutions in breach of or not following the procedures correctly.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to liaise with the Minister for Finance on whether he proposes to accept the amendment tabled in December by Deputy Michael McGrath to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2011.  It is in all of our interests to know which financial institutions are adhering to Government policy and statutory codes of conduct.  Issuing a report indicating the number and type of complaints made without pinpointing the financial institutions involved does not go far enough.</P>
        <P>During our debate on 8 February on Second Stage of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011, Committee and Remaining Stages of which are being taken today, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, confirmed that the warmer homes scheme initiated by the previous Government, under which approximately 6,000 jobs had been created, had supported 5,800 jobs last year and that this year, owing to a cut in the grant available for external insulation works, in particular, from &euro;4,000 to &euro;1,800, it would only support 4,500 jobs, a decrease of 1,300.</P>
        <P>I have met people involved in small construction firms who have diversified into this area.  The construction sector has been hit more than any other by the current crisis and I have been told that at least 1,600 jobs have been lost in it since announcement of the budget.  A debate on the jobs plan which I am reading and does not state additional money will be made available <Col N="2"/>in this regard is due to take place in the House soon.  More than &euro;35 million has been cut from the allocation for the warmer homes scheme which is supporting people involved in an industry which has been hammered during the past few years.  This makes no sense, as Ireland is required to meet its energy targets by 2020.  This is to be achieved by way of the conservation of energy and having warmer homes which can only be done through the creation of employment in the construction sector in which some 1,600 jobs have been lost since the announcement in the budget of a cut in funding for the warmer homes scheme.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to raise this issue with the Minister for Finance.  I will also be raising it again today with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, as it is an issue of concern to all Members of the House.  The scheme supports jobs.  The Minister has confirmed that there are at least 1,300 fewer in the sector.  My figure is 1,600.  I would appreciate it if the Leader would raise the matter with the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien referred to the financial institutions.  I am requesting the Leader to consider how this House can best liaise with the committees of both Houses.  Yesterday the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality had a three hour discussion on the heads of the insolvency Bill which was attended by a wide range of interested parties, including the Irish Bankers Federation, the Association of Insolvency Practitioners and representatives of FLAC.  It afforded us a valuable opportunity to question, in particular, members of the Irish Bankers Federation about the practices engaged in in lending to customers during the boom years and what has been done since to alleviate pressure on mortgage holders.  It strikes me that it would be useful if there was in place a formal mechanism to allow committees to report back to this House on some of the issues raised.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform also held hearings on similar issues during the past few weeks.  There is a good deal of work being done outside this Chamber and the D&aacute;il on issues to do with financial institutions, accountability and providing greater protection for mortgage holders.  The hearings on the heads of the insolvency Bill are a valuable part of this work, of which, perhaps, Members of the House, with the exception of those who are members of committees, are not sufficiently aware.</P>
        <P>I renew my call for a debate on higher education.  I note the formal opening took place yesterday in Trinity College Dublin of the school of medicine in the new Biomedical Sciences Institute on Pearse Street by the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, which was opened last June.  This is a very important innovation and initiative which it is hoped will generate a good number of jobs.  It is already generating a great deal of research which will lead to further innovations in bioscience.  This is an area in which our biomedical departments are leaders.  I, therefore, seek a debate on higher education in the context of such initiatives taking place in both Trinity College Dublin and other institutions of higher education.</P>
        <P>I congratulate President Rousseff of Brazil.  A major feature on her Cabinet has been published in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> in which it is pointed out that she has appointed women to ten of the 39 ministerial posts.  She is trying to ensure greater participation by women in the political system in Brazil.  The report states it is languishing with a female parliamentary participation rate of 12%, well below the average in Latin America, albeit not far off Ireland&rsquo;s very poor representation rate of 15% in the D&aacute;il.  It is, of course, much better in the Seanad.  Interestingly, however, Brazil has failed to introduce the legislation Ireland is introducing &mdash; it was debated in the House yesterday &mdash; to ensure political parties will be required to ensure at least 30% of their candidates will be of each gender.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I revert to a matter ventilated in the House yesterday, the review of embassies and, in particular, representation at the Vatican.  I strongly support the work of the diplomatic corps.  Ireland is extremely well served by it, although it is small when compared with that of other states such as the Netherlands.  It does very good work and we get good value from it.  As for the Vatican, I understand the new papal nuncio will present his credentials to President Higgins today.  I welcome him and hope he will have a successful tour of duty here.  I understand he is a close confidant and associate of Pope Benedict XVI, which shows the seriousness with which the Vatican is taking its relations with Ireland.  However, charges were made on this side of this House yesterday against the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, to the effect that there was a personal vendetta that was ideologically driven against the Vatican and he personally had selected the embasssy for closure.  However, in the D&aacute;il yesterday Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin blew the whistle on that suggestion when he indicated that precisely the same three targets had been presented to him but that he had turned them down.  While he may have turned them down, this indicates clearly that the list pre-existed the formation of the current Administration and the remarks made should be withdrawn.  They were obviously factually wrong and perhaps ideologically driven.</P>
        <P>This morning the former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. David Andrews, appeared on Newstalk.  He is a man who has appeared in this House and showed great independence of mind and courage on the situation in Timor Leste.  He also spoke about the strength of the diplomatic corps but stated that, on practical grounds, he considered having one embassy in Rome was correct.  His is a voice that also should be listened to.  Moreover, he started from a philosophical view that I also have brought forward in the House on the question of whether a church should also be a state.  I will quote from the gospel according to Mark, chapter 12, which is echoed in the gospel according to Luke, chapter 20, &ldquo;Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar&rsquo;s and unto God the things that are God&rsquo;s&rdquo;.  I believe in the separation of church and state and this presents a great moral difficulty for the Roman Catholic Church.</P>

        <P>I refer to the question of bin collection by Greyhound.  This is a very serious matter.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Denis Landy.  I will be brief.  I am concerned about this matter because I myself have received completely contradictory notices from the Greyhound company as to the day on which I should leave out the bins.  Everyone is in a mess and there does not appear to have been a proper tendering process.  The company has a bad record and was obliged to repay money to CIE.  In addition, the council members had their view overturned by the diktat of the city manager&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I seek a debate on this serious issue, particularly in the light of the waste of money.  I understand Ernst &amp; Young had its services secured, at a cost of a &euro;250,000 to provide a list.  I could do it in half an hour.  Someone should, please, appoint me as a consultant, as I could do with &euro;250,000.  Moreover, I would do the job efficiently and for less.  Next time, let the council seek tenders.  I will provide such a list and while I will not charge the council  &euro;250,000, I will charge it a good fat fee.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senators Feargal Quinn and Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien on the Private Members&rsquo; motion they introduced last night which enabled a fantastic discussion to take place with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, on the food industry and the issue of food waste.  I also compliment the Minister on being willing to accommodate the two Senators by accepting most of the motion&rsquo;s contents and coming to arrangement whereby the debate on the motion was adjourned to enable further discussions to take place.  The debate facilitated a comprehensive discussion of food and food labelling and, in particular, food waste.  It is highly appropriate to discuss the issue of food waste at a time when so many people throughout the world do not have enough to eat.  </P>
        <P>I raise an issue brought to my attention over Christmas concerning a practice being engaged in by a large multiple which I consider to have contributed to the production of a great deal of food waste.  The multiple in question was forcing its suppliers to overstock the supermarkets and put more products on the shelves than would be sold.  This resulted in much of the stock being left on the shelves over the Christmas period and because the supplier was forced to take back that product&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise a serious matter that was highlighted yesterday in the Irish language newspaper, <i>Foinse</i>, which is published with the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  The headline that appeared in yesterday&rsquo;s edition was, &ldquo;Mic l&eacute;inn ag dul gan bh&eacute;il&iacute; mar gheall ar chostais arda&rdquo;, that is, students are going without meals because of high costs.  This is a serious issue that shows starkly the pressure being exerted on third level students as a result of the economic crisis.  The article reports that many students are going without food owing to the high cost of transport, the lack of part-time jobs and rising registration fees.  This was an eye-opener for me, as I assume it would be for many Members.  The article reports that many students are living on &euro;1 a day as a result of being obliged to pay their registration fees of &euro;2,500 per year, as well as significantly more expensive bus and train fares.  I was shocked to learn that certain students from Trinity College Dublin were reporting they could only afford one meal a day.  Consequently, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to discuss this important matter.  Many students appear to be availing of welfare services and vouchers from student unions.  I commend the student unions which are providing such services.  However, it certainly is shocking if students are going without meals.  Although this should not happen, it is and a number of student union officials were quoted in the article.  I pay tribute to the iriseoir of <i>Foinse</i>, Ms Orla Bradshaw, for carrying the story in the newspaper.  If the student registration fee is increased next year and in future years, as the Government has indicated, many students will be forced to drop out of education, thereby jeopardising the country&rsquo;s future economic and social prosperity.  Consequently, I seek a debate on the issue of students going without meals.  Members should face up to the realities being reported in the daily and weekly newspapers.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  My question relates to people being fined for not displaying national car test, NCT, certificates on their cars.  If a traffic warden places a ticket on a car in respect of the non-display of an NCT certificate, he or she is doing so without knowing whether the owner of the vehicle has actually applied to have the test carried out.  Traffic wardens are not in a position to check computer records in order to discover whether a test has been applied for.  As a result, people are being fined in respect of the non-display of NCT certificates when some of them have evidence &mdash; either written or in the form of a mobile phone text &mdash; that they have applied to have their vehicles tested.  When these cases go to court, they are thrown out by judges.  This means that the time of traffic wardens, the courts and judges is being wasted.  Under the Road Traffic Act 2010, road traffic wardens were given responsibility for checking whether people are displaying NCT certificates on their cars.  However, they lack the equipment necessary to allow them to do the job properly.  I request, therefore, that the legislation be amended.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am also seeking that the provisions of this legislation which relate to the imposition of fines for road traffic offences be amended.  What happens is that a fine is issued, then a reminder is sent and a registered letter is dispatched.  If the latter is not signed for &mdash; there are many serial offenders who do not pay fines &mdash; it is returned to the relevant local authority.  Literally thousands of these letters are being stored in boxes in local authority offices throughout the country.  There is a need for a new system to be put in place in order to ensure that these fines are paid.  I ask that the relevant Minister re-examine the parts of the Road Traffic Act 2010 which relate to the matters to which I refer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank everyone who contributed to last night&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; debate on food.  Senators raised a wide range of issues and I ask the Leader to keep in touch with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this issue.  The Minister has promised to forward to us the replies to questions in respect of which information was not available last evening.  I compliment Senator Mullins on the congratulations he extended to the Minister.</P>
        <P>I raise this matter again because yesterday I read an article on obesity and unhealthy and non-staple foods which indicates that a proposal has been put forward in the US to the effect that people should be prevented from using food stamps to purchase unhealthy foods.  At present, these food stamps cannot be used to purchase alcohol or tobacco.  In this country we pay people child benefit but we have no control over how that money is spent.  In the United States they use the system of food stamps to which I refer and people cannot use their stamps to purchase tobacco or alcohol.  We cannot control our system in such a way and I do not know whether we should be in a position to do so.  However, it might be appropriate if we were to take some form of action in order that we might meet the challenge we face in the fight against obesity and unhealthy foods.</P>

	<P>A report issued today by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, states that almost half of the wastewater treatment plants which serve urban centres are failing to achieve national and EU standards.  The report also indicates that treatment plants in Cork city, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Meath and Dundalk must meet the requirements relating to nutrient reduction.  There is a need for the House to take note of this report.  I suggest that the Leader request the Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht to invite Mr. Dara Lynott, director of the EPA&rsquo;s office of environmental enforcement, to come before it.  I will certainly be proposing that Mr. Lynott be invited to address my party&rsquo;s internal committee.  However, that is a separate matter.  This will be a crucial issue for the men, women and children of this country during the next 20 years.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I seek a debate on the household charge.  We have not had such a debate since the charge was introduced.  It is clear to many people that not only is this charge unfair but that it is also deeply unpopular.  The Leader will be aware that Waterford City Council passed a motion against the household charge on an eight to five basis.  Many people are not registering for it and are not paying the charge.  This is not because they want to break the law, it is simply due to the fact that they cannot afford to pay.  People believe they are getting the thin end of the wedge and that the charge will continue to rise and will be followed by water and all sorts of other charges.  I have been asked whether the Government intends to amend the Fines Act in respect of people who are brought to court because they cannot afford to pay the household charge.  Is it planned to amend that Act in order that any fines can be deducted directly from people&rsquo;s social welfare payments or wages?  It would be disgraceful if this were to happen.  Trying to force people to register to pay a charge they believe to be unfair is nothing short of bully boy tactics on the part of the Government.</P>

Likewise, a person who lives in a two-bedroom house should not be obliged to pay the same amount as someone who lives in a mansion.  The Government should admit its mistake and then bring forward its plans for a so-called progressive property tax in order that we might examine them.  This flat, regressive &euro;100 charge should be abolished.  Does the Government intend to amend the Fines Act?  If it does, when will amending legislation be brought forward.

	<P>Yes.  Approximately two weeks ago, I raised the issue of the payment system relating to the household charge.  I have been contacted by many people seeking to discover where and how they can pay this charge.  Advertisements relating to the charge have not appeared on local radio stations or in local newspapers.  People have written cheques but they do not know where to send them.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to put in place an advertising campaign in order to inform people how they can pay the household charge.  Those who have decided to pay want to get on with doing so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senators Cullinane and Sheahan in respect of what they each said.  I suspect the Government is somewhat embarrassed with regard to this charge and is, therefore, not going to go out of its way to oblige people to pay it.  The introduction of the household charge has had unintended consequences, particularly in the context of the tourism industry.  In my constituency, where tourism is the mainstay of the local economy, a particular family has, in the past 30 years through its own efforts and without any State aid, built more than half a dozen traditional Irish holiday cottages which it markets successfully.  As a result of the downturn, like many other family-owned tourist operators the family is struggling to keep its head above water.  Families like these are not corporations or limited companies.  They will now be liable for this tax on top of the second home tax they have also had to pay because they are not exempt.  They will be liable for a bill in excess of &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,500 on top of all of their other costs.  This is not happening in County Leitrim only; it is happening in every part of the country, but particularly along the west coast of Ireland, where there has been a tradition of establishing traditional Irish cottages which appeal particularly to the continental European market.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I call on the Government to introduce an exemption.  I have the greatest respect and affection for, and a personal friendship with, the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism who is a west of Ireland man doing a great job.  I call on him to make representations to his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, to introduce an exemption, with guidelines and strictures, for those involved in tourism to prevent this tax damaging an already fragile industry throughout the west of Ireland.  It is unfair and morally wrong.  As the Minister has stated it is not the most equitable tax which has been implemented in advance of the progressive tax he will introduce.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The tourism industry is already on its knees in certain parts of the west and this will kill it off.  All I am asking is that an exemption is introduced.  It is in the Minister&rsquo;s power to do so.  The Minister of State with responsibility for tourism will come to the House and mention the great strides and great improvements being made.  Yesterday we heard about the creation of jobs as a result of the reduction in the VAT rate last summer.  This is all very welcome but why give with one hand and take away with the other?  The Government cannot justify this.</P>

A particular patron has made an application to be patron of a new Gaelscoil in north Kildare.  The Department of Education and Skills has sought expressions of interest for patronage of the new school, <Col N="9"/>and An Coiste Bunaithe has twice made an application to be its patron but these have been ignored.

        <P>The decision on patronage will be made on 24 February.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Skills to say why the expression of interest has not been posted?  The Minister has stated that parental demand for plurality and diversity will be taken into consideration in the establishment of any school and I agree with this.  Parental preferences should be central to considering the type of school to be recognised.  I call on the Minister to put his words into action and take into consideration the parents of these 1,600 children and the children.

	<P Just="Left">In the past year there has been intermittent but considerable outrage on the issue of the personal assets of people who are in debt to NAMA and, in turn, to the same taxpayer whose health and social services are being depleted to meet the terms of our external financial requirements.  It appears that has been a policy of individuals attempting to hide their wealth by transferring it to the names of family members to maintain their family homes at a time when they are in substantial debt to the State.  Understandably people feel very aggrieved about this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is apparently unrelated, but what I believe is a related issue, is that it is reported in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> that very substantial donations, which were heretofore not disclosed, have been made to major political parties in the State.  On the basis of this morning&rsquo;s relatively superficial perusal of it I can identify at least two and I believe three companies which are now in NAMA which made donations to political parties.  As a result they are co-culprits in the economic demise of the country and a drain on the country&rsquo;s resources and social services.  I am sorry we do not have the capacity to get a large quorum of turkeys to vote for Christmas but my belief is that we need a policy of a complete ban on all corporate donations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">I do.  If we are to provide services for citizens we must have money to pay for them.  Last week I met the manager of a hotel which pays &euro;10,000 a week in commercial rates.  This is the reality of what the commercial sector pays to local authorities.  We need to get real; if we want services we must have money to pay for them.  We can no longer borrow <i>ad infinitum</i> and decide we will not pay for the services.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I tabled a matter on the Adjournment on the globalisation fund.  In his reply the Minister of State outlined that the retraining courses people can take do not have to be provided by VECs or State educational institutions.  This is a welcome development but, according to people seeking retraining, many of the training courses being offered are out of date.  If we have a debate on education, we should address the issue of upskilling the trainers who are supposed to upskill those who require retraining.  Many of the courses have not been changed in recent years and they are out of date.  For example, I was advised by an employer last weekend that he would not take on someone from a VEC secretarial course because audio-typing training is not provided.  That basic skill should be provided for anyone doing a secretarial course.  It sounds like someone has sat back for years and not done anything about bringing in modern training techniques and providing training for new skills required for people entering the private sector.  I ask that this issue be included in a debate on the education sector in the not too distant future because we urgently need to review the training provided by VECs and other service providers being paid for by the taxpayer.</P>

I support what the Senator said in that regard.  We should do everything we can to get people back to work and that is the Government's plan.  If there is a restriction, the scheme should be examined again. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bacik asked for greater liaison between committees and the Seanad regarding business.  I am willing to debate reports from the various committees in the House and we will do that, if necessary.  The Senator also called for a debate on higher education, as she did yesterday, and I have asked the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen mentioned the debate on food waste and food production.  The debate will be resumed but a few matters must be thrashed out with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It was an excellent debate yesterday but it was a pity more Members were not in the House to listen to it.  Approximately 20 Members were breaking down the doors calling for HSE plans for the south and everywhere else around the country to be debated in the House but only ten were present for the debate with the Minister for Health.  Members shout and roar for debates but when they are held, only a handful of Senators are present.  It does no good for the perception of the House among the public.</P>
        <P>Senator Landy referred to the issue of fines for not displaying NCT discs.  I am sure common sense would be applied in this regard.  If motorists have arranged a test, they can go to the body that issues the fine to say they have done so.  Common sense should apply and the fine should be dropped.  I do not see why these cases should go to court.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn inquired about the use of food stamps.  I am sure there would be a great deal of opposition if we decreed how people should spend their benefits.  However, the matter should be discussed.</P>

We will have what he asked for, a progressive property tax, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has stated that this will happen.  I hope we will have the full support of the Senator when that progressive property tax is put in place.  He is on record as saying he supports such a tax to be used for local government services and so on, which I welcome.

      <Speaker pid="LucindaCreighton"><NameTxt>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last occasion many questions were asked and in going through them I will provide as much detail and clarity as possible.  </P>
        <P>I will begin with questions posed by Senator Terry Leyden who asked specifically if the provisions of the intergovernmental treaty would apply to Ireland as soon as it left the programme on 1 January 2014 or if they would apply at a later stage.  The answer is clear.  Post-2015 when we emerge from the excessive deficit procedure, there will be a three year transition period and the obligations under the fiscal compact treaty will not kick in until 2018.  That is not an interpretation of the treaty; it is also set out in the six pack of measures agreed between <Col N="13"/>member states last year.  In the annex to the six pack it is clearly stated in regard to Ireland that all the provisions will come into effect in 2018.  The transition period has been designed to give breathing space to countries in excessive deficit procedures and allow them an opportunity to emerge from the very difficult decision-making associated with meeting all the obligations provided for in the programmes in which Portugal, Ireland and Greece are participating and some time to adapt.  That is the flexibility we set out to achieve.  It makes eminent sense that there be an opportunity for countries to adjust.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry Leyden also asked if the treaty was geared towards ensuring a referendum would not take place.  I began to address that question at the end of our session last week.  The answer is no.  Members may not believe my assurances, but I am not aware of any government setting out in international negotiations with the objective to deliberately avoid the holding of a referendum.  That certainly was not the case in this instance.  Legal advice was sought, as is always the case in the negotiations on any treaty, be they EU or international.  That is the normal practice.  It would be grossly irresponsible for the State not to seek and take legal advice on the wording during the process of negotiation.</P>
        <P>Senator Katherine Zappone asked a number of questions which I will try to deal with as comprehensively as I can.  Her first substantive question was if I could indicate whether any type of mutual insurance mechanism would come on stream after ratification of the treaty.  There are many ways by which one could interpret what is meant by a mutual insurance scheme.  It was agreed to bring forward and fast-track the European Stability Mechanism &mdash; it will be the permanent financial rescue fund of the European Union &mdash; on foot of the negotiations between member states to agree the text of the intergovernmental treaty.  The size of the fund was also agreed in the course of the negotiations &mdash; it now stands at &euro;500 billion and we have a certain expectation that it will be increased.  It is contained in the statement of the Heads of State and Government that emerged at the informal summit on 30 January that there will be a review of the amount agreed in regard to the European Stability Mechanism.  However, it is anticipated that the fund will be increased in size.  We do not yet know by how much, as it will obviously be subject to negotiation.  There are rumours in the media, on which Members can take a view.  I will not repeat them in the Chamber, but suffice it to say there is an agreement to review the amount.  For us, this is hugely important because as the situation in Greece has become more fraught in recent months, the issue of firewalling and protecting vulnerable countries in the European Union within the eurozone, particularly the other two countries in receipt of funding under IMF programmes, has come to the fore. It is absolutely essential that there be robust firewalls in place.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We can have a debate some other time about the rights and wrongs of how independent is the ECB.  I argue that it is too independent and that it should probably be more accountable to the Council and the European Parliament, but that is the framework of how it was established under the treaties.  This is something that will have to be reviewed in the future.  The ECB, notwithstanding its independence, has clearly responded to the December agreement by issuing the three year loans known as LTROs which have been of major significance in stabilising the eurozone in the last two months and of benefit to Ireland and all other eurozone countries.  That very dramatic step by the ECB was in response to the political agreement reached in December at the second last summit.  We have seen the ECB accelerate its provision of liquidity across the eurozone since the intergovernmental treaty was agreed at the summit on 30 January.  There is a clear link, although we must at all times be mindful of the fact that the ECB is independent.  I hope that answers the question somewhat.</P>
        <P>Senator Katherine Zappone asked about the form the correction mechanism had to take.  She also asked for clarity on the principles of the correction mechanism and whether there <Col N="14"/>would be some flexibility in the identification of a required adjustment path to ensure lengthy austerity did not put us under for good.  In terms of the fiscal implications of the debt correction rule, it is important to remember that the debt-to-GDP ratio is the key element.  In other words, on the basis of reasonable assumptions in the medium term, we can expect economic growth to do a lot of the heavy lifting.  This is very complex and detailed and based on all sorts of economic theories, but I will give a simple example which might shed a little light on it.  Between the 1990s and 2007 Ireland&rsquo;s debt ratio fell from well over 50% of GDP to about 25% &mdash; clearly, a dramatic fall &mdash; while the nominal level of debt increased.  Thus, the nominal amount grew, but the debt-to-GDP ratio fell because of growth in the economy.  This illustrates that it is not simply a question of cutting and cutting, rather by achieving growth over an extended period we automatically reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio.</P>
        <P>Nobody inside or outside this House can predict entirely how much growth there will be and how long it will take.  It is impossible to do so.  We can have forecasts, certainly, and lots of number crunching, but it is absolutely impossible to determine exactly how long it will take and how much growth there will actually be in that period.  Anybody who suggests he or she can give a definitive figure is wrong.  I have heard wild figures being thrown around which I absolutely reject of &euro;5 billion a year in austerity meaures and cuts from 2015 to eternity.  That is patent nonsense because there are no circumstances in which the country would have a zero growth rate.  It is not realistic.  Even last year, while we were in the middle of this deep and difficult economic crisis, the country achieved a 1% growth rate and certainly the forecasts for the years ahead will be more optimistic.  The Department of Finance has its own growth projections, while the ESRI and others have competing ones.  I suspect the reality will be somewhere in between.</P>
        <P>At this time it is impossible to anticipate the growth rate because it depends on so many external factors, including global trade and how serious the European Union is about enhancing the Single Market.  I have said repeatedly that there are huge opportunities to achieve growth if political leaders in Europe take the initiative now.  Many opportunities have been missed in the last 15 years.  There have been wonderful grand plans to increase growth, liberalise trade, eliminate barriers and make it easier for SMEs to access credit, become mobile and penetrate markets all over Europe.  We did not have the impetus to do this in the last 15 to 20 years; we were all far too complacent.  Now we have that impetus and I am confident we will see serious action being taken at a European as well as a domestic level.  Senators are aware of the Government&rsquo;s proposals for job creation, outlined this week by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, which have been well received.  That is an element of the solution, although I will not pretend it is the full solution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some really interesting articles have been published by economists in Ireland in the last few weeks on the debt-to-GDP ratio &mdash; I am sorry I do not have them with me, but I can happily pass them on to Senators &mdash; which take into account a range of elements that have to be considered in calculating the debt burden such as write-downs of mortgage or personal debt that are written into banks&rsquo; own projections and which certain commentators have not taken into account.  Credit card companies, for example, have an in-built mechanism for a debt write-down which is not taken into account in calculating private debt.  All these elements make things very complex but must be taken into account in the process of reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio over a long period.  These are not simply obligations imposed by the intergovernmental treaty; they are obligations that the Government has set out for itself.  We want to reduce the debt burden.  Unsustainable debt levels are not desirable and it is in our interests to reduce the debt burden.  This is, of itself, an essential element in achieving growth and setting out a path forward for the State.</P><Col N="15"/>
        <P>Senator Katherine Zappone also asked about added value.  She particularly wanted to know whether, if we signed up to the treaty, we would be allowed to access the European Stability Mechanism funds should we require them, and whether, if we did not sign up to it, we would be precluded from accessing them.  The simple answer is yes.  The treaty clearly links its ratification with access to ESM funding.  It is not our intention to draw down funding under it; our funding is in place through the EFSF and we are confident that we will meet all our targets, as we have been doing, and that we will emerge from the programme on target.  However, the simple answer is that there is a direct link with the ESM.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must consider the logic behind it.  We obviously see this challenge from one perspective, while the creditor countries &mdash; the remaining triple A credit rated countries in the eurozone &mdash; see it from a very different point of view.  They want some assurances, as they turn a blind eye to the intervention of the ECB in the last two months and agree to enhance the capacity of the ESM, that they are not putting money into a black hole.  That is the sort of language we have heard from a number of finance Ministers of triple A credit rated countries and it is a reasonable perspective.  They must go back to their parliaments, as we do, and explain to taxpayers why they are investing money in these funds, in which there is always a risk involved.  Therefore, they are seeking some type of assurance that if countries intend, or are likely, to draw down funding from the ESM, they will make every effort to reform their economies, restructure their government spending, reform in so far as is possible and make significant strides in reducing their deficit and debt to GDP ratio. That is, objectively, a reasonable assumption. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Senator Gilroy asked a number of questions about achieving a balanced budget within the 3% threshold and how we would agree to the sanctions.  He also asked questions relating to compliance and how we could believe it is fair to codify these terms in law.  Even if it was not required, he wondered if it was desirable.  Finally, he asked if the fiscal compact was not simply a recipe for continued austerity.  These questions are connected to some of the questions that have already been addressed.  The first thing to note is that the elements of the fiscal compact are already European law and we have already signed up to them.  The idea that this is new and that we are putting into law something that was not previously part of the European legal framework is incorrect.  The compact is consolidating it in a treaty and changing one or two of the mechanisms to make it more enforceable and binding.  The implications of that are more significant for bigger member states than for small member states.  As we have seen over the last ten years, when small member states breached the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact and had deficits greater than 3% or their debt-to-GDP ratio grew out of control, proceedings were brought against them.  There was no requirement to achieve a qualified majority of the European Council to do that.  On the other hand, when large member states breached the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact a blind eye was turned because the other countries did not want to club together to vote in favour of imposing sanctions on them.  That burden has now been reversed.  It is necessary to achieve a qualified majority of member states to oppose the automatic introduction of sanctions.  That is the interesting element in this.  It means it is far more likely that the big countries will have to play by the rules, as the small countries have had to do previously.  We should see that as a positive.  When one considers how interconnected we all are in the eurozone and how dependent we are on the performance of other member states, it is in our interest to ensure that all other states play by the rules, particularly the bigger member states.  That is probably the most important development contained in the intergovernmental treaty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We will be required to reduce our debt-to-GDP ratio annually by one twentieth of the difference between the actual rate and the threshold rate of 60%.  Some commentators have suggested that we would have to reduce by one twentieth of the overall rate in each year that <Col N="16"/>we are in an excessive deficit procedure.  That is not the case.  As one reduces the difference between the 60% and the total debt, it is one twentieth of that.  As one reduces it, the proportion one must reduce it by each year is reduced.  That is an important distinction.  It means it is a much slower process, not the type of big bang accelerated process which has been suggested by many people.  During the transition period that applies to Ireland, which lasts for three years following the correction of the excessive deficit procedure, the requirement under the debt correction rule is deemed to be fulfilled if we are making sufficient progress.  That is essentially an allowance for countries emerging from a programme to have a great deal of flexibility and not to rush into this one twentieth per annum rule.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also crucial to stress that reducing the debt ratio is a function of running not just a prudent fiscal policy but also of economic growth.  I made that point previously but it is worth reiterating.  In Ireland we expect growth to do much of the heavy lifting and that is a realistic objective.  We have managed to stabilise the public finances and, most importantly, our banking sector.  I do not wish to reopen the differences in this House and in the D&aacute;il about how we did it.  We are where we are, to use that awful phrase.  However, the bottom line is that we have created a significant amount of confidence in the Government&rsquo;s capacity to deliver, in our banking system generally and across our public finances.  The key element of that stability is that we have generated a great deal of investor confidence, which was absent for the last number of years.  It has been restored.  Investment in the last 18 months has been improving steadily and our exports have grown at a quicker rate than was the case for the previous ten or 15 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a great deal of good news.  This places Ireland in a strong and opportune position to take advantage of growth opportunities.  While growth in the European Union has clearly slowed down dramatically, there is still a big market if one has good products and services and if one is smart about how one exports them and about targeting markets.  Coupled with that, if the European Union does what it says it will do to eliminate barriers within the Single Market and to make it easier for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, to access other markets, Ireland will be far better placed than most countries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I can give an example.  I spent the last three days in Madrid and Lisbon meeting with members of the governments in those countries, members of academia and people from other walks of life.  Portugal&rsquo;s exports account for approximately 30% of its GDP, which is below the European average of 40%.  Ireland&rsquo;s exports account for 100% of our GDP.  We are in a different league in the context of the flexibility of the economy and our capacity to export products and services and to generate growth and, potentially, employment through that process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I give credit to the last Government for a number of the policies it pursued.  Clearly, we have our differences but many of the policies that were pursued in regard to exports and placing Ireland in a competitive position to take advantage of our natural qualities have been successful.  We have continued them.  One can see the work that is done by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  They are very focused.  They have a small team but it is hugely professional.  The same applies to our embassy network and the work it does.  We have huge untapped potential in markets such as France and Germany.  It is interesting to meet Irish business people who are living and working in other European countries and to listen to them talk about the frustration they experience with market access.  There is huge potential if we can just eliminate many of the barriers and difficulties.  I am very confident about our potential to do this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not buy into the negativity we hear much of the time about the economy being crippled, that we have no potential for growth and so forth.  It is simply not true.  If we believe we cannot develop and grow, we will not.  However, if we believe we have potential, if we are ambitious <Col N="17"/>and if we follow through on it, we can grow.  It is that simple.  We must decide which way we want to go.  The Government and I are determined that we will go in the right direction.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a final point in response to the series of questions on the notion that the treaty will lead to years of austerity.  This comes back to the fact that we have already committed to correcting our excessive deficit.  We are already in that procedure and we are making big strides.  It is and has been difficult, and it will continue to be difficult up to 2015.  There is no easy way out of this.  We often hear people saying this is the wrong road and that we should be on some other path.  We rarely hear anyone spell out exactly what that path is.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prioritising making the economy more nimble, getting the public finances back on track, which it is very difficult to argue against, and trying to reduce our debt-to-GDP ratio while receiving billions of euro of funding to keep the State running as we do so is the only solution.  I am not aware of alternative options and I have not heard any Member, of this House or the D&aacute;il, making any concrete proposals as to how better we could do it.  We have heard people advocating unilateral default of our debts.  That is fine, but they do not explain where the funding would come from to run schools and hospitals and to pay for pensions, carers and social welfare benefits.  I have heard no answers to that question.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to face the reality of where we are and plan our way forward.  Part of that is about stabilising the eurozone.  This treaty is an essential element of that stabilisation.  We need to have a discussion based more on fact and less on fantastical views of how we can solve this crisis.  There are no easy answers.  It would be more honest of many Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to acknowledge that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Similar questions were put by Senator Barrett.  There is a considerable overlap between the questions and while I may not have addressed individual Senators&rsquo; questions, I have covered most of what was raised.  Senator Reilly asked about the link between the treaty and the European Stability Mechanism.  I think I have answered that question.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator Reilly asked about the treaty&rsquo;s inflexibility.  I have tried to address some of her concerns regarding the three year transition period and how the one twentieth requirement is calculated.  There was some misunderstanding about this.  One can have flexibility but one must also have rules.  We saw flexibility taken to an extreme in the past, in a way that did not serve the State.  Flexibility is all well and good but we must have parameters and rules by which we set standards, and we must meet those standards.  It is in our interest that we meet them, for some of the reasons I have pointed out.  It is also in our interest that other member states meet them.  In the interconnected world we live in that is now more important than ever.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I answered Senator Colm Burke&rsquo;s question on my previous visit to the House and I will not do so again.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien raised the issue of whether the Government sought a <Col N="18"/>write-down of the debt.  I answered that question on a previous occasion, perhaps not in this House.  We are looking for debt sustainability and our focus is on the promissory notes.  The Government is working hard with the troika to reach an agreement on a reduced interest rate on repayments and potentially &mdash; I do not want to be prescriptive because this is still part of a negotiating process &mdash; on the extension of the repayment period.</P>

        <P Just="Left">With regard to whether we sought a debt write-down, the Minister for Finance had informal but high level contacts with the ECB, with Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet and with other member states and finance Ministers.  It was made abundantly clear that there was no question of a write-down being agreed in a mutual sense at this time.  There has been some criticism of my party, and it has been claimed that we made commitments before the general election to default unilaterally on the debt.  We did not.  It would be irresponsible ever to suggest that a country in a bailout programme should default on its debt.  We committed to try to write down debt through a multilateral process.  It did not work.  It may work in the future.  Who knows?  At this time we are not looking for any such debt write-down.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 33, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(6) Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (5)</i>, energy efficiency improvement measures include the provision of dry lining or any other form of wall insulation, or the provision of double glazed windows.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of the amendment is to add a small subsection on dry lining insulation in walls.  Our main concern is to ensure this provision aimed at energy efficiency would be allowed.  The Minister is well aware of the issue of fuel poverty and that there has been talk that the ESB, or a section of it, will be sold.  Some of the money would go towards job creation, but would some of it go towards the alleviation of fuel poverty?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is right.  We dealt with this amendment in the other House on both Committee and <Col N="20"/>Report Stages.  His colleague, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, withdrew it for the straightforward simple reason that being this prescriptive about energy efficiency in terms of improvements in insulation was not a matter to be considered in primary legislation.  As technology changes, we can see the changes being approved for the programme on energy efficiency.  Therefore, to hardwire something like this in primary legislation would constrain us.  I regret that I cannot accept the amendment and my reasons and arguments have not changed since the debate in the other House.  As I said, it would tie the hands of the Minister unreasonably.  As technology is changing all the time and the nature and scope of the scheme will change, about which there is no doubt, I would prefer not to be stuck with something so prescriptive in primary legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned about primary legislation not being prescriptive.  As the Minister is aware, a report was published by the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny that indicated 75% of legislation in any given year was implemented by way of statutory instruments signed by Ministers to give effect to EU law and often to amend legislation where that power had been given to the Minister under primary legislation.  The concern in this regard is that there is no scrutiny.  Under the Government committees have been given the power to scrutinise EU legislation, but there is no power in the case of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade which has been told statutory instruments will be passed to it at the same time as they are passed to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, meaning they will already have taken effect; therefore, changes to primary legislation are made without the approval or knowledge of Members of the Oireachtas.  If 25% of legislation in a given year is debated by the 226 Members of the Oireachtas and 75% is implemented by way of statutory instrument, primary legislation must be more prescriptive because there is no mechanism for Members to scrutinise statutory instruments until after the fact when we are told committee members will receive copies of statutory instruments at the same time as the public.  This makes me wonder about the reason primary legislation should not be more prescriptive.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s contention that concepts are changing and that my amendment may be too prescriptive.  My fear is that statutory instruments are used to regulate in all legislation.  Once we make the law, the Minister is all powerful, as he can use the process of statutory instruments to add or subtract from a list of schemes and the methods of conserving energy will never by scrutinised by anybody in this House.  There are no checks and balances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I accept his view on the amendment, but Senator Daly makes an important point.  Our initial surge into energy efficiency and green energy has been shown to have been excessive in terms of achieving value for money.  The OECD recommended the end of grants for offshore windmills and the phasing out of grants for windmills on land.  It also has doubts about tidal and solar energy.  To echo what Senator Daly said, as a legislature, we need to keep in mind whether a proposal is cost effective or just possible in engineering terms.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The advice of an bord snip nua is that energy efficiency schemes should be funded in the future only if the cost of achieving the reduction in carbon outputs secured by them is equal to or less than the market price for carbon credits.  Things that seem to be good on philosophical or ethical grounds may not make much sense on economic grounds.  That is the important point Senator Daly raises.  Energy efficiency measures have to be efficient.  I recall from the literature that the most cost effective energy saving measure is simply to draw the curtains at dusk as that will keep heat in a dwelling, and is much less expensive than some of the measures that have crept in.  It is important to keep an economic perspective, as I am sure the Minister is doing, on some of these proposals, which were so enthusiastically advocated.  Certainly the OECD reported that on the producers side they may not make much economic sense.  We must <Col N="21"/>be equally vigilant in persuading the consumer what energy efficiency measures are worthwhile.  The ultimate test of a really good energy saving measure is the benefit of a reduced energy bill and therefore why should it need to be subsidised at all, apart from an information campaign?  In these straitened times we must consider the use of resources and as Senator Daly has said some of these programmes require to be kept under constant scrutiny, as I am sure they are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Daly raises a reasonable point about the extent of legislation that goes through the House by way of statutory instrument as compared to primary legislation.  I did not know, to be honest, that the ratio was 75:25, but if the Senator says that is the case, I accept it.  In fairness, the Office of the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel keep a close eye on what a Minister can get away with in a statutory instrument, as compared to primary legislation.  It must conform to certain rigorous standards.  I am not trying to duck primary legislation, because we are dealing with the Bill.  I am raising the wisdom of trying to dictate to the market the type of measures that can be supported.  It would be unwise to be so prescriptive.  It is simply not wise to set out certain things in primary legislation, but better to leave it to the particular terms of the scheme.  It is not fair to say that the public gets access to statutory instruments at the same time as Members of the House.  When a statutory instrument is made, it is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and there is a period of 21 days in which it can be annulled.  It is open to every Member who feels that strongly about it to move a motion to have it annulled.  It is not something that goes through sight unseen, or that should go through sight unseen.  It is an arcane process to stay up at night with a wad of statutory instruments for bedtime reading, which I accept, but there is a requirement that it can be annulled within 21 days.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Barrett raises a bigger question on energy efficiency and whether the measures in place to facilitate thermal efficiency are economic.  The  current better energy scheme is a grants based scheme, but as I have said before we are on a glide path to a pay-as-you-save scheme.  What is being proposed is a new financial model in conjunction with the banks on the one hand and the energy supply companies.  We have put an enormous level of work into this project.  I have met the chief executives of the two banks and my officials have been dealing with the people appointed by them to work on the detail.  The energy companies are on board.  The idea is that one would pay for the renovations or refurbishment from the savings that accrue from the gains made.  If we can put that model together, it will be very worthwhile.  It sounds easier said than done.  There are difficulties, such as the period of repayments and so on, but we must make the scheme attractive to the householder so that he or she is likely to want to avail of it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What confronts us now is that we import more than 90% of our energy.  The price is set elsewhere.  There is very little that we can do about it.  Perhaps we can do something in limited areas such as transport, if we were to tackle the issue of excise duty.  The rise one sees in the forecourt price, is to some extent contributed to by the tax take.  Generally, we have little enough control over the market price.  We have been taking steps to improve energy security but in terms of what we can do about cost, the best we can do is to bring down consumption.  There is no doubt but that energy efficiency measures are proven in that regard.  We waste energy.  Our built environment is not very efficient.    Even during the boom years, the standards in our domestic residences were not up to par.  The invigilation of standards was not adequate.  There is no doubt that as a result, energy is being wasted.  Energy is also being wasted in our public buildings.  I imagine that the splendid room in which we meet, which is part of an old house, is woefully inefficient.  There are opportunities for a win-win in this area.  Not only would these works save energy and reduce consumption, but they would also create employment.  We are developing some expertise in that regard.  In response to Senator Barrett&rsquo;s question, I will say I hope we will be able to move out of a grants-based approach.  Demand has been built. <Col N="22"/> There is a greater awareness that pulling the curtains, which may be advisable for reasons of thermal efficiency or simple concealment, is not adequate in itself.  We need to do more than that.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland returns to do random checks on homes that have been refurbished.  There is no doubt that the evidence it has garnered shows significant reductions in one&rsquo;s energy bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister and wish him every success with his efforts with the glide path model he has described.  It might be helpful if it were to be declared by both sides that in the event of a doubling in the world price, a list of specific projects would become worthwhile; and in the event of a further doubling, another set of projects would become worthwhile, etc.  Something similar could be provided for within houses.  That would facilitate better decision-making in the entire area.  I commend the Minister for his efforts to get us to abide by such a scale, both in the production of electricity and its consumption.</P>

	<P>I thank the Members of the House for their co-operation.  Although this is an important Bill, it is not a controversial one.  We had a reasonable debate on it on Second Stage.  It is important that the measures outlined in the Bill are put in place.  I do not think any great issue of dispute arose with regard to the merits of the legislation.  I am glad we have been able to finalise it.  There are some reasons that make it necessary for it to be completed at the earliest possible time.  In the future, as we make progress with energy efficiency measures and evolve into a different system, we can have a general discussion in the House on the merits of any changes that would encourage more householders to improve the thermal efficiency of their homes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to respond to Senator Barrett&rsquo;s point about the efficient use of resources in the context of what Senator Daly said about fuel poverty.  I am not an expert on the matter, but having examined it I do not doubt that an increase in energy efficiency would make a significant contribution to the alleviation of fuel poverty.  The traditional fuel allowance support scheme is not the most efficient way to address fuel poverty.  It is helpful and valuable.  A great deal of heat goes up the chimney.  If homes were more thermal efficient, it would make a bigger contribution to the alleviation of fuel poverty, which is obviously an issue.  It is scarcely a surprise, in current economic circumstances, that the problem of fuel poverty is not easing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The warmer homes scheme is the way to go.  Those who have responded to surveys as part of the evaluation of the scheme will agree that it has made a world of difference.  It is a far more economic use of resources than continuing to spend significant moneys on fuel allowance.  In the last ten years we have spent &euro;2 billion on fuel supports and approximately &euro;80 million on thermal efficiency measures.  When the expenditure of &euro;2 billion is subjected to the test mentioned by Senator Barrett, it is hard to say to say we get value for the taxpayers&rsquo; money in question, or that it addresses fuel poverty needs in the targeted way they need to be addressed.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his comments and wish him well in his portfolio.  I thank him for coming to the House.  As he said, this uncontroversial Bill did not attract robust exchanges on Second Stage.  We were glad to co-operate with the Minister and point out to him some of the improvements that could be made to the legislation.</P>
        <P>I wish to mention what I find amazing about the statutory instruments issue.  It came to my attention when I read a thesis by Garrett Greene from County Clare on the analysis that is done by EU scrutiny committees.  He pointed out that 75% of legislation is introduced in this manner.  Perhaps the Minister will bring that fact to the attention of his Cabinet colleagues.  Given that transparency is so important, we need more oversight of statutory instruments.  I am sure the Attorney General is not as concerned about what the Minister can get away with.  It is a question of having the best and most efficient system.  I do not intend to spend my evenings reading the latest statutory instruments that have been approved by these Houses.  I suggest that the members of all committees be given a list of the latest statutory instruments, as well as details of what such instruments will do, as a matter of course.  I estimate that 99% of statutory instruments are fairly standard.  They involve small measures like increases in fines.  I am afraid that the 1% of statutory instruments that might cause trouble down the line could be among those that are passed sight unseen.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House today</P>

	<P Just="Left">I echo everything that has been said.  I thank the Minister and wish him well.  As I spoke during the Second Stage debate, I wanted to be present when we wrapped it up.  I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Daly, who proposed amendments as our party&rsquo;s spokesperson in this area.  I hope the Minister will fight the good fight at Cabinet level to restore some of the money that was lost to his Department as a result of the economic downturn.  He knows that additional funds would help small operators in the home heating sector.  I am sure he will agree this Bill is about trying to improve fuel efficiency, not only in terms of suppliers and distributors but also in terms of home owners.  Perhaps that is one way of reducing our overall energy bill.  I hope the Minister will secure the resources to allow him to be more proactive in trying to encourage householders to be more fuel efficient.  I appreciate that he is quite active in this regard.  I could give many examples of what could be done.  Many people leave electrical appliances, such as, televisions and computers on stand-by mode, not realising that it is costing them up to 50% of the original cost if the appliance had been on fully.  Even that simple efficiency measure of turning off the appliance at source would help to reduce the energy bill considerably.  I wish the Minister well in an important portfolio.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House.  I commend my colleagues across the floor for some interesting contributions and pay tribute to the Minister for his open-mindedness and consideration in these matters.  It is not a contentious Bill but important housework in tidying up many loose ends in the area.  The Minister mentioned the standard of builds.  Whatever about retrofitting old buildings and houses that are ten to 20 years old, it is a matter of concern that houses that have been built in the past decade have had such deficiencies and failings in the area of energy conservation and efficiency.  I am aware the Minister and his colleague in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are working on introducing measures to ensure the standards set out are implemented.  The standard to which some houses were built and the prices charged are not reflected in the quality of work.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett raised many issues that may be uncomfortable for us and that we may not wish to hear.  I am a big fan of renewable energy and green technology but we must examine their merits and cost-effectiveness.  On the last day we heard that the nuclear option has not been ruled out even though the issue raises the hackles of many people, including me, who protested at Carnsore many years ago.</P><Col N="24"/>

	<P>I join my colleagues in thanking the Minister for bringing the Bill to the House.  In his last summation the &euro;2 billion in fuel supports that he mentioned shows where we are coming from in the past ten years.  If the houses had been built and insulated properly it would not have been necessary to spend the &euro;2 billion.  The same issue arises in another area involving retrofitting facilities for the disabled in houses for people who need it where we are spending hundreds of millions of euros.  If they had been built properly with a low level access shower and toilet downstairs we would not have to do that work.</P>
        <P>I thank my colleagues who contributed to the debate which, at times, went beyond the remit of the Bill.  I appreciate that the Minister took many positive comments on board.  I wish him well with the Bill and any other Bills he may initiate.</P>
