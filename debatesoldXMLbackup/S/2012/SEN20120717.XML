	<P>I have received notice from Senator Paul Bradford that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to clarify the current position on plans for the structures of local government.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">To ask the Minister for Health to clarify the future of the subsidised patient return bus service from Donegal to hospitals in Dublin.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mary Moran of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">To ask the Minister for Health to comment on the recent cutbacks to respite, residential and day services announced by Saint John of God&rsquo;s in the north east and their impact on service users and their families.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Kelly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">To ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to clarify the role of the Civil Service and its interaction with Ministers and the Government.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Denis Landy of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">To ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to provide an update on progress to introduce local government reform and make a statement on the matter.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator David Cullinane of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">To ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to discuss the issue of ground rents, whether he intends to pursue the abolition of ground rents on the family home and the current position of the residents of Lismore Park, Lismore Lawn and Lismore Heights in Waterford, who are being pursued for ground rents by the landlord.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Colm Burke of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">To ask the Minister for Social Protection to outline if she intends to set up a special fund to assist those property owners in Blackpool, Park Court, Ballyvolane and Meadowbrook, Riverstown, County Cork, who suffered loss as a result of the recent flooding and who did not have insurance cover for flood damage.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Whelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">To ask the Minister for Education and Skills to clarify the new arrangements pertaining to the school transport scheme being implemented for new applicants and which will come into effect from the start of the new school term in September; and if he will ensure there is a fair and easily accessible appeals process which takes into account existing and historical school enrolments by families throughout rural Ireland, as the scheme as it is being implemented is leading to an unforeseen level of hardship and dividing siblings attending primary schools.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Martin Conway of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">To ask the Minister for Education and Skills to facilitate a student with the school transport allowance who is entering a secondary school in County Clare that is not nearest to her due to bullying reasons.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">Go nd&eacute;anfaidh an tAire Cumars&aacute;ide, Fuinneamh &amp; Acmhainn&iacute; N&aacute;d&uacute;rtha soil&eacute;iri&uacute; ar na c&uacute;iseanna nach bhfuil an st&aacute;isi&uacute;n raidi&oacute;&aacute;&iacute;ti&uacute;il, Galway Bay FM, le f&aacute;il tr&iacute;d an seirbh&iacute;s tarchurad&oacute;ireachta i gConamara Theas agus c&eacute;ard at&aacute; i gceist aige a dh&eacute;anamh le seo a cheart&uacute;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by Senators Bradford, &Oacute; Domhnaill, Kelly, Moran, Cullinane, Colm Burke, Whelan and Conway as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters tabled by Senators Bradford, &Oacute; Domhnaill, Kelly and Moran and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Landy&rsquo;s motion is on the same subject as that of Senator Bradford and I suggest that they share time.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.  I regret that I must rule out of order the matter raised by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh as the Minister has no responsibility in the matter; it is an issue for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2011 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 5.15 p.m.; No. 2, Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill 2012 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and conclude not later than 7.15 p.m.  The revision of today&rsquo;s schedule to deal with the Remaining Stages of No. 2 is due to the fact that only two Committee Stage amendments were received by the Bills Office and both were ruled out of order.  That is why I have decided to take Remaining Stages of the Bill at that time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I advise the House in advance of the statements on the development of the European Union and Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Council which will take place tomorrow that it is my intention to allocate ten minutes speaking time to each group leader which can be shared, with Sinn F&eacute;in having three minutes of speaking time.  This is the most efficient way to order the time for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Quite a number of Senators have indicated that they wish to speak today and I ask them to keep to the time limits.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that is not directed at me.  It probably is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is for every Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I am finding it difficult to contain my excitement about the fact that the Taoiseach will come to the House tomorrow after 16 months.  I very much welcome it and I appreciate the Leader organising it.  I look forward to the debate tomorrow.</P>
        <P>This morning on the radio we heard the announcement of 1,000 jobs at PayPal and Senators on all sides of the House welcome it.  Certainly the jobs are badly needed in the greater Dublin and Louth areas.  However, having listened to media reports today, it is of concern that more than 500 of these jobs will be filled by people from outside the country because of the lack of modern language skills here.  There are several reasons for this and relates to not only lesser used languages such as Russian and Arabic, but also mainstream languages such as German.  PayPal could not find enough people in this country with the requisite language skills to have sufficient proficiency to fill the roles.  I remind Government Senators that in the most recent budget the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, abolished the modern European languages programme in primary schools.  Since the programme was implemented by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin in 1999, thousands of children at 550 primary schools went through it but it no longer exists.  We need a proper debate in September on proficiency in European and other languages.  Alarm bells are going off in my head over the fact that 50% of the PayPal jobs had to be sourced abroad.  I asked the Leader to arrange this debate.</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, come to the House to discuss promises he has made since becoming Minister and in the run up to the election.  We know very well the promises he made with regard to Sligo cancer care services.  These were specific promises which he has broken.  We also know the promises he and the Taoiseach made about retaining services at the Roscommon accident and emergency department.  I welcome representatives of the cross-party action group for the Community Hospital of the Assumption in Thurles and concerned citizens to the Gallery.  Not only has this hospital lost 20 respite beds, but 37% of its hospital beds have also been lost while more than 300 people in the area are waiting for beds.  What is worse is that on 9 November, the Minister, at a meeting with the group attended by Deputy Coonan and the Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, promised the beds would be reinstated by the end of January 2012.  This was a specific promise.  I want the Minister to come to the House to explain whether Deputy Coonan and the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, are incorrect.  Did the Minister make this promise?  It was very clear to those who were there.  Why have the beds not been reinstated since January 2012?</P>
        <P>We are used to broken promises.  On numerous occasions prior to the news coming out two weeks ago I raised my concerns about the Minister for Health having a conflict of interest in the nursing home sector.  I stated this six months ago.  How can the Minister tell a group of elected councillors and people in the community that he will reinstate beds by the end of January 2012 at a meeting in Leinster House on 9 November 2011 but now deny he said it?  Is the group lying, is the Minister lying, or did Deputy Coonan and the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, pick up wrongly what the Minister said?  I will tell the House who is wrong in this.  The amendment I propose is that the Minister for Health come to the House to explain why another promise has been broken and ask him with the greatest degree of urgency to fulfil the promise he made to the community of Thurles on 9 November 2011 that he would reinstate the beds.  We will accept nothing short of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the &euro;2.25 billion stimulus package announced by the Government today.  It is greatly welcome, in particular as it is a job-rich public stimulus programme.  The infrastructure projects being put forward by the Government in a range of areas will provide for significant levels of employment in those areas and they will also be of great public good.  I refer in particular to the &euro;280 million worth of investment planned for the education sector &mdash; notably to finally build the new DIT campus in Grangegorman which I think was announced by the previous Government on at least three or four occasions.  I was present in Grangegorman on one occasion when Bertie Ahern, as Taoiseach, announced it was to go ahead&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Welcome to the northside.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but it never did under the previous Government.  It is really excellent to see&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>We were promised metro north, which was binned.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, promised&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Bacik to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is a strong symbol of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to third level education to see the Grangegorman campus finally going ahead and the DIT being moved from 39 locations in which it is located across the capital.  That is really excellent and it will also rejuvenate that inner city area.</P>
        <P>There will be investment in health &mdash; in primary care centres &mdash; in transport and in the justice area.  I am really glad to see the State pathology laboratory will be invested in.  It is long overdue and it is really important investment for the future.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s, alcohol abuse package?  I very much hope the package of measures will go to Cabinet next week.  We need to support her in putting forward this range of very important measures to try to curb the abuse of alcohol which has been the topic of so much debate in this House and elsewhere, in particular following the recent gig in the Phoenix Park.  Some doubts have been expressed about curbing sponsorship of sports by alcohol companies but I think that is misguided.  If one looks back, one will see the same issues were raised about cigarette company sponsorship.  We now all accept that was wrong.  Some years ago I raised in this House the issue of a very well-known beer company sponsoring children&rsquo;s sports and football kits.  It was most inappropriate to see young children going around with the beer company&rsquo;s logo on their t-shirts.  I am glad to see that has stopped but we need to be more radical in curbing sponsorship by alcohol companies.</P>
        <P>I thank colleagues who came forward to join the Oireachtas all-party cyclists group which met last week.  We launched it on a very busy Kildare Street where we had a cycle safety class.  I hope other colleagues will join with me and that we can have a debate on transport and on promoting the use of cycling as part of our transport policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>Having given the matter careful consideration, I deem it would be remiss not to question the unfolding events in the Seanad last Thursday.  That morning we gathered to debate the intent and content of the resolution to establish a constitutional convention for Ireland, a matter of exceptional historic importance.  As one of the newer Members of the House, I may not understand all the traditions and customs underpinning the act of putting to a vote an extensive string of motions which blocked the use of our time to engage in a debate with the T&aacute;naiste scheduled for this period of time.  It behoves us all to stand back from the events and allow us space to reflect on the wisdom of our procedures &mdash; the wisdom of interrupting the work of this House in that way.</P>
        <P>I had prepared for many hours the issues I wished to raise, and I am sure many Members did so also.  However, not only was the T&aacute;naiste left standing outside the door for more than 90 minutes, but those in this Chamber who wanted to engage in this historic moment of conversation were silenced.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have a question on democratic exchange.  As a result, the resolution passed through this House without debate and with no opportunity for any of us to improve or amend its contents.  As a litmus test of how members of the public view this use of our time in the Seanad, perhaps we should listen carefully to a voice from the Visitors Gallery who shouted his judgment--</P>

	<P>I have a right to raise this question.  Will the Leader gather his colleagues on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to review whether Seanad rules, relevant to the procedures utilised last Thursday morning, require some form of amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I respectfully disagree with my colleague, Senator Zappone.  The way the business was organised we would not have had time.  This House was lied to because we were told the T&aacute;naiste was not available.  He was then made available when it suited him.</P>

	<P>The Senator may disagree with me but I have the right to raise the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader pass on my congratulations to the Government on the firm stance it has taken with regard to the tragic case of the McAreavey and Harte families?  I cannot comprehend how appalling it must be to have this pain continually re-opened in the way it has been, particularly the sensationalising of the case in a newspaper in Mauritius.  I welcome the strong line the Government has taken.  I hope this will encourage it to take a similar line with the media in this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">By coincidence I today received an interesting e-mail in which a parent is very concerned about material available on a newspaper website which shows a woman being murdered by the Taliban because she was accused of adultery.  This is a difficult issue because one must be appalled by what the Taliban did but the questions remains as to whether a seven or eight year old child should have access to this synthetic outrage of the tabloid newspapers.  I recall seeing a photograph on the front page of one such newspaper some years ago of a female teenage heroin addict in her coffin.  They also recently published photographs of the singer, Whitney Houston, in her coffin.  This raises a question.  It is commendable but less difficult to raise these questions about a newspaper with a tiny circulation on a small island many thousands of miles away.  It takes more determination to raise it directly here, particularly as politicians may not be protected against the depredations of the press.  I listened with interest to a good commentator on television saying that this was less acceptable because she was not Irish nor a celebrity.  Does this mean that if this unfortunate victim had not been Irish or had been a celebrity it would have been appropriate to show those pictures?  I do not think so, nor do the vast majority of the people.</P>
        <P>I strongly agree with Senator Bacik in supporting the moves of the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, with regard to the problem of alcohol.  I am not sure what the statistics are and there may be some dispute about them.  However, as one who lives in the north inner city, there is a real problem with people in possession of enormous trays of beer which they get for virtually nothing from supermarkets.  This should be banned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this afternoon&rsquo;s announcement of the infrastructure stimulus package aimed at labour-intensive sectors of the economy, including construction.  We need to rebuild our construction sector to provide trade jobs.  Funding will be in the region of &euro;2 billion and I am delighted this will include a new primary care centre for Tralee.</P>
        <P>While this is a positive investment I would also like to point out that if we want sustained job creation we have to focus on small and medium Irish enterprises.  Small, family-run Irish companies are providing thousands of sustainable jobs.  There are two pressing problems for the SME sector.  In a recent survey 41% of SMEs reported a drop in turnover, 79% said their employee levels were constant and 21% had decreased employee numbers.  Some 72% reported a profit or achieved break-even.  Why it is so hard for the SME sector to get credit from banks is hard to understand.  There are pressing problems on the sector.  Business costs for small and medium enterprises, utility costs and local charges have increased by almost 10% in the past 12 months and there is also a continuing lack of credit from the pillar banks.  We have to act on this straight away in the name of job creation and, while I welcome the stimulus package, I call for real and practical help for the small business sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  I ask the Leader if he can provide an update on whether the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, will come to the House this week given that it is our last opportunity to make statements on the pilot issue.  I will reserve my right to propose an amendment to tomorrow&rsquo;s Order of Business if the response is not positive.</P>
        <P>I wish to praise a world record breaking hero, Steve Redmond from Ballydehob in west Cork, who met one of the most enduring challenges ever faced by a human being.  He succeeded in a task of Herculean proportions in passing the Oceans 7 challenge, which incorporates swims between Ireland and Scotland, the English Channel, a channel in New Zealand and the Tsugaru Channel in Japan, which he swam last Saturday.  It is an enormous achievement for any individual, particularly one who is not known as a long-distance swimmer.  It was a test of endurance, mental strength and tenacity and we should acknowledge what he has achieved.  His world beating record is similar to that achieved by the great explorers to the North Pole and the South Pole and those who climbed Mount Everest.  The final swim covered a distance of 27 km in difficult seas.  As a west Cork man, an Irishman and a European he deserves the accolades of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien in calling for a debate on education and language skills in particular.  Last February we were delighted to welcome 1,000 jobs but it is disappointing to note that more than 50% of the new positions will have to be recruited from abroad.  I worry that the shortage of necessary language skills will deter companies from locating in Ireland.  As a gateway to Europe, it is important that we focus on language skills.  I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills when we return in September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments made by Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Moloney.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien beat me to the punch because I clearly recall our previous discussions on this issue.  Senator Quinn and I have met representatives of the modern languages in primary school project.  It is astounding that the Government could be so penny wise and pound foolish as to cut funding for this important project.  It is a matter on which we should express our disquiet to the Minister for Education and Skills and I hope the cuts will be reversed.</P>
        <P>I support what Senator Bacik has said about the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Shortall, and her laudable ambition to introduce changes to the law governing sponsorship of sporting events and concerts by alcohol companies.  Perhaps we can ask the Taoiseach in due course whether the matter will be discussed in Cabinet before the end of this term.  I have not heard any reason why it should not be discussed and the Government should signal its firm purpose in this regard.</P>
        <P>There is considerable speculation about British people being invited to Ireland to escape the madness of the Olympic Games.  However, certain Irish people will not be coming home because they are in a vulnerable position and are being supported by various bodies in England.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have heard recently from the Southwark Irish Pensioners Project which involves an outreach by Anglo-Irish seniors who give of their time to accompany Irish people, some of whom are in their 70s up to late 80s and may not have that long to live.  That project having lost funding from the London Borough Council is very concerned about whether it will lose funding from the Irish State in due course.  That insecurity, particularly in the lives of some vulnerable older people, is something with which they should not have to put up.  I hope that in all the hard decisions that have to be made people such as those involved in the Southwark Irish Pensioners Project will not be forgotten and that the small amount of funding which is given in order that people can bring joy and support into their lives will not be cut back in due course.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am delighted to note Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s excitement in regard to tomorrow&rsquo;s business and hope he will manage to contain himself.  On a more serious note, ever since the Lehman Brothers crash in September 2008, the banking world has not been the same and banking practices everywhere have been suspect.  We are still awaiting our own banking inquiry in this country.  We saw recently that a major international bank in Britain, Barclays, fiddled and manipulated the London interbank money rate.  How can we sure about the Dublin interbank rate?  This is a vital interest rate.  We need true reform of the system.  Greater transparency is essential.  We cannot afford in this country to have any hint of the sustained fraud which occurred in Britain.  In light of that, I ask the Leader if he would be good enough to arrange a debate on banking as early as possible.</P><P Just="Left">On a more serious note, ever since the Lehman Brothers crash in September 2008, the banking world has not been the same and banking practices everywhere have been suspect.

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I have called for a full debate on poverty on a number of occasions in this House in recent months.  The Leader indicated he would consider hosting such a debate but up to now he has not come back with any timeframe or date.  A number of reports have been published since I made those calls.  A report by the Irish League of Credit Unions, published last week, reveals that 1.82 million people are left with less than &euro;100 per month of disposal income after they pay their household bills.  It also shows that 69% of people will have less money at the end of this year than they had at the end of last year.  A report by Social Justice Ireland, published yesterday, shows that the gap between the rich and the poor has increased.  It shows that low income families and people who are out of work are suffering because of the austerity measures and policies in place and that there are more people living in poverty this year than there were last year and previous years.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">It was on the back of a CSO report published a number of months ago that I sought a debate on poverty.  That report shows that the top 10% of earners in the State have seen their disposable income increase while everybody else has seen their disposable income reduce.  That is one of the most important debates that we could have in this Chamber.  Every issue is important but when there are people living in poverty who do not have money to pay even basic bills and there are people who have no money left over after paying those basic bills yet policies are still being put in place, and may well be put in place in the next budget, which will force more people into poverty, it is important that we debate the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Combat Poverty Agency was disbanded by the previous Government.  There is a real opportunity for this House to play its part in ensuring there is a constructive and worthwhile debate on the causes and effects of poverty and on what actions we can advocate the Government should take to reduce the number of people living in poverty bearing in mind that far too many people in this State live in poverty.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, subject to the Leader&rsquo;s response to my request, that we have a debate on poverty in this House today and that the Minister for Finance would take it.</P>

	<P>I would like to second Senator Bacik&rsquo;s proposal that at the earliest opportunity we should have a mature, honest and open debate in this House on the question of alcohol, alcohol abuse and on the sale, price and advertising of alcohol.  Every Member has been inundated with requests from parents and teachers across the country for us to do so.  Any sensible and right-minded person would know that we can no longer bury our heads in the sand on this issue with regard to what is going on across the country.  It is important that we give proper and fair consideration to what I regard to be common sense proposals put forward by the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall.</P>
        <P>I regret to report to the House that my old friends in EirGrid are back to their old tricks.  After promising courtesy in public engagement, the company is now behaving once again more like the old KGB than the old ESB by riding roughshod over the rural communities.  In my own area across the scenic landscape of Stradbally and Rathnesk and Timahoe, 17 new high voltage power lines are planned.  I do not understand how this is conceivable or how it can happen.  We were promised this would not happen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have attended a briefing by another company which is promising not hundreds of jobs but tens of thousands of jobs, not millions of euro investment but billions of euro.  They are promising to do so with the installation of 750 wind turbines in the midlands.  This is in addition to another company which proposes another 1,500 wind turbines across the midlands.  The proposals of these two companies alone amount to 2,000 wind turbines across the midlands, in the bog, and no one has convinced me how this power will be transmitted from the midlands over to the eastern seaboard and across to Britain.</P>

The two Romanian nationals took advantage of the attitude of trust and the fact that they were in the Grove which is not a high security area.  These are old houses which remain from the time it was a hospital.  It also housed the republican prisoners.  They respected the fact that this was a low security area and did not break that trust.  This escape has been a betrayal of the trust and the quality of treatment in that area of the prison to prisoners of all persuasions, including politicians.  My solidarity is with the officers who are providing an excellent service in this low security area in Castlerea.  The prison provides excellent employment in the area and the project was approved by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Party Government.  I hope that despite the result of this betrayal of trust, this excellent facility will be retained in Castlerea and that it will not become a high security area.</P>

        <P>I welcome the infrastructure projects announced this morning by the Government.  These will bring much needed employment to the country.  I particularly welcome the funding for the N17-N18 Gort to Tuam road, which is 57 km of motorway that will bypass Clarenbridge, Claregalway and Tuam.  Obviously, this is vital infrastructure.  Another piece of the jigsaw which has yet to be completed and which will make Galway probably the most desirable place in the country in which to do business is the completion of the Galway city outer bypass.  At present, legal proceedings are ongoing which have yet to be resolved, but there is a commitment in the announcement this morning that when those legal proceedings are concluded the Galway city outer bypass project will be completed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While exports were up 7% in May this year in comparison with May last year, I share the concern expressed by Senator Sheahan for the small and medium enterprises in this country that are really struggling.  There has been much debate in the Seanad on job creation but I ask the Leader to set aside time next September for a debate on small and medium-sized businesses, in which we can explore the problems facing them.  Many of us have concerns about the possibility of small businesses having to carry the cost of sick pay schemes.  That issue requires a great deal of debate and I urge the Leader to put it at the top of the priority list for discussion in September.  We are beginning to turn the corner with regard to employment but we need to give assistance and a boost to the small businesses of this country that are on their knees.</P>

	<P>I second Senator Mullins&rsquo;s call for a debate on the subject of sick pay, and I apologise to Senators for raising it again today.  However, there are only 95 working days between now and the budget.  Great damage could be done to the small and medium-sized business community.  Over the weekend the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, said that workers in the public sector take nearly twice as many sick days as their counterparts in the private sector.  I was aware of that after researching this area in detail over the last number of weeks.  The public sector absenteeism rate also compares very poorly with that of our EU counterparts, while the statistics for our private sector show it is among the best in Europe.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, said in a party briefing document that &euro;40 million could quickly be saved if public sector workers took as few sick days as private sector employees.  If average absences in the public sector, calculated at 11.3 days, could be reduced to the private sector average of six days, there could be significant benefits.</P>
        <P>Under the proposals mooted by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, employers would have to pay the first four weeks of staff sick pay, which would save the State &euro;150 million.  However, Deputy Bruton says that illness benefit claims lasting up to four weeks only account for 5% of the total cost of illness benefit claims, which leads me to question the logic behind the proposal to transfer the cost to the employer.  As a business owner and having spoken to many fellow employers on the topic of changes to sick pay, I welcome the comments by the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  The Government&rsquo;s mantra is that Ireland will become the best small country in the world in which to do business, but if the Government transfers the cost of paying the first four weeks of sick pay to the employer it will contradict its own mantra.  If the Leader has not already done so, I ask him to arrange a debate on this early in the new term.</P>
        <P>I second Senator John Whelan&rsquo;s call for a debate on alcohol.  Perhaps we could also include the labelling of alcohol.  It is a mystery why all alcohol, regardless of whether it is beer, wine or spirits, can be sold with no label whatsoever to indicate the content of the drink.</P>

	<P>I welcome the recently announced stimulus package.  My home town of Ballaghaderreen is to benefit from a new primary care centre.  It is much needed in a rural part of the country that has been neglected for many years.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Whelan&rsquo;s call for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to come to the House to discuss the two new wind farm development projects for the midlands region.  I am all for job creation, but it should not be at any cost.  When one erects over 2,250 wind turbines across four counties, surely people will be affected by them.  I have a Bill on the distances wind turbines should be from family homes, Second Stage of which was passed in this House.  If the Bill were passed, wind turbines 175 m in height would be 2 km from people&rsquo;s homes.  That will not be the case in the circumstances to which I refer.</P>
        <P>The main point is that we are not in compliance with the Aarhus Convention.  I spoke to representatives of the relevant company in Buswells Hotel this morning and told them that, under the convention, there should be preplanning engagement with local communities.  From having spoken to the representatives, I note this has not happened yet, although planning permission has not yet been applied for.  All the company has done is have all the farmers sign deals with their solicitors.  It is a foregone conclusion that it is an unstoppable train.</P>
        <P>The company representatives told me the company is to erect 750 wind turbines, creating 10,000 jobs.  Two weeks ago, it was stated in a newspaper that another company in the midlands is to build twice as many turbines and create 54,000 jobs.  One must answer the question as to how real the jobs are.  It does not make sense.</P>

The man is a member of Guth na Gaeltachta, a non-political community organisation that fights for and promotes the Irish language and which endeavoured to initiate debate locally on the Gaeltacht Bill.

The National Suicide Research Foundation published a timely report today that showed 78% of 190 people who committed suicide in the Cork region had abused alcohol in the preceding 12 months.  Some 35% had abused both alcohol and drugs in the preceding 12 months.  The report shows a direct connection between substance abuse and mental illness and suicide.  It is important that the reform required to restrict the sale of alcohol be introduced at a very early stage.  This must be dealt with if we want to deal with suicide.  We should debate this in the House at a very early date.</P>

	<P>I wish to speak on the same topic raised by Senator Burke.  I propose that the Leader send to the Cabinet a transcript of our debate on 16 November 2011, during which all the points we have heard today were made.  All of the points we have heard today were put at that debate.  There are two sides to this argument.  The price of alcohol has not been falling, although consumption has done.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, can confirm that.  We put this evidence before the House on 16 November and I wonder if the problem is being exaggerated.  The current <i>Economist Pocket World in Figures</i> puts consumption of alcohol in Ireland at 23rd in the world, behind Australia, with an average annual intake of 99.4 litres, as well as Finland and Germany.  Ireland&rsquo;s average intake is 63.5 litres.</P>

	<P>Last week there was a settlement of a price-fixing anti-trust action in the United States.  It was the largest ever settlement of its kind, at &euro;6.6 billion, and it involved MasterCard and Visa.  The end result is that credit card costs should come down quite dramatically in the United States.  Exactly the same issue arose here a few months ago in the case of European cross-border transactions.  The European Commission urged each country to take similar action in order to reduce costs.  If we are to discuss being competitive, this is one easy win because the banks have been overcharging for many years and it appears that there has been success in the United States with the largest ever anti-trust settlement.</P>
        <P>I add to Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s reference to an effort to make employers pay the first four weeks of wages for anybody who is ill.  Approximately an hour ago I listened to Mr. Barry O&rsquo;Leary of the Industrial Development Agency talking about efforts to make ourselves more competitive and have more jobs in Ireland.  It is going exactly the wrong way to argue that every employer must pay the first four weeks of any illness in future.  We must do something about that.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I note many Government Senators are rising, properly so, to welcome the stimulus package with regard to primary care centres.  I attended a presentation this morning by the Community Hospital of the Assumption, Thurles and I welcome the cross-party group of councillors to the Visitors Gallery.  They got a new hospital in 2006 but they consider its services are being downgraded.  I hope this will not be the future of the primary care centres being welcomed today.</P>
        <P>I would welcome a debate with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  We went through a similar situation of promises made about the St. Francis nursing home. That the group can attend the Houses, meet Government representatives and the Minister and be given promises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Leader call on the Minister to attend the House and tell us whether it is Government policy to run down very good facilities such as the community Hospital in Thurles in order that it can be taken over by private interests in the future?  Is this the policy of the Government with regard to health care?  Will the Government do something about keeping this hospital and other services throughout the country open to support the 487 people waiting for respite care and the thousands of carers who need this essential respite care in order that they can get a break?  The Government depends on them to look after people intheir own homes.  What is going on is a disgrace and it is about time the Government started telling the truth.  We want the Minister to attend the House--                  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I add my voice to those who have spoken about the need for change with regard to alcohol consumption.  It is not something I do very often, but if I may I will disagree with Senator Barrett.  It does not matter if the figures show that we as a country are third or 23rd in terms of consumption.  What matters is that our culture and attitude to alcohol needs to change.  The attempts at change by the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, will be difficult and we will need to discuss them.  Change is always hard, particularly if one is challenging large organisations which have had control and which offer sponsorship.  I second Senator Bacik&rsquo;s call for a debate.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader write to the editor of the <i>Sunday Times</i> in Mauritius to lend our voices on what was an outrageous piece of alleged journalism?  Perhaps Senator Norris already raised this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill.  I also agree with Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien who proposed an amendment to the Order of Business calling on the Minister for Health to come to the House.  A number of serious issues have arisen in the past week, in particular.  We have seen the health overruns and the conditioning of the public that the troika is insisting on health cuts.  I was part of the Fianna F&aacute;il delegation which met the troika last week and that question was specifically put to it.  The troika was unequivocal in stating that the budget would be set by the Government of the day.  In regard to the health savings promised by the Government in terms of the generic drugs bill &mdash; we will see what emerges from the debate later in the week on that &mdash; and cutting the cost of agency staff and of private nursing home beds, in particular, we have seen no action over the past 16 months.</P>
        <P>I welcome the people in the Visitors Gallery from Thurles, which is quite a distance from my part of the country.  However, we certainly have much in common.  We have all lived through the set piece of the ministerial commitment to the restoration of services which is followed up by the local Deputies taking the credit on the local airwaves &mdash; in their case Tipp FM while in mine Ocean FM.  The follow on set piece is the commitment being reneged on.</P>
        <P>These are callous political gestures which are disgraceful in the extreme.  Whatever about a pre-election commitment being reneged on, which is inexcusable, to make a commitment at a meeting in November, quite some time after the election, and then to renege on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A question to the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>The question has already been asked but, I suppose, I am giving the context to it which must not be lost in these important issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join my colleagues in welcoming this stimulus package.  I support my colleague, Senator Mullins&rsquo;s, call for a debate on job creation to be taken later in the year.  There has been much talk about job creation but a number of worrying things have come to my notice in the past few days.  Two people have set up small companies employing 12 to 15 people.  Some 20% of the first company&rsquo;s income will be stopped at source by the Revenue Commissioners when it does work for public bodies.  In the second case, the person has spent &euro;100,000 on development charges but he is now being asked to spend another &euro;150,000 on an access road to his business.  This is very unfair.  We must encourage people to create jobs but the likes of this will stop people from doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement of a new primary care centre for my constituency.  More was announced in the Seanad today than was announced by the Government in its press conference.  One would be looking to host a Formula 1 championship race in Galway because one will be able race from Tuam to the far side of Galway city given all the motorways to be built in County Galway.  Best of luck to the Senators and Deputies from Galway who have done well.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise an important issue.  We need to have an urgent debate on social welfare.  Last night the Minister for Social Protection announced cuts of up to 20% for existing claimants of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit who are part-time workers.  This will hit people really hard next week and it is important the Seanad shows its relevance to people by having a debate with the Minister about these cuts, in particular when the Government promised no cuts to social welfare payments.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael can ignore this but this is the practical reality for people.</P>
        <P>In September, the Minister plans another major cut to new applicants for the old age pension who do not have full credits.  They are nearly all women who had to leave the workforce to work at home and rear their children.  They will be hit hard while the Seanad is in recess.  The Seanad must have a debate on the issue and stand up for part-time workers who will face serious cuts next week and for the mothers of Ireland who left the workforce to work even harder in the home.  Shame on the Government and on this House if we do not discuss them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Some 27 Senators have contributed to the Order of  Business.  I regret to inform Senators Walsh, Moran, Harte, Keane, Healy Eames and Gilroy that we are out of time.  They will be given priority tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and other Senators raised the lack of language skills, especially in regard to PayPal and the fact that 50% of the jobs there will be sourced abroad, which is to be regretted.  In response to many requests from across the House, the Minister for Education and Skills is scheduled to come to the House in early October for a debate on third level education.  The training of people for new types of jobs in the economy could definitely form part of that debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Brien also referred to broken promises.  It is hypocritical of Fianna F&aacute;il to do so given that it practically broke the country.  I do not wish to get into the issues raised by the Senator and others in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>On the calls for a debate on alcohol abuse, I have requested of the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, that she come to the House for that debate soon after the recess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will she come back again?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is hoped the Minister of State can come to the House before the end of September to address the points raised by many Senators on the issue of alcohol abuse and below-cost selling of alcohol.</P>
        
      <TimeSt down="3" idown="3">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">On the issue raised by Senator Zappone, I will discuss the matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  What happened last week was regrettable.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator Norris referred to the McAreavey and Harte families.  What happened was absolutely appalling and most distressing for the families concerned.  The Senator also outlined a number of other examples of, to put it mildly, misbehaviour by the press.  We had a debate with the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, on media standards.  I have requested the Minister to come to the House during the next term for a further debate on media standards and ownership.  We will have an opportunity then to discuss the matters raised today by Senator Norris. </P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator Sheahan and other Senators called for a debate on the stimulus package announced today by the Government, which I am sure will be welcomed by all sides of the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in Members have been for some time calling for the putting in place of a stimulus package such as that announced.  I am sure Members of those parties welcome the package announced by the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Sheahan and other Senators also called for assistance for the small business sector.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, will be in the House early in the new term to discuss progress on projects to assist small business deal with unemployment, in particular youth unemployment.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan also raised the pilot issue.  I understand that the Senator addressed 15 questions on that issue to the Minister in respect of which he received a response last Friday.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We all welcome Steve Redmond&rsquo;s achievement in the Ocean&rsquo;s 7 Challenge, on which we compliment him.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator Coghlan raised the issue of the Dublin interbank rate and called for greater transparency in view of experiences in the UK.  The Minister for Finance was in the House a couple of weeks ago.  However, there is a need for ongoing debate on the economy and banking.  I will endeavour to arrange such a debate early in the new term. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Cullinane called for a debate on poverty.  We took two social welfare Bills in the House and had a comprehensive debate on the question of poverty.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, will come to the House for a two and a half hour debate on social protection on 11 October.  This will be a comprehensive debate on all matters coming within her remit.  Several of those matters have been raised by Senators, including sick pay and poverty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Whelan and Kelly spoke about EirGrid, high voltage pylons and the jobs that can be created through wind energy projects.  Some people in the midlands have objected to wind turbines.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, will come to the House early in the new term.</P><P Just="Left"> I note Senator Leyden's comments on Castlerea Prison.  Senators Mullins and Higgins spoke about the stimulus project for the N17 and N18 highways in Galway.  We all hope the Galway city bypass project will also proceed.  There is good news for Galway in this project. </P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien spoke about the sick pay proposals.  As I have noted, the Minister, Deputy Burton, will be in the House on 11 October and I am sure she will address the issues raised.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the specific issue of a gentleman in Donegal regarding whom I do not wish to elaborate on further.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator Colm Burke referred to a report on suicide in Cork which investigated the number of people who had died by suicide after abusing alcohol.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Shortall, will be available in September for a wide ranging debate on that issue.  Senator Barrett set out a different point of view on alcohol.  He can certainly make his argument during the debate with the Minister of State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Higgins again raised the issues affecting Ulster Bank.  I am sure we all wish that full compensation will be paid to the customers who have been affected by the debacle.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator Quinn spoke about price fixing by MasterCard and Visa in the USA.  The Senator also raised this issue on previous occasions.  I note his comments on sick pay.  </P><P Just="Left">Senator Noone can raise the question of sponsorship of sports and the arts by alcohol companies during the debate in September with the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to a number of issues which will require further spending.  I remind him that we continue to spend &euro;15 billion more than what we are taking in.  That will have to be addressed, irrespective of what Government is in power.  Requesting <i>ad infinitum</i> that additional funding be provided for various items does nothing to address that problem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials for their efficiency in dealing with the Bill.  I also thank the Members for their contributions.  We had a most interesting debate on it last week.  The Bill is an important element in supporting small businesses, particularly those that employ fewer than ten people.  It is a niche area.  This Bill is an important step and it will help increase confidence, particularly among those involved in the small and medium-sized enterprise sector.  I wish the Bill well and look forward to its enactment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I support what Senator Clune said.  Ultimately, we need a banking system in this country that will take on the role the Minister has had to take on today.  All the evidence shows that in the period of massive lending between 1998 and 2008 hardly any of money lent from our financial institutions went into the manufacturing industry or the agricultural sector.  Rather there was a spending splurge based on property and financial intermediation.  In the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s discussions with Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, it was stated that we need at some stage to reinvent the banking system so it will perform the normal functions which banks perform in promoting enterprise.  The banks undoubtedly lost the plot over that ten-year period and we need an early warning system to make sure that there is no question of a recurrence of that.</P>
        <P>I thought during that dreadful period that there was a rationale for having the Industrial Credit Corporation and the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  They were both privatised but they performed from the 1930s when the banking system was similarly reluctant to invest in industry.  We need serious reform of the banks.  They had lost touch with important sectors of the Irish economy.  We should try to entice them to have regard for that.  There was evidence from Bloxhams that foreign banks in Ireland played a much bigger role in funding manufacturing industry than the home grown banks.  The banks may have lost the skills to do that and may not know anything about manufacturing industry or  technology, but part of their duty as institutions, into which we put &euro;64 billion, is that they had better acquire those skills again, perhaps play less golf with builders and get involved in the sectors that the Minister has brought before us.  I commend the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  This is an important Bill.  As alluded to by Senator Barrett, it would not have been necessary if the banks had done their business and stuck to what they were set up to do, namely, banking.  Retail banking and investment banking became mixed up and these must be separate.  I refer to the Northern Rock issue in the UK.  When the head of Northern Rock resigned it transpired that he was a public relations person who did not have a banking background.  The banking system needs to change and small businesses must be able to access credit.  </P>
        <P>On a sad note, I spoke last week about a Donegal man, Hugh Green, who is the current Donegal person of the year.  He emigrated to New Zealand 60 years ago and made millions and never borrowed one dollar from a bank in New Zealand.  He became a multimillionaire.  He rang <i>The Irish Times </i>when he was listed on the rich list to say that he was worth twice as much as the newspaper had estimated.  Sadly, he passed away on the night I spoke about him.  May he rest in peace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their support for this Bill.  Senator Barrett is correct that, sadly, we saw the banks take a wrong turning.  A couple of years ago, Ireland was the easiest place in which to get a loan and the refusal rate was a mere 2%.  This was a symptom of the problem.  Banks had lost the run of themselves by issuing money but, sadly, they had demolished their capacity to lend other than on the basis of property.  The Senator is correct that we now have to go about the painful reinvention of our banking system.  Enterprise Ireland which is under the remit of my Department is working with the banks in this regard.  To be fair to the banks, they are re-examining their model and seeking to rebuild it but they are doing so against a background of so much retrenchment in their balance sheets and risk aversion measures that credit is not getting through to small business.  The current refusal rates for small businesses are now the highest in Europe.  It is true that we need to move quickly to fill this gap but this is something the State cannot do.  This Bill is a microfinance initiative which is only a tiny niche within the overall piece but it is a very important niche which is to help, for example, an unemployed person on the back to work allowance who needs a few bob to get a business off the ground.  This is the sort of enterprise which the banks will not touch.  We hope to rebuild that segment and it requires action across the whole spectrum.  </P>
        <P>The development capital fund is aimed at companies higher up the tree, so to speak.  The loan guarantee scheme is aimed at another subsection.  However, the main heavy lifting has to be done by the banks.  The Government has demanded that each of the pillar banks would be accountable for lending &euro;3.5 billion this year to the small and medium enterprise sector.  The banks will also be accountable for the quality of the loans, for ensuring that these will be genuine new loans to new businesses.  We need to relearn the banking and other skills necessary to underpin an export economy.</P>
        <P>I thank the House for its support.  The Government is anxious to enact this legislation as quickly as possible.  The scheme has been developed.  I thank my officials for their work on this Bill.  It has not been easy because the system is not all that well disposed to financial innovation in this current climate.  It took a lot of resilience on the part of my officials and co-operation across the system.  This Bill will probably prove to be one of the most significant actions in this area.  It is evident that this segment, even in a healthy banking system, will not attract a great deal of support.  Small or micro-business is not of great interest to the banking system because of the cost of administration and the higher failure rate.  However, from a community point of view it is very important that these small businesses which are not necessarily exporters, are given a chance to succeed.  The Government is quite happy to cover a relatively high failure rate because the social advantages stretch well beyond the percentage of businesses which do not succeed.  We will return to the House within two years with a report on how this scheme is faring.  I hope we will return with a good news story at that point.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank him for his attendance for the Adjournment debate.  Two Members, Senators Bradford and Landy, have raised similar motions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and I am glad my colleague, Senator Landy, is also raising the subject of local government reform.  We are speaking with less than two years to go until the local government elections.  While the timescale is getter shorter it still gives the Minister, the Government and the House an opportunity to make final decisions on the structures, role and size of local government but decisions will be required in the very near future.  I hope the Minister will indicate his current thinking on the situation.  This matter has been debated previously in the House but decisions will need to be taken in the very near future.  The Minister has both the opportunity and the challenge of deciding the future of local government and of putting structures in place which are to last for 25 to 40 years.  It has been at least a political generation since significant local government reform took place and the structure now requires another reform.  We will need to have a debate about the size of town and county councils, the possibility of sub-structures and the format of same.  I do not wish to be prescriptive but I ask that these decisions are made soon so that current local councillors and the hundreds of people who are interested in running in the local government elections would have a reasonable idea in sufficient time of what will be the new structures and powers of local authorities.  This debate will continue until the elections in 2014 but I ask the Minister to provide an interim report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also seeking an update from the Minister about the future of local government.  I know common ground has been reached on this matter between the Government parties and across the political spectrum but we are no closer to a definite announcement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Tell the people why.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>Many councillors are contacting me and the three associations representing councillors, AMAI, LAMA and ACC, have been in contact with  spokespersons and with individual Oireachtas Members in recent weeks.  They are asking for some final decisions on the process.  I commend the Minister on his decision to take action on this rather than go through a process of producing Green Papers and White Papers, as was done on so many other occasions.  I am anxious to ensure that the urbanised society in which we all now live can continue and that the structures put in place will facilitate this.  We currently have the least representative local government system in Europe, and we do not wish to see that slipping further.</P>
        <P>Reform should not mean reduction in representation but simply reform.  As Senator Bradford said, powers must be devolved from central government and there must be a rebalance of powers between the current executive management at local government level and councillors.  Most important, we must have some sign of a timescale on this issue.  The horse can eat grass for only so long; eventually it will need proper feed.  I would appreciate if the Minister could give us an update on this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Indeed and I thank the Minister for noting it.  Today is the tenth anniversary of my third election to the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators Bradford and Landy for raising this matter.  They have a genuine interest in local government reform and have a genuine interaction with local representatives.  The Government&rsquo;s broad policy approach to local government reform was set out in the programme for Government.  My approach to taking this forward has been characterised by initial decisions in the cases of Limerick and Tipperary, which I made early in the Government&rsquo;s term of office.  I also established the Waterford local government committee to consider whether Waterford city and county councils should be unified, and the report of this committee has been examined.  In addition, a considerable amount of work has been under way for the past eight to nine months relating to the implementation of the local government efficiency agenda, the alignment of the local government and local development sectors, and how to implement plans at local level through new means of local government funding.</P>
        <P>To build on this progress, I intend to bring proposals to the Government very shortly for an extensive programme to reform and develop the local government system.  I assure the Senators I will not hold this up in any way.  Subject to the Government&rsquo;s decisions, I propose to publish a comprehensive policy statement setting out a vision for the future of local government and proposals to achieve it in the form of an action programme on local government.  I agree with Senator Landy that we could have Green Papers and White Papers but what is needed now is an action programme for reforming the system.</P>
        <P>There will be a particular focus in this programme on strengthening the structures of local government generally at each level of the system &mdash; regional, county and sub-county.  Any structure that exists should ensure that it has a meaningful existence and that it has sufficient power and responsibility to act at that level.  There will be a strong emphasis on strengthening and expanding the role of local government, with an indication of functions that have potential for devolution from central level to local level and where greater delegation of responsibility or reduction of central control is proposed.  lmportantly, this includes strengthening and clarifying the role of local government in economic development and enterprise support.  This is underpinned already by the decision to establish the new local enterprise offices in local authorities, integrating the micro-enterprise support functions of the county and city enterprise boards with local authorities&rsquo; business support units.</P>
        <P>An important element of the programme will be to continue and reinforce measures to maximise operational and organisational efficiency, with particular reference to the implementation of the local government efficiency review measures.  There will also be emphasis on improving local government performance generally and the standard of service that it provides for citizens.  When more people are paying for more services, the least they can expect is a good standard and quality of service.  A range of issues that are essential components of a modern system of local government will also be addressed.  This includes: providing for a robust framework of governance, with effective arrangements and mechanisms for policy formulation; accountability; oversight of local authority performance at executive level; ethical standards for councillors and employees; local political and executive leadership; and effective citizen participation and engagement in local authority affairs.  There must be a rebalancing between the powers of management and executive and those of the local democratically-elected councillors.</P>
        <P>The programme will indicate the arrangements required to implement the reform programme and certain issues that will be the subject of further policy development work.  Whatever we propose will require legislation, so there is an opportunity to enhance the programme or policy of reform when the legislative programme will be giving effect to those reforms in 2013.  Of course, proposals to put in place a sound, stable and equitable system of local government funding, with a significant element of local responsibility for raising resources and deciding spending priorities, is fundamental to the reform and development of local government.  Opportunities for local funding is a key essential to ensuring there is greater autonomy for the local elected representative.  The ultimate aim of the action programme is to have a local government system that supports a good quality of life and delivers value for money for people in local communities, and that makes a substantial contribution to the national recovery effort.</P>
        <P>Work on the development of policy proposals for Government consideration in this area is informed by the extensive analysis that has already taken place on local government reform over the past 20 years.  I have received submissions, even up to recently, from councillors throughout the country.  I thank the 21% of them who responded to the recent survey and the local government representative associations.  Individual local authorities have made submissions over the years and principally in the past year.  I have engaged with all the representative organisations, as well as with many individuals, about reform of local government.  The publication of the action programme on local government will provide a further opportunity for public comment and input ahead of the development of the legislation, and the legislation will also provide an opportunity to Senators and Deputies to further advance any additional measures they wish to include.  The content of local government reform legislation will be a matter for Government decision in the first instance and will, of course, be the subject of Oireachtas scrutiny and debate in the normal way.</P>
        <P>I hope that whatever proposals on policy for local government reform that emerge in the context of our public statement will be meaningful and will give an additional opportunity to people to engage robustly on the new opportunities for local government, where it will have more power, more devolution of responsibility, more opportunities for funding and better structures for the elected member.  That will give greater accountability for the money that is spent at local level and councillors will be in a better position to scrutinise the management and executive of the local authority with the additional powers and responsibility given to them, so there will be a meaningful opportunity for them to engage with the executive to deliver better quality services for the people who elected them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister indicated that 21% of councillors responded to the survey.  On a lighter note, he will recall that when our mutual friend, the late Senator Jackie Daly, conducted a similar survey on local government and I believe he received a 100% response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, our great friend, the late Senator Jack Daly, carried out a survey to find out whether the 1984 local elections should be postponed, and he received an 85% response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>And 100% support.  On the action programme which the Minister will publish in the near future, the Minister indicated that it will allow for an input before the drafting of legislation.  Will the action programme contain his decisions regarding the structures of local government, the number of town and county councillors and so forth, or is the action programme the first part of a phase that will lead to an announcement on the future of county councils, town councils, numbers and so forth?  My question is on behalf of the councillors who contacted me.  When will the Minister announce the number of councillors, the size of the areas and the future of town councils?  Will that be in the action programme?  It does not have to be.  It is important that we have this ongoing and broad debate.  Let us get it right rather than rush it.  Will the action programme allow the ongoing process to continue, in terms of the debate for and against big councils, small councils and so forth?  When will those decisions be made?</P>

	<P>I can confirm to Senator Bradford that as part of the policy statement a boundary commission will have to be established for the purpose of looking at the wards in each county and local government area.  That will be established by early September with a view to reporting in January 2013.  That will give people who are interested in standing in the local elections 18 months to get their feet into the right electoral area to get the right result for themselves.</P>

When I put something to the Government I always do so on the basis that there will be a positive outcome, but I cannot prejudge the discussions that take place in Cabinet.  I would like to have it sooner rather than later but, in fairness to my Cabinet colleagues, they should have an input into it.  They will be having an input very shortly.</P>

    <sTitle>Patient Transport Services</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  This matter relates to the withdrawal of an essential service connecting Donegal and hospitals in Dublin.  The service has been subsidised by the HSE, formerly the health boards, for some 38 years.  The service entails the transportation to Dublin of patients with hospital appointments in the city when they are unable to receive their required medical care, attention or treatment in Letterkenny and Sligo general hospitals.  Marley Coach Hire, which has operated the service for the past 38 years, received confirmation last week from the HSE that the subsidy of almost &euro;100,000 would be withdrawn with effect from 27 July, ten days from today.  The withdrawal will leave many families and ill patients, who may never even have used the service, without a service.  The security of having the service will be withdrawn to make an apparent saving of &euro;100,000.  This is shameful and disgraceful, particularly given the waste within the HSE at present, despite the promises made by the Minister for Health to combat waste.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us consider some of the key statistics pertaining to the Department.  Agency staff costs have doubled in four years and are in excess of &euro;200 million this year, despite assurances by the Minister for Health in the D&aacute;il last September, October and November that they would be reduced greatly.  The cost of taxi services within the HSE has risen by 10%, from &euro;26 million in 2010 to &euro;28 million in 2011.  Medico-legal payments and associated costs have risen from &euro;39 million in 2008 to a projected &euro;127 million this year.  The overtime bill in the HSE and Department of Health was &euro;170 million in 2011.  In the first five months of this year, it has amounted to &euro;69 million.</P>
        <P>Despite what has been promised, the expenditure increases and waste have been escalating within the Department of Health.  The service to which I refer costs only &euro;100,000.  If any of the aforementioned costs had been tackled, as promised by the Minister for Health, &euro;100,000 would be but a drop in the ocean by comparison with the overall budget.  We face over-expenditure in the Department of Health this year of at least &euro;500 million.  The returns that were to have been made to the Revenue Commissioners were late.  The Department has been penalised and the interest and penalties that accrued amounted to &euro;100,000, which is exactly what we need to keep the service open in County Donegal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I know the Minister of State is not directly responsible for the Department of Health, he should note there is a serious issue within the HSE owing to taxpayers&rsquo; money that is unaccounted for.  There is significant over-expenditure.  How can individuals in County Donegal, a geographically isolated area, be expected to travel to Dublin on public transport vehicles that are not wheelchair accessible, unlike those provided by Marley Coach Hire?  If patients are ill, how can they be expected to attend for emergency treatment or urgent appointments?  Many of the individuals concerned are elderly.  How can they be expected to navigate through the streets of Dublin on foot, taxi or connecting bus?  The nature of the service is hard to contemplate for somebody who lives in Dublin city.  Those from a country area depend on the kind of service that would bring one from Letterkenny General Hospital to a hospital in Dublin in the morning for an appointment and bring one home in the evening without one having to get a taxi or navigate through the city of Dublin.</P>
        <P>This morning, a Senator spoke on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; about the dangers in O&rsquo;Connell Street in Dublin during the day and night.  The people from Donegal to whom I refer will be dropped off in O&rsquo;Connell Street if the service is withdrawn.  I refer to sick, elderly and disabled people.  This is simply unacceptable.  How can it be justified given the massive over-expenditure and freefall in the HSE, bearing in mind that the service in question is critical if the elderly and most vulnerable are to be protected when travelling to emergency hospital appointments?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue, particularly in the wider context of non-emergency patient transport.</P>
        <P>I wish to make it clear on behalf of the Minister for Health that the HSE has no statutory responsibility to provide transport or support for patients to attend its facilities or clinics.  Patient transport funding is primarily intended to provide an emergency ambulance service.  The cost of non-emergency transport rose significantly over the latter part of the previous decade, as stated by the Senator, and provision was not uniform across the State.  Accordingly, this was an area identified for improved budgetary control and management.</P>
        <P>Against this background, I wish to set out the principles that underpin the HSE&rsquo;s operational practice for non-emergency patient transport.  As a rule, patients should make their own transport arrangements, especially where public transport is available, unless there are clear clinical factors involved.  HSE ambulance resources and health care personnel should be used only where there is a clinical need for such service &mdash; for example, medical or nursing support during a journey or where a stretcher is required &mdash; and the HSE should arrange other transport only when the patient is not in a position to make or fund his or her transport arrangements.</P>
        <P>The Donegal-Dublin bus service mentioned by the Senator has been extensively subsidised by the HSE over many years, and the HSE has now reviewed the service to assess its viability.  In recent years, there has been an increase in public transport services on the Donegal-Dublin route, with shorter journey times.  This has resulted in fewer patients using the HSE-funded service.  The review has shown that, in recent months, on average five people per day have been using the service.  Additionally, Letterkenny General Hospital has in recent years sought to reduce the number of people travelling outside the region by improving and increasing services.</P>
        <P>Given the need for the HSE to operate within available resources, it is necessary to review all costs to ensure that spending is necessary and effective and that essential core services are maintained.  The level of support available at any given time for non-emergency transport is dependent on financial resources, and such resources are very limited.  The cost of the subsidised bus service is now approaching &euro;100,000 per year.  Based on the number of the people using the service, the alternatives available and the cost-effectiveness, the HSE has made the decision to discontinue funding the service from 27 July 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate that the Minister of State was reading a response from the Department of Health.  Expenditure on the patient taxi service within the HSE in 2010 amounted to &euro;26,025,000.  Last year, which, according to a recent response to a parliamentary question, is the last year for which we have up-to-date figures, expenditure in this area rose by &euro;1.6 million.  The HSE&rsquo;s contention that five people per day use the bus service from Donegal is disputed by the bus operator, whom I believe has more up-to-date figures.  There are question marks over the HSE&rsquo;s figures.  However, this is not really where the argument lies; the argument is that the service is essential.  The taxi budget of the HSE, which has responsibility in this area, will escalate if the service is withdrawn.  How can sick people who cannot physically enter a public transport vehicle with no means of access for the disabled travel to Dublin for an essential appointment without getting a taxi paid for by the HSE?  The cost incurred by the HSE will escalate if the service is withdrawn.  I have spoken to staff in the health sector who have confirmed this.  It is wishful thinking to say that, on the one hand, it would save &euro;100,000, but the budget will escalate by &euro;500 million this year.  It does not make sense.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Wearing my Department of Public Expenditure and Reform hat, I can confirm to the Deputy and the House that the overruns cannot happen in the HSE this year.  This was referred to in the most recent visit of the troika.  Everybody must live within the budgets and how the HSE manages its budgets is a matter for the executive in the first instance.  It is not the job of the Minister for Health to second-guess those decisions if there is a belief, locally, that a decision like this must be taken.  I appreciate the difficulty it causes for people who previously used the service.  The overruns are a reality that must be checked between now and 31 December this year.</P>

    <sTitle>Services for People with Disabilities</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I wish to raise the severe cutbacks to the service provided by St. John of God services in Drumcar, County Louth, and the effect this is having on the users of the service.  St. John of God north-east services provides for the care of people with an intellectual disability and this year alone the cutbacks to the service amounted to &euro;1.5 million.  Since 2005, the cutbacks have come to over &euro;4 million.  I have first-hand experience in witnessing how the staff there have continually implemented increased efficiencies, including taking on additional responsibilities.  One of the respite care workers told me that shower facilities, including gel and shampoo, used to be provided but the staff, on their own time, now buy shampoo to take in for the children or adults in respite.  They have done everything possible but at this point they can no longer deliver the previous levels of service.  The users and their families are now being hit with these cuts.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">In the residential services alone, it will not be possible to accept any more admissions without specific funding for such places, and I and other colleagues have raised this in the Seanad in the past couple of weeks.  In Drumcar there are 60 people on the waiting list, with seven in need of immediate placement.  There are people in need of residential care and I am fighting hard for one particular family where a daughter is paraplegic and needs percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and 24-hour care.  However, there is no place for her and age is not on the parents&rsquo; side.  The mother&rsquo;s health is also suffering, although she is providing 24-hour care for the daughter because there is no residential place available.</P>
        <P>Since 12 June there is only one respite house in operation, while previously there were two working.  As a parent of a child using the respite services, I am gutted, as are the other parents who have come to me.  The children would have had access to respite every month before but respite for children is now down to ten days in the month and available for 20 days for adults.  Dividing that between the 80 children seeking the services, it results in one day every eight months.  People live for respite as it is the only break they get.  With all the implementation of such cutbacks, if we do not seek something to alleviate the pressure in St. John of God, it will only add to the mental health issues of families and people helping to care for the service users.</P>
        <P>The places for day services are now full; specifically, the Drumcar Park Enterprises and Venegas centres, where students would traditionally go, are full.  In a recent letter received by parents from the St. John of God services, it was hesitantly indicated that there were suggestions in some forums that a way around the difficulty would be for a client to have two days of day services one week and three days the next.  Thank God, it was mentioned that it is not their intention to implement this system immediately, as it would be a detrimental move.  Any children leaving school at 18 know that if they fill in a CAO form or college application, they know where they are going.  It is awful that the most vulnerable children are being hardest hit.</P>
        <P>The St. John of God services also used to traditionally give a weekly allowance to clients.  It was a pittance but it meant much to those people, bringing a feeling of independence.  The clients cannot understand how they have lost what they call their money for their work, or the part-time jobs in some of the service units within the St. John of God service.</P>
        <P>I fully support the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and the Government in the policy in the programme for Government to maintain people in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  In order to do this, there should be adequate support.  That is where respite options come in, and people can do it if they know they will get a break.  That might only be one or two nights a month.  Traditionally, respite services used to be able to offer parents of children and adults two weeks holidays during the summer that could be spread out but that cannot happen.  If there is a family emergency, there is no guarantee that respite will be available.  When a person cannot feel there is somebody to help in an emergency, it can be very scary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator, on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for raising this matter and I am pleased to take this opportunity to outline the current position regarding St. John of God north-east services.  As the Senator is aware, St. John of God services provides services to adults and children with an intellectual disability.  These services include residential, respite and day services.  St. John of God north-east services is funded by the HSE under section 38 of the Health Act, 2004.  Services are provided through a service arrangement which is signed on an annual basis and reviewed continually.  St. John of God north-east services received significant funding from the HSE of &euro;27.7 million in 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Senator is aware, the disability budget nationally was cut by 3.7% in 2012.  The Health Service Executive national service plan states that at least 2% of this should not impact on services and needs to be generated from other savings and increased efficiencies.  The HSE has advised me that there will be a maximum reduction of 1.7% in the funding for day, residential and respite services in the north east.  The HSE is working in Dublin north east to address the 2% savings required by improving integration of staffing levels and skill mix between day, transport and residential respite services to achieve cost reductions safely, with minimal impact on front line services.  The HSE has assured me that it will endeavour to ensure that residential, day, respite and personal assistant services are protected where possible from reductions in front line services.  However, some reductions in services will be unavoidable, even with such efficiencies.  The aim will be to tailor such reductions in a way which minimises the impact on service users and their families as much as possible.</P>
        <P>As a first step, the HSE has indicated a general reduction of 3.7% from the budget of disability agencies, pending the outcome of its discussions at a local level with individual agencies.  I recognise the valuable contribution St. John of God services make to the provision of services to people with intellectual disabilities in the Louth, Monaghan and Meath areas.  The HSE is very much aware of the challenges service providers, including St. John of God north-east services, are experiencing, and the particular difficulties facing all health services in 2012.  It is vital that all providers work creatively and co-operatively to ensure the maximum level of services is maintained for service users within the funding resources available.  In this context, the HSE is in ongoing active discussions with St. John of God services to minimise the impact of the budget reductions on services and clients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State spoke about minimising the impact, but a huge impact is already being felt.  We are trying to keep everybody at home for as long as possible but reductions in services such as this will very often push families into making decisions about having to seek residential care for elderly parents who need care.  They would prefer to look after them at home but cannot do so without support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">She more than anyone else understands the importance of respite care and its necessity in the range of services being provided for people in this situation.  I know this from my constituency.  The crucial issue is how to maintain front-line services while ongoing cutbacks are being made.  Many of these decisions should be left to local areas to determine.  In so far as the Government is concerned every effort will be made to minimise the impact on local communities.  I appreciate the difficulty faced with regard to the budget and the impact it has across a range of services, particularly on providers.  This is why the view of the Minister of State, and the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is to examine how to ensure people work creatively with the budgets that exist.  The reductions being made are significant but they are smaller than in other areas.  The question must be posed as to how we reconfigure the service and examine the issue of pay again to ensure the front line remains in place and the services exist for those who need them.  This must be the priority for us all.</P>

    <sTitle>Civil Service Role</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  He is on the home run now.  I question the role of the Civil Service and ask who is running the country.  Is it the Civil Service or the Government?  I was a civil servant and I am mindful the majority of them are good people and do a very good job. However, I am also of the opinion that certain civil servants think they are more powerful than the Minister and Government and they dictate the pace. Since I came to the Seanad it has infuriated me that civil servants can knock on the head things I think are achievable.  I suggested to the Department of Education and Skills that a particular national school needed extra classrooms because of the increase in roll numbers.  They had obtained some but needed more.  Departmental officials continually told the Minister it was wrong and that the numbers were decreasing.  Six months later, when it was too late, the officials admitted they were wrong and that they had given the wrong information to the Minister.  They were then not in a position to provide funding for the extra classrooms required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Social Protection officials come to committee meetings - every Member of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad will probably say the same thing - and tell us how quickly they are dealing with new applications for carer&rsquo;s allowance and that appeals are being dealt with within the three and a half or four month timeframe but the reality is that it could be more than 12 months.  We just accept this from the same civil servants.</P>
        <P>I introduced a Bill on wind turbines in the House which successfully passed Second Stage but as soon as that happened officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government contacted me.  They did not want the Bill to go through because they wanted business as usual.  They wanted wind turbines to be sited wherever they wanted them to be to achieve certain goals, which they probably will achieve but at a major cost to the environment.</P>
        <P>The worst example of all of civil servants or public servants in operation was after the closure of the accident and emergency department in Roscommon, which was another botch by HIQA getting involved with the Department of Health stating it was unsafe when it had never visited the hospital.  However, setting this aside, after the closure a group of us got together to see how we could better the health service in Roscommon where there is a void.  At the time I pointed out the need for an ambulance base in my town.  I suggested to the county manager that we could use the fire station if it were to go ahead.  I and others made proposals at a forum at which the HSE was present.  My proposal was accepted and the HSE got involved.  The Minister for Health wants this to happen as do the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the chief ambulance officer for the entire western region, the acting chief fire officer in Roscommon, the station officer and the firemen.  After three months of negotiations and wheeling and dealing between the HSE and the local authority, the HSE came up with a service level agreement which the chief fire officer accepted but one person in the local authority decided he did not want to go down this road and he has been able to put a stop to it.  It does not make sense.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Colm McCarthy proposed to the Government that we share services and it is Government policy, yet a civil servant can decide something is too much trouble for him or her.  We have a serious issue.  This is all about accountability and who is accountable to whom.  Are civil servants accountable to Ministers or are Ministers beholden to civil servants?  This is the question.  I accept we have many good civil servants but many people are employed in the public service and Civil Service who would frustrate one.  They find ways to not achieve something instead of trying to find ways to achieve it.  The project I outlined would cost approximately &euro;15,000 a year if it went ahead as nothing extra is involved.  The HSE is willing to pay the local authority &euro;15,000 a year for utilities and there are no capital costs.  It makes sense but people are frustrating the process.  I would like to hear the comments of the Minister of State on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his very interesting remarks.  The title of the motion was the need for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to clarify the role of civil servants and their interaction with Ministers and the Government.  It is a big title.  I have a very interesting script from the Department but I will not use it.</P>
        <P>The issue we face is one of political accountability because ultimately we must have a system based on parliamentary democracy whereby people elected to jobs have the task of responding to both Houses on performance on these tasks.  Where policy is enunciated by the Government one would have thought this policy is then implemented by those public servants whose responsibility is to put it into effect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator cited four examples, which were very frustrating for him I suspect, where progress or action he wanted to see was being frustrated by a number of individuals.  I have not heard their side of the story or the rationale for their view so it is difficult for me to comment.  The Civil Service is entirely professional and independent and it gives its advice to the Government in a way that takes into account all competing policy interests.  I understand the Senator&rsquo;s frustration, and one could argue his speech was like the last chapter in the book at the end of a very long political career, but on the contrary he is a new Senator who I suspect may be in the other House at some point.  It is very important that he take up these issues with the Minister of the day who has responsibility in these areas, whether agriculture, social protection or health, to see whether progress can be made.  It should not be the case that civil servants stand in the way once a decision has been made and it is in the interests of the system.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        
        <P>The great advantage of the public sector we have is that it can weigh up problems.  However, ultimately it is a political call as to what the outcome has to be.  In other systems, when one comes into government one can bring all the administration in with one.  Those in senior positions from the previous administration leave.  That may well be a view that the Senator is espousing and thinks is relevant and there may be merit in it.  There is a necessity to have some bridge between the public service and the political system in terms of making sure that what Ministers want to happen actually occurs.  That is crucial.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From the script given to me by the Department which I will forward to the Senator for a fascinating read, we are looking at all these issues.  We are clarifying the role of the public sector in terms of advice, freedom of information, and what it is and is not accountable for.  One of the key parts of the programme for Government is that where civil servants believe that a policy position such as decentralisation was contrary to a range of other objectives, they could speak publically about it and have their views recorded.  Perhaps that would be a more useful way of engaging in this debate.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s frustration but untimately the answer is this is a political responsibility for that Minister of group of Ministers to make sure they believe in him and what he is attempting to do.  That is the only way progress can be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister of State pointed out that we are talking about the same Civil Service.  I am not talking about the Civil Service at large but senior advisers in the Civil Service who have been giving the same advice to the last three Governments.  I am not suggesting we get rid of all of them but there has to be some kind of accountability which does not apply at present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister, Deputy Hogan, was in the House earlier.  In fairness, under local government reform he stated the executive needed to be held to account.  This is not happening.  I thank the Minister of State and thank him for not reading out script.</P>
