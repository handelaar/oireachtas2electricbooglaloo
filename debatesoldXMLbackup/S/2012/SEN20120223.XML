	<P>I have received notice from Senator Michael Comiskey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine to give a commitment that the Teagasc office in Manorhamilton, County Leitrim, will remain open in view of the fact that it provides an essential service for farmers in north Sligo and north Leitrim.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jimmy Harte of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to discuss the proposed closure of Lifford Community Hospital in light of the favourable HIQA report.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kathryn Reilly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to discuss the recent meeting of the action group on youth unemployment with European Commission officials, the work plan of this group and the actions and initiatives it intends to take to tackle youth unemployment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Averil Power of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to give an update on the current position on the Priory Hall development and to advise if he intends to meet the residents in order that he can hear their stories first-hand, rather than Dublin City Council&rsquo;s version of events.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mark Daly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to outline the amount spent on wastewater treatment plants in the past 15 years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Colm Burke of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to request all local authorities, including town, city and county councils, to have on their websites the names of the employees who are responsible for the management of individual <Col N="2"/>departments and the names of persons who are responsible for each individual area within each department, in order that citizens can identify the relevant person who has responsibility for their query.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Comiskey, Harte and Power and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise a serious matter, which I already raised in the House the day after the fiscal compact was signed.  There were reports then from senior sources in Europe saying the treaty was designed to ensure there would be no referendum on the treaty itself.  The Minister of State for European affairs, Deputy Creighton, attended the House and flatly denied that.  After I questioned her, the Leader dismissed that suggestion.  This morning, however, we read that Germany&rsquo;s Minister for European affairs, Mr. Michael Link, has confirmed that European negotiatiors sought to design the eurozone fiscal compact in such as way as to avoid a referendum.  The German Minister visited Dublin yesterday.  This is an extremely serious subversion of the democratic process.  I am even more concerned that the Minister of State for European affairs could flatly deny this in the House.  The day after the treaty was signed, we knew of reports from Europe which said it was designed to facilitate Ireland in order that there would be no referendum here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am tabling an amendment to the Order of Business in order that the Minister of State for European affairs can attend the House today to clarify the position.  Did she not know that this was the case or did she willingly mislead the House?  I put it to you, a Chathaoirligh, that she misled this House because it was very clear.  If Germany&rsquo;s Minister for European affairs knows that the treaty was designed to ensure there was no EU referendum, how in God&rsquo;s name does our Minister of State for European affairs not know the same thing?  I put it to you, a Chathaoirligh, that she did, as did the Taoiseach and all our negotiators.  As this is a very serious departure, I am calling for the Minister of State for European affairs to come here straight after the Order of Business or at any stage today &mdash; we will facilitate her &mdash; to clarify this position.  If she wants to deny what the German Minister said, she should put it on the record.</P>
        <P>Is it the Government&rsquo;s view that Bord G&aacute;is, the ESB and Aer Lingus are of strategic importance?  Will the Leader confirm that in the original memorandum of understanding no figure or commitment was given to privatise any State assets?  In Fine Gael&rsquo;s election manifesto, and in the programme for Government, it was proposed to sell up to &euro;7 billion worth of State assets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards the Government&rsquo;s record on job creation &mdash; notwithstanding the positive announcement concerning PayPal earlier this week &mdash; Members of the House should not forget that the Government is taking &euro;2 billion from private pension funds to put into job creation by way of its jobs initiative, which simply has not worked.  Unemployment rose last year by <Col N="3"/>0.5% between July and December.  Why should anyone trust the Government, a Government that is trying to make a big play on the fact that we will be allowed to use one third of the price realised to create jobs, to sell State assets?  It is like selling the TV set to pay for the TV licence.  It makes no sense.  What I want to know is whether Aer Lingus is of strategic importance to the Government and the State.  Are Bord G&aacute;is and the ESB of strategic importance to the State?</P>

	<P>To suggest that Fianna F&aacute;il did not envisage the sale of State assets in the original memorandum of understanding is nonsense and they know it.  They are being disingenuous about it.

	<P>It is typical behaviour from the other side of the House.  They are afraid to hear the truth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I call for a debate on the Pathways to Work programme, which is being launched today.  I very much welcome this new programme, which will bring together the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills.  This is a significant initiative to ensure we see proper job activation measures put in place and a really joined up way of thinking in terms of putting the long-term unemployed back to work and giving people incentives to go into training and re-employment and come off the long-term live register.  This is a major exciting initiative of the <Col N="5"/>Ministers, Deputies Burton and Quinn, and the entire Government.  It would be very useful to debate it.  I know the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, will come to the House on 6 March and perhaps we could include a debate on Pathways to Work at that time.</P>
        <P>I wish to follow on from Senator Crown and express the sympathy of the House on the deaths of two journalists in Syria.  We need to have a cross-party motion on the need to protect civilian lives in Syria.  It is appalling what is happening, with the Syrian bombardment, and to see the number killed yesterday, including children, is really appalling.  Perhaps next week we could agree a cross-party motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryAnnOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">News has just broken that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has turned down the children&rsquo;s hospital.  What can be more important than the care of sick children?  Once again, listening to &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; I heard Phillip Lynch say that we have wasted &euro;25 million and now &euro;35 million on the process and consultation on the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health and others in charge of planning to move on and not spend another four years and another &euro;35 million fighting about whether the hospital should move to a site in the M50 area, which it should, because there are 26 counties in this country and the middle of Dublin was never the right location.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday I held a very successful and productive session with a number of the country&rsquo;s leading business women, focusing on the challenges of doing business in Ireland today.  One of the strands that came up repeatedly in the discussion was the cost associated with administrative compliance.  Many of the ladies suggested that these costs often prevent small business owners from expanding their business and creating new jobs.  I now identify one very simple step to lower administrative costs on small businesses, which has presented itself.  It comes in the form of an optional directive, agreed earlier this week at a meeting of Finance Ministers at the European Union.  The directive would allow small companies to be exempted from publishing annual accounts in a bid to lessen their bureaucratic costs and to encourage small firms to take on more staff.  The rules will apply to companies which have an average of ten employees or fewer over the course of an accounting year, with a balance sheet of under &euro;350,000 and a net turnover of &euro;700,000.  To qualify for the exemption, companies must satisfy at least two of these criteria.  Germany and France are in favour of this directive.  The new rule will not overrule national obligations to keep records showing businesses&rsquo; transactions but should lessen the administrative costs of setting up a small business.  Will the Leader seek clarity on the Government&rsquo;s position on this directive and use his influence to encourage the Government to sign up to this worthwhile proposal, which will make a major difference to business owners who are the life, soul and blood of the economy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I express regret that a very interesting and sometimes stormy debate on the media yesterday was not reported at all.  I would have thought the media would be interested in it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It was on Twitter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support my colleagues, particular Senator Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien, who spoke about the children&rsquo;s hospital.  This is an absolute disaster.  I raised this issue a number of years ago and suggested that it be sent to an international review panel, including planning and medical experts.  It would have taken about a month to six weeks, but that was not done.  It actually suited me to have the hospital where it was, in terms of the metro, but I think one must put the children first and this is a disaster because there will be no other appeal.  This is a decision on an appeal.  I do not know what can be done about it, but something needs to be <Col N="6"/>done urgently.  Perhaps the aspects that conflict with the visual amenity can be amended in some redrawn plan, but we must act urgently for the sake of children.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the question of privatisation of State assets, I am horrified at the notion we should be grateful for being allowed to use one third of our own money.  That shows an extraordinary degree of obsequiousness.  Selling off utilities is almost always disastrous.  Let us look at the ESB &mdash; the parallel is in the privatisation of energy production in America, particularly in California, which gave us Enron, a lovely bonanza for the public.  It led to bankruptcies, people losing their pensions, higher costs and massive electrical blackouts across the state.  That is what one might possibly expect.  With regard to Coillte, imagine selling the forests of Ireland.  Let nobody who votes for this ever again talk about the use of Irish oak or Irish timber for the building of the British Navy, because we are flogging it off wholesale.  It reminds me of James Joyce's comment that there were people who would not only sell their country for thruppence but they would get down on their bended knee and thank the Almighty Christ that they had a country to sell.  That is what is going on, which is appalling.  I notice that the newspapers reported that one of the companies tendering for Coillte was headed by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern.  That is interesting. What about safeguarding access to the walks in the forests?  I speak from experience in my family where a relative sold trees but did not specify a date by which they had to be harvested.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I am asking for a debate on this subject.  We need to be very careful to protect the trees.  If we are going to make this disastrous decision, at least let us ensure that it will have the least hazardous outcome possible.</P>

	<P>I cannot wait to get the chance to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Perhaps we could have a debate on foreign affairs as we have not had one for a long time.  There is the question of the journalists who were killed.  It is appalling.  They are particularly at risk, as are human rights defenders.  Although I am a long-time admirer of President Ch&aacute;vez, he seems to have lost his marbles totally, or his supporters have, in attacking Mr. Capriles, who is his most significant opponent, in a horrible anti-Semitic way with the Star of David on the front of the newspapers.</P>

	<P>I can requote it but I will not as I do not wish to waste my time as it was already quoted by Senator Bacik.  In regard to the word &ldquo;strategic&rdquo;, the Government&rsquo;s commitment is clear. The Bord G&aacute;is transmission networks and interconnectors will not be put up for sale because it is recognised that they are strategic.  The energy business, however, will be put up for sale, although the ESB is not for sale.  Some of the non-strategic power generation is to be sold but the minority shareholding in ESB is to be retained.  There was a proposal that would be done but that is not going to happen.  If and when market conditions are correct, the 25% stake we have in Aer Lingus will be sold.  What good is it to us when we look at the debacle in Shannon some years ago when Aer Lingus removed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, namely, that the Minister for Health come to the House immediately to explain the implications of this morning&rsquo;s decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is an outrage.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision refers to the impact on visual amenity, detraction from the character of protected buildings and overdevelopment of the site.  Are these issues about which we should be concerned when one considers the headlines yesterday of children lying on trolleys for 12 hours and a 700% increase in waiting lists for paediatric patients throughout the country?  Where is the joined up workings of Government?  Can nobody in An Bord Plean&aacute;la liaise with the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Health in the context of critical infrastructural projects?</P>

	<P Just="Left">There must be a level of joined up thinking in the Government.  I recall the imagination of one tweeter who said: &ldquo;So Bord Plean&aacute;la which oversaw the Celtic tiger planning fiasco stops the only viable construction project for the entire country.&rdquo;  This is an outrage.  That is why I demand that the Minister for Health come to the House immediately to explain this decision, which is a disaster, and indicate if it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to seek a judicial review in the High Court, which would have to be done within a few weeks, to resolve the issue.  It does not bear thinking about that we may have to go back to the beginning of a process that has taken many years, including arguments about the site, and cost &euro;35 million.  We thought we were there but now the interests of the impact on visual amenity and the detraction from the character of protected structures, which is a highly subjective view of individual planners have taken precedence.  It is not remotely as important as the paediatric care required for children.  We must put the children first and if that requires legislation through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Government to take a hand in the planning process, in the interests of public health, that is what must happen.</P>

In recent weeks, I have been in correspondence with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy R&oacute;isin Shortall,  who has responsibility in this area.  I assure members, through the Minister, that the PCRS will come to the House and provide an information seminar.  In her letter the Minister of State said she was keen to set up an information session for Members of the Oireachtas on medical card processes and procedures and the recent changes and on how best to assist constituents with medical card applications.  She has said she has already discussed this issue with the PCRS and that it is very much amenable to it.  A review of the process is taking place in Finglas and when that review is complete the PCRS will come into the House and provide a seminar in the AV room for all Members.</P>
        <P>I understand the Joint Committee on Health and Children will visit the unit but all of us who are not members of the committee would be excluded from attending.  I welcome the seminar and ask the Leader to co-operate with the Minister to ensure all members are made aware of it to ensure a good turnout on this issue which is of much concern.</P>

	<P>I remind the House of the visit today of archbishop John Barwa of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India.  As I mentioned yesterday, the archbishop is in Ireland as a guest of Aid to the Church in Need and comes from one of the poorest regions in India.  It is one of the regions where there has been intense and sustained persecution of Christian people.  Some horrific incidents have taken place such as the torching of more than 4,000 houses and 252 churches, without counting the loss of life.  More than 500 Christians have been killed and more than 54,000 people have been made homeless.  It is an opportunity for us to hear at first hand what some of the most vulnerable people are suffering.  This can inform our thoughts as we continue our discussions about human rights and solidarity with people in different parts of the world.  I invite my colleagues to the audio visual room at 12.15 p.m.  I appreciate Members are busy doing other things but if they can attend it would be helpful and much appreciated.</P>

This happens mainly in the high-tech goods area.  An example is an iPad costing &euro;487; the additional cost of &euro;149 is to cover damage and breakdown for two years and theft in the first year.  When one takes out the small print, the company offering that particular cover does not include iPads.</P>

Many problems with electrical equipment will be covered already by the manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty.  These additional policies sold at the counter by staff on commission allow the purchaser little time to consider the cover's details and its cost.  This is a major issue that needs to be investigated.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to examine it as customers are paying in excess for cover they may not need at all for electrical goods?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I must admit that I am incandescent with rage to discover that we live in a &ldquo;banana-plean&aacute;la republic&rdquo;, which is what we now have as a result of the catastrophic decision about the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  I know others have raised the matter but a couple of facts must go onto the public record.  There were very fine arguments to be advanced in favour of developing the Crumlin hospital site.  I supported that plan.  Others had very fine arguments for developing it in the Mater.  The main argument is that it would be beside a large general hospital and that there would be synergies, efficiencies, economies of scale and increased expertise.  There was a downside to it which related to the physical plant, geography, location and traffic issues.  There were plus and minus arguments on all sides.  It does not necessarily speak very well of my profession because I believe that none of the opinions which were articulated at that time were completely disinterested.  Most people acted out of some degree of chauvinism on behalf of their own institution.  People from UCD favoured the Mater site, people from Trinity College and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, favoured the Crumlin site, people from the north side favoured the Mater, people affiliated with Temple Street favoured the Mater and people affiliated with Crumlin opposed the Mater.  This was the way it shook down.  Everyone knew a decision was going to be made.  As someone once stated, medical politics are so vicious because so little is at stake, but there is much at stake in this case.  The wise consensus was that, after the decision was made, those who proposed a different solution would be quiet, sit on their hands, lick their wounds and go ahead with the decision.  The decision was to develop the Mater site.  Some people believed it was a good one, some a bad one, but at least it was made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The grounds for turning down the development have been used as an excuse against every necessary short-term and medium-term investment in pediatric services.  They should not be used now, as we are building a children&rsquo;s hospital.  The grounds are aesthetic and architectural.  If the hospital was built, there would be a prison in front of it, a second hospital beside it and another hospital behind it.  The street beside it is not necessarily regarded as being one of the great beautiful boulevards of Europe.  The hospital&rsquo;s construction is being blocked because <Col N="18"/>people believe it is too tall, not because it is the wrong site for traffic or for medical reasons.  This does not wash.  We cannot allow this to be an excuse for endlessly putting the development on the long finger.  An urgent decision needs to be made to overrule An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to amend the plan or to go ahead.  Aesthetics and architecture are being used as excuses to delay the development.</P>
        
        <P>In other sad news, it appears that the Iranian Government has launched the next stage of the legal process to execute Pastor Nadarkhani for no other crime than being a Christian.  I thank the House for its attention and I hope the Leader will bring this issue to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I also hope that the Minister for Health, in whom I have great faith, will quickly and decisively intervene to get this pediatric hospital business straightened out once and for all.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, is disappointed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision regarding the children&rsquo;s hospital.  A great deal of time has been lost and an expert group was convened.  We are discussing the urgent treatment of sick children.  Given the waiting lists, we cannot afford to waste time and money.  There is merit in the suggestion that the Government should explore the possibility of a judicial review.  Will the Leader convey this message?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Pathways to Work programme being launched by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, today.  She is coming to grips with helping people on the live register return to employment.  The programme contains a number of measures and people will be led through the process by the hand to get suitable work and placements.  Everyone in receipt of social welfare payments has entered into a contract with the State for supports.  People must show that they are actively engaging with work and the State in this regard.  A question has been put to me.  Quite a number of people around the country are involved in Occupy campaigns, for example, Occupy Dame Street and Occupy Eyre Square.  Are they actively seeking work or availing of social welfare?  There need to be checks, as it is all coming out of the public purse.  We all have a duty to engage actively.</P>

If she is planning to make employers pay for sick leave, she will endanger that relationship.  She is on to a good thing, but let us proceed carefully in respect of the issue of sick pay.  The Leader was asked for a debate on this matter yesterday.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join my colleague, Senator Norris, in raising the issue on the ongoing carnage in Syria.  I raised the matter on the Order of Business some weeks ago when innocent children were killed by the Syrian regime.  Two distinguished journalists, a French photojournalist and a print journalist, have now been killed and there is a suggestion that the <Col N="19"/>regime is targeting journalists who operate on the front line.  Sometimes, their work is considerably undervalued, but we would not know what was happening without them.  The city of Homs is being pummelled into dust and innocents are being killed wholesale, yet the world seems to be standing by and doing nothing about it.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, who is chairman of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and has made it his priority to raise human rights issues in that capacity, to state Ireland&rsquo;s position unequivocally and clearly, that being, we are opposed to the killing of innocent civilians and the Syrian regime should stop and enter into mediation talks?  The regime should also allow humanitarian agencies into the country, including the Red Cross and the Red Crescent.  Humanitarian agencies are more than willing to help unfortunate civilians in Syria&rsquo;s various cities.</P>
        <P>The situation is yet another example of the international community turning aside.  Two of the major powers have already thwarted the UN&rsquo;s efforts to resolve the situation.  As we speak, a human rights disaster of unprecedented proportions is under way.  No Senator would agree that it should be tolerated by any civilised society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will comment briefly on a subject that has been raised by a number of colleagues, namely, the sale of State assets.  The rewriting of history, which is called revisionism, generally sees a few decades pass before people reflect and perform significant U-turns in print or spoken word.  This morning, I listened to the D&aacute;il Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Martin.  It was the quickest piece of revisionism I have ever heard.  It was a pathetic attempt by a party leader to pretend that the past had not happened.  He pretended that the former Government, of which he was a member for many years, did not commission the McCarthy report on the possible sale of State assets.  He attempted to rewrite the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il in government sold Telecom &Eacute;ireann, TSB and three quarters of Aer Lingus, raided the Central Bank and the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and would have sold its members&rsquo; mothers to keep itself in political power for another day.</P>
        <P>Let us be realistic in the debate on State assets.  The Government announced a proposal yesterday.  Let us have a reasonable and mature debate on it.  State assets are owned by the people, but they are not State antiques and do not need to remain <i>in situ</i> forever.  They must be put to their best use for the people.  I hope that the Opposition will stop rewriting history and join with us in having a constructive debate on how best to protect the taxpayer and return the unemployed to work through the considered and useful disposal of State assets.  What I heard this morning from the so-called Leader of the Opposition in the D&aacute;il was pathetic.  The people are not stupid.  They know what happened last year and two years ago.  They know why and by whom this country was bankrupted.</P>

Of the world&rsquo;s population of 6.7 billion, 20% live in China.  One in every five people on the planet is Chinese.  The weekend&rsquo;s visit was exciting and spine-chilling.  For Ireland, it was as dramatic as the day we joined the EU in 1973.  There are no words adequate to describe the opportunities for boosting trade and employment.

For the past ten to 15 years, during the greatest boom we will probably ever experience, the project could never even get off the ground.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on planning in this country.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with responsibility for planning was in the House last night to deal with a Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  We need to have a mature discussion on planning.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has done enormous damage to its own credibility with this decision.  It already lacked credibility among ordinary members of the public because of earlier decisions which overturned the recommendations of its inspectors.  This country needs an appeals mechanism that enjoys the confidence of the people.  Decisions like the one made today further erode the people&rsquo;s confidence in the appeals process.  I ask the Leader to arrange time for a constructive debate on planning.</P>

	<P>Let us have a balanced debate on this issue.  I disagree with Senator Bradford because I support the statement made by the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Martin.  He clearly outlined the facts on this issue.  Senators should listen to the broadcast.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate with the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Kelly, on taxis and taxi regulation.  We have great expertise in this House with Senator Barrett, who is an expert on transport, and other Senators who are familiar with the situation first-hand.  As I was on my way to Leinster House on Tuesday morning I observed approximately 50 taxis at Heuston Station.

When the Attorney General advises on the need for a referendum, the Government will act on her advice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of Members raised the issue of the sale of State assets.  Senators will be aware that the programme of support contained commitments on State assets.

I hope to arrange for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to address the House on the matter in early course.  The Pathways to Work programme involves a regular and ongoing engagement with unemployed people, greater targeting of activation placements and opportunities, incentivising the take-up of opportunities, incentivising employers to provide more jobs for unemployed people and reforming the institutions to deliver better services.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, or the Minister for Social Protection will explain the programme to the House in the near future.</P><Col N="23"/>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the House for the co-operation I have received on this Bill which is essentially a technical Bill to introduce a new range of reforms with regard to the IMF.  The Second Stage contributions were most informative and helpful.  Now that the Bill has passed this House it will be signed by the President and the Government will now inform the IMF of the decision.  This is significant because as a programme country we have a unique relationship with the IMF and it is important for it to know that this matter has been considered in both Houses of the Oireachtas and has been expedited in a professional way.  Ireland is among one of the first group of countries to pass this important legislation.  This sends a very positive message to the IMF about how this House and the other House does its business and how it regards its relationship with the IMF.  These reforms will make a difference and there will be created a greater sense of participation for all countries in the IMF.  It breaks up the old rules as regards the dominance of the larger countries and sets the IMF on a new path.  When this measure is passed by 85% at the annual meeting later this year, it will allow a reduction of approximately 100 basis points in the interest rate being applied to this country and this will lead over a period of years to a not insignificant saving for this State on the total interest payable.  As we are currently paying 20% of all taxes towards the interest on all these loans, this measure will make a small but helpful difference in the ongoing sustainability of debt.</P>
        <P>I thank Members for their contributions, particularly on Second Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank all sides of the House.  The Bill was dealt with in a speedy and professional manner which is how all legislation and also the Order of Business should be dealt with.  This was not the case this morning.  We have a unique relationship with the IMF at this moment.  Perhaps it is not quite unique as there are three of us in the programme.  The IMF is proving to be the more flexible of the troika, from what I am being told.  This flexibility has been demonstrated with regard to the sale of State assets.  While people refer to the case of Eircom as being a bad news story with regard to the sale of State assets, there is nothing new in the practice.  In 2009, the previous Administration, via the ESB, sold four power stations to Indesa, bringing in &euro;450 million and Indesa invested a further &euro;450 million into the country <Col N="30"/>in that period.  I know this because I am based in Wexford where Great Island power station is in receipt of &euro;300 million of those funds for an upgrade.  The project is due to break ground in May this year.  It is a 30 months project with 500 construction jobs.  Councillor Larry O&rsquo;Brien and the local authority have been ensuring that as many local people as possible can work on the site.  If we do not embrace the new way of doing business, which is to sell non-strategic assets and use the money to create jobs, we will be in greater difficulty now and in the future.  I am informed &euro;1 billion worth of assets must be realised before we can put some funds towards job creation.  In conjunction, County Wexford received its first portion of natural gas from the BGE pipeline which is also a benefit because it means construction jobs and &euro;1 million per kilometre to construct the pipeline into the county.  There is a new order with regard to the IMF and this measure is a part of this evolution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank my colleagues for the professional manner in which the debate on this legislation has been handled.  This is an important technical piece of legislation which will help deliver significant reductions in interest rates and this bears to be repeated.  We must remember we are dealing with the future cost to our children&rsquo;s generation and for the people who have no work.  Over 400,000 people are unemployed and therefore every penny matters.  Achieving this type of a reduction is significant for this and future generations.  The reform of the IMF structures which is under way is also significant.  There is no doubt that the IMF has been subject to significant criticism for its actions during the 1980s and the early 1990s in African countries in particular and in some parts of Asia.  The reforms under way within the IMF recognise the importance of protecting the interests of poorer countries which require the assistance of the IMF on a more frequent basis.  It also recognises the emerging BRIC nations and the new world order, which is also very significant.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the recognition that Ireland will be entitled to use one third of the proceeds from the sale of State assets once we have achieved a certain element of asset sales, as a means of investment in new State ventures.  I refer to the state of this country in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, and the importance of the State investments made in those years in areas such as rural electrification.  There is now an opportunity to put money into emerging areas, for example, water conservation, wind energy and other alternative energy.  We debated the subject of wind energy and the regulation of wind turbines in the House yesterday.  We must be a nation that is capable of seizing opportunity and of reinvesting in ourselves rather than constantly seeking for others to invest in us.  This Bill is an important step on the road.  I congratulate the Minister of State and both Houses of the Oireachtas for the speedy manner in which this Bill has been dealt with.  I hope we give the IMF the impression that we take its participation in and contribution to our economic history very seriously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the speedy passage of this Bill.  I agree wholeheartedly with Senator D&rsquo;Arcy.  I have met the troika on each occasion as a member of my party&rsquo;s finance team.  In my view the IMF is the more accommodating and more flexible part of the troika.  I caution the Minister of State with regard to the sale of our strategic State assets.  There is some confusion in this House and elsewhere that the original memorandum of understanding did not include a figure or a firm commitment with regard to selling State assets.  In my personal view I am not opposed to privatisation.  In many instances &mdash; particularly in regard to former State utility companies &mdash; privatisation leads to rationalisation and significant job losses.  We see significant job losses in the banking sector.  The Government must be cognisant of that and I caution against the spin being put on this, that we will raise &euro;2 billion and that a further &euro;1 <Col N="31"/>billion will be used towards job creation.  The Minister of State does not have to answer this point but I caution him on it.  Will the money be spent through the strategic investment bank?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P Just="Left">I will not ask questions.  This is an important Bill and I am glad it is being passed.  Other contributors specifically mentioned the sale of State assets.  We will debate that topic separately in this House and I look forward to the Minister of State, who has engaged very well in this House, participating in a constructive debate.  I do not want scaremongering on this issue because every State should look at how its utilities and State agencies can be best used.  We will do that on another day.  Time is pressing and I look forward to that debate at an appropriate time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I endorse the comments of Senators Hayden, Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Michael D&rsquo;Arcy.  We had a very good debate the last day.  We see the IMF as part of the post-war architecture that prevented the period since then being a rerun of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.  The IMF is a much-reformed organisation, which helped it to get support from parts of the House it might not traditionally expect.  It takes into account the social and political dimensions of countries it advises and does not go around seeking to devour countries, as per the demonisation of the organisation.  It is brought in by Governments to help.  The advice that one cannot borrow one&rsquo;s way into prosperity is useful and we are in a good position to give this advice.  One must husband the nation&rsquo;s resources efficiently and frugally.</P>
        <P>The IMF is the best of the troika elements in understanding what happened in Ireland and giving advice and assistance.  The IMF has experience of the collapse of banking systems in other countries and we are not first country to get into difficulties with public finances.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Hayden said, it is important that BRIC countries participate more.  We must inquire in other fora whether the 85% rule gives the United States too much power.  I am not running on an anti-American platform but as participation is extended to the emerging countries, perhaps the 85% rule should be examined.  Canada still has solvent banks and it is useful advice for us to get.  These contacts are useful because some of our difficulties were caused by design faults in the euro and the solution to that lies in building up more allies outside the eurozone.  The no exit mechanism is causing so many problems in Greece and one size does not fit all.  What can a country do when it gets massive capital flows such as those that flowed into the Irish banking system from France and Germany in particular?</P>
        <P>The 100 basis points reduction in interest rates is very good news in a country where 20% of tax revenues are paying interest on the national debt.  I echo the comments of Mr. Colm McCarthy on RTE radio this morning that running down the debt is useful and should not be perceived as a waste of money.  If we can reduce the tax burden, industry can flourish here.</P>
        <P>We already have &euro;8 billion in the kitty from the sale of State assets.  I would hate to be in the shoes of the Minister for Finance if he had to come in here and ask for &euro;8 billion in extra tax.  If we sold the telephone company for more than it was worth, I am glad the State was on the winning side of some transactions.  According to Professor Kennelly&rsquo;s account of the Kerry Group, Mark Clinton saw that the dairy disposal company had a much better future as Kerry Group than it would in State ownership.  It is now one of the three biggest companies in the Irish stock exchange and a major company in the international food business.  Greencore is a similar story, as is the Irish Continental Group. The B&amp;I Line was one of the nuisance companies in State ownership but it has become a highly sought-after share.  The ownership of State companies by citizens was fictional because they had no power.  At least those who own a share in a private company can turn up at the AGM and there is some illusion of power.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.  No one believes anymore in the model of the national airline owned by the State.  Olympic Air might be the last one left.  It is a purely commercial activity and we now have the biggest airline in Europe, Ryanair, with over 80 million passengers per year, which is two and a half times the size of British Airways, which has been privatised.  The proposition in the Culleton review of industrial policy is that the State needs a dynamic portfolio of assets so that it can sell them and move to a more advantageous area of the economy without getting trapped.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I regret that we did not privatise the airports because we now have a company that is unsaleable and has debts of &euro;800 million.  Airports in the UK were successfully privatised and broken up by the Office of Fair Trading, which is presided over by the distinguished Irishmen, Mr. John Fingleton.  It is easier to make industries competitive if the State does not own them.  It is hard to own a team in a match and also to be the referee and retain credibility.  We should be more open to programmes like NewERA and the State should not be stuck with a portfolio of assets that it is compelled to hold onto forever.  We should keep it moving.</P>
        <P>I regret the banks joined the portfolio because one of the ways firms got into the State sector in the past was by going broke in the private sector, which is not a good method of portfolio choice.  The State must allow companies to go broke rather than nationalise them.  The advice we get is based on the experience of so many senior Irish executives in the IMF and our record of service in the organisation represents good international links.</P>
        <P>There should be some procedures whereby the IMF can link directly with parliamentarians.  A criticism of some IMF reports is that they reproduce what the Government of the day thinks about the economy.  When that collapsed in 2008, it showed the importance of the IMF reporting to parliamentary committees and seeking a wider range of views.  Many people did not see the crisis coming but it would have been more obvious if international bodies reporting on the Irish economy met a wider range of people rather than just taking the view from the Department of Finance that everything was fine.  That system led to an unpleasant surprise.  The strengthening of parliamentary democracy, which must be part of the lessons from what happened in Ireland in 2008, should involve procedures whereby the OECD and the IMF meet Members.</P>
        <P>I support the legislation proposed and it is a good sign that it enjoys such wide support in the House.  I wish the Minister of State well.  He mentioned a deadline of November, which we have met more than handsomely.</P>

	<P>On the sale of State assets, the previous Government asked Mr McCarthy to produce a suite of options for what it could sell if it chose to do that.  The Leader of the Opposition said at the time the question was about efficiencies rather than sales.  That is technically correct, but this issue was always going to come on the agenda.  </P>
        <P>In circumstances where a state asks a lender of last resort to come into the country to effectively bail it out, the lender will ask it what assets it has.  There is an inevitability about this.  In our discussions with the troika we found its view initially was that if we have assets we should sell them and write off our debt.  That was not a position with which we could agree.  The formula which has now been arrived at is good because sales will be done on a case-by-case basis, we will be able to get up to one third of the total proceeds of the purposes of capital, <Col N="33"/>infrastructure or job creation measures and we will not have fire sales.  It may not be appropriate to sell certain assets at this point in time, given the market.  That is something we have managed to negotiate over a long period of time.  The process will take a while.</P>
        <P>I was also encouraged to hear the Leader of the Opposition say on radio today he will assess this on a case-by-case basis, which is the right way to proceed.  I made the point to Senator Barrett that for many years the amount of dividends we obtained from State companies were negligible.  People were very well paid but the State was getting zero return.  At a time of national peril is it not right that some companies could be used for productive purposes and to write down the debt?</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett is absolutely correct.  The real problem facing our country is the debt pile.  Our current borrowings are putting extraordinary pressure on future generations.  We are borrowing to maintain our lifestyles at a certain level, yet the people who will pay for this in the future are our children.  There is a fundamental question of whether that is sustainable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I studied economics I was always told there are two fundamental problems that emerge, namely if a country goes over a 10% deficit because the markets will not take it seriously, and if the debt to GDP ratio goes over 90%.  We have a debt to GDP ratio of approximately 112% which will maximise next year at 118%.  It is too high and we have to reduce it in the next few years.</P>
        <P>We are in a much better situation than Greece, which we saw over the past 48 hours hopes to achieve a debt to GDP ratio of 120.5% by 2020.  It faces an extraordinary debt problem.  If we have learned anything from the 1980s, when one third of all tax revenues went towards paying interest whereas it is now 20%, it is that we have to reduce the debt for our own sake as a the country.  We will not be seen in a positive light by international investors if we have a massive debt pile which is not being dealt with.  It is something we have to address and the Government is committed to that, not only on the current budget deficit side which will be 3% by 2015 but also to reducing, on a deliberative basis, the debt to GDP ratio over the course of the next few years.</P>
        <P>Parliamentary engagement is crucial in all these matters.  This also arose recently at a eurozone meeting in regard to Greece.  Different observers and people with technical expertise will go into Greece.  Some people see that as a type of occupation but we need to learn from each other and from international best practice.  The day of individual countries being able to say they do not need to take advice from an international organisation are gone.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The world is a very small place and the kind of expertise, knowledge and lessons we can learn from the IMF and others will work to our mutual advantage.  In that context, this Bill will play a small part.  It is important for us, as a small country with a relationship with the troika, that the Bill has been passed by both Houses and is now a matter for the President to determine.  It means we are part of the first phase of countries, well in advance of the November or December meeting this year, and have taken our job seriously.  I thank colleagues for their observations.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Question put and agreed to.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="34"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand once the matter is agreed we can then have a debate, as the Leader said on the Order of Business.  The debate can commence without a Minister present as it is on a report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP.  I welcome the opportunity for the debate.  It is the first time a debate has been held on a motion passed unanimously by the CPP.  It is quite unprecedented in the House, as the Leader tells me.  It shows that we want to be open to debate.  It was specifically requested by a Member who said he could not be here today.  It is an historic occasion as we have not had a debate on the procedure at the commencement of proceedings in the House since November 1923.  Even then there was a brief debate on the introduction of a prayer where formerly there had not been one. I will refer to the history in my contribution.</P>
        
        <P>The Standing Order report, now that it has been passed, will add a new additional phrase into Standing Order 18 which currently provides for the prayer at commencements of sittings.  It will provide that instead of simply having the prayer read, as it currently is, all Senators present shall stand for 30 seconds of silent reflection and then the prayer shall be read.  It is adding a very short period of silent reflection to the period we currently have set aside for a specifically Christian prayer.  I am speaking in favour of the report, which has been adopted unanimously by the CPP and the House.  It is not what I would have wanted.</P>
        <P>At the CPP last July I initiated a discussion on the prayer and the way in which we commence business.  In my original submission to the committee I said I did not believe it was appropriate for a Christian prayer to be used to commence each sitting of the Seanad.  I recommended that we replace the prayer with a short period of silent reflection, as is done in Dublin City Council, the Stormont Assembly, the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament.</P>
        <P>I made the point to colleagues at the committee that although there has traditionally been a prayer at the commencement of the House of Commons and House of Lords, it is largely a factor of tradition and the particular status of the established church in that jurisdiction, the Church of England.  I do not believe it is appropriate for us to follow that tradition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, when the Seanad was first instituted there was no prayer.  It was a more recent development in November 1923 at the insistence of the Earl of Wicklow who was then a Senator.  My preferred option was and remains that the Christian prayer be replaced with a short period of silent reflection to enable greater inclusivity of all Members of different faiths and those who, like me,  would not have faith.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having canvassed this view at the CPP, we discussed it further.  Senator Mullen provided some observations.  One of his suggestions was that instead of replacing the prayer with period of silent reflection we would have a period of silent reflection in addition to the prayer at the beginning of each day&rsquo;s business.  I took some time to consider the proposal.  We discussed it at the committee last week and I fully supported it as a very fair compromise that accommodates those of non-Christian or no faith, while retaining the existing prayer.</P>
        <P>It is not my preferred option.  I will still seek to persuade others to replace the prayer altogether.  I look forward to hearing the views of others.  Somewhat surprisingly, I find myself being accused of selling out by those who would like to see the prayer abolished.  I am quite pleased, in a debate on religion, to find myself on the moderate middle ground.  I see this change very much as a first step towards greater inclusivity.  I will certainly continue to argue for an outright change but I am very happy that the compromise is fair.</P>
        <P>The initiative I have taken has allowed us to debate the prayer for the first time since 1923.  That, in itself, is interesting and marks some sort of progress.  It has also led to a change in the prayer for the first time since 1923 and to recognition of members of a variety of faiths.  It is a practical achievement and a step forward.  It is a little like having an affirmation alongside a religious oath, as is provided for jurors and which we should provide for those taking up other <Col N="35"/>offices, such as the office of the Presidency.  President Michael D. Higgins, at his inauguration, introduced in an initiative whereby a humanist celebrant took part in the proceedings alongside officiators of organised religions.  This is inclusive.</P>
        <P>Let me refer to the history of the prayer.  It is instructive to examine historical debates.  In January 1923, the issue of a prayer in the Seanad was first broached by the Earl of Wicklow, who stated he would like to see a prayer commence proceedings.  The then Cathaoirleach felt the most simple and dignified solution would be to have a moment&rsquo;s silence in which each Member could make what prayer he thought fit according to his own belief.  The Cathaoirleach said it would otherwise be delicate and difficult to frame any sort of procedure that would receive universal acceptance.  The Earl of Wicklow did not give up, however, and on 14 November 1923 he managed to have the relevant committee submit a prayer to the Seanad, which was agreed.  The only debate was on whether it should be in both Irish and English or in Irish alone.  Colleagues may be interested to know that Senator W. B. Yeats stated he would like the prayer to be read in Irish as soon as the majority of the Members know Irish.  This might have taken some time.</P>
        <P>It is also instructive to note that the Earl of Wicklow stated the words for the prayer were mainly suggested to him by a lay person but that he took them to the archbishops of Dublin, both Catholic and Protestant, who approved the wording.  That is how the prayer came about.  The wording changed subsequently and the prayer that was adopted in July 1932 by the D&aacute;il is the one we use today in the Seanad.  In November 1923, when the Seanad adopted the Earl of Wicklow&rsquo;s phrasing, the D&aacute;il had not by then adopted a prayer.  It was being recommended at the time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The prayer is not with us since the beginning of the Seanad.  I am very grateful to Atheist Ireland for pointing that out to me.  In checking the record, I was interested to see that the issue of the prayer has been raised on a number of occasions by former colleagues, including Mr. Proinsias De Rossa, who spoke about a petty instance of discrimination.  He objected to the prayer being specifically Christian, not to the fact that there was a prayer.  He believed it was not in line with the thinking of a pluralist society.  He outlined these beliefs in 1999.  My colleague and friend, Senator Norris, has raised this matter on a number of occasions since, as have I.  This is the first time we have had a debate on the prayer and the first time we are seeing a change to the proceedings to allow them to be more pluralist and inclusive.  Therefore, I strongly welcome the introduction of what I believe to be a small and modest change which will, nonetheless, represent an important step forward in recognising the plurality of religious belief and non-religious belief in Ireland.  I hope colleagues will embrace the change and that we will see people taking part in a dignified and respectable way in the 30 seconds of silence we will now have.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unlikely we will ever have 30 minutes of silence.  To incorporate 30 seconds of silence as part of the ritualistic commencement of proceedings is an important step forward in creating more tolerant and inclusive society.  I will continue to try to persuade the House to move towards the method used in Stormont, Dublin City Council and other assemblies, where there is simply a silent period of reflection.  This is the most inclusive method.  What is proposed, however, is a very useful and valuable compromise.  Its adoption by the Seanad provides not only a starting point for greater inclusivity in our parliamentary procedures, but also marks an initiative this House has taken that was not taken in the other House, although there have been moves towards change there.  It shows we are capable of changing methods not only by having this debate, but also by making the change to procedures.</P><Col N="36"/>
        <P>I very much welcome the report from the CPP and urge colleagues to embrace it and share their views thereon.  We very much welcome their views.  I urge them to take part in the 30 seconds of silence in a respectful and dignified way in recognition of the very many varieties of beliefs in this Chamber.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of my party, I support the amendment to Standing Orders to allow for a period of 30 seconds of reflection.  It is an acceptable compromise.  It is fair to say this is not a burning issue around the country.  I received fewer than a dozen e-mails this morning on it.  One or two were very insulting but most were very balanced.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>In what way were they insulting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>By referring to religion as a fantasy.  This is very unfortunate.  One hears this view expressed by some of the organisations involved in this area from time to time.  It is very important that we have respect for faith and individual faiths.  I support the principle of non-denominational Christian prayer at the commencement of proceedings and support the change to introduce the period of reflection.</P>
        <P>Prayer is common at the commencement of proceedings in various parliaments and assemblies around the world, be they in the United Kingdom, Australia or the United States.  Politicians must tread warily in the area of faith and religion.  I will never forget the words of Antonio in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, who tells Bassanio the devil can cite scripture for his own purposes.  Those with religious beliefs must not use those beliefs for their personal political purposes.  This is a very important principle that I try to uphold as best I can, although I acknowledge one&rsquo;s faith can inform one in one&rsquo;s approach to issues.  It should do so because the values of religious faith are very relevant to the values of today.  I refer to the fundamental Christian message of helping the poor.</P>
        <P>I support the change being introduced today.  We should change to reflect all faiths.  Perhaps we could make a further change, such as that implemented in the US House of Representatives.  Perhaps we could invite people from various religious faiths and the Humanist Association of Ireland to come to the House at the commencement of proceedings to deliver the prayer or allow for 30 seconds of reflection, perhaps to coincide with particular feast-days of particular religions, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jewish.  I also include people of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; faith.  They are very good people and there are a number of them in the country.  I also include humanists and others.  After allowing members of these groups to say the prayer, for however long it takes, we could then proceed with our business.  I do not see how this would interfere with us too much.</P>
        <P>We support the change.  Let us move on to more important issues.  I bet the media will be highlighting this issue and stating the Seanad is doing nothing else but raising it.  I assure the people that every Member has been raising very important issues in the Seanad today.</P>

	<P>When I was a child, I remember 30 seconds of silence was brought to us on television by Guinness.  We are now introducing 30 seconds of silence to the mornings&rsquo; proceedings.  Senator Bacik outlined the background to the proposal before us, which involves a compromise.  The Senator proposed to the CPP that the prayer be removed or abolished.  Had the proposal come to a vote, it would have been defeated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I suspect Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s prediction of the result of such a vote is correct.  We had a mature discussion.  Senator Mullen proposed a compromise and it was accepted by all.  It strikes a balance.  Let us call a spade a spade and say it is only a small minority that has had difficulty with the formal recognition of religion.  As the most recent census clearly shows, the vast majority of people, who do not consider themselves to be living on a higher ground than the next person or to be holy Joes or Josephines, and who do not describe themselves as saints on earth, described themselves as members of the Christian community.  We also have to recognise that group of people.  We have a duty to listen, respond and ensure that minority voices are respected.  However, we must also listen to the majority voice on occasions.  The vast majority of people in this country, who proclaim themselves in some shape or form to be of Christian belief or to hold other religious views, are relatively comfortable with the idea of parliamentarians invoking God in some small way before they set out on their day's work.</P>
        
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Byrne&rsquo;s proposal was interesting and it is something we could consider.  In the coming months in the United States, party conventions will be held to select candidates to contest the presidential election.  President Obama will be automatically selected.  Each evening, at the commencement of the Democratic and Republican conventions, there is a four or five-minute call to prayer.  In this country we sometimes believe we are so modern that we are setting all the boundaries, but in America religion plays a much greater role in politics than it does here.  We have to recognise that we are probably striking a fair and reasonable balance.  I have no difficulty with the prayer as it was, nor do I have a difficulty with this proposal.  I hope people will be in the Seanad 30 seconds earlier and will reflect.  Those who wish to pray will do so, while others need not pray as there is no such obligation on them.  We do need to be respectful, however.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the week we discussed gender quotas in politics and I said that &ldquo;respect&rdquo; is a key word, as it is in this debate.  The significant majority must respect the minority viewpoint and <i>vice versa</i>.  The only figures we can go on are those in the census which show that the vast majority of people in this country see themselves to be of a Christian ethos.  Those people deserve respect also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinMcAleese"><NameTxt>Senator Martin McAleese</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I record my support for this proposal to amend Standing Order 18, as recommended by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  As we have heard, it entails 30 seconds of silent reflection prior to the recitation of the Christian prayer at the commencement of Seanad sittings.  We know of one person &mdash; I suspect there are more &mdash; who would prefer to dispense with the Christian prayer completely on the basis that it fails to accord equality, tolerance, respect and recognition to all beliefs.  However strongly felt those feelings may be, this would have been a mistake.  Equality, tolerance and respect do not requires us to abandon any aspects of our identity or traditions, or even to wash out those things which make us distinct.  In fact, it was that kind of either-or thinking which made it so difficult, if not impossible, to find peace on this island for so long.  It was only when all traditions were guaranteed respect and felt respected that peace took root and slowly began to grow.</P>
        <P>Looking at what happens in other parliaments, we can find examples to argue both for and against opening prayers.  Therefore, we cannot really look outside own experience and judgment for guidance.  We have a Christian tradition on this island that stretches back almost 1,600 years.  It is part of what has defined us and it is stitched into our very language with every greeting in the Irish language, and often too in English, still referencing this Christian heritage.  Similarly, placenames throughout Ireland abound with references to saints, as well as to <Col N="38"/>churches and other Christian landmarks.  At home and abroad the Christian faith has sustained many generations through life&rsquo;s capricious ups and downs.</P>
        <P>I want to make it absolutely clear, however, that my reference to our Christian tradition embraces all the Christian denominations which have created and enriched our heritage, and not simply the majority tradition.  We should always be proud and should certainly not be ashamed or afraid to express that rich Christian tradition in any place and particularly here in the national Parliament.  However, in a spirit of respect and equality, I fully support the addition of 30 seconds of silent reflection prior to the prayer.  While reflecting our tradition, this allows us to make space for those who are not Christians, but of other faiths or indeed of no faith.  What is being proposed allows us to advance the inclusivity of this Chamber.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Byrne that we could go further and indeed I think we should.  We could become leaders in tolerance by, for example, as Senator Byrne suggested, exploring with generosity ways of incorporating prayers from other faith traditions from time to time, perhaps on occasions of special moment to those traditions.  The prayer said here to date was never designed to offend but rather to conscientiously dedicate our best efforts each day to the service of the people.  Today&rsquo;s proposal will enhance this Chamber simply by having more of that dedication.  It offers the prospect both of respecting tradition and creating a new tradition alongside in order that in the end this House is truly a place where all are respected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Should the Cathaoirleach not be responsible for reading the prayer, as is the case in the other House where the Ceann Comhairle does so?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for the sensitive way in which it has dealt with this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I also welcome the compromise that has been reached.  I heard with great interest what other speakers have had to say.  I was listening to Senator Byrne quoting from <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> and was reminded of the agreement that Senator Bacik and myself had arrived at.  I was wondering how we might shape another quote from a Shakespeare play.  To misquote <i>Hamlet</i>, perhaps we have become &ldquo;a little more than kind, yet still less than kin&rdquo; in our views on this issue.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have had the privilege of introducing Archbishop John Barwa from the province of Orissa in India.  He spoke in generous and interesting terms this morning about the challenges his people are facing, where Christians are being persecuted by extremist Hindus in that part of India.  He was not asking us to do anything but was coming here to tell us about their Christian hope and love, even for those who persecute them as they try to build a better world there.  Thankfully, we are not in that position.  It is a long time since people in Ireland had to suffer like that for their faith.  We should also hope that we never go to the other extreme either which is that, in seeking to include all traditions and be generous to all the different groups in our society, we lose the ability even to declare our identity.  That is essentially what is at stake in this particular debate.  I note and support everything Senator McAleese said.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Byrne is right to hope that the media will not focus exclusively on this matter.  If I were to strike one note of disagreement, however, it would be to invite the media and colleagues to consider that we should never be afraid or ashamed about having a debate on the deeper values that animate us individually or collectively.  We have had many important debates in Ireland over the past ten or 15 years and we made a lot of mistakes.  Perhaps one of the <Col N="39"/>reasons we made those mistakes was because we failed to reflect on the higher spiritual and moral values.  Had they been followed more closely, they could have led to less selfish acts in banks and the marketplace.  Scripture says that &ldquo;Without a vision, the people perish&rdquo;, so we should always be willing to get back to the reflective space and never be ashamed of it.  There will be plenty of time for the important bread and butter discussions as well.</P>
        <P>If there was ever a time when Christianity was compulsory in Ireland it has certainly gone now, and thank goodness for that.   If there was ever a time when Christianity was the fashion and many adhered to it for that purpose, then arguably that moment has also passed.  As people, however, we still find ourselves searching for the truth about life and its meaning.  We all need to be able to bring our deepest understanding of reality to important everyday business.  That means that if we are people with a distinctive religious perspective, we need to be able to let that inspire what we propose as the common good, just as others with different philosophical perspectives need the freedom and respect to be able to articulate their views.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bacik proposed that since the Constitution recognised the separation of church and State, this somehow meant that we should not have a specifically religious prayer.  I agree about the importance of separation between church and State, but we must always remember that it is for the protection of both from undue influence by the other.  The Constitution affirms the most Holy Trinity and our divine Lord Jesus Christ. It would be a misunderstanding of church and state separation to say that it is contravened by all public acknowledge of God, for example, the American Declaration of Independence clearly mentions God, the creator.  The separation of church and state means that the state should not interfere with religious freedom and teaching and the church should not interfere with state powers, such as the legislative or judicial processes.  It does not mean that the state cannot require church clergy to pay taxes, and by the same token, it does not prevent the state from enshrining an acknowledgement of God within its constitution or a prayer within its democratic processes.  Like the prayer at the beginning of the proceedings at the House of Lords and the House of Commons, our prayer is a factor of tradition, specifically the Christian tradition to which a clear majority of Irish people still adhere.  It should be noted that there is nothing exclusive to the Catholic tradition in the language of the prayer we use in these Houses.  I agree with the comments on whether the Cathaoirleach should read it.  I have on occasion taken up the prayer and shown it to guests who are visiting the Houses.  There is a little instruction, in pencil, in spidery writing, saying, &ldquo;Read Slowly&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>A Senator said to me that it would be nice if the prayer was read with a greater degree of solemnity.  I wonder if there is a psychological embarrassment about the prayer, in a sense that we need to compromise with those of no belief and other traditions, which means that if we have to say it, we will say it quickly.  We need to invite ourselves to return to a solemn and reflective place.  This compromise allows it because we will already be called into a reflective space, whether we have a faith tradition or none and the prayer of the majority can be said, hopefully in a reflective way.  It is true that no prayer is said at the commencement of proceedings in other jurisdictions.  There is a time for reflection in the Scottish Parliament as Senator Bacik has pointed out.  As I said, the United States, Canada, the UK and Australia, all provide for the saying of prayers before parliamentary proceedings commence.</P>
        <P>There is one important point that Senator Bacik&rsquo;s proposal highlighted, namely, a democratic state should always ensure that freedom of conscience and freedom of religion are protected.  We do not want the prayer to impinge upon the freedom of conscience of Oireachtas Members who are atheist, agnostic or non-Christian.  There would be a problem, if a Member were required to take an oath and that is the reason there is a possibility of an affirmation in court proceedings.</P>

	<P>Some in this Chamber will be getting very worried.  I think the fact that Oireachtas Members are not required to say the prayer or be present when it is said clinches the issue.  That is the reason I supported a more inclusive and equal acknowledgement of both religious tradition and freedom of conscience and we have managed to do that.</P>
        <P>It was Senator McAleese who reminded me that so many things associated with Christianity are stitched into our tradition.  It was the late great V&aacute;clav Havel, former President of the Czech Republic and the great dissident, who pointed out at the time of the debate on the inclusion of God in the European Constitution, that it simply made no sense to try to write Christianity out of the equation when every great city had a cathedral that was built to the glory of God.  It will take another day to discuss the historical errors of religion and religious leadership, but we should always acknowledge that among the philosophies that have inspired people to greatness down through the centuries, those who have been inspired by a loving God and what that means in terms of how we should treat others, have contributed significantly to the development of our cultures and our civilisation.  It is the fact that a large number of people still adhere to the faith that is being reflected in the fact that we continue with a Christian element at the beginning of the proceedings of the House each day.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am proud of the fact every day that I am a citizen, not a subject, of a republic, which increasingly is becoming a more inclusive, understanding and tolerant place to live.  There are many things that need to be improved and there are many things we will try to improve in Parliament and outside it.  What is important to me is that I am a citizen and proud of it and we share the Republic with other citizens.  We are all shaped by what we believe, whatever that belief system is.  In a more equal and tolerant republic, this new way of starting our day in the Chamber reflects the change and growth that is happening in our republic.  We have reached an understanding that we can be more tolerant and that we can live side by side and respect, understand and appreciate them.  In respecting our tradition of saying a prayer and allowing a time for reflection, to encompass all the other beliefs, systems and value, it creates a perfect reflection of what we are trying to do in the Republic.  I am delighted to support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I recall what the very well known rosary priest, Fr. Peyton, used to say, that the family who prays together stays together.  I wonder if there is a message we can send to the Taoiseach, that the Seanad that reflects together may stay together after the next referendum.  I compliment those responsible for what we are now discussing.  It lifts my spirits that common sense and self-respect have coalesced in this resolution.  While it may not be an issue that will get wide media coverage, I firmly believe there is something in what is being achieved that can be transposed into many other aspects of life outside.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to get away from tags, because sometimes the word &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; is used but it has so many different meanings.  When it comes to individual faith, there is no doubt that tolerance <Col N="41"/>has to be part of it.  I believe that faith is very private, whereas in other parts of the world we see that religion and politics are very closely connected.  We see some terrible things being done and we are never sure if it is done in the name of politics or in the name of religion.</P>
        <P>I have always found a sense of compassion in Ireland.  In all aspects of life we must start with compassion and understanding.  We must endeavour to see how we can expand on that understanding because the Ireland of today is not the Ireland of 50 years ago, it is changing.  People are trying to come to grips with that change.  I am reminded of the debate about the Angelus bells on the radio.  There were several moves to remove the Angelus.  The person who played the most significant role in ensuring the Angelus would not be removed was the Church of Ireland archbishop.  In his contribution to the debate at the time, he used the same word that is being used in the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on Standing Order 18.  He asked what was wrong with stopping twice a day to reflect for a minute or two.  That put an end to the debate about removing the Angelus.  I admired him ever since, and I have mentioned him in the House on several occasions.  It might have been an intervention of only ten sentences, but the rest of the debate was lost when something as simple as that from that source was brought into play.  We are doing exactly the same in this House.  We are endeavouring not to score points, not to be sensationalist and not to create negative headlines.  If we were being asked to remove that prayer which is so much tied to tradition one can imagine the message that would be going from this House &mdash; a message that would not remain in Ireland but would go from our shores.  It would be another argument against the retention of the Seanad.  It was an issue that could have been handled with reason and compassion and through dialogue with each other, whatever our beliefs, and by doing it in that way we have not allowed the opportunity to reflect badly on the Seanad.  I compliment those whose idea it was and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because this is a way forward on other issues also.</P>
        <P>I used to be very sad when I heard that a certain hospital was not allowed have a crib at Christmas.  When we visit patients in hospital and they are at their most vulnerable the very symbolism is taken away from them at that particular time. We have heard of a statue which has been in a particular public institution and the big debate that took place about removing it.  In future when these debates arise, let us come back to what we have done and show that we can respect all traditions but, above all else, we should not be pushed into a position where our own tradition is viewed in some way as negative.  We must keep that tradition positive into the future.  To all involved in the Seanad I say, well done, and please God it will benefit everyone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Leader for allowing time for the House to participate in debate on this critical issue of the most appropriate and acceptable way to begin our work together each day as we sit as Senators.  I see this as yet another way in which the Leader and members of the 24th Seanad are committed to ensuring reform of the practices in order that we are more effective, relevant, representative and inclusive.  Perhaps our colleagues in the Lower House ought to take note.  I shall, however, be a lone voice, with the greatest of respect to all the colleagues who have spoken and yet to speak.  I agree with much of what virtually everybody has said, especially Senator Bacik, and some of what Senator Mullen has said.  I wonder about the lone voice, I guess I am just so very different, therefore, I will be true to my difference.</P><Col N="42"/>
        
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bacik has already offered the House something of an historical analysis on the practice of saying a Christian prayer.  My view is that it reflects a time in history where there was not a clear separation of church and state and that the prayer is a manifestation of the interweaving of Roman Catholicism with the politics of a new republic.  In my view, this reflects an historical period where the people were not as conscious of the importance of separating religion from the business of politics in a republic.  This was an error that has now gone by.  We have heard some of that in the contributions.  This was an exclusionist adherence to one world religion and no longer reflects our history, nor does it reflect the contemporary thinking of theologians and theorists of religion and the ways in which religion and meaning-making are studied and practised today.  There exists a growing pluralism of the membership in the five great world religions within Ireland today and a growing number of people who lead ethical and spiritual leaves, outside the context of any world religion.</P>
        
        <P>The last census of population demonstrates that 186,000 people ticked the &ldquo;no religion&rdquo; box, up 34% from 2002 and several thousand others opted not to answer the religion question.  There also exists a growing number of people who hold an attentiveness to the &ldquo;beyond in our midst&rdquo; &mdash; those are words taken from the great thinker Paul Tilley and I count myself within this number &mdash; as well as those who attempt to lead ethical lives through reflection on the meaning of the best ways to be human and to practice the good, both the personal good and the good of the common.  Consequently, it makes good sense to reform the practice by moving away from the practice of what is a bygone era to choosing a practice that respects the pluralism of belief of members and between and among the people we represent.  I am in favour, therefore, of a moment of silence at the beginning of our work where we can each draw on the inspiration, meaning and ethical values of that which we believe, and as Senator Mullen said, of the reflective space.</P>
        <P>I see no good reason to maintain a prayer from one world religion even if it is combined with a moment of silence.  Such a combination would form a practice that does not adequately represent the diversity of Irish people because it still emphasises an element of the predominance of one religion&rsquo;s value at the expense of other ways of making meaning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I conclude with a cautionary note &mdash; any argument that the belief of the majority dictates practice in the House is not wise counsel and, I submit, will not build a society of inclusivity and equality.  Therefore, I am not in favour of the amendment.  Most members are calling it a compromise &mdash; I appreciate and respect that &mdash; but I do not agree.  I view it as maintaining an exclusivist practice and it is not a practice towards inclusivity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>What we are debating reflects the evolution of Irish society.  We have moved away from dreadful events such as the penal laws and insulting 12 July marches and so on.  We have emerged from that sectarianism and we are tolerant in our religious beliefs.  On reflection, people engaged in prayer are not a threat to anybody else.  The prayer encompasses some very beautiful language.  As a new member I welcome it when we come here and pray every day and it is not incompatible with the period of silence recommended by Senator Bacik.  That is part of a life, leaving aside dreadful events, the abuse of children and abusive and sectarian marches on 12 July, but we must reflect on many of the worthwhile things that happen.  I come from a college where a Latin grace is said twice daily, where the college chapel is at the centre of much of what we do and provides much of our inspiration, where we pray on Trinity Monday that we will neglect no part of our manifold inheritance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator pray for Queen Elizabeth?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I do and for her successors.  I thought her visit to Ireland was extremely important in the development of this country.</P>

	<P>I meant Queen Elizabeth I.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The founding by her ancestor at Trinity College Dublin was a major contribution to education not only in this country but worldwide and I am proud to represent it.  I share that with Senator Norris.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the mixture of religion and politics has been toxic in Ireland.  I recall when a former member, Dr. Maurice Hayes, was conferred with a honorary degree in Trinity College on 12 July.  At the dinner afterwards he thanked the provost, fellows and scholars for allowing him to wear regalia to march in a procession on 12 July and he was glad the procession did not cause offence and did not have to be rerouted.  Therefore, one can redefine traditions in a more inclusive manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recently, I prayed with Senator Zappone when she preached in college chapel.  One can practise as successfully as she does, religion and her membership of the House.  I see nothing sinister about people at prayer and do not think people at prayer are a threat.  One might say to those who sent the e-mails to Senator Byrne that if those of a religious belief are correct, they are harmless when at prayer.  If they are wrong they will not do atheists any harm because nothing will result.  However, I worry that as we set aside some forms of bitterness and sectarianism an intolerance is developing in society among those who sent Senator Byrne and others the e-mails.  I recall Senator Norris saying on one occasion, and Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to an intervention by the archbishop of Dublin, that if one does not like the Angelus just leave the room, make a cup of tea and it will be all over when one gets back.  There must be tolerance on both sides.</P>
        <P>There is an intolerance in some of the e-mails that have been circulated on this issue.  In an attempt to appear modern and so on, we might have the rather strange result that, while we might succeed in banning the Angelus twice a day on RTE, people may turn over to the morning service on BBC which operates for a full 15 minutes.  It would be ironic that a country which thought of itself as religious when the United Kingdom had ceased to be had to rely on the United Kingdom to supply it with its religious broadcasting.  It requires a balance on the other side to see that people engaged in religious practice are not a threat to others.  We believe in that inclusiveness that requires a compromise which is in the motion and which I support.</P>

	<P>Just as the Ceann Comhairle reads the prayer in the other House, I have always thought the Cathaoirleach, or the Leas-Chathaoirleach in his absence, should read it here.  That would be more in accord with parliamentary practice in the US Congress, the Houses of Commons and the House of Lords in which the bishops sit.</P>
        <P>I found myself in agreement with many of the sincerely held points made so far.  It was lovely to hear the history of prayer given by Senator Bacik.  I congratulate all Members on how we are going forward in a very respectful and tolerant manner.  We are being inclusive and acknowledge our differences, in so far as we have any.  There are some with regard to beliefs perhaps but I do not believe we are going to get hung up on them.

        <P>I also welcome the inclusivity, tolerance and democracy of taking all viewpoints on board in the Seanad.  That is the way we should and need to go.  However, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact the CPP itself is not inclusive.  The three Sinn F&eacute;in Senators are not represented on it and were not consulted on this decision on Standing Orders.  While we support this decision, we would like our favour not to be taken for granted at any stage.  We recommend we are given representation on the CPP at some stage.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Leader on the decisiveness he showed in taking up this issue.  I hope he will be as decisive in some of the other calls we have had for important debates.  For example, I have called for a debate on Galway transport but the Leader does not see it as a national issue or indeed one for the Seanad.  I believe it does and is equally important as this debate.</P>
        <P>We have called for debates on other issues such as regional development which we have not had yet.  I hope they can be dealt with the same urgency, reverence and importance as this debate has been.  In the call for inclusivity, tolerance, democracy and of listening to all opinions, I hope the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister of the Assembly in Northern Ireland will be invited to attend the Seanad as soon as possible for an equally important debate.  A Thursday afternoon might be a good time as it appears the best time to get Members into the Chamber for these types of debate.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the allocation of five minutes to speak on this topic.  Yesterday, I was given two minutes to speak on media standards when I would have liked to have had three more minutes to debate.</P>

        <P>I would also have liked to have had five minutes speaking time during the debate on natural resources.  During an important debate on foreign affairs, we were only allowed to ask a question and not make a statement.  The CPP might take these thoughts on board when examining the nature of debates here to ensure they are inclusive, tolerant and democratic and to give more time to ensure a real debate.</P>
        <P>I also want to welcome the presence of the media.  I know there is no one in the Press Gallery but I am sure people in the media are listening online now or will read the Official Report.  I do not agree with the claims this debate will not get much notice in the media.  It probably will get much more notice than many of the other important debates that have gone on here which is disappointing.  I welcome anything the media have to say about this debate.</P>
        <P>Again, coming back to the point about inclusivity, tolerance and democracy and the CPP taking all thoughts on board, maybe we should consider removing the Whip in the Seanad.</P>

First, they ran it past the Anglican archbishop and then as they could not find the Roman Catholic one, they ran it past the administrator of the Pro-Cathedral.  They more or less got the okay, but there was also a proposal to introduce a chaplain.  Frankly, that is daft.</P>
        <P>The one thing that the Earl of Wicklow said that was sensible is that surely there has seldom been a parliament in the history of the world that finds itself more in need of divine guidance than ours.  There may not have been then but there is now and it is this one.  I object strongly to the prayer.  Others have talked about respect for the conscience of atheists, agnostics, Muslims, Jews, Hindus and others.  I am a believer and it is because of my belief that I object.  I find it insulting to my belief that every day we go through a rigmarole, which I regard as a piece of humbug, because the prayer says:</P>
        <P LI="1">Direct, we beseech thee, O Lord, our actions by thy holy inspirations and carry them on by thy gracious assistance; that every word and work of ours may always begin from thee and by thee be happily ended; through Christ our Lord.  Amen.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Do we seriously want to lump the responsibility for some of the nonsense that goes on in this House on God?  Was it not enough that they crucified Jesus Christ without sticking him with the responsibility for this?  I really do not agree with it at all.</P>
        <P>Senator Yeats took up a similar position with regard to the Irish language.  He said it was all histrionics, because they wanted it in Irish as well.  That was all playing to the gallery.  It was nonsense.  He exposed it by saying it was histrionics and saying that he was going to move an amendment that they should not do it until a majority of Members of the Seanad could speak Irish.  Approximately two of them could at that stage.  That was more grandstanding.</P>
        <P>I respect the cultural traditions.  I was one of those who spoke out in favour of the Angelus.  I do not agree with tearing away our cultural heritage, but I was alarmed to hear that we should almost be grateful that we were not required to say the prayer.  What kind of country would we be in if we were required to say the prayer?  I object strongly to the Constitution.  I am a believer; I go to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral every Sunday.  In my family I have people who suffered during the penal laws, including a Roman Catholic bishop who founded an order of nuns and an order of monks.  The Constitution begins:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the name of the most holy trinity, from whom is all authority and to whom, as our final end, all actions both of men and states must be referred,</P><Col N="48"/>
        <P LI="1">we the people of &Eacute;ire, humbly acknowledging all our obligations to our divine Lord, Jesus Christ . . .</P>
        <P FLI="0">Do they?  This is a legally enforceable instrument, as I found in a case before the High Court where a Protestant judge, the late Herbie McWilliam, found that although all the evidence I had introduced was accurate and correct, nevertheless, he had to find against me because of what he called the Christian and democratic nature of the State, referring to the Constitution.  It is effective in law when it suits them to persecute minorities but not when it comes to foreign policy.  If people are serious about the Constitution, they should act on it.</P>
        <P>Let us have an ethical foreign policy.  I have always spoken on behalf of an ethical foreign policy.  I was the only person to vote against a beef deal with Iraq and sucking up to Saddam Hussein.  I was told from the then Government benches that what I was suggesting might be the morally correct thing to do but I was asked whether we could afford it.  We now see exactly the same thing with regard to the Chinese.  We were afraid to mention Tibet, or as Senator Zappone said, to list the political prisoners.  We sucked up to the Americans when they had rendition flights through Shannon Airport.  How Christian is that?</P>
        <P>On the document that Senator Mullen produced, I do not always agree with Pope Benedict, but I was moved by what he said about the power of weakness and the power of love.  I genuinely dislike this prayer because I do not believe that it is altogether sincere.  I am on a number of boards where they say prayers and as a Christian I am disgusted by the fact that they recite those prayers and then they set into each other and hack lumps out of each other.  Let us be consistent.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief.  I support the change to Standing Order 18.  The amendment should not be regarded as a compromise, but as evidence that Senators are a tolerant and inclusive group of parliamentarians.  Senator Bacik referred to the background to the prayer and its introduction in the House in the 1930s when a compromise on the prayer&rsquo;s wording was reached.  Some traditions are worth retaining and it is appropriate that we retain the prayer at the start of our business and start the day with a period of reflection.  I take Senator Norris&rsquo;s point on board, in that it sometimes appears hypocritical to say a prayer before taking lumps out of one another on the Order of Business or during proceedings, but we should <Col N="49"/>reflect on whether we should be much more Christian or tolerant towards one another.  We should be more inclusive in how we deal with particular issues.</P>
        <P>I have received a number of e-mails from people who believe it is not appropriate in this day and age to start our proceedings with a prayer, but a 30-second period of reflection allows non-Christians an opportunity to think about their version of religion or non-religion, as the case may be.  It allows us to reflect on how we can do better, be more tolerant of one another and make decisions in the best interests of the people we represent as well as others.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Archbishop, who is in the audience.  I was moved to hear him speak in such a tolerant, Christian and forgiving manner about people who carried out terrible atrocities against his people.  I almost asked whether he was for real.  Had any of us been subjected to such injustice and discrimination, would we have been as tolerant or as forgiving as him?</P>
        <P>I support the prayer and period of reflection.  As Senator Bradford mentioned, the recent census showed that a large majority of people indicated that they were from a Christian tradition.  The prayer reflects this fact and the 30 seconds of reflection afford people who do not subscribe to the Christian tradition time to pay respect or homage to their own beliefs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the confusion created when I put the question while in the Chair.  Like a pause for prayer, a few seconds passed before anyone indicated a desire to speak.  I never envisaged that 12 or 13 Senators wanted to contribute on this issue, but that is their entitlement.  I ask the Acting Chairman to use his discretion to put the question again.  It would be the fairest way to proceed.  I respect people&rsquo;s right to ask for a vote on this issue, but we should be careful about what it is we are voting on.  Were we to vote against the 30 seconds of silence, we would also be abolishing the prayer.  Sin sc&eacute;al eile.</P>
        <P>I support the decision of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I was not one of its members who were in favour of abolishing the prayer.  It is important that we have a prayer.  I am often present for the Order of Business and, like most Senators, I stand and reflect on the words uttered.  I will respect the additional 30 seconds of silence.  It is a good idea.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I ask the House to reflect on a comment by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney.  During the recent boating tragedy in Glandore Harbour, five lives were lost.  Thankfully, all of the bodies were recovered.  I asked people to pray for their recovery, etc.  I visited the scene twice throughout.  Every evening on the pier as night fell and the search was called off, the Catholic priest prayed for the recovery of the bodies and for tolerance.  Sometimes, 200 or 300 people were present.  Immediately after that, members of the Muslim Egyptian community said their own prayers.  The Christians and those of no denomination who were present respected those prayers.  It was beautiful to see Muslims and Christians praying together because of a tragedy.  It was a wonderful blend.</P>
        <P>We should take a look at Muslim and Christian history.  Christ is seen as a prophet in the Muslim religion, not the redeemer or saviour.  There are links, but there have been several holy wars and, of course, internal Christian wars.  I had a chat about faith with a religious person in America.  I do not know whether the person was Muslim or Buddhist, as it was a while ago.  The person could not understand the holy row between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland.  We were all Christians and the person could see no difference or understand for what we were fighting.</P>
        <P>It is important that we retain the prayer and add 30 seconds of silence.  I am not an overly religious person.  I am a practising Catholic, albeit not daily.  I am also a spiritual person.  In addition to the prayer, the 30 seconds will cater for those who want the prayer and for those <Col N="50"/>who want time to stand in reflection.  It is a catch-all amendment and has been agreed by the CPP.</P>
        <P>Members can vote on it if they prefer, but we should reflect about what it is we are voting on.  I have been in the House for a long time and am probably one of the elders in the Chamber.  I first became a Senator in 1989.  This is a sensitive issue and the majority of members of the CPP as well as a majority of Senators would like to retain the prayer.  By including 30 seconds of silence prior to that, we will accommodate those who do not have the same religious beliefs as others.</P>

	<P>This is an interesting debate, although I am surprised that the CPP took this decision without consulting Members.</P>
        <P>I was not aware of this extra reflection.  I genuinely believed that the prayer was a reflection and I had not heard it was offensive to people.  There was a time in my life when I taught in America.  I respected the traditions of that country, which included pledging the oath of allegiance before the flag every morning along with the children I was teaching.  I did not regard that as offensive because I was living there.</P>
        <P>We came into this House and its traditions.  Perhaps I have not parsed each and every word of the prayer but I did not find it offensive by any means.  I respect the traditions of the House.  Why do we need another reflection if the prayer was itself a reflection?  I can only presume the issue pertains to the prayer&rsquo;s wording.</P>

	<P>If we are to provide an opportunity to reflect in silence to suit some Members of this House while maintaining the prayer to suit others, all we are doing is sticking together two pieces to keep people happy.  It is a bit phony to act in that way.  Would it not be preferable to reflect on what Senators have said today and craft a new formula of words that brings together all traditions and reflects the diversity of the House?  We have clearly arrived at a point in our history where we are being challenged to do this.  In the Christian tradition there is nothing wrong with allowing a moment of silence.  We often observe silence in our religious practice.  Sticking it all together is a phony solution, however.  We have to consider the formula of words before we proceed further.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The issue of Lifford Community Hospital was debated here recently.  A report issued by the HSE West last week indicated that Lifford Community Hospital would close in three months subject to consultation and a review.  There will be a meeting tomorrow with Mr. John Hayes of HSE west in Letterkenny to discuss the plan.  I was born in Lifford community hospital and some of my family members passed away there over the years.  The most recent HIQA report from September 2011 highlights the great care patients are getting in the hospital and how well the hospital is regarded in the community.  It also acts as a step-down facility for Letterkenny General Hospital which is approximately 20 minutes away.  Mr. Hayes has admitted that this may pose a difficulty.  In light of the favourable HIQA report perhaps the Minister might suggest that the hospital be given one year or two years rather than the three months, which would allow patients the time to get used to the fact that it might close down.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My most recent visit to the hospital was before Christmas.  Some of the patients regard the hospital as their home.  One patient said, &ldquo;This is my sitting room and this is my fireplace.&rdquo;  Most of them would be over 80 and regard it as a home.  I accept that if they are moved to St. Joseph&rsquo;s home in Stranorlar they might be cared for as well.  However, moving them from what they regard as their home could come as a shock to them.  The community in Lifford has raised more than &euro;100,000 to assist the HSE in whatever way possible to improve the facilities in the hospital.  While I accept the building is old, the quality of care cannot be overstated.</P>
        <P>The report highlighted that the hospital can give better care because the numbers are small.  There are 11 long-stay beds and nine respite beds.  The fact that the numbers have fallen gives them a better quality of care.  I ask the Minister to extend the time from three months to 12 months or perhaps two years before a closure takes place.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I apologise that the Minister of State with responsibility for care of the elderly, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was unable to address the issue.  It provides me with an opportunity on her behalf to update the House on the matter and to outline the background to the current situation and the action taken by the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The Senator will be aware that the moratorium on recruitment and compliance with national quality standards are impacting on the community hospital system in Donegal.  These pressures are mirrored across the country and are well documented.  I acknowledge that there is a considerable concern about the future of our community nursing units.  There is no doubt that we are facing challenges in this sector owing to staffing and funding issues, and the age and structure of the existing units.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE West service plan for 2012 proposes that a rationalisation of residential facilities be undertaken following extensive consultation with patients and relevant stakeholders regarding Lifford Community Hospital.  Lifford Community Hospital is one of 11 community hospitals in County Donegal.  It was established in 1799.  Over the past 12 to 18 months the hospital has reduced its bed capacity from 40 beds to the current 20 beds.  The HSE is now considering a proposal to discontinue the inpatient services at Lifford Community Hospital.  This includes 11 long-stay residential beds, five respite-specific beds, one palliative-care bed and three assessment-rehabilitative beds.</P>
        <P>The proposal envisages that the physiotherapy department, dental and chiropody clinics located at the hospital will continue to provide services to the local community.  Access to the primary care services would remain unchanged.  However, prior to any final decision being taken a three-month period of consultation by HSE management will begin on 1 March with all residents, their families and staff.  This consultation period will focus on the provision of information on the proposed changes and the options that are available to the residents, and will allow time for them and their families to consider these.  Any proposals for the continuation of services or provision of alternative services, whether from the local community or other interested parties will be actively considered as part of the consultation process.</P>
        <P>The HIQA acknowledges that the facility&rsquo;s age, layout and structure pose challenges to the delivery of care.  It further acknowledges that the reduction in numbers and the clear demarcation of respite and long-stay accommodation has assisted the hospital in meeting the regulations in terms of provision of service to long-stay residents.  However, the HSE estimates the cost of future compliance with HIQA standards, SARI guidelines on infection and the national standards for safer better health care is approximately &euro;1.5 million.  The capital requirement to upgrade or extend the facility is one factor informing the decision to propose the closure of the facility in 2012.  Other factors include the moratorium on recruitment and the cost of care per resident which is now not sustainable in comparison with other units and the private sector.</P>
        <P>In addition, there is existing capacity within the local public and private residential facilitates to accommodate the 11 long-term residents in Lifford based on their preference.  All developments have to be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures and any decisions taken by the HSE must have regard to this and the current moratorium.  I trust the House will agree that we need to ensure that the highest standard of care will continue to be provided to all residents in a safe and secure environment.  Providing quality and safe care will always remain at the heart of any considerations.</P>

	<P>As the Minister is aware, more than four months have passed since the Priory Hall residents were forced to evacuate their homes as a result of a dangerous fire risk.  Four months have passed since I raised their plight with the Minister in the House but there is still no sign of a long-term solution to their housing problems.  In the short term the residents face the prospect of having to pay rent on temporary accommodation as well as paying their mortgages because the council is appealing the High Court decision to the Supreme Court.  I was genuinely shocked to read the response of the Minister to a question on this issue tabled in the D&aacute;il last month.  The Minister put it to the House that Dublin City Council had made commendable efforts to provide for the needs of the residents.  Frankly, there is nothing commendable about forcing people out of their homes with no advance plan for emergency accommodation for families with infant children who were unsure where they would sleep in subsequent days.  There is nothing commendable about trying to make the residents pay rent on temporary accommodation on top of mortgage repayments on uninhabitable accommodation in Priory Hall.</P>
        <P>Overall, Dublin City Council&rsquo;s approach has been typified from the start of this debacle by a distinct lack of humanity.  My concern is that by listening only to the council&rsquo;s version of events, the Minister is getting a warped view of the reality faced by the residents.  By passing the buck between each other, Dublin City Council and the Department are effectively ensuring that no State body is taking responsibility for resolving the problems in Priory Hall.</P>
        <P>The Department is insisting that the matter is the responsibility of Dublin City Council.  However, Dublin City Council has made it clear at meetings which I attended that it is taking instruction from the Minister&rsquo;s Department and that it has been warned not to set a precedent by accepting responsibility for Priory Hall.  This buck-passing must stop.  I urge the Minister today, as I did four months ago, to meet the residents and to hear at first hand how all of this is affecting them and their families.  I believe if the Minister sat down and listened to them he would feel compelled to help them, to put aside all the bureaucracy, to stop passing the buck and to do the right thing.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to ensure a proper system is put in place at national level for dealing with housing evacuation situations.  Unfortunately, the problems in Priory Hall are likely to <Col N="54"/>recur to varying extents in other developments throughout the country.  It is neither fair nor sensible to allow different county councils to take different responses.  No doubt the Minister is aware of the announcement yesterday that 250 householders in Belmayne, north-east Dublin, must move out of their homes temporarily due to fire safety problems.  Thankfully, they will be accommodated within the same development because there are many empty units in Belmayne and the works should take only a matter of days.  Unfortunately, residents in others developments in the coming years may not be quite so lucky.  I call on the Minister, who has national responsibility for this issue, to put in place a proper national system for dealing with future problems of this nature.</P>
        <P>I fully accept that the responsibility rests with the developers.  The State should ensure that the costs rest with developers when these issues arise in future.  Unfortunately, we may end up with other situations where developers go bust and are not in a position financially to rectify the situation or where the likes of Tom McFeely, the individual responsible for building Priory Hall, try to do everything they can do avoid their responsibilities.  It is sensible to get ahead of this before we end up with future problems.  I call on the Minister to sit down, to bring all the agencies together and to put in place a framework for how these issues will be dealt with rather than leaving the residents to run from one Department to another and from the council to their national representatives in an attempt to get someone to take responsibility.  Let us put a system in place now to ensure that problems in future can be deal with effectively.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The legal proceedings relating to Priory Hall are continuing and it would be inappropriate to anticipate their conclusion.  I imagine Senator Power has no wish for me, as a public representative, to intervene in court proceedings.  Dublin City Council&rsquo;s appeal against the High Court order that it pay the costs of providing alternative accommodation for the Priory Hall residents will be heard on 24 April 2012.  I realise this has caused a good deal of inconvenience to the residents through no fault of theirs.  The lack of trust between the professional bodies, professional people and the developer has allowed this to happen from the beginning.</P>
        <P>At my request, the Department is being kept informed of developments by Dublin City Council.   The Department has assisted the council, in consultation with NAMA, in securing alternative temporary accommodation for many of the residents.  My Department has made a contribution towards the costs necessarily incurred by Dublin City Council, in the context of the High Court cases, in providing temporary accommodation for households evacuated from Priory Hall.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council is the designated authority with powers to enforce the statutory requirements arising under current legislation, including the Fire Safety Act, the Building Control Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which are at issue in the case of Priory Hall.  The council is also the designated housing authority under the Housing Acts.</P>
        <P>My responsibility is to ensure that appropriate statutory requirements, technical standards and administrative provisions are put in place under the relevant legislation.  This responsibility has been fulfilled and is not in dispute.  I have no role in enforcement activity or in the direct provision of housing services.  Residents at Priory Hall and their representatives have previously been advised of this standing division of responsibilities.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to meet the residents at this point.  As I have stated on many occasions I must act appropriately and within my powers, especially since the case is already the subject of legal proceedings.  The overriding priority is to facilitate <Col N="55"/>the return by residents to their homes as early as possible.  In this respect it will be necessary to ensure that these homes are made fit for purpose and that the costs of so doing fall where they should.  I have asked Dublin City Council to do all within its powers to achieve this objective and I have asked the Department to continue to liaise closely with Dublin City Council in this regard.</P>
        <P>The council has made commendable efforts to provide for the needs of residents to date and it continues to work proactively on their behalf towards achieving the necessary and longed-for resolution of the issues at Priory Hall.  Difficult legal issues arise including issues of enforcement.  The fire officers of Dublin City Council were the people who identified the problem.  In the circumstances, I urge all concerned to allow the council to continue to deal with this situation even though it is protracted and things are not happening as fast as I would like.  My Department will continue to liaise with the council with regard to its ongoing response to the needs of the residents and its efforts to facilitate their return to their homes as early as possible.  Substantial works remain to be undertaken before this can take place.  The council is making every effort to achieve the remediation works as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since taking office I have clearly signalled that consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings is a priority matter.  I am dealing with legacy issues of poor building standards implemented by previous Governments and I intend to change the regulations and the system of regulations as soon as I can.  In July 2011, before any of these matters came to light, I announced several measures to be advanced by the Department and local authorities with a view to improving compliance with and oversight of the requirements of the building regulations.  Mandatory certification and improved inspection arrangements are key reforms which will be put in place in 2012.  These will have the capacity to improve the quality of buildings while ensuring that problems like those that have arisen at Priory Hall do not visit homeowners again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have also publicly articulated my views on the role played by construction professionals and industry interests in certifying the building works at Priory Hall.  I am most disappointed at the lack of attention being paid to this aspect of the problem by commentators in general.  I hope that they come to realise where the problem and a considerable part of the blame lies.  From the point of view of the residents, the blame game is no good to them.  We must get on with trying to help them.  Given the law and the current situation regarding the potential case at the Supreme Court I can do no more than I am doing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the Minister&rsquo;s suggestion that some kind of legal impediment may prevent him from meeting the residents, the residents themselves are not party to the court case.  They are unfortunate bystanders to this debacle.  Nobody is asking him to intervene in the court proceedings.  I have sought legal advice on the issue from experts in constitutional law and have been informed there is no legal impediment because the Minister is not being asked to exercise a judicial function, hold a parallel hearing, direct the judge or otherwise get involved in the legal determination of these issues.  Nothing in the Constitution stands in the way of a political solution to a problem that is before the courts.  I accept this is a serious issue and I would not ask the Minister to intervene if I believed he faced legal impediments in doing so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to a national framework for future problem developments, I welcome the fact that the Minister is being proactive in addressing the building regulations for future developments.  I appreciate that he can do nothing about developments that were built wrongly in the past or the fact that the system was not good enough but in addition to changing the regulations and <Col N="56"/>ensuring we do not encounter problems with future developments, we also need to put in place a system for dealing with problems in current developments.  This is why I ask him to address the question I asked about the establishment of a national framework for dealing with Priory Hall and other developments that were not built properly and will not be affected by the new regulations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with the Senator.  This is a legacy issue and, unfortunately, we cannot deal with existing buildings.  I inherited this problem but I was trying to do something about the mandatory certification system before the issues arose at Priory Hall and Belmayne.  I assure the Senator that according to the legal advice I have received, I am precluded from getting involved in this case.  I am going to comply with my legal advice and I will not act other than legally because I do not want the outcome of this process to be other than the pursuit of the people who are directly responsible for the trouble caused to the residents of Priory Hall and Belmayne.</P>

      <sTitle>Teagasc Advisory Offices</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine for coming to the House to respond to my concerns about the future of the Teagasc centre in Manorhamilton.  It came to light only last week that the centre&rsquo;s future was in question.  A similar problem arose in 2003, when it appeared that Teagasc was planning to close its smaller offices throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Teagasc or its predecessor, ACOT, has always maintained an advisory service in Manorhamilton, which is my local town.  I have special responsibility for that area as the only Government Member from County Leitrim.  The current office was built in the early 1970s and it has served the people of the area well over the years.  When it was previously threatened with closure, we managed to keep it open.  Since Christmas, the Teagasc office in Sligo was closed and its staff were moved to Manorhamilton, where five or six people are currently employed.  Most of the staff would be happy to remain in Manorhamilton because it is easier to access than the suggested alternative of Ballymote for those who come from north County Sligo.  If we end up with Teagasc offices in Ballymote in south County Sligo and Mohill in south County Leitrim, the northern parts of counties Sligo and Leitrim will not be covered by an office and farmers will have to travel 40 or 45 miles to Ballymote or Mohill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Manorhamilton is ideally situated and Teagasc operates from a purpose-built office in the town.  I will be attending a beef discussion group meeting at the office this evening and a sheep group has also been set up in the area.  It is vital for the farmers of the area that we maintain the office.  It would also encourage young farmers who are currently studying at agricultural colleges to stay in the industry.  Farmers from north County Sligo are also attending courses and discussion groups at the office.</P>
        <P>Under the Croke Park agreement, staff who move further than 40 km can incur additional costs, which would create further problems for Teagasc.  We are only looking at the cost of running it.  That building cannot be sold in the current market and it will just sit there.  Significant amounts have been spent on the building since Christmas to facilitate the move from Sligo.  It would be a great pity at this stage if the office was closed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the issue of the Teagasc office in Manorhamilton.  I note his request that a commitment be given that the office remains open.  In case the impression is created that this is a <Col N="57"/>decision for the Minister, let me make the position clear.  Decisions relating to the future of Teagasc local offices are operational matters for the Teagasc authority to consider.  Teagasc operates as a separate State agency under the Department&rsquo;s aegis and it has statutory responsibility for the provision of advisory, education and research services to the agriculture sector.  It is governed by an authority, which is representative of the main stakeholder groups in the agrifood sector.  It is a matter for Teagasc and the authority to prioritise activities in the delivery of these services and to allocate its resources in accordance with these priorities.  As far as my Department is concerned, ministerial responsibility is confined to matters of policy in accordance with the Act and the Minister does not interfere in the day-to-day operations of Teagasc.</P>
        <P>The agency commenced a change process in 2009 to ensure it remains fit for purpose and delivers value for public money.  The change programme addressed both the ongoing need for change and the need for significant resource rationalisation.  Implementation is resulting in the disposal of surplus assets, a significant reduction in the number of research, advisory and educational locations, the cutting of management and administrative posts and significant productivity gains by staff.  On completion, the future Teagasc will be a smaller, highly innovative, efficient and focused organisation.</P>
        <P>I understand that, as part of the change programme, Teagasc has decided to concentrate the delivery of its services, including advisory services, at fewer centres.  The existing network of advisory offices is being streamlined from 91 to 51 by the end of 2012.  The specific criteria used by the agency in assessing the viability of advisory office locations includes client numbers, staff numbers, distance to clients, distance to other Teagasc offices and overall cost structure.  The decision to close offices and concentrate the delivery of services at fewer locations is entirely a matter for Teagasc and its board.  On average, clients visits an advisory office 1.5 times per year.  Farmers tend to gravitate much more readily to other centres for public events such as seminars, farm walks, demonstrations and information meetings.  A good example is the discussion group model referred to by the Senator where groups of farmers visit similar farms and share information and experiences in dialogue facilitated by their Teagasc adviser.</P>
        <P>I understand from Teagasc that no decision has been made to close the Manorhamilton advisory office.  A review will be carried out by the agency of its remaining advisory office structure on completion of the current rationalisation programme. Teagasc is committed to providing high quality advisory services to farmers in the Sligo-Leitrim region and to ensuring they have access to the best advice delivered by highly skilled advisory staff.  In addition to the Manorhamilton office, enhanced advisory offices are located in Mohill and Ballymote.  Teagasc opened a new purpose-built office in Mohill in 2009.  This state-of-the-art facility, which cost more than &euro;1 million to construct, includes new offices, training rooms and customer facilities.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to comment on individual decisions taken by Teagasc regarding the delivery of its services at particular locations.  I understand the local concerns that may arise are significant and are of concern to public representatives.  However, that is a matter for the Teagasc authority to deal with and it is not appropriate for the Minister to become involved in a location by location basis. Teagasc is substantially dependent on taxpayer funded resources to deliver its statutory mandate.  In the current economic circumstances, it has had to explore every conceivable option to minimise the Exchequer contribution.  It embarked on an extensive rationalisation programme in 2009 to respond to these budgetary constraints in a manner that minimises the adverse impact on its services, clients and programmes.  I am satisfied that Teagasc will continue to provide quality advisory services to farmers within the restructured advisory structure and plan it has in place.</P><Col N="58"/>
        <P Just="Left">I understand where the Senator is coming from.  Many farming communities are attached to their local Teagasc offices, particularly where there has been investment in them in the recent past.  My information regarding Manorhamilton is no decision has been taken to close the office.  A rationalisation process is under way and if the future of the office is reviewed following that process, that will be an issue for Teagasc and its board.  I cannot be any more accurate than that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I very much thank the Minister because it is so far, so good.  I will be in touch with Teagasc about the issue and, I hope the office will remain open in Manorhamilton.  I will have to wait and see what happens.</P>
