	<P>I have received notice from Senator Deirdre Clune that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to ensure the increase in the use of heroin in the Cork region is tackled in an effective manner.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mary Moran of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to make a statement on the health and safety aspects of the cycle lanes and associated works at Stapleton Place, Dundalk, which were funded by his Department and are a safety hazard.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I have also received notice from Senator Denis Landy of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to clarify if he is aware that the Presentation primary school in Carrick-on-Suir is due to lose eight of its 26 teachers as a result of changes to pupil-teacher ratios and the loss of legacy posts and support teachers, and to address this matter urgently to assuage the concerns of the teachers, parents and local community on this issue.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 - Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business.  The time allocated for this item shall not exceed two hours and 15 minutes.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I ask the Deputy Leader how many Ministers are here this week.  Earlier in the week those of us in this House mentioned the importance of the events held on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and the week in which it falls.  The two Houses are sitting this week, but yesterday, for the first time I can recall, the sitting in this House had to be suspended because there was no Minister available to take a Private Members&rsquo; motion we had tabled on a number of items for which the Government should answer.  We tried to facilitate the relevant Minister, but all we were offered was one hour.  Whether the Government likes it, this Chamber is part of the Oireachtas.  If it wants to treat it with such disregard and disrespect, it should bring it on.  It may not like the robust nature of debates here, but as I am sure all Senators know, we take our job very seriously.  I received a telephone call at 2 p.m. yesterday to indicate to me that it was not possible to find a Minister to take the Private Members&rsquo; motion, which was an absolute disgrace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Shameful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a common trend yesterday.  The Seanad adjourned early yesterday and Private Members&rsquo; business was delayed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for 15 minutes because a Minister could not be found.  The Government also lost a vote called by the great Deputy Peter Mathews at the finance committee as Fine Gael could not find enough Deputies to vote for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>They could not vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is everyone?  Why not adjourn the House for the week and be done with it?  The common theme running through all three issues that arose yesterday was the mortgage crisis.  In Private Members&rsquo; business, when we discussed the Government report card, the first item related to the thousands of people in mortgage arrears, an issue I will discuss further in a moment.  Private Members&rsquo; business in the other House yesterday focused on the interest rates being charged by Permanent TSB and other banks to hard-pressed mortgage holders.  I note a Minister did not bother turning up in the D&aacute;il Chamber until 15 minutes after the debate was scheduled to commence.  Yesterday, when members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform called for the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, to appear before it the only Government member present was Deputy Peter Mathews.  Perhaps the great Deputy Mathews will explain to the joint committee the reason he voted against the motion he tabled.  This is a very serious matter.  The Seanad was forced yesterday to move business to next Wednesday and effectively lost an entire afternoon&rsquo;s business.  What Ministers are available this week?</P>
        <P>I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, interviewed on radio this morning.  While I do not wish to make a personal criticism of him given that he comes before the House regularly, he was available to come to the House for only one hour yesterday.  Which other Ministers are available?  Senators will not put up with this.  I want an absolute commitment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Given that we had to conclude business early yesterday, I ask the Cathaoirleach to indulge me.  I understand this is the first time this has happened and I want a commitment from the Deputy Leader that it will not happen again.  It shows utter disregard for all Senators, especially the Fianna F&aacute;il Party group, nine of whose 14 members contributed in detail yesterday on the fiscal compact.  My party contributes to debates and we were ready to contribute on our Private Members' motion yesterday before it was pulled.  That is not acceptable.</P>
        
        <P>On the comments of the Governor of the Central Bank, he has raised the flag for the banks and allowed them open season to proceed with the repossession of thousands of properties in the investment sector.  Does he realise the 400,000 people who own second properties are not property developers or the wealthy but individuals who invested in properties as a form of pension scheme?  I would like the Governor to be much more forthright in calling on the Government to act on the Keane report and the 140,000 mortgages &mdash; he referred to a figure of 107,000 &mdash; on principal private residences which are in arrears.  Until we are given cast iron guarantees on ministerial attendance in the Chamber and until the House functions properly again, my party will oppose every Order of Business and every measure the Government proposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I never doubted that Senator O&rsquo;Brien was taking his job seriously and we are pleased to note that is the case.  However, as he and other Senators are well aware, many Ministers have been paired and are travelling on State business.  The Leader will respond in due course but this side of the House is doing everything possible to oblige the Opposition.</P>
        <P>On the Senator&rsquo;s comments on the Governor of the Central Bank, he is misrepresenting the position somewhat.  The Governor was referring only to buy-to-let properties and the investment sector.  The Government is doing everything possible to help distressed homeowners keep their homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It would have been good to discuss the issue in the House last night.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Governor&rsquo;s comments, which I am sure he will amplify, related to the investment market.</P>

	<P>I have a copy of his comments.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>He referred to people with investment properties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow Senator Coghlan to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>When one analyses his statement it makes a great deal of sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not make any sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to raise a matter for discussion in the House.  It is one of particular interest to me as a former university person and I am proud of the role Ireland is playing in this regard.  In August 1992, the National and University Library of Bosnia in Sarajevo was completely destroyed with the loss of more than 2 million volumes and priceless manuscripts.  The European Union is facilitating the rebuilding of the library structure and three students in Sarajevo have taken a wonderful initiative to start the restocking of the library, particularly with contemporary works.  I am pleased this country is playing a role in the initiative through the Genealogical Society of Ireland.  I wonder if, through a debate in the House, our authorities, third level institutions, universities and private citizens could be encouraged to contribute to this positive measure.  After the disastrous civil war in Bosnia, which lost a large part of its cultural heritage, it is important that Ireland supports and assists in this project.</P>
        <P>While I am on the subject of universities, I express my regret that the top 100 listing of universities in the world no longer features an Irish university.  My colleague, Senator Barrett, organised a meeting with the Higher Education Authority, which discussed this issue, among other topics.  I am concerned about the criteria used for compiling the list, which I do not believe for one second to be accurate.  One of the things I was told was that the reputational damage done to Ireland by the economic crisis was having a spin-off effect and what is being measured is perception rather than reality.  As Senator Barrett will, I am sure, confirm, at least two or three of our universities deserve to be in the top 100 universities in the world.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask for a debate on an issue that must be close to the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s heart, namely, the way in which the global financial system operates.  For the 100th time, I refer to the malign impact of the ratings agencies.  They were at it again yesterday when they began nibbling away at the United Kingdom.  I am highly concerned about practices within this discredited group and the disproportionate power it has been permitted to have.  I am also concerned by an article on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> today which features a statement by a senior executive of Goldman Sachs, Greg Smith, in which he is critical and condemnatory of the company.  He states employees were told to &ldquo;hunt elephants&rdquo; which was &ldquo;Goldman-speak&rdquo; for getting clients &ldquo;to invest in products that would generate most profit for the bank, regardless of whether they suited the investor.&rdquo;  Where is morality in the international financial system?  Why are Goldman Sachs and the ratings agencies not held up to scrutiny and held to account?  These institutions are the very source of the global financial disaster, yet they are getting away with it and continue to milk money from clients whose interests they are not serving.  I note once more a wonderful phrase used by <i>Rolling Stone </i>magazine about a decade ago when it described Goldman Sachs as "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money."  I am not on the side of a vampire squid but I am on the side of humanity, as I believe is every Member of the House.  We may be a small Parliament in a small country but a David can sometimes take on a Goliath.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the Ministers who is not in the country today is the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, who is in Silicon Valley where he announced a &euro;30 million investment fund to be administered through Sofinnova Ventures, a venture capitalist company which will work with small medical and health care companies in this country.  This welcome development forms part of the Government&rsquo;s action plan on jobs.  The global health care sector is due to grow by 9% in 2013 and is estimated to be worth &euro;1.2 trillion per annum.  This is an important and welcome announcement on which I congratulate the Minister.  It signifies the value of Ministers&rsquo; travelling abroad at this time of the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It strikes me that the State should have sent Senator Norris abroad for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day because he would be a great ambassador for Ireland from a cultural point of view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator could have travelled himself with the green tie he is wearing today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reminiscing about the days I spent abroad.  It is appropriate that the House recognise this great week and I wish everyone present a happy St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  I also wish all our Ministers abroad great success in attracting industry and tourism to Ireland.</P>
        <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, to come to the House next week to clarify a matter regarding the household charge of &euro;100 per house.  Yesterday, Senator Jimmy Harte referred to legal advice provided by a solicitor indicating that a question mark hangs over the legality of the charge.  It has been brought to my attention that a misleading document circulating on the Internet may be the same document to which the Senator referred.  A reputable firm of solicitors, McCann FitzGerald, associated with the document has issued a statement that it had no hand, act or part in regard to it.  It is important that this be clarified because the name was used and abused by somebody purporting this was advice given by that firm of solicitors, which is absolutely inaccurate.  Whatever one thinks about the charge, the legislation was passed by this House and the D&aacute;il and signed by the President.  It is not being challenged other than on the basis that it was not published in the Irish language.  The document in circulation which has been brought to my attention is misleading.  I am glad McCann FitzGerald has issued this statement clarifying the matter because it was associated with the document.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to extend the deadline for the payment of the charge until the end of April because people are encountering great difficulty in securing the form.  Many people do not have access to the Internet to complete it.  It would be a good idea, therefore, for the Minister to examine the matter and come to the House to clarify the issues raised by Senator Jimmy Harte yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Terry Leyden for raising this matter.  He has covered the point I made yesterday, namely, that erroneous information is being peddled on the Internet about the legality of the household charge.  In the interests of those who want to pay it &mdash; I believe all of the people in the country want to do so &mdash; the Minister should clarify the position.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to discuss the issue of rural schools?  I make an interesting journey every Tuesday morning from Donegal to Dublin and when I cross the Border at Strabane, I pick up BBC Radio Ulster.  However, I lose that coverage when I leave Aughnacloy and travel into County Monaghan.  The content of the coverage on Radio Ulster is completely different from that on radio stations here from the point of view of rural schools.  The situation of rural schools in County Fermanagh was discussed recently while I was travelling to Dublin.  There are 44 in primary schools in County Fermanagh, 40 of which are located in rural areas.  In terms of the enrolment threshold,  25 of these schools will have to close.  However, none of the four urban primary schools will have to close.  This will affect 1,600 primary schoolchildren in rurals areas of the county.  Will the Sinn F&eacute;in Party Members of the House tell me why it is planned to close 40 rural primary schools in County Fermanagh?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to deal, first, with what happened at the meeting of the finance committee yesterday.  Those who like to view what happens here as a Punch and Judy show can put their own interpretation on what happened.  The point at issue is that Parliament has a role to play in dealing with the national finances and the issue of reinvesting in the banks.  It was in that spirit that we asked the Governor of the Central Bank to appear before the committee.  I believe every member of the committee supports the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and all those seeking to reduce the promissory note payment of &euro;3.1 billion on 31 March, which is bad news for the media.  There may have been doors that did not unlock such that the full committee was not able to meet, but it is fair to say we all support those who are seeking to reduce this burden.  As we said the other day, the use of promissory notes, letters of comfort and so on is frowned upon by the Comptroller and Auditor General and not part of a proper parliamentary process.</P>
        <P>I wish the very best for Mary Ryan-Hayes, aged nine years, in her continued recovery following the incident with a train near Tipperary.  It was great news for us to hear, although it was tempered somewhat by the reports on the loss of 22 schoolchildren from Belgium while returning home from a school outing.  We extend our sympathy to the people of Belgium.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the issue of university rankings, as mentioned by Senator David Norris, the counterbalance is that we have universities in the top 15 in the world based on article citations.  Sometimes league tables do not make much sense; they are sometimes used by lobby groups, of which we must always beware.  The good news is that research articles are widely cited and referred to.  It is recognised that this is a very difficult time for the public finances and that people have to play their part in setting the country to rights again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I refer to the university rankings which have been mentioned.  The rankings of TCD and UCD have slipped.  The previous two speakers have worked in and may still be a part of the university sector.  We have to keep an eye on these rankings.  <i>The Times</i> higher education rankings are regarded as being the most authoritative in the world.  I know Senator David Norris has criticised them, but in order to criticise one must have the facts.  We should conduct more research on our universities to ascertain if we have the requisite number of professionals with PhDs lecturing in their own field.  It is one thing to have the requisite number to qualify in terms of university rankings, but to have the requisite number qualified in the field in which they are teaching is another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely, but the proof is, as Senator Sean Barrett said, that we are in the first league in terms of citations.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>However, we must recognise that this research was carried out all over the world and 31,000 rankings were evaluated.  Regardless of what we think of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It has to do with the criteria.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>If we had criteria in place for funding universities, the funding would follow the level of performance.  This would make people in universities pull up their socks.  There should be checks and balances.  We have to decide how we will evaluate our universities, aside from the <i>The Times</i> higher education rankings.  In that respect, if a university does not perform, it should not receive funding.  I, therefore, ask the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to have an informed debate on the issue to ensure we protect the integrity of our universities.</P>

	<P Just="Left">When Ministers come into this House, they are not doing us a favour, they are carrying out their constitutional obligations.  The Government is accountable to this House.  At some stage in the short to medium term, we may have a referendum on the future of the Seanad, a campaign I am looking forward to.  Until then, however, it is imperative this House is treated with absolute respect.  We are not second rate or second hand politicians and the thousand county councillors and the tens of thousands of university graduates who elect the majority of Senators are not second rate electors.  It is imperative that we are treated with respect and I share the sentiments of my colleagues who were disappointed by events yesterday.  That must not occur again.  A strong statement must go from this House to Ministers and Government that they are not doing us a favour by coming in here to engage and respond to our debates; they are carrying out their constitutional duties.  Until such time as the people decide on the future of the Seanad, it is vital for that full engagement to continue.  We cannot replay yesterday but we must learn from it.  If one word should be on the Government agenda in its relationship with the Seanad, it should be &ldquo;respect&rdquo;.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I concur with other Senators, particularly Senator Bradford.  On this occasion contempt has been shown for all Members of the House.  I have been vocal in the past in praising the Leader and Deputy Leader for changes to procedures here and how we do our business in the House.  The Government, however, has shown absolute disrespect to all Members of the House and to the Leader.  I do not hold him responsible but I expect him and the Deputy Leader to raise this at the highest level.  As Senator Bradford rightly said, it is not a case of doing one a favour.  This is not a democratic dictatorship; Ministers are servants to this House and its work rather than doing favours for us.  I do not hold her or the Leader personally responsible but I expect swift action and a statement from the Taoiseach on the issue.  He has not covered himself in glory in pursuing an abolitionist agenda that he likes to reinforce at every opportunity.  No doubt we will have that debate in due course but I would like a response from the Cabinet that, at least for now, it acknowledges that as a functional democracy, Ministers have a responsibility to this House and to the people of Ireland to which they did not live up yesterday.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is timely to have a serious debate on the mortgage crisis in this House, especially in light of Patrick Honohan&rsquo;s words in the University of Limerick, where he appears to favour repossessions, if they must take place, taking place for over-indebted buy-to-let borrowers who can no longer service their debts.  Have we come to a moment in time where we must now ask what is our priority?  My priority is to save the family home.  No greater crisis can befall a family than their home to be taken from them.  I want to see what Mr. Honohan can do to help Government policy.  Will it make it easier for banks to save family homes if the buy-to-let properties are repossessed?  Is that the subtext of Mr. Honohan&rsquo;s remarks?  We must get clarification of such issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is customary at this time of the year for Ministers to travel all over the world to promote our special little island, which needs the world&rsquo;s help.  I agree a Minister should have been here yesterday but this is a special moment because every Government Minister will be promoting &ldquo;the Gathering&rdquo; that is to take place next year, the initiative the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is promoting to boost tourism numbers in 2013.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join those on all sides who have once again encouraged Ministers to wear the green jersey across Europe.  In the ongoing debate, I was heartened and taken aback by an editorial in yesterday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which lauded the fact  Ministers were going abroad, and went so far as to say it was an imperative and suggested there were elements in the media that had been controversial about the issue in the past.  I was astonished because there was a collective attack by all of the media in recent years, particularly when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, that this was about junketing.  Now, all of a sudden, in this brave new world, it is an imperative.  It was always an imperative that we went abroad during St. Patrick&rsquo;s week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I compliment once more Tourism Ireland and its CEO, Niall Gibbons, for the outstanding work in establishing the green lights on iconic attractions across the world, from Niagara Falls to Sydney Opera House and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  For the next week, little Ireland will be the focus of world attention.  Jimmy Crowley, a great folk singer from Cork, recorded a song many years ago that I will paraphrase by saying we will all be Irish tonight; everyone abroad will be Irish for the week and I hope, with the help of Ministers, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the Irish Diaspora and all of those networking throughout the world for the week, that it will result in the attraction of more visitors and more jobs.  I applaud them for their efforts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>People have criticised Ministers for not coming into the House but we must get our own house in order.  I raise again the role we can play in European legislation.  I understand a letter was sent to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission about the allocation of staff to deal with that issue.  That was more than six weeks ago and I am anxious that the Deputy Leader looks at this issue again &mdash; the setting aside of time to deal with very important legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have been here now for 12 months.  Recently it took us 90 minutes to have nine votes.  We must look at our own procedures and use our time more efficiently.  We are reluctant to move with the times and we will soon be entering a major debate on this.  We must show the electorate we are prepared to change with the times.  I am not convinced that has happened yet.  I have no difficulty with votes being called but I have a difficulty with the fact that even though an electronic system is in place, it still takes 20 minutes to deal with the issue once a vote is called.   We need to move on.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The other issue I wish to raise is that of third level colleges.  It is wrong in this day and age that we have colleges producing graduates for whom there are no jobs in this country.  I refer, in particular, to the law faculties, in respect of which we have not adjusted to the times.  It is sad that it takes so long for a third level institution to change to meet what the market is now seeking.  If we have a debate on education, we should debate ensuring colleges respond to what the market requires.  That is not happening or is not happening fast enough.  The issue should be included in the debate on the next occasion the Minister for Education and Skills is in the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>To follow Senator Colm Burke&rsquo;s comments on third level education, let us not limit ourselves to third level education provided in universities.  Let us remember that there are job possibilities in other areas.  I am thinking, in particular, of the hospitality sector and the great work being done in that regard by a number of third level education facilities.  I was in the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s county on Monday.  It was my first visit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Senator received a good welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I received a great welcome at Ireland West Airport in Knock.  I was very impressed by its plans for the year and the number of aeroplanes that will fly to the west from various European countries.  This is the first time the airport has had such large numbers arriving.  Clearly, it is gearing up for a huge increase in the number of tourists from the Continent this year.  I mention this because when talking about creating jobs and solving the unemployment problem, there is nowhere in which this can be done quicker than in the hospitality business.  Tourism offers, possibly, the one chance we have left.  Perhaps the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, might be invited to the House for a debate on tourism.  It is something we can do immediately; it does not take a long time to develop the business.  I realise the Government&rsquo;s heart is in the right place and that it is committed to the industry.  The steps it took with regard to value added tax, VAT, were in the right direction, but the industry is always under threat.  The Government could decide, however, that it was a one-off measure and put the rate back up again.  We have a chance to do something about tourism and should debate the issue in the House, as it would be worthwhile.  If we wish to use this House to best advantage, we must ensure time is allocated for a debate on tourism.</P>

	<P>I wish everybody a happy St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  As I walked to Leinster House this morning it was truly heartening to see so many foreign visitors in the city.  I hope we will have a good weekend of festivities, that everybody will be safe and that people will celebrate wisely.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last night we were briefed on a topic I had raised previously, symphysiotomy.  It is welcome that there are to be statements on the subject in the D&aacute;il this morning.  However, I reiterate my call to the Leader that we do likewise and hold a debate on these absolutely barbaric procedures carried out on women.  There are approximately 150 known survivors.  As time is against them, we must solve the problem now.  Up to 15 people died before their cases were settled.  As I have said previously, symphysiotomy was a barbaric act performed on women in childbirth.  What is shocking is that many of them did not even know the procedure had been carried out until years later after the broadcast of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme.  Last night one woman described how she had watched the programme on television and realised it had had happened to her.  It was the reason she was unable to walk and had no control over her body.  It is horrendous that the women concerned have not received justice to date.  I call on the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate on the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I read with disappointment the report that we were dropping down the leader table of university rankings.  God knows, it is not that the heads of departments, professors, presidents and so forth are not being paid enough.  They are among the best paid, if not the best paid, university professors and presidents in the world.  However, we are not getting the return.  There is no point in throwing money at the problem.  It would not be a bad idea to haul some of the people concerned in here and make them account for themselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I read with dismay a report in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> that a child in Virginia, County Cavan, who suffers from cerebral palsy, still had not been accommodated in school with the special dog that assists his mobility both at school and at home.  The board of management of the school has refused access to the school for the dog.  That is horrendous.</P>

I ask my Fine Gael colleagues to personally ask the Taoiseach to respect his party members in the Seanad by coming to address the House which is part of the Oireachtas under the 1937 Constitution.  It diminishes the status of this Chamber that the leader of the Government has not come here.  To be honest, if we were in government, we would insist on the Taoiseach coming to the House and different Taoisigh did come here on many occasions.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I spoke about the speech made by Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful woman ever in American politics, in which she spoke about <i>e pluribus unum</i>.

I hope our Ministers will enjoy a successful few days abroad as they promote business and tourism in this country.  Yesterday, a significant initiative which is linked to that was launched by the Taoiseach next door.  I refer to the Ireland Reaching Out initiative, which was founded in 2010 by a fellow Galwegian, Mr. Mike Feerick, who is a businessman.  Under this initiative, local volunteers can use information and communications technology to trace the descendants of individuals who emigrated from their parishes in years gone by.  These people are then contacted and invited to visit and become part of the local community.  Some 2,500 parishes have signed up for the initiative to date.  The potential benefits of this initiative are significant, given that this country has a potential Diaspora of approximately 70 million throughout the world.  I ask all Members of the House to work within their own local parishes to support this initiative, which dovetails nicely with a Government initiative &mdash; the Gathering &mdash; which is planned for 2013.  I hope both initiatives will bring significant economic benefits to this country in the next few years, while linking the people at home with the Diaspora throughout the world.  I ask the Leader to encourage all Members of the House to support the initiative that was launched yesterday.  I hope we will see the benefits of it in 2012 and subsequent years.</P>

I do not blame the Leader, who is representing this House abroad during St. Patrick&rsquo;s week, for it.  I do not blame the Government Chief Whip for it either.  Since I was elected to this House, I have noted an attitude among Ministers of this Government and previous Governments who do not seem to believe the Seanad really counts.  We are treated as second-class Members of the Oireachtas, even though we are not.  We are here by constitutional right.  I want the Deputy Leader to write to the Taoiseach and his Ministers to inform them that we will not accept being treated as second-class Members of the Oireachtas.  On 15 December last, some 27 employees of Lagan Brick in Kingscourt, County Cavan, were told by management that the company was no longer viable and would close with immediate effect.  The employees have picketed the plant since then in an effort to ensure they get their entitlements.  Talks with the Labour Relations Commission collapsed earlier this year.  The company has refused to take this matter to the Labour Court.  Will the Deputy Leader invite the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to the House in order that we can discuss this matter?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry for getting here late.  I would like to add my thoughts to those which have been expressed already about the need for Senators to be given an opportunity in the near future to discuss the strategy for higher education with the Minister for Education and Skills.  Such a debate is necessary in light of this morning&rsquo;s disappointing news that there has been a further attrition in the academic rankings of leading Irish universities.  We reached a high water mark in this regard as recently as two years ago when two of our institutions were ranked in the world&rsquo;s top 100, with one of them being in the top 50.  We now have none in the top 100.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Rather than putting our hands in the air and bleating for more resources &mdash; I accept that additional resources are needed &mdash; we should apply some intelligent thinking to this problem, like all others.  We need to identify what the problems are and decide how best they might be tackled.  This will require people to suspend some of the values that are sometimes disproportionately emphasised at election time.  People need to understand that the problem in this country is not a shortage of universities.  We are clearly seeing that the universities we have are &mdash; for whatever reason &mdash; under-resourced, sub-critically sized and staffed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is generally felt that the reason for the drop in our universities&rsquo; status this year was the loss from this country of some of its most productive researchers.  I refer to those who were producing the greatest numbers of papers, manuscripts and reports, getting the highest numbers of international peer reviewed grants and securing the greatest status from international research sponsoring organisations.  When a university loses people like that, it loses real metrics like the impact factors of the journals and the citation indexes of the papers that are published, etc.  This has a knock-on effect throughout the whole system.  If an institution is perceived as not being a quality institution, it will have more trouble attracting top quality international funding, faculty and students.  These days, students are much more mobile.  Some people who are seeking an education in Ireland preferentially may decide to go elsewhere if the university in which they are giving consideration to studying engineering, medicine or law is not considered to have a high international ranking.  We need to get the Minister to come in to have a chat with us about this matter.  This is one of the classic issues for which the Seanad was designed.  There is an opportunity to bring in people who have a different skill set from that of full-time politicians.  I am not disparaging such people.  Six Members of this House are designated to be here because they have been elected by university constituencies.  I accept there is a democratic deficit in the way those seats are derived.  If our presence is to mean anything, it should give us an opportunity to have a serious discussion on a strategy for the development of the third level sector and to try to take remedial steps.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I will give an example of what I am talking about.  This country has six medical schools, which, <i>per capita</i>, is approximately two and a half times the number in the US and one and a half times the European average.  We recently discovered data that show there are just 60 consultant-level full-time academics across the six medical schools &mdash; an average of ten per school.  Harvard Medical School has 1,500, which tells us something.  We may need to have a serious think about the number of institutions we have here.  Without advocating closing any down, we need to forge very definite strategic alliances between those institutions here to reach a critical mass of expertise unimpeded by institutional chauvinism.  I join my colleagues in asking the Minister to come to the House to give us an opportunity to discuss these issues.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I will only be responding to colleagues who are still in the House or who have given me their apologies for leaving, in keeping with the Leader&rsquo;s policy.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n ceisteanna inniu.  The first and perhaps most pressing issue, which was raised by Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, Diarmuid Wilson, Mary White and others, is that of the suspension of the House yesterday and the deferral of Private Members&rsquo; business until next week.  I absolutely share the view of all speakers who raised this issue on both sides of the House.  As Senator Wilson said, it was unacceptable and deeply regrettable.</P><P Just="Left">T&aacute; a l&aacute;n ceisteanna inniu.  The first and perhaps most pressing issue, which was raised by Senators Darragh O'Brien, Diarmuid Wilson, Mary White and others, is that of the suspension of the House yesterday and the deferral of Private Members' business until next week.  I absolutely share the view of all speakers who raised this issue on both sides of the House.  As Senator Wilson said, it was unacceptable and deeply regrettable.  I am very concerned to make sure it will not happen again.  I had already talked to Senator Paul Coghlan about sending a letter to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste expressing our concern in the strongest possible terms that this would not happen again and that we would always have a Minister available for Private Members' business.  It was asked whether it was necessary to have a Minister present.  It is necessary for Private Members' business.  We had initiated reforms in this House.  We had an excellent three and a half hour debate yesterday on the fiscal compact, with a large number of speakers from both sides, but with no Minister present.  We can do that for other debates but certainly not in Private Members' time.  It was unacceptable and I do not want to see it happen again.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I should say no blame attaches to the Seanad Leader&rsquo;s office, which made every effort to ensure a Minister would be here, which I know colleagues will appreciate.  Clearly, it is more difficult when Ministers are away.  This was a wide-ranging motion which covered a number of areas of responsibility for Ministers.  Article 28 of the Constitution makes it clear that the constitutional duty of the Government is to the D&aacute;il, although I do not say any of that by way of excusing what happened yesterday.  I am very concerned to ensure it will not happen again.  I give a commitment to Members that that letter will be going today to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste expressing our concern at what happened yesterday and the availability of Ministers.  Members can take it the matter will be taken up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On other issues, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien raised the issue of the comments of the Governor of the Central Bank.   I said yesterday I would send a letter to the Taoiseach expressing the concern of the House at the delay in taking action on mortgage arrears, and that letter is in hand.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Paul Coghlan also raised the issue of the comments of the Governor of the Central Bank.  It would be helpful to have a debate.  There is a debate scheduled for 28 March on housing and the fallout from the Governor&rsquo;s comments about buy-to-let mortgages in particular is one issue we might discuss at that time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Leyden raised the issue of the household charge.  Again, that issue can be dealt with in the debate on 28 March.  There is a case before the courts on the issue of legislation in the Irish language.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Barrett raised the issue of the promissory notes and yesterday&rsquo;s finance committee meeting.  We all accept this was a particularly expensive means by which to finance Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The Government was left with this situation and, as Senator Barrett said, we all very much support the ongoing negotiations to try to ensure change to the current obligation to pay the &euro;3.1 billion by the end of March.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Barrett also raised the issue of university rankings, as did other Senators.  As with the ratings agencies, there is a lot of controversy about how the rankings are carried out.  Senator Barrett has pointed out there are other means of ranking according to citations and so on.  Therefore, we approach university rankings with caution but, at the same time, all of us, particularly those of us involved in university education, are very sorry to see all our academic institutions dropping out of the top 100.  I have made a note in regard to a specific debate on the university sector and higher education more generally, which would be helpful.  Senator Keane also raised the issue of the rankings and referred to funding following performance.  The RAE model in Britain has also been contentious.  We can discuss how this can best be done but it is a difficult issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned the household charge and the issue of simultaneous translation of legislation into Irish, which has been discussed previously in the House.  As I said, it is a matter before the High Court.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Colm Burke raised the role of the Seanad in scrutinising EU legislation.  The Leader has taken up this issue, as the Senator will know.  I accept we need to explore the issue.  The Senator also raised the issue of third level colleges.  With respect, I am not sure I agree with his point that law faculties are producing too many graduates and should adapt to the market, which is what I understood him to say.  Universities cannot anticipate cycles in the market, nor should they.  Those law students who are going through law degree programmes may find that by the time they graduate, particularly if they undergo postgraduate or professional training, the market has changed completely.  Universities should not be so tied to the market, nor should university education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn spoke about the need for a debate on tourism, a view I share.  I have made a note of this and will look for the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to come to the House to debate the issue.  It is very heartening to see visitor numbers up.  Senator Moran referred to the increase in visitors for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, which is very welcome.  We also saw a rise in the number of tourists coming to Ireland last year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Moran also sought a debate on the issue of symphysiotomy.  I have made a note of this and believe it would be a useful and valuable debate to have in this House, particularly as a debate is happening in the D&aacute;il today.  I agree with the Senator in her comments on this barbaric practice that was carried out on so many women in Irish hospitals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Conway spoke about the child with cerebral palsy.  With respect, I agree with the Leader that this is a matter for the Adjournment.  It is very serious matter and I am&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful to the Senator for giving me some of the material, which I will read.  I am very concerned to hear about this.  However, if there is an issue with a particular school, it would be more appropriate to raise it on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator White mentioned Ms Nancy Pelosi.  As I did not get my photo taken with her, I am very envious of the Senator who is correct that we should perhaps be more proactive in inviting people in.  If we know somebody like Nancy Pelosi will be here, we could invite the person as a distinguished speaker to the Seanad.  I understand we learned of her visit too late to do that but we should keep an eye on this in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Mullins&rsquo;s welcome for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s launch of the Ireland Reaching Out initiative.  I have responded to Senator Wilson on the issue of Ministers&rsquo; attendance.  On the issue of the plant in County Cavan, as the Cathaoirleach said, that is more a matter for the Adjournment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Brennan raised the issue of a welcome for the extension of the short-stay visa waiver programme by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, which is quite right.  We can debate this issue, more generally, in the context of a debate on tourism.  The issue of the Dundalk office is clearly more a matter for the Adjournment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Crown also referred to the university rankings and the issue of amalgamation or possible strategic alliances.  This is something the HEA is working on and has in hand.  The Senator is right that it needs to be looked at in the context of university rankings as it clearly has a bearing on our placing in the rankings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish all Senators a happy St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  As we will be having debates on the Finance Bill on Wednesday and Thursday of next week, we will have the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, in the House on those days.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome back to the House the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  Before we commence, I remind Members that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment, who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.  On Report Stage each amendment must be seconded.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 21, line 18, to delete &ldquo;Part after Part VIII&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Parts after Part VIII&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire ar ais go dt&iacute; an Teach.  &Oacute;c&aacute;id stairi&uacute;il &iacute; seo mar seo &iacute; an chuid deireanach den reachta&iacute;ocht, An Bille Toghch&aacute;in (Leas&uacute;) (Maoini&uacute;) Polait&iacute;ochta) sula dt&eacute;ann s&eacute; go dt&iacute; an D&aacute;il.  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla rud gur mhaith liom a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id an tSeanaid agus an Aire maidir le athruithe at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh ar Ch&eacute;im na Tuarasc&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 have been grouped together.  The Minister probably considers me to be a broken record on the issue of the infamous leader&rsquo;s allowance, but as a Senator, I feel highly exposed to the short-termism of the media and fellow parliamentarians.  It is important that Independent Senators have what is called the leader&rsquo;s allowance to enable them to carry out their work in an appropriate way, particularly in being able to use research facilities to the benefit of the House and their activities.  The amendments are about this and establishing responsibility for elected Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann who are not members of a qualifying political party or are independent of a political party.  However, they also apply to the circumstances of the members of my grouping who are nominated Members.</P>
        <P>There was a big kerfuffle in this regard.  I understand the Minister has stated it comes within the jurisdiction of his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to introduce such a measure under the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2001.  However, regardless of whether he wishes to call it on an optical level or simply a pragmatic level, the Minister has an opportunity to close the gap now, rather than waiting.  I do not believe an amendment to the aforementioned Act is on an A list, a B list, a C list or a critical list of proposed legislation.  Consequently, the likelihood of such a Bill being introduced to the Houses of the Oireachtas within the next 18 months is minimal.  The members of my grouping have, therefore, taken the opportunity to introduce these amendments to the Bill to close the gap.  They would place an onus on Independent Members to keep accounts of public payments received and provide for a need to disclose such payments in compliance with the guidelines as set out in section 89.</P>

	<P>The new Part X is an attempt to address this issue.  When one considers what the leader&rsquo;s allowance is for, there are aspects of it which could be perceived to be open to misappropriation.  In that context, certain elements within the media are only dying to jump down our necks in respect of expenses.  Members and the House will be left open to accusations of being of ill repute if we do not close this loophole.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We tried to raise this matter on Committee Stage.  Other members of the Independent group and I have been consistent in respect of it from the outset.  It is ironic that Fine Gael and the Labour Party voted down our Committee Stage amendment &mdash; which is slightly different from that before the House today &mdash; without offering their own solution.  I am seeking to discover whether the Minister might be able to accommodate the spirit of amendments Nos. 1 and 3 rather than kicking to touch and stating that the matter will be contemplated in the Bill being brought forward by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I remind everyone present that between 25 February 2011 and 31 December 2011 a total of &euro;656,134 was paid to Deputies and Senators who are not members of political parties, who are not qualifying parties or who were nominated to the Seanad.  I include myself in this regard.  The money to which I refer is unaccounted for because there is no mechanism by which it can be vouched.  In addition, there are no rules under which I am supposed to account for my leader&rsquo;s allowance.  However, I account for it on a voluntary basis.  As amendment No. 3 suggests, all Independent Members should be required, on a statutory basis, to keep accounts in respect of public payments received and to &ldquo;disclose annual accounts in compliance with guidelines as set out under section 89&rdquo;.  It also states that &ldquo;All accounts will be published and available to the public within 6 months of the end of the previous financial year&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The amendment further advocates that the Standards in Public Office Commission could establish the guidelines in question.  I accept that these might not have to be as onerous as those which relate to political parties, particularly in the context of the requirement to keep audited accounts, etc.  However, they would ensure that there would be a way in which we, as Members, would not be exposed to expressions of cynicism.  Even more important is the fact that they would make it possible for the public to see, in a very clear way, how our money is spent.  I have no difficulty with Independent Senators and Deputies having access to the leader&rsquo;s allowance, particularly as they can use it to the benefit of citizens by ensuring that they research matters of concern in full and then make positive and democratic contributions in respect of them in Seanad and D&aacute;il debates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In its final report, the Moriarty tribunal stated &ldquo;Appropriate measures should be adopted to ensure that equivalent obligations apply to Independent or non-party candidates&rdquo;.  In such circumstances, I see no reason amendment No. 3 should not be accepted.  I would, however, be happy to withdraw the amendment if the Minister were to offer an alternative or to accept it in spirit.  I would not be happy to withdraw it if he proposes to kick to touch and wait until the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform brings forward his legislation in 18 months.  Outside of the financial exposure involved, this matter also gives rise to reputational exposure.  When the silly season comes back around, Members are going to be attacked in respect of not ensuring that the money involved is properly vouched.  It should be vouched.</P>
        <P>The findings of the Moriarty tribunal provided the impetus for this otherwise excellent Bill to be brought before the Houses.  Since Second Stage, we have been consistent in our argument that Independent Members&rsquo; allowances should be fully vouched and that the relevant details in this regard should be put before the Houses within six months of the end of each financial year.  I commend the amendments to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the amendment.  The members of the Independent group feel extremely strongly about amendments Nos. 1 and 3.  I will not reiterate what my colleague, Senator Mac Conghail, said but I must point out that there are no guidelines for Independent Members.  The guidelines we follow are the same as those which apply to political parties.  We are, therefore, interpreting those guidelines as existing for us.  We only obtained said guidelines on request.  &ldquo;Accountability&rdquo; and &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; are the buzz words which are in vogue.  In that context, we are of the view that Independent Members should be dealt with under the Bill, which relates to political funding.  Thus, it is our view that it is the appropriate place in which to indicate how Independent Members should be treated.  That is why we put forward the amendment.  In the aftermath of the amendment we put forward on Committee Stage not being accepted, we have tried to ensure that amendment No. 3 is now in line with what it is hoped to achieve via the Bill.</P>
        <P>We ask our colleagues in the House to support amendment No. 3.  As Senator Mac Conghail stated, we will push the matter to a vote unless the Minister can provide some assurances to the effect that this matter will be dealt with in another way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  We tabled this amendment as a group.  We have come under fire from the public and we are strongly of the view that our allowances should be vouched.  I do not see why we should have come under fire in respect of this matter.  As stated on Committee Stage, I returned quite a large portion of my allowance to the Minister for Finance.  It is slightly unusual that I was obliged to gift the money back, in the form of a cheque, to him.  Surely there is a better way of doing it but that is a matter for another day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 3 is designed to ensure that the Standards in Public Office Commission will have a remit in respect of public moneys.  Perhaps the rules which might be applied to us need not be the equivalent of those which obtain in respect of political parties but there is certainly a need for disclosure and accountability because public money is at issue.  That is what the public expects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank our Independent colleagues for tabling the amendments.  As this is a Seanad Bill, we must complete our consideration of it today and it will then be sent to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for its consideration.  It is often the case that Bills are thoroughly debated in the Seanad and that some of the proposals made in respect of them are not accepted here.  It then transpires that further proposals may be accepted when such Bills are dealt with in the D&aacute;il.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s reply but our colleagues on the Independent benches should realise that the Bill has a long way to travel yet.  In that context, it could be amended in the D&aacute;il and then sent back to the Seanad in a few months&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome what Senators Mac Conghail and van Turnhout said.  The leader&rsquo;s allowance, or whatever we wish to call it, has been the subject of much political debate in recent months.  There is also a debate taking place in respect of government in general &mdash; be it national or local &mdash; and of political reform.  That debate seems to centre on whether government should be bigger or smaller.  I am of the view that it should focus on better government.  We should not concentrate on what should be the number of councillors, Senators or Deputies; rather, we should focus on the quality of the work being done.  Part of the necessary change in this regard requires that there be maximum transparency and accountability.  I accept that the latter two terms have become clich&eacute;s but what is proposed here would make for better politics and would lead to fewer questions being asked in respect of where the money goes.  It would also place greater demands on every Member of this House and the Lower House in the context of accounting for his or her use of taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
        <P>We should not be asking how much it costs to run politics.  Our focus should be on how the money involved is spent.  Democracy does not come free of charge.  We could engage in an endless debate on the funding of politics.  Regardless of how it is funded, however, our prime responsibility politically must be to ensure that the money is properly spent and accounted for.</P>
        <P>As already stated, I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply and it should be remembered that the D&aacute;il may return the Bill to this House with amendments.  I ask him to reflect on the contents of amendment No. 3, particularly as what is envisaged could be of assistance in allowing members of the public to see what is happening to their money.  That could only be good for politics.  It is difficult to argue against transparency or to oppose accountability.  I accept that there can be small legal loopholes and that problems can arise.  In that context, the Minister requires the maximum of time and space.  If this cannot be afforded to him today, there will be further opportunities for it to be afforded to him on Second, Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  We will see what the Minister has to say.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I applaud the sentiment behind these amendments but personally I believe there is a certain level of political naivety behind them.  The Mahon tribunal report was quoted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It was the Moriarty tribunal report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senators for the correction.  The Moriarty tribunal report was referred to and there was an argument that there should be equality.  There is no equality and everybody knows this.  That is deliberate, structured and built in by the parties since the beginning of the State in order to exclude independent voices.  Part of that arises from financial considerations, and the Minister knows that perfectly well.  The Minister may want equality and he should reply to this directly if possible.  People who are full-time Independent Members of this or the other House should have some mechanism whereby at least some of the expenses incurred in re-election can be discountable for income tax purposes, as they are a professional expense.  A dentist, lawyer, doctor or tradesman can do this, and we are the only people who cannot use expenses that way.  Where is the equality and level playing field there?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe I give value for money but I do not know if the people think so.  I certainly put in the hours and I work 12 to 16 hours every day.  I am the person who got this place opened up on Saturdays and that practice stopped because I was virtually the only person to use it.  As I do not have access to my office on Saturday as a result, I work on Seanad and related business, including legislation, at home.</P>
        <P>I do not welcome this added responsibility.  I am not an accountant and it would be a considerable imposition on me to have to produce audited accounts.  Details of the money dispersed to us is accessible to everybody under the Freedom of Information Act.  I accept the point about the leader&rsquo;s allowance, which is part of a cluster of allowances.  I remember when they were introduced, and they were a subterfuge by the then Minister for Finance.  As a political stunt the Government decided to refuse to take a series of pay increases granted generally throughout the public service and the Government thought it would look good if it did not take the increase.  They were implemented through the back door.  I prefer openness and honesty but I want to be paid a proper sum for the job, and although it is not easy, I give my full energy to it.  Do people believe the public will be satisfied by this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not.  The public gets the information via the media and I will tell a story about how that operates.  I was contacted by a person in one of the tabloids approximately two years ago and although I do not usually speak with such people, it was suggested to me that this was a good idea.  The person claimed to be a student of mine and a big fan but just wanted to ask a few simple questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should stick to the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is directly relevant.  The person in question asked about the expenses.  He asked if I lived on North Great George&rsquo;s Street and even I had the intelligence to answer that straight off.  He asked if I worked in Leinster House and I said the questions were getting easier all the time and if I got a third one right, would I get to keep the sweets?  The third question was how I could justify claiming &euro;6,000 in travelling expenses the previous year.  I asked the journalist how he would justify it and he told me he could not.  I said that I could not do so either and that the journalist was referring to the <i>per diem</i> allowance.  Not only that but I was the 59th of 60 Senators on the expenses list, with the only person claiming less being my colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn, who had just sold a supermarket empire.  The headline detailing how politicians had their snouts in the trough had a photograph of me and indicated I got &euro;6,000 in expenses.  Every element of the story was true but when they were put together it was for the purpose of a toxic lie.  Anybody who believes being open, honest and answering questions will completely resolve the problem is living in cloud cuckoo-land.  I know that from a series of experiences, of which that is one.</P>
        <P>The Independents should get support and we should be accountable.  Every penny we get is recorded.  I have said before that I go for unvouched expenses because I live an extremely busy life and although I am a hoarder and keep every scrap, I find it very difficult sometimes to find receipts, etc., or remember what has gone on.  This would be fine if I could be provided with an accountant and I could be relieved of this duty.  I do not want to be bothered by this obligation because I want to deal with the ideas that have me here in Parliament.  I should not have to be an office boy checking receipts and keeping lists.  I would go ahead with this if I had an accountant but not otherwise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators should not think the media will be impressed by this as it will not.  The media are between us and the people, and they can often argue that politicians are corrupt, on the take or liars.  I hear that every single day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I put up my hand to speak when the Senator stated that this side of the House voted against this amendment, which we did.  As it stands, the amendment is flawed but the spirit behind it is good.  Openness and transparency is very valuable in politics but we are not going to fix an entire system with this Bill.  I agree with the spirit nonetheless.</P>
        <P>We are all Senators and our category &mdash; in a party or Independent &mdash; is secondary.  Independent Senators are governed and their expenses are as open as mine would be, except for the leader&rsquo;s allowance.  We all have an allowance that can go to certain areas.  The Independents&rsquo; leader&rsquo;s allowance is different from the Senator&rsquo;s allowance but we are dealing with a Bill that comes under the auspices of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should compliment the Minister on a very far-reaching Bill but I will not mention the gender issue today because it is not relevant to the amendment.  It is an historic day.  This amendment may be under the wrong Department; as I stated the last day, the expenses of Members are not dealt with by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but the issue should be examined in a different sphere.</P>
        <P>Keeping accounts is difficult and I would prefer if we got no expenses but had a proper salary for the job.  Politics is getting a very bad name and although we are looking for women to get into politics, they will refuse to do so if there is such a bad name connected with expenses.  Why not pay Senators and Deputies a decent salary and let them pay their own expenses and travel costs?  They would be the same as everybody else.  That is what I would like to see but it is not within the brief of this Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like the Minister to take the issue to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, in order that we can have a debate in the proper place.  I hope the issue comes back to the Chamber.  I will only agree with the amendment if the Minister believes it appropriate to come in under his Department.  I have sympathy with Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments and the way politics is funded currently is giving politicians a bad name.  I do not like having to keep accounts and I would like to concentrate on the business of politics.</P>
        <P>I am here on a full-time basis and have given up my previous work, as Senator Norris did.  People very often write not about what is given up for politics but what a person takes from the job.  We should all try to ensure politics gains a good name and we should put in the required hours.  I am fully in favour of openness, accountability and transparency.  The requirement to return money to the State does not only apply to Independents but also members of parties.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I commend Senators Mac Conghail and van Turnhout for the amendment, for which they should be applauded.  It is appropriate that Independent Members should be paid an appropriate allowance for the reasons outlined by Senator Norris.  To safeguard the allowance it should be accounted for and transparent.  Political parties obtain funding from the State, that is, the taxpayer, and must account for it.  It is only right, therefore, that Independent Members should account for allowances provided for them.  For this reason, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party will support the amendment should it be pressed by Independent Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Having followed earlier contributions on the monitor, there is nothing to be feared from this welcome amendment and the Bill is appropriate legislation in which to insert it.  Vouching expenses and recording legitimate expenditure is perfectly correct.  I was one of 12 Members of the previous D&aacute;il who was subject to an audit by Mazars.  I ask the Minister to examine the costs incurred by the State as a result of the audit.</P>
        <P>On allowances for Independents, while most of us are not accountants, it is not a big deal to retain and publish invoices for legitimate expenditure.  I would not have any issue with such a requirement.  My party was the first to publish detailed accounts this year.  This is a step which all parties should take.</P>

        <P>That the Independent Senators tabled the amendment demonstrates that they consider it necessary to introduce the proposed change.  The issue of expenses is cannon fodder for the media should they wish to spin matters in a certain way.  This then feeds into public perceptions.  The Oireachtas should avail of all opportunities to make changes of this nature.  There is nothing to be feared from vouching public expenses and my party will support the amendment.</P>
        <P>Senator Keane referred to openness, transparency and accountability, a phrase the Fine Gael Party used while in power previously.  She now has an opportunity to vote for these qualities and I assume she will support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the comments made about the presence of the Minister.  It is always a pleasure to welcome him to the House.  Long may his visits continue.  I must declare a slight personal interest.  My late father, Joe Mooney, was a Member of the Seanad for a short while.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are trespassing again on other matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Leas-Chathaoirleach bears with me, I will get to the point.  My late father was an Independent councillor for some 20 years, most of which were during my growing period.  I can remember him fighting elections as an Independent and coming up against the considerable resources political parties bring to bear when fighting elections.  I have a great deal of empathy with Independent candidates given the financial burdens placed on them when contesting a Seanad, D&aacute;il or council election.  This burden increases considerably when they are elected.</P>
        <P>I am interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s views on the amendment.  As matters stand, the transparency and accountability sought in the amendment will not apply to current allowances.  In one sense, I can understand the reluctance to go down this road.  The allowance is currently granted to Independent Members and used, I presume, to enable them to compete with party representatives in getting a message across, influencing the flow of information and for the other activities associated with being an elected Member of Parliament.</P>
        <P>While I support the amendment, I have a small but nagging doubt about opening up this particular avenue of discussion.  On the one hand, we are all conscious of the media which are constantly looking for any opportunity to call politics and the political class to account and sell newspapers.  The latter objective is the priority in many cases and is often cloaked in an argument about the public interest.  My immediate reaction when I received a freedom of information request on the usage of printer cartridges was to ask how much further the media would go and if they would ask us to account for paper clips.  As we have discovered since, the journalist in question knew a little more than the rest of us when he submitted the request.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am curious to learn the Minister&rsquo;s views about the<i> status quo</i>.  It is important that the allowance continues to be paid, which will be the case under the legislation.  When the media get on a particular hobby-horse and apply pressure, as they have done during many Governments, the political class often responds in a knee-jerk fashion.  If such pressure is applied in this case and the allowance comes under threat, it would not be in the best interests of or serve well the parliamentary and democratic process.</P>
        <P>The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but a cursory reading of the information on allowances given to political parties indicates they are subject to specific guidelines.  Do these guidelines apply across the board, including to allowances to Independent Members?  It would be unfair if that were the case because one cannot compare an Independent Member with a party, which is an institution.  I am curious to learn if the guidelines relating to spending the allowances, which appear restrictive, apply also to Independent Members.  They should be applied in a more liberal manner to Independent allowances.  That is an argument for another day, however.</P>
        <P>Overall, there is no reason the Government should object to an initiative from Independents that seeks greater accountability for Independent Members.  Addressing the reasons the allowance should be stopped could head off further attacks on the allowance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt></TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 in the name of Senator Mac Conghail and others deal with the same related matter.  Amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment to facilitate the insertion of the new Part X into the Electoral Act 1997, which is then provided for in amendment No. 3.  A new Part X is proposed for insertion into the 1997 Act after the new Part IX, which section 27 of the Bill is inserting to provide for the disclosure of accounts by political parties.  The purpose of the amendment is to require that Independent Members of the Oireachtas keep accounts for all payments other than the salary they receive arising out of the public execution of their duties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with the broad principle that has been expressed.  The issue was raised by Senators Mac Conghail, van Turnhout and others on Committee Stage.  I agree with the concept of bringing greater transparency and accountability to payments made to Independent Members of the Houses, but I cannot deal with a perception in this respect, much and all as Senator Mac Conghail indicates that there is a perception about this, in that the position must be legally sound.  The Report Stage amendment he submitted does not refer to the appropriate Bill, and penalties for non-compliance were not included as part of the amendment.  I have no difficulty about the spirit of what the Senator is seeking to do.  These matters will be addressed and the Senator will not have to wait too long for that.  Arrangements in respect of the payment of the party leader&rsquo;s allowance are made under different legislation, namely, the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2001.  While I acknowledge it shows some ingenuity to bring this forward through this methodology, I assure Members that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is contemplating changes in the very near future.  I expect that proposals will be passed to the Government in a matter of weeks regarding new arrangements in the spirit of what Senator Mac Conghail is seeking to enshrine in this legislation.</P>

Party leaders' allowances in respect of political parties are already audited.  It does not happen in regard to Independent Senators or Deputies.  It is an issue that has rightly been examined.  I assure Senators that it is a matter that is receiving active consideration by the Minster, Deputy Howlin, and the contributions regarding the matter made in the House have been brought to his attention.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Okay.  I thank the Minister for his explanation.  I wish to be clear on this issue, having regard in particular to what Senator Norris said.  There is nothing naive about what I am proposing.  I am not responding in any way to the media but to my responsibility as a parliamentarian who is being given taxpayers' money and being accountable for that.  I could decide not to take the money but it is important the party leader&rsquo;s allowance is available to parliamentarians to execute their work and conduct their duties.  If I am to accept that, as Senator Keane said, I must also accept the fact that I have to be accountable for it, to keep receipts and to make those public.  It is not too onerous a task for anybody in that position.  In my role as director of the Abbey Theatre, I am accountable and answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts for all my expenditure.  I have to keep receipts in respect of my role there.  That is a pattern or habit one gets into in the same way as one gets up in the morning or hits the snooze button on the clock radio.  This is an important matter.  I am not doing this for the sake of optics.  I am not doing it to satisfy some media&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>The perception is a legitimate one because there is a gap in the legislation, which we have raised.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the spirit in which I put forward this amendment.  Senator Keane also mentioned the spirit of it in a teacherly way, but I know she was not too critical of me and noted it was loosely worded or not appropriate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is about joined-up thinking and having joined-up government.  This is a highly appropriate way to work towards that.  I offered the Minister the option to reword the amendment but it should be included in the Bill and there is no reason it should not.  I genuinely do not feel naive, as Senator Norris said, in putting this forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has mentioned there are no penalties provided for in the amendment.  It would be up to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, to include them.  What I suggest, and I would be happy for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 22, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;85.&mdash;(1) There shall be immediate disclosure of all corporate and personal donations during a general election campaign.</P>
        <P LI="2">(2) This disclosure is to commence on the date of the formal dissolution of the D&aacute;il and to cease 6 months after the first sitting of the new D&aacute;il.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I formally congratulate the Minister on the overall tenor of the Bill and the amount of work that has been put into it.  His rigorous and robust engagement with us, all the way from Second Stage, has been a learning curve for me and a deeply educational one.  I have learned a great deal.  I am very supportive of all the revised caps on donations and the increased transparency and accountability.  However, one area that concerns me is the general election.  What I am concerned about is a transparency issue with regard to who is funding political parties and candidates during a general election and how that might influence how we might vote.  In addition, there is the issue of how it might influence certain decisions after the general election, or the perception - we are back to the concept of perception - of some decisions or appointments that might be made by future Ministers which might have a connection with the donations.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">We are accepting all the Minister&rsquo;s arguments, following Committee Stage, regarding the caps on donations and the procedure surrounding the transparency and disclosure of donations.  However, one area that requires additional discussion is the time of a general election.  Again, I will refer to the Moriarty tribunal report on donations.  These are not my words; I am invoking the Moriarty tribunal report because it provided the impetus, although I recognise that both the Labour Party and Fine Gael, in their own right, would have pushed this.  The final report of the Moriarty tribunal published in 2011 says that donations should, if possible, be disclosed in something approaching a real time framework, for example, on the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, website, rather than waiting for an annual disclosure report.  This is especially important during an election period, as is stated on page 13 of the final report.  It is important that as many donations as possible are disclosed during the period surrounding an election.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing from the Minister why what we are suggesting cannot happen.  What we mean by immediate disclosure is that the period could be 48 hours &mdash; we are not talking about instantaneous disclosure &mdash; but we could find a way of resolving that.  I will be happy to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view.  The disclosure is to commence on the date of the formal dissolution of the D&aacute;il and to cease six months after the first sitting of the new D&aacute;il.  The spirit of this amendment is to allow citizens to make a full and informed decision on how they might vote, in the knowledge of where the candidate, particularly the political party candidate, actually stands on particular issues and how they might support them.  That is the basis for proposing this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I formally second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Mac Conghail said, the immediate disclosure is something that would have to be examined, but I do not see any difficulty with that.  There is no threshold in the amendment either.  It could be helpful.  There could be a way whereby when donations or contributions are lodged into the person&rsquo;s separate political account, that information could be forwarded on.  I accept there would be administrative difficulty as well in calling for an immediate disclosure.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.  We will decide on the basis of that response whether we will support this amendment.</P>
        <P>Corporate donations are also mentioned in the amendment.  As the Minister knows, we have put forward legislation in the Lower House to ban all corporate donations.  The Government has taken the view that it would be unconstitutional but we do not agree.  One of the reasons we will oppose this Bill is that, while it goes a long way towards that objective, there is no complete abolition of corporate donations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is part of the Ard-Fheis motion on gender.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to hear the Minister was watching it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I read about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Good.  I am sure we will be reading a great deal about the forthcoming Fine Gael Ard-Fheis with interest.</P>
        <P>With regard to the gender motion, I do not believe it goes far enough.  That is an amendment Senator Mac Conghail&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why the Senator opposed it at the Ard-Fheis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is why some of our delegates did, and they were perfectly entitled to do so.  We run a democratic party.  It is one member, one vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Slightly democratic and slightly constitutional.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not in the big divvy-up way that Fine Gael uses, where it pays for its delegates to come to get the punter it wants on the tickets.  That is not the way it will be done in our party.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To clarify for the Minister, given that he showed such great interest in how some of our delegates voted, we are 100% in favour of greater female participation in electoral politics, but this Bill does not go far enough.  It only deals with general elections and does not deal with local authority or Seanad elections.  Most people will make their start in politics in a local authority election so the Minister should introduce the quotas at that stage.  There is also the fact that the Minister has not seen fit to ban corporate donations.  I will not mention the Moriarty tribunal report again as Senator Mac Conghail has outlined its view.  The Minister should just go ahead and ban them.  To allow for corporate donations in the Bill is not enough.  However, I am interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response to this amendment because I foresee a difficulty with the immediacy of disclosure of personal donations.  We will decide whether to support the amendment on the basis of his response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The amendment is similar to the one put forward on Committee Stage.  However, it is now proposed to insert it in a different part of the Bill.  The amendment seeks to introduce a provision for the disclosure of all donations once a general election is called.  It is proposed for inclusion in the new Part IX of the Electoral Act 1997, which is being inserted by section 27 of this Bill.  This new Part in the 1997 Act will provide for the preparation and publication of accounts by a political party.  It does not deal in any way with the reporting of political donations at a D&aacute;il general election.  Those provisions are set out in Part IV of the Electoral Act 1997 which is titled "Disclosure of Donations".  In addition, the amendment makes no provision for how donations would be declared, to which body they would be declared and what sanctions would apply.  These are some of the technical reasons for not accepting the amendment even though the spirit of what is proposed by the Senators is not a difficulty.  Practical issues arise.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I agree there must be more transparency about donations.  The current system is badly in need of reform and I have already indicated that this is high on the agenda of the Minister for Public Enterprise and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  However, in this legislation I have radically changed the thresholds and the donations that can be made, particularly in light of the constitutional issues.  Rather than wait for the constitutional issues to be resolved by referendum, we proceeded on the basis of doing what is legally sound.  Therefore, section 9 of the Bill provides for the lowering of the thresholds that must be declared to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  The threshold for disclosure by a political party is being reduced from &euro;5,078 to &euro;1,500 while the threshold for a Member of the Oireachtas, a Member of the European Parliament or a candidate in D&aacute;il, Seanad or European Parliament elections is reduced from &euro;634 to &euro;600.  There is a reduction in the threshold for donors other than companies, trade unions, societies or building societies in reporting donations to the SIPO from &euro;5,078 to &euro;1,500.  Aside from these reductions in the declaration thresholds, the maximum amounts that can be accepted as a donation by a political party or a candidate are being significantly reduced.  Corporate donations are also being substantially curtailed.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        
        <P Just="Left">The principle underpinning the amendment is that all donations of all sizes should be subject to &ldquo;immediate disclosure&rdquo;.  The proposal would have serious negative consequences for the practical operation of politics.  I do not believe in putting in place a system if it is not practically possible to implement it.  This amendment could unwittingly tie the administration of the political donations system up in knots to the extent that people would genuinely find themselves in difficulty without that having been intended.  I want candidates and political parties to be more accountable.  I do not believe the approach that is proposed is feasible.  I cannot imagine what public good would be served by reporting the name of every person who supports an election candidate by giving him or her a contribution of &euro;10 or &euro;20, or even by purchasing a &euro;2 raffle ticket.  That is what the effect of this amendment would be.</P>
        <P>The threshold that would apply under this proposal is very low.  Under this law, a poster in a shop window during an election campaign or sticker on a taxi could be regarded as a donation, and a corporate donation at that.  The onus would be placed on the candidate to send a form to &mdash; presumably &mdash; the Standards in Public Office Commission immediately, reporting the receipt of such support.  I do not think it is reasonable to require that every transaction be reported immediately, which is what the effect of this amendment would be.  I suggest that if it were accepted, the Standards in Public Office Commission and the individual candidate would become bogged down in administration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator referred to the recommendations of the Moriarty tribunal, to which the Government had regard in developing this legislation.  The provision in the Bill relating to the publication of political party accounts will address the Moriarty tribunal recommendation that all the income of political parties should be disclosed.  I am going beyond that by saying all the expenditure of political parties must also be opened to public scrutiny and reported.  The tribunal recommended that all political donations apart from those under a modest threshold should be disclosed.  The reductions I have outlined will address that issue in a substantial and significant way.</P>
        <P>The reduction in the thresholds is a significant measure in its own right.  It can be seen as part of a range of measures in the Bill that will have the cumulative effect of providing for a more open and transparent system of political funding and imposing a severe limitation on the scope for corporate influence on politics in Ireland.  The problems in the current system have been clear for many years.  This legislation will address the fact that too few donations fall within the net of disclosure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has been admonishing me slightly in his responses by referring to the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of the legislation and the &ldquo;technical&rdquo; side of it.  If this were a football match, the score would be &ldquo;technical 2, spirit 0&rdquo;.  Having said that, since the Second Stage debate we have been highlighting all the amendments we intended to table.  Our previous amendment was defeated.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind that this is not something we considered lightly before we brought it on board.  Having listened to the Minister&rsquo;s comments and responses, I have decided not to press this amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 26, line 31, to delete &ldquo;30 per cent&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;40 per cent&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">We outlined our position strongly during the previous Stages of this debate.  I will not reiterate all of the reasons we believe this legislation should be amended to provide for a gender threshold of 40%.  We welcome the Bill and support it fully.  In 2003, the committee of ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a resolution stating that the representation of women or men in any decision-making body in political or public life should not fall below 40%.  Therefore, it is disappointing that a level of 30% has been proposed.  According to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the figure in question should be at least 30% but preferably 35% or 40%.  We are asking why the introduction of a 40% level is being delayed.  If we wait for the natural electoral cycle to run its course &mdash; the Government may wish this Parliament to run for a full term &mdash; it could be more than ten years before we get to 40%.  The figure of 30% is the bare minimum that has been recommended.  It does nothing other than delay the inevitable.</P>
        <P>Women play a significant role in each of this country&rsquo;s political parties.  It is interesting to note that 42% of the members of the Minister&rsquo;s party &mdash; Fine Gael &mdash; are female.  His Government colleagues in the Labour Party have 37% female membership.  The relevant figures for Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in are 34% and 24%, respectively.  We have proposed this amendment because we believe it will take more than a decade for us to get to 40% &mdash; the level that is recommended in many reports &mdash; if we proceed in the manner provided for in this Bill as it stands.  We believe that now is the time to be introducing a 40% requirement.  We do not understand why it is being deferred.  On the basis of the figures from last year&rsquo;s general election, to move from 30% to 40%, in line with the Council of Europe recommendation, Fine Gael would have to find 24 more female candidates and the Labour Party would have to find 12 more female candidates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is no problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Exactly.  There are 2.25 million women to choose from.  I do not understand why there will be a delay in moving to 40%.  The Government can do it without a problem.  There are more than 2 million females in this country.  I do not believe the political parties cannot find the candidates to get us to 40%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to second this amendment, which arises from the Committee Stage debate.  We might have to wait until seven years after the next election.  It is very convoluted.  We think the Seanad should be brave and progressive.  I know many people have a difficulty with the setting of quotas in the first place.  We have accepted and put aside the problematic aspects of that.  It would be clear and progressive to set the target at 40%.  It is a question of equality.  I assume the Government will last for another four years, but the next one might not last as long.  Potentially, we might have to go through another three general elections before the 40% target is reached.  That is why I am seconding and supporting this amendment.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In keeping with what Senator Mac Conghail said, I am in favour of the spirit of the amendment but against it on a technical level.  I do not have a difficulty with the proposal to start at 30%.  That was recommended in the report that was produced by the Oireachtas joint committee in 2009.  That recommendation was based on the Belgian model, which involves starting with a target of one third.  Such a level would represent a doubling of the proportion of candidates who were women at the last election.  If it were achieved, it would mark significant progress in itself.</P>
        <P>Although I have no difficulty with keeping the 30% figure as a starting point, I would like to see change in another respect.  Would it be possible to reduce the timeframe within which the target will remain at 30% before increasing it to 40%?  If that cannot be done in this House, I ask the Minister if it could be done in the D&aacute;il.  The Bill as it stands specifies a starting point of 30% at the next general election, to increase to 40% seven years after the date of that election.  I would like the period within which the 40% target must be reached to be reduced somewhat.  If we were to provide for a five-year period, that would be more closely aligned to the election cycle.  That would give us a realistic chance of progressing to the 40% level that all Senators on this side of the House agree with.  While I do not have a difficulty with the proposal to start at 30%, I would like us to agree on a reduction in the time it will take us to get to the 40% target.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in agreement with the spirit of the amendment.  The legislation currently refers to &ldquo;at least 30 per cent&rdquo;.  I encourage all parties to ensure they reach a level of 40%.  They will not be prevented from having 40%.  They will need to have at least 30%.  I urge all parties to strive to achieve 40%.  If the Government established a committee to examine legislation and make recommendations, we would criticise it if it were to ignore those recommendations.  Senator Bacik mentioned that the committee she chaired recommended that a level of 30% be provided for.  I suppose that was the benchmark.  In the 1992 general election, 18.5% of all candidates were women.  That figure increased to 19.8% in 1997 before dropping to 18.1% in 2002.  It decreased further to 17.6% in 2007 and to 15.5% in 2011.  By ensuring 30% of candidates will be women, we will almost double the 2011 figure.  I recognise that everybody would like to see an equal number of men and women being selected, as the 50:50 by 2020 group which was set up to look at the issue of gender representation is aiming for, but we must walk before we can run.  This is a significant advancement in politics.  I was not totally in favour of having a quota system, but European-wide statistics have convinced me otherwise.  It is the way to go and I have sympathy for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party Members who voted against quotas at their Ard Fheis.  When everybody examines the European statistics, it is in our interests to go along with the political parties.  I also join Senator Ivana Bacik in asking the Minister to look at the length of term and reduce it to five years.</P>
        <P>As women cut their teeth in local politics, we should have another look at the local elections.  As this is not referred to in the amendment, I cannot dwell on the point.  However, it is important that women are chosen to contest winnable seats.  I ask the parties to ensure female candidates are not political fodder but chosen to contest winnable seats.  Let us look at the French experience &mdash; the parties knew that if female candidates did not contest seats, they would pay the penalty; therefore, female candidates had to contest seats that were not winnable.  The French used both methodologies.  I do not suppose any political party in Ireland would dream of doing this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Minister Ms Gemma Hussey is in the Visitors Gallery and I welcome her to the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I concur with Senator Ivana Bacik that we need to consider reducing the seven year period, as that would be of benefit.  We would like to see more women involved in politics.  In practical terms, as Senator C&aacute;it Keane said, if we start with a figure of at least 30% of candidates being women, it gives everybody involved in the political parties the chance to engage in a proper debate and to find women who are almost on the cusp of entering politics.  If we were to increase the figure to 40%, perhaps we might be looking for women who were not quite ready.  Given that confidence has been spotted as a problem, forcing people before they are ready to become involved may have a perverse effect and we might find the number falling back in subsequent elections.  I am very happy, therefore, with the starting figure of 30%, but I would like to see the period of seven years being reduced to five, as this would go a long way in the direction of the spirt of the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I like the idea of 40% of candidates being women, but Senator Ivana Bacik has come up with a very good compromise by suggesting we reduce the timescale within which we arrive at the 40% figure.  The real challenge for women, as Senator C&aacute;it Keane pointed out, is to have the female candidates who stand for election in the coming years elected.  We know how most of the party organisations are male dominated; therefore, it would be a very good idea if all parties agreed &mdash; even though this is not included in the legislation &mdash; that at least 30% of the candidates chosen to stand in the next local elections in 2014 would be female.  I know the Fine Gael Party intends to do this and hope all other parties will show good faith and agree voluntarily to do the same.  I would like to support the amendment tabled by Senators Fiach Mac Conghail and Jillian van Turnhout, but a figure of 30% is more realistic at this point.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to consider, as Senator Ivana Bacik requested, reducing the timescale within which the 40% figure will be reached.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the suggestion in respect of a figure of 30%.  It would be interesting to know the Minister&rsquo;s rationale for not increasing it to 40% or even 50%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As a practising politician of long standing, I can assure Members this will not be an easy target to achieve, even if it is supported by legislation.  There are various reasons which prevent the participation of women in politics, which do not apply to men.  In the Bill we have adopted an ambitious but also a pragmatic approach to double the level of female participation.  We must phrase it in such a way that women will make up at least 30% of candidates.  Political parties are very conscious of the fact that if they do not address this issue, they will lose the opportunity to gain support and there is nothing that concentrates the minds of political parties and their candidates more than receiving enhanced popular support by ensuring a balanced gender ticket.  If we do not incorporate this provision in legislation, we will have the same opportunities described by Senator C&aacute;it Keane in filling in the ballot paper.  With the forthcoming local elections due to take place in 2014, I imagine all political parties will be mindful of the fact that they will be heading into a general election in 2016 in which at least 30% of candidates will have to be women.  It is deemed this will be difficult, which is the reason we are introducing this provision.  The local elections will provide the opportunity for political parties to address the issue.</P>
        <P>Some 85% of candidates elected to the D&aacute;il have come through the local elections process.  It would be very foolhardy of any political party to ignore this fact, or not to make plans to ensure the provision that 30% of candidates be female will be adhered to.  In starting with a figure of 40% we would be setting the bar too high, as the last thing anybody wants to do is fail.  One would exert pressure on the system, but we would end up with tokenism.  If people come through the local elections system, they get a flavour of what is involved in politics and whether it would suit them.  That applies equally to male and female candidates.</P>
        <P>I am not going to change the stance I have taken on the basis that I am seeking to double the level of participation by women in politics in the next general election.  As it is linked with the funding of the political process through the votes cast in the general election, there will be a penalty for not doing so.  Some political parties may get around this provision by stating they will pay the penalty and will be happy to have their funding reduced by 50%, but I do not think political parties will be inclined to take this option.  However, some might wish to do so.</P>
        <P>I hope the spirit of what we are trying to achieve in an ambitious way is accepted.  I am delighted that Senator Jillian van Turnhout who talked about sunset clauses in order to ensure female representation and was against quotas during the Second Stage debate now wants to enhance the provision in order that there will be a ratio of 50:50.  I am delighted that we have converted her.</P>

	<P>The Minister referred to the local elections, on which I will comment during the debate on our next amendment.  He has made some valid points which underline the next amendment which we tabled.  In spite of the number of female Deputies rising slightly since 1997, the overall percentage of women standing in general elections is decreasing.  We must be more ambitious.  Previously we debated ways by which we could reduce the time period involved because it could take several elections to get to the figure of 40%.  Our group has the greatest difficulty with the fact that potentially it will take a considerable length of time for us to increase the level of representation from 30% to 40%, a point the Minister did not address.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am sorry I did not have an opportunity to address that issue.  The latest date by which the quota of 40% of candidates being women must be reached is 2020.  That is a reasonable period for political parties to prepare properly to reach in an ambitious and pragmatic way the participation level by both sexes we want to reach in elections.  For the next election the gender quota is 30% and for the subsequent election, 40%.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 27, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;29.&mdash;Section 17 of the Act of 1997 is amended by inserting the following subsection after subsection (4A) (inserted by section 50(<i>c</i>)(iv) of the Act of 2001):</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(4B) All political parties shall endeavour to reach the quota of at least 50 per cent men and 50 per cent women in local elections by 2019.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Our final amendment is about quotas in local elections.  This is the first time I have gone through a Bill and the Minister and I have been very intimate since Report Stage.  I listened to his comments on Second Stage and on Committee Stage regarding the fact that no sanctions that can be imposed regarding local elections.  We tabled a series of amendments on Committee Stage about the general election, Seanad elections and local government elections.  The Minister quite rightly pointed out that we could not look at any quota for Seanad elections because they are not within the remit of the Bill as political parties do not necessarily control the quotas or the candidates who go for election to the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was also a very good debate about local elections.  I am reminded of what Senator Keane said on Committee Stage.  The spirit of the discussion about local elections was that, while we cannot have sanctions, we should encourage, inspire and possibly blackmail, although not through sanctions.  We are proposing this amendment because there should be a quota at local elections.  The Bill does not require quotas to be applied at local level, as political experience is one of the most important criteria in the selection of candidates by political parties, but women make up only 16% of local councillors.  The application of quotas for local elections would seem, in my view, to be an appropriate way to tackle the barriers.  In our debate on amendment No. 4, the Minister was eloquent in saying we should start at a local level.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister is going to hit me on the head with a technical criticism of the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Exactly.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response on this because a Bill should inspire and encourage and be a guidance to us, as parliamentarians and as citizens, to make our political culture better and more equal, where men and women can participate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a non-binding and aspirational clause in the Bill which calls on all political parties to reach a quota.  I know Niamh Gallagher from the 5050 Group which is proposing equal representation by 2020, but our amendment proposes equal representation by 2019.  We are looking at encouraging political parties at a local level to fast-track this over two general elections.  This amendment does not propose any sanctions in the Bill, because that cannot happen, which I learned from the Minister on Committee Stage.  We are proposing that all political parties endeavour to reach the quota of at least 50%  men and 50%  women in local elections by 2019.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second this amendment.  We are missing an opportunity by not applying the gender quotas to local elections.  I agree fully with the 5050 Group and its contention that for quota legislation to be meaningful and to work, it must be extended to local government.  By failing to do that, we will run the risk of making the same mistake that was made in France, to which Senator Keane referred, where women who do not come from a political family are effectively excluded from entering local politics and thus gaining  political legitimacy within their constituency, which is often what is needed to succeed at a general election.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To be truly effective in the long term, quotas cannot be introduced in isolation.  New candidates should be given every opportunity to build up the skills and the experience that would allow them to achieve their full potential.  As the majority of Members in this House and the Minister himself began politics at a local level, they should be more than aware of the invaluable experience that can be derived from participating in local democracy before moving on to the national Legislature.  Excluding local government from gender quota legislation denies potential female candidates the experience and sense of political legitimacy that would protect new female candidates from any allegations of tokenism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendment we have put forward is non-binding.  It states &ldquo;shall endeavour&rdquo;, but it is an important principle that local elections are included in this Bill to set down a clear marker for the parties that they need to ensure that in the 2014 local elections and the subsequent 2019 elections, they will strive to increase female participation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with this amendment.  Why does the Bill not deal with local authority elections or Seanad elections?  Is the Government pre-empting the judgment of the people in the forthcoming Seanad referendum, meaning that the Seanad is not included in the Bill?  I caution the Minister on that issue as well, because the Government pre-empted the decision of the people before on the investigations referendum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Senator van Turnhout said, most of us began our careers at local authority level.  It is where most politicians who serve in the Oireachtas start their careers.   It would seem sensible to apply the gender balance quotas at a local authority level, as that is where most people start out.  It seems to be a glaring omission from the Bill.  I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views as to why it is not included.  Has he plans to address that matter?  Why are quotas for political parties in elections for Seanad &Eacute;ireann not mentioned in the Bill?</P>

She is still working with the various groups that have been set up to ensure that women are educated.  Much work remains to be done besides introducing quotas.  We must get to the bottom of the problem.  I will not make a Second Stage speech, but quotas are one thing and preparatory work by parties is also important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I proposed the use of quotas in local elections.  Unless a measure is mandatory and a fine can be imposed for non-compliance, political parties will not comply with the measure.  Before the local elections in 1991, in my innocence I wrote to every political party in my ward asking them not to put up posters.  I was thinking of reduce, re-use and recycle and thought we would come to a local agreement.  I have learned much since.  If you cannot beat them, you must join them.</P>

        <P>I would like to see this principle extended to local and European elections, as recommended by the 2009 report on women in politics by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  The difficulty is how to do that.  Where is the sanction?  As we saw in all the research done in other countries, a sanction on parties who do not comply with the target is critical.  That is the difficulty with local elections.  I hope parties will endeavour to reach quota targets in the local elections, in preparation for the targets which will be enforceable in the next general election.</P>
        <P>I reiterate to the Minister my wish that the seven years between the targets of 30% and 40% be reduced to five years.  That would be a major step forward and would have a significant knock-on effect on the local elections.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>When I explain I am sure the Senator will accept my bona fides.  The language he used suggests that it would not be a binding requirement.  I note the provision proposed is for political parties to, &ldquo;endeavour to reach the quota of at least 50% men and 50% women in local elections by 2019&rdquo;.  Unwittingly, the use of the word &ldquo;endeavour&rdquo; means that we do not have to do it, or even to reach the 30% required by the legislation.  In terms of legal soundness, that provides a difficulty.</P>
       <P Just="Left">Apart from that, where there are two genders it is not possible to have at least 50% men and 50% women.  It must be either one or the other.  I got the Senator.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The fundamental issue is to link the provisions in the Bill to local election candidate selections.  I do not rule out reviewing the legislation after the 2014 local elections to see what has happened among political parties during the course of that election, but I do not want to be too prescriptive.  People in all political parties, or none, should be trying to embrace what we are trying to do here anyway.  Women are under-represented and have been since the foundation of the State.  The situation will not change unless we take some action.  We are taking a practical approach in the Bill.  It is the first time it has ever happened.  I hope political parties will, to borrow a well worn phrase, embrace the spirit of what we are trying to do here, which is to bring greater gender equality to candidate selection at general elections.  I also hope the potential loss of half the funds from the State will focus minds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to Seanad elections, there is a panel system and representative bodies must make nominations for 43 of the 60 seats.  I do not believe it is appropriate for me to dictate to those organisations that have only one nomination &mdash; others have the right to nominate two &mdash; and to be too prescriptive in telling them how to do their business.  I hope the organisations that have two nominations would nominate at least one woman, on a voluntary basis.

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also expect that the new provisions of the Bill will provide the necessary catalyst for improvements at local elections.  Practical experience suggests that if a target is set, with a number of years to achieve it, incremental moves will be made along the way in order to achieve the objective.  In this case, there will be a legally binding provision on political parties.  There is nothing like money and a financial penalty to concentrate the mind.</P>
        <P>Some in the House, and elsewhere, believe the Bill goes too far.  I respect those opinions.  No matter what one does one will please some people and not others.  I hope we have hit a balance and that we point the way forward nonetheless.  The 30% quota will apply in the 2016 general election.  After that, we will make incremental moves to enhance the figure to 40%.  I am mindful of what Senator Bacik said earlier and we will look at that when we debate the Bill in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill balances our legal and constitutional responsibilities against a clear need and desire to bring about significant change.  If some people do not agree with the Bill I hope they will realise that we are making a genuine effort to ensure that we have at least 30% female and male representation in the next Oireachtas.  The Bill gives people the opportunity to participate.  It is then up to the people to decide whether they want to have at least 30% of both genders in the House.  With this measure, we have gone a fair step of the way in making an important development in political reform.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the work of former Senator Gemma Hussey.  My first ever political action was to help her in her first Seanad election.  Before computers were used, I addressed thousands of envelopes in Dartry Park.  I remember that very well and I am proud to have supported her such a long time ago.</P>

        <P>Senator Keane is a little churlish about this proposal, when she says it is pie in the sky.  I find this slightly disrespectful.  The idea of the amendment is to show leadership and a sense that this House can encourage additional political participation at a local level.  I do not care whether the word used is &ldquo;endeavour&rdquo;, &ldquo;will&rdquo;,  &ldquo;able&rdquo; or &ldquo;should&rdquo;.  I thought there should be generosity in the Government parties.  They had plenty of time to come up with their own amendment.  Our amendments were submitted very early.  The amendment regarding the 40% quota was submitted particularly early because we could not accept that we will have to wait seven years after the next general election to reach that percentage.  There was a lack of clarity on the part of the Government parties in explaining this.  We were the ones driving this on Second Stage.    We were the one who highlighted the fact that the duration was seven years, which was why we pressed the motion.  The Bill will have a profound impact on the political culture and level of participation in politics in this country and as such, I broadly accept it and congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.  I also commend him for his good humour and technical ability to admonish me.  However, with no disrespect to him, we will press the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I raise this issue because on Monday the <i>Irish Examiner</i> examined figures released by the Health Research Board which indicated that in 2004, 34 cases of heroin addiction had been noted in Cork.  This figure had increased to 254 in 2010.  More heroin is being used and more users are being treated.  Since 2008 resources have increased.  There was one part-time doctor and a small number of counsellors, but now there are four full-time doctors, three nurses and additional counsellors.</P>
      </Speaker>
        
        <P Just="Left">We have been fortunate in Cork.  In the past there was no heroin epidemic or high incidence of heroin use by comparison with the position in Dublin.  We have had the good fortune to escape the problem.  However, difficulties have arisen with the use of ecstasy and cocaine.  The use of heroin is very worrying if it takes hold because of the crime associated with it.  Heroin users are socially excluded and have poor social skills.  Traditionally, they have difficult family backgrounds, high levels of social welfare dependency and low levels of educational attainment.  There may be an increase in crime, from handbag snatching to more serious thefts and burglary, because heroin is more expensive than other drugs.  It can wreak havoc in a community if it takes hold.  There has been a low incidence of heroin use in Cork; it was relatively unknown as far back as 2008.  However, it is becoming more prevalent and I am concerned that its use could escalatel  I, therefore, ask that the existing facilities be protected.</P>
        
        <P>I congratulate the Garda on the work it is doing.  It told a joint policing committee last September that it felt the problem was under control and that there had not been as many seizures of the drug as in previous years.  This is positive.  The drugs task force is working in the community with families, community groups and youth groups, in particular, to tackle heroin use to prevent an escalation.  That is why I wanted to raise the matter.  I want the Minister of State to assure me the Government recognises the importance of stemming the tide at this stage.  We have not had a major problem in Cork and I would not like to see one develop.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.</P>
        <P>Heroin use continues to be concentrated primarily in Dublin and other urban centres, particularly in Leinster and the south of the country.  While the prevalence of heroin has stabilised in the Dublin area, its use has become more widely dispersed around the country.  One of the aims of the national drugs strategy is to expand opiate substitution treatment provision to meet requirements on a countrywide basis.</P>
        <P>The number in opiate substitution treatment outside Dublin increased from 928 in 2004 to 2,436 in 2010.  This is a trend that we welcome and one on which we intend to build.  The provision of treatment is obviously positive and the increase in the treatment number does not necessarily indicate an increase in heroin use.  Rather, for the most part, it involves people being able to access treatment that was not available in earlier years.</P>
        <P>The Government considers heroin use to be a very significant ongoing problem and a source of serious concern in many communities.  At the end of 2011, 9,251 people were in opiate substitution treatment.  In total, 10,711 people received such treatment during that year.  Such figures indicate that a substantial proportion of opiate users are now receiving treatment to address their drugs problem.</P>
        <P>The total number on waiting lists for opiate substitution treatment in the first half of 2011 was 343 and we expect a reduction in this figure when updated figures become available.  There are no under-18s on waiting lists.  New opiate substitution facilities have opened in Cork, Tralee, Wexford, Kilkenny, Waterford, Limerick and Dundalk in the past two years.  Furthermore, residential detoxification facilities have been established in counties Cork, Limerick, Carlow and Kilkenny.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Cork region in particular, there has been significant investment in drug and alcohol services in HSE South in the past two years.  For the past year, there has been no waiting list for opiate substitution treatment in the region and there has been a commensurate increase in the number availing of such treatment, from 34 in 2004 to 254 in 2010.</P>
        <P>Let me outline recent initiatives in drugs services in the Cork region.  Additional opiate substitution clinics were set up at Heron House, Blackpool, Cork, and at Edward Court, Tralee, and services increased at Arbour House, Cork.  There is access for people from the HSE South region to dedicated residential detoxification beds provided through the voluntary sector at Farnanes, County Cork, Bruree, County Limerick and Tullow, County Carlow.  Additional GPs were recruited &mdash; with the equivalent of three full-time GPs now compared to one part-time GP three years ago.  Three new full-time nursing posts were established in counties Cork and Kerry.  A full-time psychologist was appointed.  The equivalent of 11 additional addiction counsellors are working in counties Cork and Kerry and a drugs rehabilitation co-ordinator was appointed for the region.</P>
        <P>These initiatives underline the progress being made to address the use of heroin and other drugs in the Cork region.  My colleagues in the Department of Health are determined that there will be increased focus on rehabilitation from problem drug use in the coming years.  Meanwhile, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; Customs service are continuing to tackle vigorously the supply of illegal drugs in Cork and across the rest of the country.</P>

      <sTitle>Cycle Lanes</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, and call on him to comment on the newly installed double cycle lane at Stapleton Place in Dundalk which has badly affected the safety of residents and road users in general.  The road is one of the widest and most picturesque in the town and of high aesthetic value.  It was completely rearranged in recent months to facilitate the installation of the double cycle lane on a one-way street.  Prior to the installation, two lanes of traffic were facilitated.  </P>
        <P>As a result of the new cycle lanes, the area presents a safety hazard for residents.  Residents living on the left hand side of the road face cyclists if they get out on the passenger side of a car and face oncoming traffic if they get out on the right hand side.  Many people with young families are living in the area and find manoeuvring prams, buggies and car seats very dangerous.  I witnessed at first hand the danger for all residents, especially those with small families and people with disabilities, whom I know live on the road.  They have considerable safety concerns.  No matter from what door they emerge, they are emerging into traffic.</P>
        <P>Why were residents not consulted before the road works commenced?  I understand there was no obligation to consult them.  Surely, however, they should have been consulted and their opinions sought before the works were carried out.  I am in favour of the installation of cycle lanes and encourage people to cycle so far as possible.  I understand the value of cycling, but where it presents a safety hazard for other road users, more consideration should be given and consultation should take place.</P>
        <P>Since the cycle lanes were installed, I have not seen an increase in the number cycling on the road, despite the fact that there is a school at the end of it.  The junction at the entrance to this road also has been narrowed to ensure that traffic entering is reduced to a single lane.  This is causing huge traffic congestion on the road and in the surrounding areas and is completely unnecessary.  Moreover, what I can only describe as an unsightly lump of cement has been placed at the entrance and is extremely dangerous.  I have witnessed one car hit against the side of it through no fault of the driver.  As a result of these road works, the surface of the road is completely unsatisfactory and for the first few weeks after it was laid, I thought it was a temporary road surface.  I question the value achieved for the money spent on this project, which was funded by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and would be grateful for a full review of how this project was carried out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to outline the Government&rsquo;s commitment to smarter travel and to address the issue in question.</P>
        <P>My Department provided almost &euro;10 million in capital funding for projects under the jobs initiative scheme, which included the improvement of pedestrian and cycling infrastructure and other sustainable transport measures in towns and rural areas outside the greater Dublin area.  Works completed include cycle paths and cycle parking, pedestrian routes, improvements to pedestrian and cycling accessibility to key destinations including town centres, public transport locations and education centres or schools, low-cost traffic management and signage schemes and low-cost safety measures to enhance the attractiveness of walking and cycling.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Works at Stapleton Place, Dundalk, were funded under this jobs initiative scheme.  These works comprised a two-way cycle track, enhanced pedestrian route and speed reduction measures on Stapleton Place from its junction with Hill Street to its junction with The Crescent.  I must stress the design of the cycle lanes and associated works was and is a matter for Dundalk Town Council.  My Department is not in a position to undertake or supervise that level of detail for each of the many projects funded throughout the country.  I have been informed by Dundalk Town Council that a number of design issues have been raised locally concerning safety along this track, such as the interaction between cars and cyclists at certain junctions, car parking along the cycle route and the visibility of the kerb installed to separate the cycle track from the road.  The local authority has undertaken to conduct another safety audit of the route and is engaging with the local community to address the safety issues raised.  I hope issues pertaining to this project can be resolved locally.  I assure the Senator that when I visit the area, which I hope to do in the coming weeks, I will engage with the council, if necessary, in respect of this or any other matter that may be of assistance to the Senator.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This and other projects are important in making progress on sustainable travel.  Persuading people to travel smarter is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s transport policy, that is, helping people to make smarter choices about their personal travel habits by choosing to walk, cycle or take public transport rather than taking the car for every journey.  Smarter travel can be sidelined in the transport debate, as getting more people to cycle more often is not as straightforward a deliverable as a new stretch of motorway or a fleet of trains.  No one disagrees with the idea that increased walking and cycling or active travel is good.  What we need to accept as a nation is that a move to active travel is fast becoming a necessity.  Active travel is necessary to improve the nation&rsquo;s health, to make our communities liveable and to reduce our emission outputs and energy use.  A sustained shift to more active travel modes will contribute to our national competitiveness, as well as our well-being.  Increased cycling and walking increases the health and fitness levels of the workforce, a less congested road network improves the movement of goods and people and towns that are not blocked with traffic are more attractive places in which to live and do business.  My Department has taken a two-pronged approach to promoting active travel, namely, improving cycling and walking infrastructure around the country, thereby making it safer and more attractive to walk and cycle, allied with the promotion of active travel to persuade people to get out of their cars.</P>
        <P>The final point I will make to the Senator is this is a matter for Dundalk Town Council.  While she has brought it to my attention, it primarily is a matter for the council.  That said, when I visit the area, if necessary I will discuss this and other matters with the council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and first wish to acknowledge there was good news for Carrick-on-Suir earlier this week.  I commend the Minister for Education and Skills including a new VEC school for Carrick-on-Suir in the five-year capital programme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, visited Carrick-on-Suir within the past ten days, when he and I discussed this matter, with which he is familiar.  The present position, according to correspondence received by Presentation primary school on 2 March, is the school is to lose eight teachers from September 2012 in the event of the proposed cuts going ahead.  Four of these teachers were in legacy posts put in place through the giving children an even break scheme, two posts derived from the general allocation model and one post was allocated as part of the English as an additional language scheme.  In addition, because of a reduction in numbers, a further teacher will be lost to the school.  The school has the highest number of teacher losses of the 15 non-DEIS schools in its category.  In 2001, the school was allocated four posts as part of the Giving Children an Even Break scheme.  When the school applied for DEIS status in 2005, it unfortunately was unsuccessful but the aforementioned four posts remained in place and this position has continued until the present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Carrick-on-Suir actually went backwards economically during the Celtic tiger period and the benefits of the latter did not reach that town.  As a result, when the RAPID programme areas were brought into being, Carrick-on-Suir was designated as a RAPID town because of its levels of disadvantage.  The south Tipperary social inclusion report of 2008 was based on the 2006 census and makes reference to deprivation indices.  The relative deprivation score for the south east is 3.5 but that for Carrick-on-Suir is minus 13.9, which indicates it is an electoral district with one of the highest levels of disadvantage within the country.  The report highlighted the problems of unemployment and high levels of lone parent-headed families.  It states that Carrick-on-Suir and district are educationally disadvantaged, with unemployment currently running at 20% within the town.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another issue within the town of Carrick-on-Suir is the high number of asylum seekers.  I note that 120 asylum seekers from 12 countries are based in the Bridgewater House hostel in Carrick-on-Suir.  The number of foreign nationals within the area has increased from comprising 2.9% of the population in 2002 to a total of 407 in 2006.  As a result, the school has an English teacher as an additional language teacher with a class of 24.  Despite the class having 24 pupils, this post is due to be extinguished as a result of these cutbacks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I earnestly ask the Minister of State to consider how a school with 26 teachers will have its complement cut by eight teachers or almost one third.  It is not practical to run a school in this way.  Both the parents&rsquo; council and the teaching staff understand and realise there must be some clawback of posts.  However, I ask that this be done in a structured fashion and over a number of years, rather than in one fell swoop.  I seek a favourable response in this regard.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter, to which I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  I wish to outline to Members the allocation process for primary schools, including the reforms to the teacher allocation process that are being made and that will take effect from September 2012, and in so doing I will address some of the Senator&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
        <P>The relevant appointment and retention figures for mainstream staffing for the forthcoming school year have been published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  However, the staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012-13 school year, including the one referred to by the Senator, can also be affected by changes in enrolment, the impact of other budgetary measures and reforms to the teacher allocation process.  The reform of the teacher allocation process has been designed to bring about a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools.  Inevitably, some schools will lose posts, while others will gain them.</P>
        <P>While the Government has tried to protect as best as possible front-line services, difficult choices had to be made to identify savings across all Departments in line with the requirements of the EU-IMF programme of support for Ireland.  Achieving savings in education is particularly difficult, given the significant increases in the overall numbers of pupils in schools.  Notwithstanding this, the Government has protected the 28:1 pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, prioritised targeted support for the most disadvantaged schools and maintained the overall numbers of resource teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, to support children with special needs.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements incorporate a long overdue updating of the general allocation model, GAM, learning support allocation for all schools.  Inevitably, this involves changes to existing clustering arrangements, whereby a teacher is shared between schools.  A further change is that schools in any locality are empowered to cluster and arrange their GAM resources in a manner that best suits local needs.  This should be completed by schools by 16 March.</P>
        <P>There are new and separate arrangements for how resource hours for individual pupils are converted into teaching posts in schools.  The requirement for resource hours in a school varies from year to year, depending on the number, if any, of its pupils with autism, etc.  Small schools generally have a lower requirement for resource hours.  The new arrangements take account of the later timescale for the allocation of these hours necessitated by individual assessment by the National Council for Special Education.  All the changes have been designed to enable a more efficient operation of the teacher allocation and redeployment process in the new climate of a fixed ceiling of teacher numbers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Budget 2012 provided for the phased withdrawal of approximately 428 posts allocated to some schools under disadvantage programmes prior to the introduction of the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, initiative in 2005.  As announced, the withdrawal of 192 posts from primary schools outside DEIS band 1 and 2 and DEIS second level schools will proceed, including the 38 posts from 15 non-DEIS schools which include the four posts in the school in question.  Three posts will also be withdrawn as a consequence of a combination of falling enrolments and reforms to the teacher allocation processes.  The school has the option to cluster 15 GAM-English hours as additional language hours with a neighbouring school to retain a further post.</P>
        <P>The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board.  Details of the criteria for appeals are contained in primary Circular 0007/2012.  The existing staffing appeals criteria have been extended to enable limited phasing arrangements for schools where the combination of budget and reform measures impacts in a particularly adverse manner on a school&rsquo;s overall allocation.  Schools such as the one in question that are due to lose three or more posts as a result of a combination of budget and reform measures will be able to apply to the staffing appeal board with a view to having a portion of the loss of posts deferred to the 2013-14 school year.  This may assist the school in question.  The closing date for submission of appeals for the April meeting of the staffing appeal board is 23 March.  The board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  It is intended that the board meeting will take place on Wednesday, 18 April, which will be prior to the release of the main redeployment panel and allow for any impact of the board&rsquo;s decision on redeployment panels to be taken into account.  However, it is important to note that all schools that have surplus teachers for redeployment are required to return the completed redeployment forms to the Department on or before Friday, 16 March.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Senator&rsquo;s concerns and see the issue in the light in which he presented it.  The Department will be working with schools and the relevant education partners to ensure the new arrangements operate as efficiently as possible.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  The school in question is preparing its appeal which I understand has almost been finalised.  I hope common sense will prevail, as the school wants to continue to operate.  It is already operating in difficult circumstances.  I have outlined the position of disadvantage in the town and that the school is also providing an education for 24 asylum seeker children living in the town.  I am glad the Minister of State has said cognisance will be taken of local circumstances.</P>
