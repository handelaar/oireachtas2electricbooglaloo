	<P>I have received notice from Senator Averil Power that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to outline his response to correspondence from the Priory Hall Residents Association (details supplied) regarding the Draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Diarmuid Wilson that he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to provide an update on the urgent need for an extension to St. Mary&rsquo;s national school, Virginia, County Cavan.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by Senator Power as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
        <P>I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Wilson, as it was replied to in a similar motion on 16 May 2012.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion regarding the proposal for a directive on the freezing and confiscation of proceeds of crime in the European Union, to be taken without debate on the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, statements on &ldquo;A Decade of Commemorations&rdquo;, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 1 and to conclude no later than 1.45 p.m. with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and the contributions of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes, the Minister to be called on to reply to the debate no later than 1.35 p.m.; No. 3, Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2012 [D&aacute;il] &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 1.45 p.m. and to conclude no later than 4 p.m.; and No. 4, motion on earlier signature of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2012, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 3, without debate.</P>
        <P>I wish to notify Members that next week I have arranged for statements on the Euro-Science Open Forum 2012.  As Senators will know, Dublin is the city of science this year.  Senator Quinn has previously called for a debate on this subject, so I have arranged that for next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Without wishing to sound like a broken record, I have asked on numerous occasions when the Government will publish the pyrite report and its response to it.  I am beginning to bore myself with this matter but it is too important to let go.  I would remind the Leader that the Government promised to have a report out by the end of March.  It then promised to have the report by the end of June, yet it is still not forthcoming.  I know the Leader has been following up this matter and I appreciate that.  I would like a commitment, however, that when the report is published time will be set aside in this House for proper debate on it with the Minister present.  I would also remind the Government that the Statute of Limitations on this matter is six years.  Many residents whose houses are affected by pyrite have been left high and dry by their insurance companies.  The longer this goes on the more likely it is they will become statute barred.  Therefore, the longer the Government delays this matter, the fewer the number of people who will have recourse to the courts.  We have a Bill in preparation that we are waiting to introduce, but we must first see the pyrite report.  I am hoping that it will deal with many of the concerns of thousands of people across the country.</P>
        <P>When is it intended to publish the report on the Government&rsquo;s proposals on property tax?  We have had numerous discussions here on the household tax, and I will not go back over old ground concerning how badly that was handled.  At the time, the Government said it would publish fair and just proposals on property tax.  I believe that report is ready, but the Government did not publish it before the referendum for obvious reasons.  When will that be published and made available to the Houses of the Oireachtas in order that people will know the type and amount of property tax they will be asked by the Government to pay next year?</P>
        <P>I was a little bemused that the Taoiseach in response to my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, in the D&aacute;il yesterday would not give any confirmation of what he said to or discussed with Chancellor Merkel on the day of the referendum count last Friday.  The exchange in the D&aacute;il yesterday was astonishing when the Taoiseach could not even tell the Leader of the Opposition or other party leaders what he said to Chancellor Merkel and what she said to him.  It raises questions as to whether the Taoiseach even spoke about changes to the ESM or about getting a deal for Ireland on debt.  He has now said he has written to the relevant leaders across Europe.  Will he publish that letter and will the Leader ask him to do so?  The Irish people are entitled to know the Government&rsquo;s position.  People need to know what the Government is seeking.  Does it entail a debt write-down or the ESM taking over the bank debt?  What is the Government&rsquo;s position?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A question please, Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to check with the Department of the Taoiseach and to ask the Taoiseach to publish the letter he wrote to the EU Heads of Government and to share the Government&rsquo;s position with the Irish people.  What is our negotiating position?  If the Taoiseach could not even tell elected Members of the other House yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is well known.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to know the Government&rsquo;s position.  What is its negotiating position?  What is it looking for from Europe and from Chancellor Merkel?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a simple question.  If the Taoiseach cannot tell us that, perhaps the Leader can tell us.  I ask the Leader to check with the Taoiseach if he will publish the letter he wrote.  I do not see any reason he should not do so.  It should not be a secret as to what Ireland is looking for.  The Taoiseach could not tell the leader of my party yesterday what the Government&rsquo;s position is on this matter.  The Irish people deserve to know that.  I ask the Leader to take this matter up with him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to what Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien has said, I am sure the Leader will respond.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien has raised the question as to what the Government is looking for from Europe.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, in an interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning, and I do not know if the Senator heard it, gave a very clear answer to that question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator would say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister was not on the phone to Chancellor Merkel.  That is the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and cut through the &ldquo;smoke and daggers&rdquo;, as a previous leader of the Senator&rsquo;s party might have said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Was there a conference call between the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and Chancellor Merkel as well?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Senator Bacik to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>He cut through the fog of confusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>By the Government advisers.  The Taoiseach even blamed them yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that the Opposition is trying to create around this issue.  It is very clear, as Minister Rabbitte said.  What the Government is seeking is a restructuring or alleviation of the bank debt.  It is as simple as that.  That was what the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, said and he proceeded to explain why&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Taoiseach ask Chancellor Merkel that last Friday?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that was very clearly set out.  That is the Government&rsquo;s position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Taoiseach ask Chancellor Merkel that last Friday?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien, please.  Can we hear Senator Bacik without interruption?  Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is trying to confuse the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Did he ask her did she have a good weekend or what?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>My question to the Leader relates to a matter Senator Norris raised yesterday.  I want to support the Senator in calling for a debate on homophobia and bullying.  On the Order of Business in this House on 17 May we marked IDAHO, the International Day of Action Against Homophobia and Homophobic Bullying.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality that morning, as Senator Conway explained, presentations were made by a number of groups working in the area of LGBT rights, which set out for us very clearly some of the very worrying statistics around homophobic bullying in Ireland, particularly among young people and school age students.  Senator Norris raised that issue yesterday and I support him in calling for that debate, as we did on 17 May.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that we will have a debate today on the decade of commemorations with the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, in attendance.  As part of that debate we should consider the role of the national cultural institutions.  It is something Senator Mac Conghail raised in this House in recent weeks and on which there has been a good deal of discussion in the media.  I look forward to a robust and a considered exchange with the Minister on that issue during this morning&rsquo;s debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the calls that have been made in the past few days for a detailed debate on the question of the so-called constitutional convention.  It is in danger of becoming a complete farce.  There is a ragbag of issues involved &mdash; lowering the voting age to 17 and restricting the presidential term to five years, a proposal I made 15 to 20 years ago but nothing of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Excuse me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Senator Norris to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Thank you.  There is nothing whatever about some of the really serious issues.  Even with regard to the Presidency, there was a report in 1998, signed up to by all the parties, which stated that the nomination process was completely undemocratic and unfair.  The report made recommendations which were adopted by all parties.  This matter was raised in the other House and was defeated by the Government.  Is it serious about real constitutional reform?  I rather doubt it is.  Its composition is also questionable in that there is nobody from an expert constitutional background from the universities and nobody with experience in this area.  It is a completely cosmetic exercise designed to divert the people.  The reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann or its abolition are not tabled.  If this matter is not to be considered by the constitutional convention, then the whole thing is an insult to the Irish people and to everybody involved in the convention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I get the feeling that there is a whiff coming off this House similar to that which emanated from the Irish House of Lords when it was about to be extinguished and the then authority created a series of new peers like mushrooms all over the place so that it could abolish it.  I can smell similar tactics operating around this joint.  I am very glad that my ancestors voted against the abolition, against the union&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>My ancestors did not have a vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and for Catholic emancipation.  I hope this kind of spirit will continue in this Upper House.  I would be very concerned about this.  I would like a full debate on it.  The Seanad must be considered in it, otherwise it is not worth a damn.</P>
        <P>I welcome very much what Senator Bacik said about the international day on homophobia.  It is in danger of being overlooked.  Regrettably in the Minister&rsquo;s contribution on the day, which was very well intentioned, it was subsumed into the general area of bullying.  Bullying is very important as a general subject but there is a specific issue here in light of the extraordinary degree of homophobia that still continues to prevail in this country and within all the churches, including my own.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>We have entered the summer period and hopefully the sun will shine on our beautiful island and the number of tourists who will come here will increase during the next few months.  When I go to restaurants and meet people in the hospitality industry they regularly tell me that the reduction of the VAT rate to 9% made a huge different in terms of tourism and employment.  I request the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House at some stage for a debate on the Gathering.  It is an innovative and interesting concept that was launched in recent weeks.  It will encourage people of Irish decent throughout the world to make a special effort to visit Ireland in 2013.  Communities around the country have been encouraged to run events and to up the ante to encourage people who would have connections with their communities to spend time in Ireland during 2013.  It is a good initiative that deserves the support of this House and of all Irish citizens throughout the world and it deserves to be embraced by our embassies and business community throughout the world.  Members may have ideas that could feed into the Gathering project and such a debate would be very worthwhile.  Tourism is our only natural resource and were tourist numbers to increase it would have a massive benefit for our economy.  A debate on tourism with a specific focus on the Gathering could be very useful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments on the convention on the constitution.  At a time when the Government has indicated one of the items for discussion will be the reduction of the voting age to 17, the Department of Defence has announced one must be 18 to join the Defence Forces.  The reason I support Senator Norris is because I advise the Government to tread cautiously in launching any referendum because it will not have the support of Fianna F&aacute;il if it launches a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;especially if it puts down a simple &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; question and does not give the people an opportunity to discuss whether the House should be reformed, which I believe the vast majority of people would want.  Many editorials in the media have indicated this also.  I caution Government to tread very carefully if it goes down this road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>We saw what happened with the referendum on the powers of inquiry for the D&aacute;il and Seanad when the Government did not have universal support.  Since the Constitution was first introduced in 1937, it has been proven that referenda put before the people have passed only when they received political consensus.  Where there was a lack of political consensus, the referenda have fallen and Fianna F&aacute;il was the victim of this also when it tried to change the electoral system in the late 1950s.</P>
        <P>With regard to the day against homophobia, I wish to bring another issue to the attention of the Leader and I would be interested to hear his comments on it.  This is with regard to the persistent and regular references &mdash; it is somewhat relevant in the week that is in it &mdash; to Giovanni Trapattoni in the sports pages of our national newspapers as &ldquo;the 73-year-old&rdquo;.  We see constant references to the 73-year-old who did this or that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the new 50.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>If Mr. Trapattoni was 53, 43 or 33 it would not be mentioned at all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>He looks well on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>This also gives me an opportunity to wish the Irish team well.  We will have a feast of sport over the weekend and the Irish will be all over the world.  I wonder whether there is a breach of any laws in this regard in that in my opinion and that of others it is ageist.  There is absolutely no need whatsoever to make reference to Mr. Trapattoni as a 73-year-old.  Why not refer to him as the Irish manager who is doing a good job for Ireland and who hopefully will qualify from the group stages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo Senator Mooney&rsquo;s comments and I see he is wearing his green tie I am sure in honour of the forthcoming matches which I am sure we will all enjoy.  I also send my best wishes to the Irish team and its wonderful manager, Mr. Trapattoni, whose age shall henceforth be forgotten.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome Transparency International&rsquo;s report, Money, Politics, Power: Corruption Risks in Europe, published yesterday.  I welcome it although its content on Ireland is less than welcome.  It reminds us yet again that we still do not have a register of lobbyists, something we inherited from the previous Government which made no effort to have such a register.  I see the report as something that places continuous pressure on both Houses to do something about it and to be the Government which does change it.  I know there are plans for such a register but I hope this register will be mandatory.  We should acknowledge that we are lobbied night, noon and morning.  We are lobbied by e-mail, over coffee, in the AV room and in Buswells Hotel.  It is a constant round of lobbying and people outside the buildings are not aware of the extent to which we are lobbied.  Although sometimes it looks like a conversation, we are in fact constantly being lobbied and I for one would very much like to see a register of lobbyists introduced as a matter of urgency.  I suggest to the Leader that this House might take a lead on this matter and debate it as early as he can arrange it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe referred to being lobbied in the AV room.  One of the issues on which we have all had to reflect in recent years with regard to our economic woes is a failure of business ethics at many levels, particularly in banking, where people made short-term and self-interested decisions to the detriment of the community.  As some colleagues will know, next week I will bring forward a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, the business undertakings disclosure of overpayments Bill, the aim of which is to create a statutory obligation on undertakings or individuals who receive an overpayment to disclose it to the payer and facilitate its return.  Ethical business practice would demand people disclose such an overpayment but good ethics should in many cases be backed up by good law.  A briefing on this will take place in the audio visual room shortly after 11 a.m.  I know colleagues are very busy but I would be very grateful if people could pass through for a brief outline of what the Bill will deal with.</P>
        <P>There has been much talk about the constitutional convention and Senators Mac Conghail and Bradford have called for a debate on it.  The article by Dr. Conor O&rsquo;Mahony, a lecturer in constitutional law in UCC in <i>The Irish Times</i> today is required reading for the Government.  What he has to say is very damning.  He rightly diagnosis the very piecemeal, half-hearted and unstructured approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to constitutional reform.  I am one of those who believes our Constitution is excellent and I favour the approach of an item by item analysis and that we should have stand-alone referenda from time to time, as painful as this might be for the Government to contemplate.  Although I am grateful for the certain degree of consultation that has gone on between the Government and the various political groupings in the House, I have reservations about the structure of the constitutional convention and the idea of randomly picking people from the electoral register.  I presume some people will say they are not interested.  There is also the issue of the inter-meshing of elected representatives and members of the public.  Dr. O&rsquo;Mahony rightly identifies that what happened in 1996 was a far superior approach whereby people with expertise and a track record made very considered recommendations, only one or two of which were ever brought forward in referenda.  He rightly states it is strange to expect anything better would come from this.  It seems to be a process that was driven by the desire of one party in government to make its mark on history but without thinking through what constitutional change actually requires.  I would welcome a debate on this in the House very soon so we can discuss some of these issues.  It was often stated that at the time of the Second Vatican Council the various bishops who arrived immediately threw out the agenda prepared for them by the Curia.  If the constitutional convention does meet, it might be a good thing if the first thing it did was to state it would not deal with the set menu as prescribed by the Government but consider what issues should first get its attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear, but it would be even better if the Government agreed to implement some of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us have a debate in the Seanad as soon as possible as a first step.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Mullen for teeing up my views on this matter.  I agree with his request for a debate on the constitutional convention.  While I am sure my views as to where it should go and what issues should be prioritised would differ from those of Senator Norris, it is urgent that we have a debate not only on the make up of the convention, but also on its purpose.  I will repeat what I have stated previously.  This House has 60 elected Members and the D&aacute;il has 166 elected Members.  Within this body of men and women we have every possible proponent of every possible idea with regard to constitutional change.  Virtually every one of the so-called weighty matters to come before the constitutional convention has already been investigated or dissected by the Law Reform Commission or various other reports or agencies.  The Members of both Houses should be leading the debate on any possible constitutional change.  The constitutional convention sounds an attractive body but what the country needs is not the politics of soundbite but the politics of substance.  We need weighty debate on the Constitution and the constitutional convention prior to its establishment.  We have seen the list of so-called prioritised questions to put before it.  One does not need to be a genius in any respect, political or otherwise, to know what its deliberations will be on the idea of reducing the voting age to 17.  One does not need to be a prophet to know what it will say with regard to the term of office of the President.  However there are issues which need to be debated but this debate should begin and end in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  For better or worse we are the elected people and we should be the constitutional convention.  It is a proposal of the Government so let us debate here the merits of the constitutional convention and let us tease it out.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>These are questions that need to be raised.  There are constitutional provisions which need to be changed but we in this House in conjunction with the Lower House have the capacity to be the leaders of that debate.  A constitutional convention would simply rehearse debates that have already occurred.  The article I read today referred to the 1996 work.  All of this has been investigated and written up by many bodies.  We, the politicians, must now lead.  And as a start we should debate here the merits or otherwise of the constitutional convention.  The debate on changing our Constitution is a serious matter and should be done with great care and not as some sort of political sideshow.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith linne, muid f&eacute;in, soil&eacute;iri&uacute; a fh&aacute;il ar c&aacute; seasann an Rialtas maidir le ceist na hEorpa agus ceist an airgid san Eoraip.  In the run-up to the referendum we were told a considerable amount about stability, jobs, etc., and that this measure was only part of a much broader jigsaw of pieces that would be put together to provide that.  We seek clarity and perhaps a debate on what are the other pieces of that jigsaw.  The stability we were promised does not seem to have appeared and there seems to be more instability across Europe.</P>

        <P>I have called for a debate on this topic in the past.  Strangely, an unusual issue came up during our debate on the septic tank legislation.  We had a very interesting debate on what constitutes poverty.  Anybody who saw last night&rsquo;s report about the 1,000 people going to the Capuchin centre in Dublin every day for bags of food would have been taken aback by the scale of poverty in the country.  There is considerable expertise in this House to debate what poverty really is.  The nature of poverty in Ireland has changed in the past year or two in particular.  During that debate we discussed European guidelines on what constitutes poverty.  Is it having a good coat, a good pair of shoes, being able to eat hot meals, etc.?  In April Social Justice Ireland published a report entitled Shaping Ireland&rsquo;s Future, which indicated that 700,000 people, one sixth of the population, are living in poverty.  I wonder if that was discussed in the telephone call with Chancellor Merkel on Friday.  Some 200,000 of those are children and 10% of the poorest people have a disposable income of &euro;210 a week while the richest have a disposable income of &euro;2,276 per week.  A debate on poverty would be very useful and would give us a very good picture of the kind of country in which we are living.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be worth having a discussion on the Seanad at this point.  All the Members of this Seanad have performed extraordinarily well under your chairmanship, a Chathaoirligh, and under the leadership of the Leader and the opposition leaders.  I returned to this House ten years ago and this Seanad is doing an excellent job.  It will prove itself successful to the extent that the people will decide to vote against its abolition.  I agree with Senator Mooney that people should be given the options of retention, abolition or reform.</P>
        <P>I bring another treaty to the Members&rsquo; minds.  Last week we passed the fiscal treaty and I hope that everything that was promised will be implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I also hope so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope they are implemented to a greater extent than the consolidated version of the treaties, particularly the Lisbon treaty and the role of the Oireachtas in this regard.  I was a member of a committee chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, which published a report on 23 May 2008.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, has been very supportive of this.  That committee specifically recommended that significant reforms are made to D&aacute;il and Seanad procedures to ensure regular consideration of EU matters in plenary session.  However, that has not been the case.  That was a clear commitment by all parties that supported both referendums on the Lisbon treaty.  It was clearly stated that the Oireachtas would have a say on legislative procedures in the European Parliament and that we were part and parcel of Europe.  However, committees do not represent a full Parliament &mdash; the D&aacute;il and Seanad constitute the fully elected Parliament.</P>
        <P>I again appeal to the Leader once a month to select issues going through the European Parliament and Commission to be discussed in this House with all its knowledge and expertise.  I do not believe it would need the back-up that has been mentioned.  People can discuss issues here and we can then send a report of the proceedings to the Minister of State with responsibility for Europe or to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We in this House could contribute to many significant and important issues.  This would be an issue worth bringing before the people who will respond very positively when they see the important role this House is playing in the implementation of the Lisbon treaty.</P>

	<P>During the referendum campaign people at the doors raised with members of the coalition Government a matter of grave public concern, which is that of special advisers.  A very undignified spectacle is playing out in the newspapers at the moment.  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, appears to be battling with the Minister for Public Enterprise and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to get the best possible salary for a third special adviser.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators cannot display newspapers in the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not displaying it.  I have read it a number of times so I can probably quote it from memory.  The Minister expressed dissatisfaction that his adviser could not get the top point in the salary scale.  The spokesperson confirmed on the record to the newspaper that the Minister will be battling for the new special adviser to secure the top point on the principal officer scale.  This man and this Government are completely out of touch with reality.  The only thing the Minister will do is reduce the unemployment rate by one in north County Dublin.  It appears that many people in north County Dublin want to have special adviser jobs with the Minister, Deputy James Reilly.  It is not right that somebody on a pension of &euro;137,000 should come back into the office, with the Minister battling on her behalf for a salary at the highest point of principal officer rate.  It is completely out of touch with reality.</P>
        <P>The Minister does not need these special advisers as the Department is full of advice.  The Department does not administer the health service any more but advises the Minister on health policy.  He is a doctor.  We thought he had all the answers to the problems due to his experience as head of the Irish Medical Organisation and as a practising general practitioner, GP.  Why does he need more advice?  I thought he knew everything but it turns out that he does not and needs advice.  It is shameful and pathetic that the main public battle the Minister for Health is engaged in at present is about whether his advisers get the top point of the salary scale.  It is being reported in the newspapers, both on and off the record, and it is doing the Department of Health and the HSE a huge disservice.  We must have a debate about it in the House with the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by my colleague, Senator Conway, for a debate with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, about The Gathering in 2013.  This event has huge potential to bring many hundreds of thousands of people to Ireland.  It will be good for local communities and will revitalise them.  It will certainly generate badly needed investment and spending.  It is also a great opportunity for tourists to see the beauty of our country in all its guises.  Linked to that, I welcome the announcement by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Alan Kelly, that &euro;7 million in additional funding is to be made available for cycle routes throughout the country.  An additional 334 km of cycle ways are to be provided as part of the national cycle network.  It is an indication that the Government is committed to promoting Ireland as a tourism destination&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the Minister for Health attend the House immediately to make a statement on and discuss the urgent measures that are clearly required to deal with the 218,000 people waiting for a hospital outpatient appointment.  Following referral from a GP, 218,000 people are waiting for a simple outpatient appointment to see a consultant in a hospital.  This is long before they presumably get onto another waiting list to determine when their treatment might take place.  Most worrying, 800 of these patients are waiting for more than four years.  Lives are clearly being lost here.  Conditions are worsening medically for these people as a result of having to wait such an inordinately long time.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Leader is most concerned about this given that 540 of the 800 patients are in County Waterford.  One wonders if a hospital which is considered to be a centre of excellence for such treatments is being adequately resourced by the Government.  If not, what steps are being taken to ensure that the people of the south east and Waterford city are given the appropriate care?  A four year waiting list for an outpatient appointment is ridiculous in the extreme.  Roscommon is another area where there have been cutbacks.  Indeed, the next largest number among the 800 is in that area.  Clearly, resources are an issue when one must wait such a long time after being referred by a GP.  When one considers what my colleague said about the posturing within the Cabinet about whose adviser gets what maximum payout, despite the &euro;137,000 pension, it seems inconceivable that rather than the basic right of people to get appointments on referral from their GP we are more concerned with the amounts that Ministers&rsquo; advisers will be paid.  How many advisers does it take to show people that action is required?  The figure of 218,000 people is a national scandal.</P>

	<P>I support my colleagues who called for a debate on The Gathering next year, particularly on how we as individuals can play our part in its success.  I believe everybody has a part to play.</P>
        <P>I seek a review of speed limits, particularly on rural, class three roads.  These roads have grass growing in the middle of them and vehicles cannot pass each other at the same time &mdash; one vehicle must pull into a gateway to allow the other to pass.  These roads have speed limit signs of 80 km/h.  They are particularly dangerous.  People live beside them.  Some of these roads have been abandoned by local authorities and I have photographs to prove it.  Some of them are in my county.  Some of them have potholes as big as craters; one would not see bigger on the moon.  Yet the speed limit is 80 km/h.  I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on this.  It probably concerns rural Senators more than our urban colleagues, although I am sure some of our urban colleagues have travelled on these roads.  They are unbelievable.</P>
        <P>I call on the Department to introduce improved legislation to ensure that local authorities, by using their own expertise, make decisions about certain roads.  Local authorities have area engineers who are familiar with the roads I am discussing and can make quick decisions to ensure revised speed limit signs are erected forthwith.  These roads are just being used by rally drivers.  Families cannot walk on them.  We encourage people to walk in the countryside but they cannot walk on these roads.  Parents with young children in prams cannot take them for a walk because of cars travelling at excess speeds.  I call for a review and that speed limit signs be appropriate, whether it be 10 km/h, 20 km/h or 30 km/h.  Certainly, in the cases I have in mind, it should not be 80 km/h.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by my colleague, Senator MacSharry.  Will the Leader confirm the date the Taoiseach will come to the Seanad, how long he will be here and what format the questions session will take?  Will it be confined to party leaders or will it be open to every Member of the Seanad to pose a question to the Taoiseach?  It would be helpful if the Leader could answer those questions.</P>
        <P>I join Senators Norris, Mooney, Noone and others in calling for the future of the Seanad to be part of the constitutional convention that is due to take place.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter, to the House for a debate on the future of the Defence Forces, with particular emphasis on the future of the Reserve Defence Force.  There are strong rumours among members of the latter force that it is about to be abolished.  While this may be dismissed by Members on the Government side by stating this is only a rumour, I note there were rumours that D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Barracks, Cavan was about to be closed.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Moreover, there were rumours that the Army barracks at Mullingar, Castlebar and Clonmel were to be closed.  They were being dismissed as mere rumours until days before the closure of the aforementioned barracks actually was announced by the Minister.  Before this rumour becomes a reality, I call on the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to come to the House to discuss the future of the Reserve Defence Force, the general future of the Defence Forces and his plans for them.  Finally, I agree with Senator Norris that Members should have a debate on homophobia.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise again a matter I raised a couple of weeks ago, as I was not satisfied by the complete lack of response to it.  I refer those schools which should have DEIS status but which do not, that is, those schools which did not meet the criteria in 2005 but that certainly would meet all the criteria now.  These schools are experiencing the same cuts as any other school, which is particularly unfair.  While I am not trying to open up a great can of worms or to run up a big bill for the Minister for Education and Skills, I keep hearing references in this Chamber to the relevance of the Seanad.  In this context, Members might seek action on this issue on behalf of those children who will be most affected by the cuts.  I do not refer to those schools that can take cuts and acknowledge there are schools that can take cuts and reductions.  However, a number of schools can take nothing and I would like to think Members would support me on this matter.  I acknowledge the Minister is highly likely to state that whatever cost might be incurred in this regard would have to be cost-neutral to the Department.  Were this the case, I would support the Minister in this respect and would like to think other Senators would do likewise because there is a huge difference between those schools that simply cannot take any cuts and those which can.  If the Minister gives Members a hearing and indicates he is prepared to bring to the table a programme to benefit those schools, Members should also be responsible.  I cannot emphasise this issue enough and hope to raise this matter on the Adjournment next week with the consent of the Cathaoirleach.  I wish to hear what the Minister has to say directly but depending upon the outcome, I hope to have the support of the Seanad.  This would demonstrate the Seanad can make a real difference to those who most need it.</P>

	<P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien raised the serious matter of the pyrite report, about which I responded to the Senator yesterday.  I remind him the expert group reviewing this important matter is independent and the Minister does not wish to interfere with its work as he wishes to give it ample time to oversee properly this problem, which is of concern to everyone involved.  However, as I indicated yesterday, I am informed that the report is being prepared and is imminent.  Following its publication, I will provide an opportunity to Members to have a discussion on the report in the House.</P>
        <P>The Senator also questioned the position in respect of the property tax.  As he is aware, a group under the independent chairmanship of Dr. Don Thornhill has been established to consider the policy approach to and the modalities for a full property tax.  The group continues to progress its work in a highly active manner and is using economic expertise that is available to the Government.  This reinforces the need for time to be allocated to this subject, on which Members will have a debate after the report has been issued to the Government.</P>
        <P>In respect of the Taoiseach, what Ireland seeks and so on, the Government seeks the restructuring and alleviation of bank debt.  This is a clear answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a better answer than was given yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik also alluded to the comments made this morning by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, which also clarify that matter.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris, Mooney, Mullen, Bradford, Noone and others raised the constitutional convention.  As Members are aware, the aforementioned convention is being set up and while the first two items to be discussed will be the voting age and the term for the presidency, it will expand from there.  If the House wishes to hold a debate on the constitutional convention, I certainly will arrange such a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no question of &ldquo;If&rdquo;, as even the Leader&rsquo;s own side has indicated its desire for it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I have stated that I will arrange a debate and will do so.</P>
        <P>Senators Conway, Brennan and Mullins raised the issue of the Gathering.  Tourism certainly is a very important part of the economy and my office already has been in contact with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to invite him to the House to discuss this important initiative.  Senator Mooney also spoke on the constitutional convention and I welcome the clarity of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party approach to a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad.  The Government position is the referendum on children will be held in September or October of this year and the referendum on the Seanad will be held next year.</P>
        <P>As for Mr. Trapattoni and the possibility of ageism coming into play, were all Members as good at the age of 73 as is Mr. Trapattoni at the age of 73, they all would be doing very well.  He is a highly active man and is a wonderful example for everyone.  Members wish the Irish team every success and indeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Consequently, there should be no reason to refer to his age.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree completely with the Senator that there is no such need.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe called for a debate on the register of lobbyists and I certainly will try to arrange such a debate on this highly important issue.  Senator Mullen indicated his intention to introduce a Bill next week on the disclosure of overpayments and Members will have ample time to discuss that issue next week.  In response to Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, I agreed yesterday to have a debate next week on the recently-held referendum.  As I indicated to Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien yesterday, that debate will take place next Thursday.  As for a debate on poverty, the Minister for Social Protection has come into the House several times but I am sure she would be willing to return again at a later stage.  In respect of Senator Noone&rsquo;s point regarding the Taoiseach, he certainly will appear in the Seanad before the end of the term.  In reply to Senator Wilson, Members will use the same procedure as was used when all previous taoisigh came into the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>That never happened previously and so will not happen again.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred to the boundary commission and while it certainly will be a cause of joy for some, it undoubtedly will create challenges for many others.  In respect of European Union proposals, as I stated previously I am fully in favour of having a debate on European issues and directives in this House.  Only yesterday did I get some backup in regard to being able to present to the House some issues that would come up and I will do so, as soon as I have word.  I have had no response from the people I met several months ago and am reactivating the matter with a view to having such debates in the House.</P>
        <P>I assure Senator Byrne there is no battling between any Ministers, in any regard.  The Government is working as a cohesive unit in the interests of the country.  If the Senator wishes to discuss advisers&rsquo; pay, a matter I have spoken about previously, the Government introduced a number of changes immediately after coming into office to reduce the costs of the political system of the State.  Specifically, the Government halved the cost of ministerial transport by reducing Garda involvement and abolished State cars except for the President, Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Justice and Equality, for security reasons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>

	<P>In this House we usually allow people to respond to the questions asked.  Permitted staffing of the private offices and constituency offices of Ministers of State was reduced and at its first meeting the Government decided to reduce the Taoiseach&rsquo;s pay to &euro;200,000 and reduce the pay of Ministers and Ministers of State <i>pro rata</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Government also decided to cut down on the costs of special advisers close to Ministers.  It succeeded in reducing the cost by about 23% when compared to the previous Government regime.  Special advisers in this Government are on a lower pay scale when compared to the previous Government rates and the practice of paying attraction allowances has been abolished.  The biggest reduction in pay is in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office.  Two years ago, the previous Taoiseach employed seven special advisers at a cost of almost &euro;1.1 million.  The present Taoiseach appointed only four special advisers, with one for the Chief Whip&rsquo;s office, with a total pay of &euro;576,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>

        <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment to the Order of Business, proposed by Senator MacSharry.  He is right; it is a very serious matter that we have 218,000 people awaiting an appointment for a consultant.  That figure which came out is indicative of the transparency of this Government.

	<P>I respect the protection given to me by the Cathaoirleach.  Senator Brennan spoke about small rural roads and speed limits.  I agree with him that one can drive along motorways where in areas there are 60 km/h speed limits but one can leave these and go onto a small country road where two cars can barely pass and where the speed limit is 80 km/h.  I understand a review of speed limits is already under way.  Members have been asked to submit proposals and outline where problems lie.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson mentioned the Defence Forces and the Reserve Defence Forces and I will try to find the information.  Fianna F&aacute;il is indulging in making rumours in this regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank Senators for this opportunity to discuss the commemorative programme for the decade of centenaries.  I recognise the expertise and interest in the history of the period that can be found in this House.  I look forward to listening to Senators&rsquo; contributions to today&rsquo;s discussion.  Some Members and former Members of this House are members of the all-party working group on commemorations.  Their contributions to date have been most useful.  As chairman of the all-party group, I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their contributions.  On behalf of the Government, I have an absolute commitment to lead commemorations that are historically accurate, appropriate in tone and comprehensive in terms of the events that are commemorated and the perspectives that are offered on those events.  I will place a premium on inclusion and public participation as I co-ordinate the development of a commemorative programme in a spirit of co-operation with political parties and community groups throughout Ireland.  I welcome the interest and association of officeholders, institutions and the Irish abroad in building a programme that will acknowledge the sacrifices and celebrate the achievements of a revolutionary decade that, more than any other, shaped our modern world.  A very special programme is required on the centenary of the tumultuous circumstances that brought our State into being.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Without wishing to be rude, can I interrupt the Minister to ask whether copies of the Minister&rsquo;s speech will be supplied?  I have to leave to go to another meeting, but I hope to return in time to contribute to this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is coming.  With the passing of a century, perhaps we are at a sufficient remove to survey our history with a detached objectivity that could not have been expected of earlier generations.  Nonetheless, we are still close enough to that period to identify directly with the personal experiences of those involved.  Some of us might have family histories that link us to the historic events we are set to commemorate.  The decade of centenary anniversaries will give us some valuable opportunities.  In the first instance, we will have an opportunity to dedicate ourselves towards an enhanced understanding of modern history.  There is no doubt that the headlines of a century ago have resonated across the generations.  The names of the key figures of this era are familiar to everyone, but how much is really known about them?  I am delighted to see young people in the Gallery for this morning&rsquo;s debate.  It is important that the history of this period is transmitted to them in a factual and accurate way.  The education system will have a key role to play in the decade of commemorations.</P>
        <P>Many of those who played a role in the events of 100 years ago have never been adequately acknowledged.  I hope we will take the opportunity to address this over the next few years.  While the Easter Rising and the Proclamation of the Irish Republic will be at the centre of our programme, any presentation of our history would be incomplete without many other stories, including those of the workers of the 1913 Lockout, the members of the Suffragette movement and the Irish who fought in World War One.  I am working with an expert advisory group of historians, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning, who will provide guidance to ensure the authenticity and balance of our commemorative programme.  I am grateful for the support of the members of this group.  I will rely greatly on their academic integrity and advice as I develop the commemorative programme.  I have been invited to attend the next meeting of the group, which will take place on 12 June next.  The group will consult widely, within the academic community and beyond, to this end.  In particular, I hope it will guide us as we try to ensure our commemorations are meaningful and of enduring benefit to our understanding of the period.  The programme of centenary commemorations should stimulate higher-level research and promote discussion that will further illuminate our history.</P>
        <P>Our programme of commemorations began with the centenary of the introduction of the third Home Rule Bill to the Westminster Parliament on 11 April 1912.  This anniversary was marked by memorial lectures on John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party, which were organised in association with Waterford City Council.  It is intended that the excellent lectures that were given on that occasion by Dermot Meleady and Frank Callanan will be available to the public on the commemorations website that is under development in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The introduction of the third Home Rule Bill was a vindication of long years of parliamentary campaigning for national autonomy and a tremendous personal achievement for John Redmond.  It can now be seen as a pivotal moment in our history, bringing the polarisation of traditions and the resort to arms in resistance.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to mark this early moment of the revolutionary period by attending the Dublin City Gallery &mdash; the Hugh Lane &mdash; on 24 May last to open its excellent exhibition of portraits, Revolutionary States: Home Rule and Modern Ireland.  As I considered the portraits of Redmond, Carson and others that hang side by side in the gallery, I was struck by the manner in which the sourcing of the exhibits reflects the shared history of the galleries of Britain and Ireland, each contributing to the total.  In addition to the exhibition in the Hugh Lane, I have already been a part of many other significant centenary commemoration events.  The Northern Ireland First Minister, Peter Robinson, visited the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at Iveagh House in Dublin in March to offer his reflections on Carson&rsquo;s influence on Irish unionism.  The First Minister&rsquo;s address followed historical presentations by Professor Paul Bew and Professor Michael Laffan.  In mid-April, I was privileged to address a conference of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland at Belfast City Hall about the Ulster Covenant, the centenary of which will be marked later this year.  At the end of May, Glasnevin Trust marked the centenary of the founding of the Labour Party with a special presentation by Dick Spring, whom I was delighted to introduce.</P>
        <P>All of our cultural institutions and local authorities are playing a part in the decade of commemorations.  Later this year, the county libraries of counties Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan will host exhibitions on the Ulster Covenant.  Other events that are planned include a conference at the National Library of Ireland this weekend offering centenary perspectives on the third Home Rule crisis, the completion of the restoration of Erskine Childers&rsquo;s yacht, <i>Asgard</i>, and the continuation of the National Library of Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Europeana&rdquo; World War One collection roadshow, which has been very successful.</P>
        <P>At these roadshow events, families will be afforded the opportunity to contribute personal artefacts and stories relating to the First World War to a pan-European exhibition.  This will help to build a contemporary narrative on a historical event that reshaped Europe.  I attended a Council of Ministers cultural meeting in Brussels recently which was very impressed by the memorabilia that was presented through the National Library, which I would like to acknowledge.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The commemorative programme for the decade of centenaries will run from 2012 to 2022.  To facilitate preparation of the programme, the organisational effort will be addressed in the first instance in the programme up to 2016.  With a view to building an affinity with the history of the period, the programme will seek to follow the historic sequence of events and reflect the background influences in each year.  The programme for 2013 will examine the Dublin Lockout and the struggles of working men and women for improved living and social conditions.  It will also follow the continuing story of the Home Rule campaign, with the centenaries of the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Force and, of course, the Irish Volunteers.  These special anniversary commemorative initiatives will complement the standing arrangements for annual commemorations which include the national day of commemorations, the Easter Rising commemoration at the GPO and the commemoration at Arbour Hill.</P>
        <P>My discussions with interested parties have left me in no doubt that the official commemorative programme will grow and be complemented by the initiatives of cultural institutions, local authorities, national associations and community groups.  Indeed, I would hope to leave the House today with some new ideas as to how we can commemorate this very important decade and I look forward to the contributions of Senators.  I am certain that the commemorative programme will also have a special broad appeal to the Irish diaspora and to the many friends of Ireland abroad.  It will also present an opportunity for the new Irish to explore the heritage of their new identity.  A particular consideration is required to ensure that the programme engages the interest of young people.  I hope to see a programme develop that will stimulate wide public participation not just in the official State-led commemorative events, but on a continuing basis at community level, based on initiatives brought forward by councils, schools, clubs and societies.</P>
        <P>I recently turned the sod on the Thomas MacDonagh centre in Cloughjordan, which involved a huge number of local people and was a very impressive event.  I appeal to any Senators who have connections with the leaders or main players in 1916 to encourage similar initiatives in their own communities.</P>
        <P>I stress to Members that preparation of the commemorative programme is still at an early stage.  I am often asked about the commemorative arrangements for the Rising in 2016 but, at this point, what I am most interested in is discussion and input into those plans.  I can assure the House that I am open to constructive engagement.  I would welcome the support of members in developing a national discussion on the shape of commemorations to come.</P>
        <P>I will attempt to pre-empt some questions by clarifying that the commemorative initiatives to date have been managed within the existing resources of Departments and State services.  While I am aware of the precedents in regard to the commemoration of the United Irishmen, the Great Famine and other events, there is not yet a dedicated allocation from which support can be provided to applicants for commemorative initiatives.  Despite the special consideration on the appropriate marking of an important centenary anniversary, the commemorative programme cannot be insulated from the necessary constraints on all public expenditure.  Nonetheless, I feel an impressive start has been made this year to the commemorative programme.</P>
        <P>Our exploration of the historic decade of a century ago commenced with a number of diverse events including lectures, exhibitions and commemoration ceremonies.  I have been greatly encouraged by the enthusiastic interest evident throughout Ireland and by the very positive response and association of the British Government and the Executive in Northern Ireland.  I am very heartened by the involvement of the Unionist community, especially in Northern Ireland.  They have attended our committee on commemorations and they have been very positive about their willingness to be involved in our commemorations on this island, North and South.  The great example was the commemoration at Balmoral, which passed off peacefully and which was a great celebration in Northern Ireland.  What has happened to date has been very positive and I am very heartened by it.  There has been great buy-in by all parties in the House and by all parties on this island.  If this trend continues, I can see that the decade of commemorations will play a major role in bringing all on this island closer together.  The important thing is that we are doing it in a spirit of tolerance, respect and inclusiveness.  This is happening and it is having an impact.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a constructive debate in the House today.  I hope Members will come up with some good ideas which we can add to the programme.  I thank Members for their attention.  It is my second time in the House as I was here last year to discuss the arts, on which we had a very constructive exchange.  I am delighted to be here to discuss this very important commemoration of a decade that was really responsible for us being here today in this Seanad.  We should remember that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Is mian liom c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire.  N&iacute;l aon amhras n&aacute; go bhfuil &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil seans againn &aacute;r dtuairim&iacute; i dtaobh an chl&aacute;ir cuimhneach&aacute;in a nochtadh.  Is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuil mioneolas &aacute; thabhairt.  Ba cheart go mbeadh tuiscint sa Seanad agus lasmuigh i measc an phobail ar c&eacute;ard go d&iacute;reach at&aacute; i gceist.  Ta m&eacute; l&aacute;n-cinnte go mbeidh dea-thoil ann don obair at&aacute; idir l&aacute;mha ag an Aire.</P>
        <P>I believe this whole episode is in very safe hands with the Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan.  I am appreciative of the fact that, at this early stage, he has come to the House to inform us of what is happening.  In a vacuum, there is sometimes a misunderstanding and misrepresentation whereas this is putting on the record what our goals and our vision for the future will be.</P>
        <P>We all agree Ireland&rsquo;s story is a very diverse one &mdash; there is no doubt about that.  We have had an opportunity to reflect in many ways and to contemplate that, particularly since the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, there has been much greater interaction between different groupings on this island, interactions that perhaps in the past would have been somewhat difficult because of the prevailing climate.  There is huge goodwill out there at present.  There are very few people who would not want to see us progressing further given the opportunity has been provided and the foundation has been laid.</P>
        <P>Wearing another hat, we in Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann had an opportunity recently to make a decision on whether Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann, which is a major event, should cross the Border for the first time in 60 years.  That will happen next year and up to 300,000 people will be in Derry for that celebration.  Interestingly, I went to a meeting of what we would call the stakeholders in Derry a few months ago and I could see the changed Ireland which exists.  All the political groupings were represented, there were statements from the Apprentice Boys offering their support and people asked to be sure that we position elements of the event on their side of the Foyle.  In addition, we had letters from the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, seeking to ensure the event would be held there.  The tone of those letters was along the lines that we have something we can all celebrate which is not divisive, enhances our own positions and enriches our own outlooks.</P>
        <P>As I said, we have a very diverse story.  If we get it right, this can certainly do a lot for the future of Ireland and also for the image of Ireland abroad.  Those of us who travelled abroad over the years of the Troubles will remember the difficulty at times of indicating that there were many cohesive aspects to Irish life involving those of all political and religious groups and of none.  It was difficult to get that message across but we now have new opportunities to get it across.  This message is important in the context of pride and of a sense of who we are as a people.  It is also important in an economic sense.</P>
        <P>Commemorations should never and need never be divisive and can avoid divisiveness through the language used.  Sometimes it is the language rather than the manifestation in a commemoration that causes difficulty.  Therefore, we should be careful in the use of language.  Some of the language is archaic and antiquated and it is important we replace that with language through which we can engage and embrace.  Any grouping that wishes to commemorate its vision, past or people should feel there is respect and tolerance of that wish and we should not distract from it.  By doing that, those of us who have a different vision of Ireland, based on our historical past, can ensure that those who sacrificed themselves for our freedom can also be commemorated and that this will not be seen as divisive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Those of us who are old enough to look back on 1966 will remember a wonderful pageant written by Dr. Bryan McMahon, entitled &ldquo;Seachtar Fear, Seacht L&aacute;&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Seven Men, Seven Days&rdquo;.  This pageant dwelt very much on the cultural side of 1916.  If one looks particularly at the 1916 Proclamation and wants it to impact on one&rsquo;s life, one will see it is not about bitterness, but about peace.  The 1916 Proclamation or charter was one of the shortest of any country, but was very much ahead of its time with regard to cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  The seven signatories nearly all come from a cultural background.  In many ways, it was the poets, musicians and such people who inspired the  Easter Rising and this should be central to the commemoration.  I am delighted to be able to say that the 1916-21 Club, which was specifically set up to heal wounds, the wounds of the Civil War in particular, has made it clear that its commemoration of the Easter Rising will be non-sectarian, non-party political and will take cognisance of its cultural and educational aspects.</P>
        <P>As I said, the commemoration need not be divisive in any way.  At the same time, it is important that we do not dilute who we are as a people.  My experience of dealing with people from the Orange Order and other Unionist groups in the North down through the years has been that in the main when they meet us and realise we do not have two heads and we realise they do not have two heads, we are amazed by how much we have in common.  I am chairman of the Irish Family History Foundation.  The vice-chairman of the foundation was Sir Robert Kidd, a former chairman of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the secretary was Paddy &ldquo;Bogside&rdquo; Doherty.  However, because this group had a specific focus, genealogy, we were able to sit down and work together.  It is important that we come together more.</P>
        <P>Voluntary bodies and national organisations have a huge role to play, whether the GAA, Conradh na Gaeilge, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, the ICA or the farming bodies.  These groups have a particular focus reflective of what is happening in society.  Their focus is positive and endeavours to bring all people together for the specific aims and objectives of the organisation.  We have hundreds, if not thousands of organisations.  I hope the Minister, through the special body he has set up, will provide some opportunity for representatives of those organisations to come forward, no matter their aims, so that what we have will be a people&rsquo;s commemoration.  It should also be a celebration.  If we start with the concept of celebration, we will not celebrate violence or division, but generosity of spirit and sacrifice and will endeavour to be in tune with what was indicated by the people on this island in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister every success in his work and assure him that I will support and co-operate with his efforts.  I am glad he mentioned that the commemoration of the Easter Rising will be a central part of the decade of commemorations.  This is what the people look forward to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for coming in today.  I am glad to see he is taking the decade of commemorations so seriously.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has said, the commemorations are in good hands.</P>
        <P>This is an issue on which we need leadership and it is evident the Minister is taking the lead.  From 1912 to 1922 was a pivotal decade in Irish history.  As Lenin once put it: &ldquo;There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.&rdquo;  What was true in Lenin&rsquo;s time appears to be true now and this time of flux, change and difficulty seems an apt time for this nation to reflect on and commemorate a decade in which there was significant change.  The decade that commenced with the introduction in Westminster Parliament of the Home Rule Bill in April 1912 remains the most momentous of our modern history.  The commemoration of this decade will also include the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising in 1916 and I welcome the fact that it will be central to the commemorations.  The decade concluded with the foundation of the Free State in 1922.</P>
        <P>Recently, Stephen Collins wrote a very thoughtful article on the decade in which he rightly pointed out that the importance of the labour movement and the struggle for women&rsquo;s rights in the making of modern Ireland were also generally overlooked in popular history.  These too need to be acknowledged in the commemorative events and I suggest they are worthy of consideration by the Minister when planning the implementation of the various programmes.  What was a struggle for sovereignty and the recognition of a nation was also intertwined with the struggle for recognition of women as equals, and the struggle to recognise the rights of workers.  Indeed, I am heartened to see that the role of women and workers in bringing about our transition from the campaign for Home Rule to the establishment of an autonomous Irish State has been noted.</P>
        <P>This decade was one of the most momentous of modern Irish history and requires a comprehensive commemorative programme that acknowledges its importance.  I am heartened this is what seems to be on the horizon for us.  I am excited by the possibilities this decade of commemorations presents us with and I am keen to ensure that our history is understood in an enhanced way.  As the Minister said, it is important for young people to be apprised of the events of the decade and this is something we should try to bring to the schools.  Perhaps this could be part of the interaction with various organisations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand that while the intention remains that the commemorative programme will run through to 2022, at this point in time we are focusing on the programme up until 2016.  This makes sense as it marks a halfway point in the decade.  We can also expect an election around then, which could be a distraction. It seems appropriate to plan up until that point for now and to consider the plans more fully then up to 2022.  I am glad to see that the Minister is supported by the Oireachtas all-party consultation group as well as the advisory group on centenary commemorations, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning and comprising many distinguished academics.  This committed, distinguished body of people will ensure that the celebrations are accurate and appropriate.  It will be their task to ensure that the commemorative arrangements will be aligned with the historic timeline of the centenary anniversaries.  I have no doubt that the group will do a fantastic job in assisting the Minister on that.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister hopes that the commemorative programme will strengthen public interest in our national history and encourage original research at local and national level.  I feel that original research will undergo a period of rejuvenation on the part of both citizens and expatriates who  left the island long ago.  As the Minister said in his contribution the diaspora projects such as World Irish and the 2013 Gathering will also play a role in augmenting this reconnection with our history.  These events in the augmented schedule of commemorations will complement rather than replace the established arrangements for annual commemorations which include the national day of commemoration and the commemorations held at the GPO and at Arbour Hill and the annual commemoration of the Great Famine.</P>
        <P>As a Dublin representative I would encourage the Minister to consider special commemorative arrangements for events such as the millennium anniversary of the battle of Clontarf in 2014.  It is an anniversary of great significance in Dublin and such an event could be used to boost the profile of the north Dublin coast.</P>
        <P>A debate continues about funding for the arts.  It is worth remembering that the budget for the arts is 0.5% of the health care budget.  I am sure the Minister is acutely aware of this statistic.  We must aim for value within the arts sector.  I am interested to note that the three main galleries, the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Gallery, have together presented a detailed proposal on how backroom services can be shared.  This proposal is currently being considered and I hope that this positive suggestion yields dividends.</P>
        <P>The Minister is quoted in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> with regard to the merging of the cultural institutions.  My understanding is that no decision has been made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views.  He is quoted as saying that he would expect proposals to go to Cabinet in the next two weeks.  I am sure that people working in the arts sector would be happy to linger a little longer to ensure that matters are considered and that the proper decision is made.  I commend the Minister for his leadership and his initiative on the commemorations.  As he said, it has been an impressive start and I thank him for sharing his thoughts with us today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinMcAleese"><NameTxt>Senator Martin McAleese</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I commend him for all his good work on the forthcoming series of commemorations.</P>
        <P>I first spoke about the decade of commemorations or the decade of sensitive centenaries during a Private Members&rsquo; motion debated in this House on 15 June last year I emphasised then that it was incumbent on all of us, North and South, Unionist and Nationalist, loyalist and republican, to find a collaborative way to manage the celebration of the events surrounding these centenaries, in such a way that value is added to the peace process rather than subtracted from it.</P>
        <P>It may be more accurate to regard not alone the decade from 1912 to 1922 but rather the 13-year period from 1911 to 1923, as representing the turbulent years that had such a dramatic impact on the course of our island&rsquo;s history.  There are approximately 62 events in that period which constitute the package of centenary celebrations, from the arrival of James Connolly in Belfast in 1911 through to the ending of the Civil War in 1923.  These centenaries present a significant challenge but they also have the potential, if conducted sensitively, to fully consolidate the peace process and to allow us to leave a precious legacy to the generations yet to come.</P>
        <P>The context in which we celebrate these centenaries is important.  In Northern Ireland, communities for so long have been content to live apart and to a worrying extent they still do, engaging only superficially with the perceived stereotype of the other rather than engaging fully and comprehensively with the person behind that stereotype.  This lack of engagement has caused communities to drift apart and to stay apart.  Over time, this ignorance of each other has generated many ill-informed, negative and dangerous misperceptions of the other.  Ultimately, it seed beds sectarianism, which has polluted and dehumanised the landscape of Northern Ireland for so long.</P>
        <P>One of the big challenges in the past was to decommission weaponry; the biggest challenge in the future is to decommission sectarianism.  We have made significant progress since the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998 but it is important to remember that the peace process is exactly and only a process, a work in progress.  Although many elements of this process have been completed, some may take years, perhaps even generations.  As we continue on this journey, we must be vigilant and never take peace for granted, as circumstances could at any time conspire to undermine or derail the entire project.</P>
        <P>Tackling sectarianism and failure to engage meaningfully with those who are different to ourselves is critical.  At a recent conference, the chair of the Community Relations Council in Northern Ireland spoke of deep divisions in housing and education and the growing problem of racism.  In referring to the scale of the challenge he remarked:</P>
        <P LI="1">The number of interfaces in Northern Ireland was 22 when the Good Friday Agreement was signed.  Today the number is as high as 88 by some estimates.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition, the number of so-called peace walls has doubled since the agreement was signed.  Both these facts demonstrate the wisdom of a comment recently made by Senator George Mitchell, who played such a pivotal role in bringing about peace on our island.  Addressing the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, he said that implementing a peace agreement was as equally important and difficult as reaching agreement and that this fact was often lost in the euphoria of reaching agreement.  Therefore, while appreciative of the many achievements of the peace process to date, we need to be very conscious that the job is not yet finished.</P>
        <P>I strongly believe that the decade of centenaries we have now entered offers a real opportunity to make further progress, provided we act with a full and true sense of inclusiveness, parity of esteem, generosity and above all, respect and sensitivity to the celebration of the centenary events of those whose traditions, heritage and ambitions we do not share.  If this approach can be applied on a mutual basis and if we can have a respectful and peaceful celebration of every tradition&rsquo;s centenaries, we will exit the decade with enhanced relationships and a better understanding of our shared history both within Northern Ireland and across the island as a whole.  These immediate years could be regarded as testing what we have achieved to date.  If we pass this test, I have no doubt that we will be on the cusp of a prolonged and sustainable peace on this island.  What a prize this would be, something that has eluded every past generation.  These centenaries have the potential to be the vehicle that will move us from a past characterised by two traditions and two communities to a future still characterised by two traditions &mdash; but by one community at peace.  To achieve this we need an integrated approach by all, by Governments, institutions, associations, committees and individuals, to the celebration of every centenary, including those that some of us may feel uncomfortable with.</P>
        <P>All over the island there is much good work being done.  As the Minister said we got off to a good start with the peaceful celebration of the centenary of the Balmoral review held recently in the Ormeau Park in Belfast.  I congratulate the organisers and all those who participated.  The way this event was celebrated sets a good tone for those that will follow.  I encourage all involved to keep going.  There is more than ten years of hard but rewarding work ahead.  As I said last June, this House can play an important role in promoting awareness of the sensitivities of these centenaries and in supporting those who will play critical roles in these celebrations.  To that end, this House could usefully be briefed by the likes of the Orange Order, the chair of the Somme Association and by reputable historians who have a particular interest in the history of this period.    In that regard, I commend the Leader on his intention to invite the Orange Order to this House.  We look forward to engaging with them in the near future.  If we have the insight and the sensitivity to engage confidently in this way with those who are pivotal to the success of the centenaries, this House will be in a strong position to make an important and distinct contribution to the success of the centenaries and consequently to the consolidation of the peace process and reconciliation between Unionist and Nationalist traditions on this island.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, to the House.  This is my first opportunity officially to congratulate him on his appointment as Minister.  I know he has been doing an excellent job.  I welcome the opportunity to debate the important decade of commemorations in the Seanad.  We appreciate the opportunity to engage with the Minister.</P>
        <P>I am taken with what the Minister said about what has been planned and particularly the inclusive nature of the celebrations, the positive engagement with the Unionist community and the inclusion of communities in North and South.  Listening to Senator McAleese, I am struck by the important role the decade can play in furthering the reconciliation going on North and South.  Like Senator McAleese, I commend the Leader of the House, Senator Cummins, on his invitation to the Orange Order.  The House should play an important role in assisting the commemoration and furthering the peace process.  I commend Senator McAleese on his significant role in the peace process to date.</P>
        <P>Others have spoken about the importance of this decade and the transition it marks from the home rule campaign to the establishment of the Irish State.  For the Labour Party, this year marks our centenary year and I am honoured to have been part of a book, edited by Daly, Rice and O&rsquo;Brien, entitled <i>Making the difference?</i>  It is a collection of essays commemorating the establishment of the Labour Party.  I am delighted to hear the Minister say plans are in hand for the commemoration of the 1913 lockout and the role played by women and workers in the decade.</P>
        <P>In the spirit of offering constructive ideas, I have three suggestions for the Minister&rsquo;s plans.  My colleague, Senator Gilroy, has a particular interest in commemoration of the First World War.  My interest is in ensuring a specific focus on the role of women and the struggle for women&rsquo;s rights, to which Senator Noone referred.  In the commemoration of the suffragette movement, we should recall that the election in December 1918 was the first election in which women got the vote.  It marked the election of Constance Markievicz as the first woman to be an MP or Deputy and links the Parliaments in Britain and Ireland.  In December 2008 we marked the 90th anniversary of the election with an historic photograph in the D&aacute;il Chamber of the women who had been elected in the D&aacute;il or Seanad and who were still living.  I would like to display the photograph in Leinster House.  Something significant should be done for the 100th anniversary.</P>
        <P>One must be careful with something as difficult and traumatic for so many families as the 1913 lockout.  It is a bit like commemorating the Famine &mdash; one cannot have a celebration.  I ask that the Irish Labour History Society and the museum in Beggars Bush be included.  They have good ideas about the appropriate ways to commemorate the lockout.  I am sure contact has already been made.</P>
        <P>My third point is on the commemoration of 1916 and the need to ensure it is not too militaristic or a celebration of bloodshed.  The role of pacifists in Irish independence, such as Louie Bennett and the Sheehy Skeffington family, should be commemorated.  The strong role of pacifists was part of events leading up to Easter 1916.</P>
        <P>The Minister asked about the inclusion of young people and ensuring a way to engage them.  Those in preschool and at a very young age in primary school should also be included.  I was struck by the success of the Olympic procession through Dublin and one way of including this age group is to have cultural ambassadors.  I suggest Jedward and Imelda May, people who have a direct engagement with preschool and primary school age children.  My children were wildly excited about Jedward carrying the torch through Dublin.  On a more serious note, the ideas outlined by the Minister and proposed in this House show the important role of historians to ensure we have an active and engaged panel of historians.  We have that and I am delighted it is being led by Dr. Maurice Manning, the former Leader of this House.  The Minister outlined some of the key events hosted by the cultural institutions, including the event in the Hugh Lane Dublin City Gallery and in county libraries.  These show the importance of keeping history on the curriculum, which is a point I will take up separately with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  It is important that history maintains a strong role in the curriculum.</P>
        <P>It also serves to show the ongoing strength of our cultural institutions, to which Senator Noone referred.  As a Labour Party Senator, I pay tribute to the former Minister and current President, Michael D. Higgins, who introduced the National Cultural Institutions Act in 1997.  The arm&rsquo;s-length principle established in the Act, that national cultural institutions should have independent boards and directors with necessary specialist expertise to ensure institutions gain respect nationally and internationally, must be maintained.  I am somewhat concerned at proposals that appear to go further than the plans in the Government&rsquo;s public sector reform plan of November.  Senator Noone mentioned that institutions are entirely mindful of the need to save money in the current economic climate.  They recognise the need to cut costs and to ensure they are as effective as possible.  The galleries have put forward a detailed plan about sharing services and it is a view shared by all institutions.  The proposals that the National Library and the National Museum will no longer have independent boards or directors might see us losing some of the respect for the national cultural institutions.  I know that no decision has been made on it.  It is not money-saving to have an independent board.  Board members have already suggested they will waive fees and come forward as volunteers.  We must be mindful to ensure the arm&rsquo;s-length tradition is maintained to ensure boards have expertise in their areas.  In the current economic climate, they can bring an independence of mind to institutions in terms of philanthropy and fund-raising.  That is a critical role for board members.  The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, have said that no decision has been made and that the proposals will go to Cabinet.  There is real concern among the arts community, which is manifest in the recent resignation of Professor Diarmaid Ferriter.  There has been a good deal of talk about this.  As we enter the centenary of commemorations, we will need to ensure our national cultural institutions are fit to play a vital role in assisting and supporting us in running the sort of events we are all so excited about to mark the decade of commemorations.</P>
        <P>Like all of us, the Minister is excited about the decade and we all share the enthusiasm and want to engage constructively to put forward plans and ideas that can help mark the decade and make it an important, pivotal point in the history of our nation.  In that spirit, we put forward suggestions and comments and I hope the Minister will take it in that spirit.  I have huge regard for the Minister and I am delighted we have this opportunity to debate with the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the fact that he is the Minister in this position.  I have known him for a long time and I regard him as a good friend.  We have had many conversations about cultural matters.  Long before he was Minister, he had a good track record in being active as an Opposition Deputy, not just as a good Kerryman but concerning all artistic, cultural and literary events throughout the country.  I salute him on his record.  It is not a case of someone parachuted into a ministry who knows nothing about the background of the subject.  We will support the Minister and he needs support because a number of institutions are being threatened.</P>
        <P>Let us start on a positive note.  The Minister asked for suggestions and I will repeat one I made during the presidential campaign.  It was a revolution of poets.  I might not have agreed with everything they said or did but we now have a poet and a visionary as President.  I suggested that one of the things we might consider doing for the celebrations in 2016 was to invite the leaders of France and the United States of America to come and join with us to read the Proclamation of 1916 under the great portico of the GPO and read their own foundation documents, which we drew from in our visionary Proclamation of 1916.  I want them to go one step further.  All three leaders could then commit themselves to cherish not just all of the children of the nation equally but all of the children of the planet equally because we are so interconnected.</P>
        <P>I shall return to the negative.  I listened with interest to what Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said.  I was around in 1966 and remember it very well.  It was a deeply unpleasant experience for people like me and, I would say, it was for a majority of Church of Ireland people and for anyone who had any connections with the southern Unionist community which had been under attack since the foundation of the State.  To me it was nothing other than a tribal celebration of bloodlust from which I was excluded on every possible ground, except the fact that I was white.  I was the same colour as everybody else but I did not have the same sexual orientation.  I did not have a republican background.  My father was English like P&aacute;draig Pearse although he conveniently forgot that.  Unless anybody thinks this is an ignorant condemnation of Pearse I have read his <i>An Cla&iacute;omh Solais</i> and it is full of the greatest racist pap one could possibly come across.  Arthur Griffith was not a whole lot better with his anti-semitism.  Let us be realistic.  I was delighted to hear the Minister talk about inclusion.  Let us learn from the mistakes of 1966.  Let us make the celebration genuinely inclusive.  I salute Senator McAleese for what he said.  He and his wife have played a pivotal role in bringing different people together.  I have never had a huge amount of time for the Orange Order but I was delighted to hear him say that its leader should be invited to the House.  Let us give him a welcome.  I was even more delighted to hear that the Leader of the House supports his call so there is no contest.  We will have them here.  Good.  It shows that we will have an inclusive celebration and that is important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question of language was touched on and it is important.  I also wish to say that the editorial section in <i>The Irish Times </i>yesterday was a complete disgrace to the newspaper.  I do not know who wrote it because all of them are usually anonymous.  Whoever he or she was should cut out the article and eat it.  In the last paragraph it stated &ldquo;the monarchy . . . also jars with our sense of modernity and democratic values&rdquo;.  Preening ourselves in our adolescent, juvenile way on our superiority to the British, it continued &ldquo;it provides spurious continuing legitimacy to the inherited privilege that continues to dominate both economic and political life in the UK&rdquo;.  What about this country?   I know all about where I live.  I am privileged to be living in an area of grotesque under-privilege in the north inner city.  The writer continued:   &ldquo;Of course, our neighbour, in truth a democracy, though still recovering psychologically from the loss of empire, must be free to entertain its cherished delusions.&rdquo;  How extraordinarily generous but how disgusting in its smugness.  Let us avoid this kind of claptrap.</P>
        <P>With regard to the celebrations, I hope that the Unionists and the British will be included.  We are all of the same people.  Ryan Tubridy showed the Queen around Dublin and started the tour from the top of the Guinness tower.  He is a direct descendant of Edward III, a King of England, as people will know from a television programme while she is a direct descendant of Brian Boru and Hugh O&rsquo;Neill, the rebel Earl of Tyrone so let us recognise the complexity of history.  I also salute John Redmond.  But for the First World War, and that is a big &ldquo;but&rdquo;, he might have achieved the same degree of independence for this country that was achieved by 1916 thus avoiding a lot of mess.</P>
        <P>The Minister went on to mention all of our cultural institutions, local authorities, or all that will be left, unless we give him the strong support that he deserves and needs.  I share the concerns of other people about what will happen to them.  First, we have lost our sovereignty and that is not much to celebrate.  In my opinion we should have a day of mourning for the surrender of our sovereignty.  If we are going to destroy our cultural institutions it will equate to the bombing of the Custom House in 1922 that resulted in the loss of all records stored there.  I applaud Senator Bacik, as the leader of the Labour Party and a significant member of Government, for taking the opportunity to raise questions about these institutions.  That took a certain amount of political courage and I salute her.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Cultural Ireland has been left adrift.  Half a dozen institutions do not have directors such as Culture Ireland, the National Archives and the National Museum of Ireland.  Where are the directors?  Has an arm&rsquo;s length principle been adopted?  Senator Bacik requested a vote but where is it?  We talked about Michael D. Higgins, our President, who introduced the 1997 Act.  Why are we setting about dismantling it?  I found it to be a quite extraordinary measure and it will be a great shame if it damages the institutions.  It is notable, and I think it has been said already, that Professor Diarmaid Ferriter resigned in protest.  He had no political agenda but he resigned in protest because he saw what was happening to our cultural institutions.  If legislation is put in place to dismantle and replace the 1997 Act we will have disgraced ourselves.</P>
        <P>With regard to the mergers, under a previous Government attempts were made to dismantle and close the James Joyce Centre by an alleged merger. The Minister will know it very well because he was a great supporter of the centre.  I managed to fight it and I got rid of the people who were behind it as well.  We started off with a promise of shared back office services but that is fine if that is as far as it goes.  Nobody in the world of culture has set their face against economies.</P>
        <P>I want to pay tribute to Senator Mac Conghail and the Minister&rsquo;s party leader and Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, who appointed people of vision to the House.  They are people with connections to the arts, poetry, drama and the Abbey Theatre.  Plato, and I dare to continue to mention his name, banished all of the artists in his republic, the poets and the rest, because he said that they were unreliable and asked questions.  Of course they do and that is their value.  That is why they exist and that is why they strengthen the spiritual life of the country.  We should glory in the Abbey Theatre and W.B. Yeats.  I am delighted that a Yeats Day in Sligo will be announced.  The organisers probably got a hint from Bloomsday.</P>

        <P Just="Left">What a wonderful way to celebrate.  What a brilliant idea to celebrate the freedom that we won, the parliamentary democracy that we won, by abolishing the Senate.  That is one of the stupidest ideas that I have ever come across and it is an insult to democracy.  There may be little forces around here that might collaborate with it but they will be exposed.</P>

    <Title>Decade of Commemorations: Statements (Resumed)</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this very important topic.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  He is well placed because of his strong sense and view of Irish history to ensure that the commemoration period is dealt with in an appropriately sensitive fashion.  In 2005 or 2006, on the floor of the House, I suggested that we begin planning for the centenary of the 1916 Rising due to its significance and the sensitivities involved.  I am glad that we have gone well beyond that and we will celebrate the decade or more of historical significance.</P>
        <P>The word &ldquo;commemoration&rdquo; is one we need to be careful of because commemoration often leads mentally to celebration and a certain presentation is then put on the whole theme.  I recall being fortunate enough to visit Australia in 1995 on a parliamentary delegation visit, when Australia was reflecting upon the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.  The phrase being used was &ldquo;Australia remembers&rdquo;, which I thought was a nice, inclusive, friendly phrase.  Over the next decade, Ireland must remember, and we must remember a lot about our history, not just one single event or one single aspect of politics.</P>
        <P>A lot of it, by definition, must be uncomfortable, and we must be prepared to deal with some of the uncomfortable and inconvenient truths, as the phrase goes.  It will be uncomfortable for some people to remember the Ulster Covenant, but it must be done.  It will be uncomfortable for some people to remember the tens of thousands of Irish people from all counties, parishes and townlands who fought in the First World War, but that is part of our history too and must be remembered.  It will be uncomfortable for some people to reflect on the fact the 1916 Rising in its infancy was not the glorious revolution it is now looked upon but was actually deemed to be unpopular and unacceptable to a large number of Irish people.  History changed and the focus on the Rising changed within the course of a few weeks but, initially, it was not a populist movement.  This needs to be reflected upon.</P>
        <P>Sometimes, we in this Republic find it difficult to remember the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the Civil War.  We find it difficult to remember that the vast majority of the Irish people in an electoral exercise supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty, although it was not politically acceptable to everybody.  We have to remember with difficulty the ethnic cleansing of Nationalists in Northern Ireland and the equally awful ethnic cleansing of southern Protestants and Unionists in parts of Ireland.  That is our history, our make-up, and it is what we need to remember.  &ldquo;Commemoration&rdquo; is a fine word in a sense but we must try to use the word &ldquo;remember&rdquo; as much as &ldquo;commemoration&rdquo; in order that it will be very balanced and fair.</P>
        <P>I was interested in what Senator Bacik said about the teaching of Irish history, which is a subject that in the past decade or so has been downgraded in our schools, where there has been a move toward history becoming a subject that is selected and is in no way compulsory.  If I was in the fortunate position of being the Minister for Education and Skills and there was one subject I could make compulsory, it would be history.  I believe a reasoned and balanced presentation of Irish history and the transmission and teaching of that history would ensure the next generations of Irish children and adults would not go through what we have gone through over the past 50 or 60 years.  We need to ensure everybody gets the jigsaw of what and who is Ireland in all of its complexity, its make-up and its historic difficulties, glories, triumphs and disasters.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well in what he is attempting to do.  This project is on a huge scale.  However, if we all deal with it in a fair, balanced and sensitive fashion, it can only help in the building of relationships on this island and the genuine unifying of people.  Let the unifying of territories sort itself out in generations to come; our task is ensure that people are united.  In that regard, I join with Senator McAleese in giving a warm welcome to the initiative of having a presentation in this House by the Orange Order at some stage in near future.  That will be quite a significant and historic achievement.  Again, it is important that we listen to people with whom we have difficulties, doubts and disagreements.  Politics and progress is about discussion, dialogue and debate.  This is a very necessary and helpful step forward.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the programme of events as they unfold.  I know the Minister, as a former history teacher, believes in the importance of balance and fair play.  That is all we can hope to achieve, namely, that all of us will listen to the other side of the argument and recognise that nobody ever had all the answers, nobody is all right and nobody is all wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and support the comments of Senator Norris, who made it clear that the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides in this area are well established.  I have no doubt he will bring to this project the same enthusiasm, engagement and commitment which we in Kerry know of so well.  In that, he will have the full support of my party.  This is something that embraces us all; it is for everybody and is not exclusive to anybody.</P>
        <P>The decade in question was obviously a crowded, exciting and dramatic time in our history.  It opened up with John Redmond pressing ahead with the old Home Rule movement he inherited from Parnell, Dillon and others and it finished up with foundation of the Irish Free State.  A lot happened in the interim, including the Great War and, of course, our own declaration of independence and the subsequent War of Independence.  All of these issues will have to be commemorated and observed in a fitting and sensitive manner.  I welcome the tone of the Minister&rsquo;s address in this regard.  All of these things define us as we are, and whether we came from a republican or from a Unionist tradition, everybody&rsquo;s history is precious to them.  It was L.P. Hartley who said, &ldquo;The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there&rdquo;.  Every generation tends to utilise the endeavours of previous generations to justify its own acts and activities.  The classic example of this in the period would have been Pearse&rsquo;s oration at the grave of O&rsquo;Donovan Rossa, where he invoked the patriotism of O&rsquo;Donovan Rossa to justify what he was prepared to do in the following year in 1916.</P>
        <P>We have to be sensitive and careful when we are dealing with another generation.  My interpretation of history may not tally with that of somebody else.  It is important, if political parties get involved in this &mdash; and I am sure they will have their own ideas too &mdash; to note that no one political party in this country has ownership of the past or of commemorating the past.  I hope that what will be done by the Government will be done on behalf of the State and of all the people, and that it will exclude nobody and no section of our society, North or South.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In 1966, as Senator Norris said, we were a young, emerging nation and, 50 years on from 1916, we clearly celebrated that in, I suppose, a triumphant and brash way.  We were probably entitled to it.  We had arrived; we were on the national stage.  Fifty years on, we have to be more mature and less militaristic.  I hope we will not see too much of armies parading around the place, flyovers and that kind of thing.  For the majority of the population of the country, 1916 is still the one central event of the decade, or so I would maintain.  We must obviously give it a certain priority while not excluding the people who took part in the Great War, fighting on the side of Great Britain, and other traditions.</P>
        <P>The Minister asked for suggestions.  To go back to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s point about the celebratory aspect, and the Minister is the perfect person to deal with this, I would like to see the arts coming to the fore as part of the commemorative process.  I refer in particular to music, poetry and theatre.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to &ldquo;Seachtar Fear, Seacht L&aacute;&rdquo;, which was the Dr. Bryan McMahon pageant in Croke Park which we remember so well.  Perhaps Senator Mac Conghail might have some ideas as to how the Abbey Theatre, which had such a central part in our nationalist revival, can become involved.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister is cautious about the budgetary aspect but it might be an idea for him to create some kind of centenary bursary whereby the arts could be supported.  In 1966, one of the best initiatives was the creation of the 1916 scholarships for students, which the Minister might reconsider.</P>
        <P>Education is becoming more and more expensive.  Although to a certain extent we have free education, many young students would benefit from patronage.  Perhaps the Minister could use this as a possible way of celebrating 1916 and all of the other events.</P>
        <P>It is important that these events are celebrated at community level, as every village and town would like to be associated with the celebrations.  Obviously there will be some flagship commemorations, most likely in Dublin, the North or wherever is appropriate, but I would like to see something for everybody in all communities.</P>
        <P>In 1966 RTE commissioned a fantastic set of interviews with people who survived the 1916 Rising.  I do not know what happened to them but I have an idea they were destroyed.  Will the Minister examine whether there is any possibility of saving them?  The media will play an important role and I commend <i>The Irish Times</i> on its excellent series of articles commemorating the 1912 Home Rule Bill.  I look forward to <i>The Irish Times</i> producing similar articles to celebrate the 1913 Lockout and the 1916 Rising.</P>
        <P>I do not raise my next point in a political partisan way and I have discussed it with the Minister previously.  It is appalling that Eamon de Valera has not been celebrated or acknowledged in any way in our capital city.  Whatever one&rsquo;s views of the politics of all of our great leaders of the past, such as Parnell, Isaac Butt, Collins, Griffith, Cathal Brugha, Connolly and all of the other leaders, they are commemorated in the city.  It would be a magnanimous gesture by the Minister if in this process he re-established the identity of Eamon de Valera, who has been reviled by revisionist politicians.  Neil Jordan did a great deal of damage to him.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this and I am quite serious about it.  It would be a gesture greatly appreciated if he were to take it on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  We have a great opportunity as we approach the series of anniversaries of the events which led to the foundation of the State and, more important, the formation of the consciousness of the State.  It is important we appreciate the historical and personal complexities which steered these events and marked them out as a series of defining moments in the formation of modern Ireland.  We must be conscious of the competing views of Irishness and have respect for traditions.  We must be careful to allocate due respect to both.</P>
        <P>I wish to mention the anniversary to be commemorated on 1 July 1916, which is the commemoration of the Battle of the Somme.  The experience of thousands of Irish soldiers on that dreadful morning is seared into the consciousness of the nation.  In the first few hours of the morning, soldiers from the 16th (Irish) Division, who were Catholic to almost a man and were drawn from the National Volunteers, fought alongside the 36th (Ulster) Division made up of men from Tyrone, Derry, Fermanagh and Donegal, along with Tyneside and Liverpool Irish, and suffered 9,000 casualties.  The men of the Inniskillings 36th Division suffered particularly bad losses that morning with 2,000 men killed and another 3,500 wounded.  These were the great grandsons of the same regiment which fought under a different name and stood before Napoleon&rsquo;s cannons 100 years previously and suffered casualties of 500 out of 700.  These were all Irish men drawn from a handful of counties and small towns throughout rural parts of Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Our views of militarism have changed greatly in the intervening time and it is not appropriate to celebrate war but, as Senator Bradford stated, it is appropriate to commemorate it.  We need to be aware the men who fought and died at the Somme and during the First World War believed they were fighting for something greater than themselves.  This complexity needs to be acknowledged.  It is only in recent years we have even acknowledged the existence of these men and the approach of the anniversaries associated with the First World War offers us a wonderful opportunity to put this to right and I look forward to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad for this important debate on the nature, challenges and role of commemorations as we begin a decade of centenaries.  The Minister is the chairman of the all-party centenary commemoration group and therefore has a powerful role in establishing the vision of how we might approach the complex notion of commemoration and in how we deliver the activities planned.  He is also in charge of our national cultural institutions which will be asked to articulate and manifest a decade of centenaries through contemporary arts, exhibitions, concerts, events, theatre productions, music and poetry in which we need to involve all of our citizens.</P>
        <P>The first Minister charged with responsibility for culture in the Republic is now its President.  President Michael D. Higgins established the vision, roadmap and passion behind the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.  I was proud, while working with a fellow Kerryman when he was Minister with responsibility for the arts, namely, John O&rsquo;Donoghue, to implement large portions of the Act and the establishment of the legal entities and boards of the National Museum of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland.</P>
        <P>When discussing commemorations we need to be aware that memory has its politics.  If this decade of centenaries is either too controlled by the State or watered down so much as to avoid dissent or anxiety it will be a missed opportunity.  The value of mutual respect, as the Minister eloquently stated in his speech, is the value that should drive commemoration and I applaud his vision for this.  Sean O&rsquo;Casey&rsquo;s <i>The Plough and the Stars</i> was written not as a commemoration of 1916 but as a critique of the failure of the Rising and the promise that was not delivered.  Are we prepared as a nation to look at some of our national events and judge ourselves against the values of those participants?  The Proclamation promised to guarantee religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.  It also acknowledged differences among citizens.  Therefore, any approach we take to marking commemorations should be about the future.  How do we value ourselves now as a nation?  We are morally, socially and financially bankrupt.  How can we use commemoration as an act of renewal and reimagining of our communities and society?</P>
       <P>It might be an idea to examine the issue of excluded narratives as the Proclamation is full of them.  We should consider how we let down our fellow citizens and our children and have denied equal opportunities to all citizens.  With regard to the Easter Rising, Diarmaid Ferriter recently wrote: &ldquo;Inevitably, there were different meanings ascribed to 1916, and it was presented as &lsquo;an idea, an ideal, an illusion and a delusion: all bitterly fought over&rsquo;.  Commemoration also involved the exclusion of alternative narratives.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>We need to mine the past, as we have often done, to meet the needs of the present.  Our President recently stated: &ldquo;The anniversaries are an opportunity too to retrieve a sense of peace with our complex identities.&rdquo;  The challenge for us is to create a new story, narrative and myth of Irishness and our President is encouraging us to use memory and imagination as a way of renewing our collective sense of what it is to be Irish.  In a recent speech given in New York, he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Renewing Ireland and with it our sense of what it means to be Irish is one of the most urgent challenges facing us at present.  It is a challenge which encompasses and underpins economic renewal but also which goes beyond it.  It is an exercise of empowerment in constructing an ethical relationship with others and it can be emancipatory in freeing us from models of economy and society which are not only failing but which are disastrous in their social consequences.</P>
        <P FLI="0">What an excellent vision for us to inform our future planning of the commemorations.</P>
        <P>The role of the contemporary artist should also be central to the discourse and debate on how we respond to commemorations.  Artists were central to the discourse and debate leading up to the events of 1913 to 1921.  They offered diverging and diverse perspectives.  Artists should be commissioned and encouraged to engage in reflecting this decade of centenaries.</P>
        <P>Yesterday in the D&aacute;il, the Minister acknowledged artistic and curatorial autonomy is a major consideration for him and I support this.  To achieve it, every cultural organisation needs not only legal independence but also moral and political independence.  I know this to be true as the director of the national theatre.  The Minister stated autonomy is achieved by having an independent board and chair; an independent director appointed and answerable to the board; and governance and procedures which guarantee transparency and help fundraise.  The Minister supports Government proposals for the mergers, amalgamations and dissolutions but we want to support him in not letting this happen.  While we are all agreed on the need for cost cutting and shared services, I would urge the Minister to try to have some of these policies revoked.</P>
        <P>Culture Ireland, which has worked well since its establishment, had an independent board and chief executive officer.  While the Department was aware that the CEO&rsquo;s contract was to expire in May, it made no plans for putting in place a successor.  It has now advertised the position internally but there is no independent board to interview the candidate.  Will the Minister confirm if there is an independent arts expert on the interview panel or if any member of the cultural board will interview the future director of Culture Ireland?  Will he also confirm whether he intends to amend any part of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 as introduced by former Deputy Michael D. Higgins, now the President of Ireland?  The removal of boards will not save money.  These boards guarantee the artistic and creative autonomy which the Minister desires, as stated so eloquently by him yesterday in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The Crawford Gallery, National Gallery and the Irish Museum of Modern Art have put an excellent idea in terms of shared services to the Minister, which I support.  I urge him to allow them retain their dignity and independence by retaining these boards.  My final question to the Minister, whom I thank for sharing his thoughts with us, is whether he can confirm when the vacant positions of the director of the National Archive and director of the National Museum will be advertised.  The uncertainty created in this regard does not bode well for the delivery of a programme of commemoration for our citizens.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister on his achievements thus far but I urge him to take a leading role in promoting the values of our fractured and diverse narratives and to include all of our citizens and cultural institutions in that process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I, too, welcome the Minister to the House.  There have been many strong and powerful contributions during the debate on this important issue.  I am delighted to take part in this important debate on A Decade of Commemorations.  It is hoped people from across the island of Ireland, North and South, will, based on their own perspectives, historical analysis and ideologies, take part in the commemorations over the next number of years.  Given the diverse number of events proposed there will be much commemoration throughout the island of Ireland during the course of the next ten years.</P>
        <P>The Ulster Covenant, the Dublin Lockout, the First World War, Easter Rising, foundation of this State and the partition of our country are all important events in the history of Ireland.  It is important in commemorating these events that we remember that at its core commemorating is remembering.  We do not always have to agree with what happened.  Senator Gilroy referred to the First World War and the Battle of the Somme.  While as a republican, I would have huge difficulties with the people who fought in imperial wars, I also respect and understand the reasons many people fought in the First and Second World Wars and why they should be remembered and commemorated.  As a republican, I will be commemorating the foundation of this State and the 1916 Rising.  It is important also that as republicans &mdash; I mean that in the broadest sense of the word &mdash; we spell out what it means to be republican and to be a republic and that we learn from history and remember what it was that all of those people struggled, fought and died for.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris made the point that some of the people involved in the foundation of this State and the Rising had opinions which he would not share.  He is possibly right.  However,  the Proclamation which hangs proudly in the Houses of the Oireachtas and in the living rooms of many homes throughout the country is a timeless document, one which offered hope to the people of this country at that time, states that we should cherish all the children of the nation equally, wants to see a genuine republic which embodies the spirit of the united Irishman and of uniting Catholic, Protestant and dissenter.  That is what the celebrations should be about.  When we remember 1916 it should be about all of those things.  The peace process and huge developments made in this regard open up new opportunities for us to commemorate 1916 in a different and, hopefully, more inclusive way than was the case in 1966.</P>
        <P>It is important we understand the complexity of our history and that we create space for all of those who have different views and come from different traditions.  The First and Deputy First Ministers in the North are trying to work through this in terms of the decade of centenaries that will take place in the North.  There are some events that will obviously be more important to people from one tradition over the other.  However, this must be marked and underpinned by mutual respect around where people come from and their different historical, ideological and political backgrounds.  This is happening in the North.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is interesting that we had two members of the Ulster Unionist Party, one a party leader, in the Public Gallery, today to listen to some of this debate.  I would welcome the address by the Orange Order to this Seanad.  It would be the first time the Orange Order will have directly engaged with a representative of my party, which will be historic in its own way in terms of those representatives having to answer questions put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.  Again, I hope that event will be respectful and that we can work through, in a constructive way, the complexities of our history.</P>
        <P>For me, it is important that we draw inspiration from all of those leaders of the past with whom we have an affinity.  I referred earlier to the 1916 Rising.  We must now live up to the ideology and aspirations of those involved for a united Ireland, an Ireland which has a true republic, one which cherishes all of the citizens of the nation equally.  That, for me, must be what 1916 commemorations are about.  The anniversary next year of the 1913 Lock-out, when people took a stand when locked out of their jobs because of the manner in which they were treated at the time, will be an important occasion.  The rights of those people were denied.  Some 99 years on workers continue to be shut out of their jobs resulting in sit-in protests such as at Vita Cortex, Waterford Crystal, La Senza, GAME, Lagan Brick and so on.  While we remember the 1913 Lock-out it is important that we do more than that and ensure that the rights of working people are strengthened.  It is regrettable that as we go into the anniversary of that Lock-out we still do not have trade union recognition or the right to collective bargaining in this State.  This needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>While those events are important to me, I understand and respect that other events will be important to other people.  At the core of commemorations for me is that we remember.  I remember all of those people who died in the First and Second World Wars, the 1916 Rising and all others who struggled for their own reasons and from different perspectives over the generations in this country.  As stated by a number of speakers, this decade of commemorations gives us an opportunity to deal with those complexities in a mature way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a great honour to serve with the Minister and his officials, John Kennedy and others on the Decade of Commemorations Committee, which is important in terms of acknowledgement of all the historic events which helped shaped this nation.  While we must broaden our sympathies we do not have to lessen our loyalties.  For a republican like me, the centrepiece of this decade of commemorations will be the 1916 Rising and the ordinary yet extraordinary men and women who did an extraordinary thing on an ordinary day, namely, took on the biggest empire the world had ever seen and struck a fatal blow.</P>
        <P>The 1,600 men and women who went out on Easter week took on an empire in which the sun had never set and was at a day&rsquo;s sail from Dublin.  By the time the war had finished Britain and her allies had mobilised 17 million men.  The Irish Volunteers were taking on odds of 11,000:1.  The empire controlled 450 million people at the time, which was one in every four of the world&rsquo;s population and had control of 13 million square miles of land, which is equal to one-quarter of the planet.  Consider what those people did, when they appeared to have no prospect of success.  Ultimately they did succeed, as a result of which we have this Chamber and the D&aacute;il.  The decade poses a number of opportunities for projects through which we can show the current generation what had to be done to achieve the Republic.</P>
        <P>The military archives will put on a digital display so the world can see all those who participated in the 1916 Rising and the War of Independence.  It means that every community will have an opportunity to see who fought and served in those events from their own area.  The proposed freedom trail, similar to the Boston Freedom Train, would follow a line through the city connecting all the major locations connected to the 1916 Rising, including the Garden of Remembrance, Moore Street, the GPO, Wynn&rsquo;s Hotel, Liberty Hall, Pearse&rsquo;s home on Pearse Street and the Royal College of Surgeons, among others.  One of the central points must be what can only be a dark stain on the entire nation, namely, the fact that now, 96 years after the Rising, the General Post Office is still solely a post office and not a centrepiece for a nation to come and reflect on such extraordinary people, as would be the case in any other country in the world.</P>
        <P>As Senator Cullinane said, every Member has a particular topic within this decade in which he or she is personally interested.  Senator Bacik spoke about the 1913 Lockout which was not only important in this country but throughout the world as it showed how capitalism, at its worst, can mobilise to inflict such pain on ordinary people.  Senator Mac Conghail correctly made points about arts and culture.  Without the Abbey Theatre, the culture of Ireland and the literary environment, there would have been no 1916 Rising.  We must protect those institutions.  I ask the Minister to take the issues raised by Senator Mac Conghail on board.  There was also the very important contribution by Senator McAleese, who knows more than most the opportunities that this decade of commemorations offers in terms of reaching out, as well as the potential for things to go badly wrong if it is not managed properly.  All sides of all traditions must show respect to each other to ensure this decade of commemoration is conducted in a fitting and appropriate manner.</P>
        <P>The Proclamation, which Senator Cullinane discussed, is a document we can still reflect on today.  That should be a part of our celebrations of the 1916 Rising in terms of how we benchmark ourselves against the aims and objectives set out in that timeless document.  The challenge for this generation, as in the case of previous generations, is how to fulfil the objectives laid out in the 1916 Proclamation.  In these difficult times, and we have experienced difficult times previously, we believe in ourselves enough to overcome the challenges we face.  The people who fought in 1916 and those who struggled so hard through the centuries to achieve the Republic we have, are worthy of our respect and proper commemoration, especially through events such as the celebration of the events of 1916.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been a very helpful debate and some very good ideas have emerged from it.  I sincerely thank the Senators for bringing them forward.  I got a number of good ideas which I will discuss.</P>
        <P>The issue of the national cultural institutions was raised.  I am still waiting for proposals from my officials who have been in constant communication with the various national cultural institutions.  They meet on a regular basis.  When the public service reform agenda was announced last November our Department set up a reform office and a reform committee.  It has been working on that since then.  Most of these public servants, from the Secretary General down, would have been in contact with all the cultural institutions over the years and people would be very familiar with each other and know each other personally.  They have been working together in providing funding for the cultural institutions over the last ten years, so it is not a case that these people are strangers.  Very close friendships would have developed over the years between officials from my Department and the national cultural institutions.</P>
        <P>It must also be said that the Department&rsquo;s officials have been asked to come up with recommendations, but they are as sensitive as I am to the value of national cultural institutions.  Whatever will emerge from this review will, hopefully, strengthen those institutions.  I am very much in favour of the arm&rsquo;s length approach, wherever possible.  I recall that when the Arts Act was being debated in 2003, and Senator Mac Conghail played a very crucial role in that legislation as he was an adviser to the Minister, I argued that case strenuously.  I held up the debate for hours when people would have preferred it to finish but I believe in the autonomy and curatorial independence of the national cultural institutions.  I wish to make that clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister publish the reforms before they go to Cabinet or is that not the procedure?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think so.  There will be consultation, whether that means publishing something or not.  There will obviously be further consultation, and that is only fair.  I have been informed by my officials that intensive and extensive consultation has already taken place with the cultural institutions.  A very good proposal was received in the Department from the galleries and yesterday a proposal came from the chairman of the National Library, for example, with suggestions for a good way forward.  All of these will be considered.</P>
        <P>It is also worth mentioning that, unusually, a large number of vacancies have arisen for directors of the national cultural institutions.  The director of the National Library has served part of her contract term but she is relatively new.  There are new directors of the National Gallery, IMMA, the Chester Beatty Library and the National Concert Hall.  There are a number of new directors.  The director of the National Museum availed of the early retirement offer and there is now an acting director in place.  That is going through the normal process and somebody will be appointed to the position as soon as possible.  The same applies to the National Archives.</P>
        <P>Culture Ireland is not a national cultural institution.  There was a proposal some time ago that it would be, but it was decided in 2008 that this would not be the case.  It is within the Department.  A chief executive from outside the public service was appointed at that time.  The person was on contract for a number of years, but that contract ceased.  That person did a very good job but if the contract was renewed it would have to be a permanent position.  That could not be done because of the complexity of our employment law.  It is unfortunate because, coming up to the Presidency, he could have played a critical role, having built up such a reservoir of contacts all over the world, in Europe and in the US.  However, that is employment law.</P>
        <P>The position is now being advertised internally.  Some very good people are working in Culture Ireland and are familiar with the range of contacts the previous CEO had.  I am sure they could operate very well in the position, which runs for 15 months from 2 July.  After that, it will be re-advertised.  The urgency is that Culture Ireland will play a critical role in our upcoming Presidency.  No decisions have been made and the discussion in the debate will further inform matters.  When a decision is made, it will be taken at Cabinet and there will be further consultation with the national cultural institutions.  I hope that whatever happens helps the cultural institutions improve their present functions rather than being a negative force.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mentioned community involvement.  We are writing to all national community groups in the country to come up with proposals.  We will have a forum featuring those groups in September to make proposals for the centenary of commemorations.  I agree with his point that we will have national commemorations but commemoration at local level is also important.  I was delighted to turn the sod for the Thomas McDonagh centre in Cloughjordan.  I saw the whole community, of all political persuasions, come together in an effort to have the centre open before 2016.</P>
        <P>Senator Noone referred to cultural institutions and Clontarf.  We are in contact with the national cultural institutions.  Dublin City Council has major plans for Clontarf and other local authorities also have plans.  Advanced proposals for the Killaloe commemorations are being led by Mr. Keith Woods.  They have connected well with the Nordic countries and come up with exciting proposals.  There will be a programme for Clontarf and, as I pointed out to Deputy McGrath, Clontarf was more of a battle between Munster and Leinster than between Munster and the Norsemen.  On the opposite side to Brian Bor&uacute; were 4,000 Leinster men and 3,000 Norsemen.  There were more Leinster men than Norsemen.  Sometimes, it is portrayed as driving the Norsemen out of Ireland but, while it affected their influence here, it was not just Ireland against the Norsemen.  A commemoration with proper historical backup and evidence could shed new light on Clontarf.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senators McAleese and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that consultation and care will ensure our commemorations can address the sensitive issues in our history.  I recognise the contribution made by Senator McAleese to the process.  During his wife&rsquo;s presidency, he was working behind the scenes building bridges across communities North and South, which was the vision of his wife when she was President.  He succeeded in getting communities into the &Aacute;ras and speaking to people who never had contact with leaders in this country.  The all-party Oireachtas committee met the Unionist Centenary Council, led by Mr. Stephen Gough, and a cross-community group chaired by Dr. Ian Adamson, another individual making major efforts to get both communities working together.  He is a former mayor and high sheriff of Belfast.  He was with Mr. Jackie McDonald from the UDA, Mr. George Newell, and the republican Mr. Se&aacute;n Murray.  He brought these people to the committee and we had a positive engagement.  I recognise the work of Senator McAleese to bring both communities together in Northern Ireland and to connect us with those communities, especially the Unionist community.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik raised the role of women in revolutionary activity, the transformative effect of the suffragettes and electoral reform.  When Churchill came to Belfast, he was not allowed into Belfast City Hall.  He went to a church to make his presentation and one of the voices of protest was a suffragette.  There is a celebrated photograph of Carson when he came to Dublin and a woman in the photograph is a suffragette.  The suffragette movement played a major role in the home rule movement.  It is important the movement is recognised.  The matter was raised in the D&aacute;il recently by Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, who spoke to a number of experts in this area.  I advised her that we will have an event and perhaps Senator Bacik can advise us on it.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I would be delighted to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We can do that as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik also mentioned labour law.  One of the people on the expert group is Mr. Francis Devine.  He was President of the Irish Labour History Society.  He will provide us with valuable advice on the suffragette movement and the Labour movement at the time.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Bacik&rsquo;s point about involving young children.  In many cases, young children do not understand what happened in 1916.  It has gone out of conversation at home.  When we were young, we were brought up believing different versions of events but we all knew that 1916 happened.  We all had great respect for the men of 1916.  Afterwards, family views divided.  If Senators ask children, they will be amazed at the level of knowledge of 1916.  It is important we use the period to reconnect with young people, even in preschool, about the events of this period.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris came up with a very good idea for the celebration of the Irish Republic in conjunction with other republics, such as France and the USA.  It is a strong possibility and I will bring it to the attention of the Taoiseach.  I have heard the view discussed that 1916 created divisions in this country through our celebration and our approach to it.  In a way, it is suggested that it incited some division, particularly in Northern Ireland.  However, I do not agree that how we celebrated 1916 is the reason for the Troubles in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>There were other reasons.  We have moved on.  As a number of Senators have said, the commemorative displays at that anniversary were to show that we had arrived.  We can now celebrate the commemorative decade in a totally different way.  In spite of the criticisms of the position in which we now find ourselves, we are in a much better place as a country than we were 100 years ago.  There are still opportunities for people in the country.  We should not blame others for not achieving at this time.  We have had significant achievements in a number of areas and should not denigrate ourselves now.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Norris, let me say this commemorative decade gives us the opportunity to develop a new programme and open a discussion on our history.  Senator Bradford referred to the very good idea of Australia remembers.  I am aware that Australia is putting a very special programme in place for the commemoration of the First World War.  We are developing links as we have a significant connection with them, when one considers that 8,000 Irish men died on the Australian side in the First World War.  Our programme for the Great War will align itself very closely with the Australian commemorations, especially with the commemoration of the Gallipoli campaign in 2015.  I totally agree with the point made by Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan that no party has ownership of the foundation of the nation.  All political parties owe their origins to 1916 and the years prior to it.  With the establishment of an all-party committee, I am trying to be as inclusive as possible and all the good ideas raised by Members will be discussed.  Senator Daly has come up with some very good ideas, and today Senator Bacik referred to the Suffragette movement and I will certainly work with her on that.  It was suggested in the House that the life of &Eacute;amon de Valera was not being commemorated in some way in Dublin.  I would be glad to see Mr. de Valera honoured on the centenary of the Rising.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Minister that he has two minutes remaining.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The surviving leaders were not honoured in 1966 and that deserves further consideration.  I feel that in our struggle for independence, the contribution of W.T. Cosgrave, a Minister in the first de Valera Cabinet should be acknowledged in the appropriate way.  We have the opportunity in considering our past to look at the contributions of all our leaders and commemorate them in a collective inclusive way.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Mac Conghail&rsquo;s vision of defining a new Ireland and we have an opportunity to create a dynamic widespread debate on the way forward.  This commemorative decade is very important as it gives us the platform to open up debate at all levels of society, encompassing debate among academics and in the local community.  We have an opportunity to re-imagine Ireland.  We can use our cultural institution, especially the Abbey Theatre, which was a source of inspiration and a major influence on the leaders of 1916.  The ideas of Yeats and Lady Gregory were an inspiration to the leaders of that era.</P>
        <P>I totally agree with the point made by Senator Cullinane that our commitment to commemorate and engage with the history of the period is not restricted to our interest in our tradition or heritage.  We have an opportunity to draw inspiration from the achievements of our national heroes of that heroic age.  We should read about them and draw inspiration from what they said.  Our challenges are different but the principles that they died for should inspire us.  I agree with Senator Gilroy that we can join with the Unionist community in Northern Ireland in commemorating the memory of those who fought in the First World War, be it at Messines, the Somme, Gallipoli and in other battles.  In commemorating these battles we can build a relationship of tolerance with them.</P>
        <P>I thank members for the opportunity to debate the commemorative decade and for all the good ideas that have emerged from this discussion.  Senator Mark Daly is a very active member of the all-party committee and he has come up with excellent ideas such as a green line around Dublin, an historical trail and presenting a copy of the Proclamation on slate to all schools.  I would welcome ideas from Members on actions and events, as we must make the most of the opportunity that this commemorative decade presents.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, line 22, after &ldquo;Reform,&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;the Houses of the Oireachtas, relevant agencies and local authorities&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I would like to speak on amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  I will not pursue amendment No. 5.  I assume the Minister of State understands the logic that underpins amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which are similar in nature.  The amendments seek to ensure there is relevant consultation before any decision is made.  The amendments provide that &ldquo;the Houses of the Oireachtas, relevant agencies and local authorities&rdquo; will have to be consulted.  Although it is stated in the Bill that this section relates to &ldquo;corporate bodies&rdquo;, my understanding is that it relates primarily to the Local Government Management Services Board.  The section will streamline some of the existing powers, functions and services of the board or of local authorities with the intention of saving money, eliminating waste and creating efficiencies.  We do not have any difficulty with attempts to create efficiencies and save money, but we do have a difficulty with the proposal to give the Minister the sole power to make decisions in this regard.  Therefore, the purpose of amendments Nos. 1 and 2 is to increase the democratic input into such decisions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 5 will give the Minister the power to establish bodies to assist him or her in carrying out these duties.  Given that some of the functions of any such body are likely to be among the key functions performed by organisations, including local authorities, it is not appropriate for them to be transferred by means of a mere ministerial order.  Such an approach has the potential to undermine significantly the operation of local government.  I am sure we will discuss the local government aspects of this matter as we make progress through the various sections of the Bill.  There is a fear that many of the decisions that are being made on local government reform are not being made on the basis of genuine consultation.  Democratic involvement is needed as part of inclusive negotiations with all the relevant bodies, such as the local authorities and the agencies that might be losing powers or being subsumed into other organisations.  There is a particular need for the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to be consulted.  That is central to these amendments.  The primary function of this House is to ensure Senators can make an input into important decisions of this nature.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 2 is similar to amendment No. 1 in the sense that it aims to provide for greater clarity and accountability.  Section 5 of the Bill provides that when the Minister is making an order and potentially taking some services away, he or she shall have regard to &ldquo;the promotion of efficiency, effectiveness and economy in the organisation and provision of the services in question&rdquo;.  I suggest that a determination should also be made on whether centralisation, regionalisation or localisation are desirable when the number of bodies providing these services is being reduced.  Many questions should be asked when a decision of this nature is being made.  The local authorities and the Houses of the Oireachtas are uniquely well-placed to recognise whether any of these criteria are being met.  That should not be determined solely by means of a ministerial order.  This House and the Lower House should have a say as well.</P>
        <P>Any proposal to transfer or subsume powers is important, even if the changes in some areas are slight.  While we do not want to micro-manage every aspect of what a Minister does, we should have a say when he or she intends to take powers from one body and give them to another body.  We should ensure that some of the decisions that could be made under this legislation are referred to this House to be decided on by democratically elected Members of the Oireachtas.  Such decisions &mdash; we will speak later in this debate about the proposal to give the Minister the power to amalgamate local authorities &mdash; should not be made by the Minister alone.  There will be a democratic deficit if the people who live in those communities are not consulted.  I suggest such a decision should be the subject of a plebiscite in the locality in question, rather than being made by means of a ministerial order.  I will not speak on amendment No. 5 as I do not intend to pursue it.  I remind the Minister that I have proposed amendments No. 1 and 2 to ensure that when these decisions are being made, there is relevant consultation with &ldquo;the Houses of the Oireachtas, relevant agencies and local authorities&rdquo;, rather than such decisions being made by the Minister alone.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments seek to introduce a requirement for the consent of or consultation with the Oireachtas, agencies and local authorities in the administrative process of establishing new bodies and in the preparation of transfer orders in the context of bodies that are being dissolved.  The principle of a Minister in a sector such as local government having the power to establish bodies to provide shared services for local authorities is long established and is recognised by the courts.  Senator Cullinane acknowledged that this Bill will strengthen the link between the principles and policies in primary legislation and the bodies to be established.  The consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is required before any body can be established and any transfer order can be made.  Therefore, the issue of efficiency and effectiveness within the sector and the wider public service efficiency and reform agenda will both be fully considered.  The rationalisation programme has already been delayed due to the necessity to dissolve bodies through primary legislation.  It would not be in the interests of efficiency to accept amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and I do not propose to do so.  I acknowledge that the Senator is not pursuing amendment No. 5.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for her response.  I am pressing these amendments.  Given that some of the functions that may be transferred are key local government functions, the Government should ensure the local authorities and the Members of this House are properly consulted.  The reserved and executive functions that form part of the infrastructure of local government are important.  It is only right that there should be democratic input into any decision that could remove power, however slight, from local government.  As I said on Second Stage, if we continue to take power from local authorities, there might not be much local government left.  It is intended to take responsibility for water services away from local authorities.  A number of other plans are in train as well.  Many people are asking what services local authorities will end up providing if we keep hollowing out what they do.  I appreciate that this section of the Bill does not deal directly with that.  We are concerned that as a result of this Bill, the potential will exist for some powers to be removed from local authorities and subsumed into national organisations.  I fail to see why the Minister of State cannot accept that the Members of this House and of the D&aacute;il are elected to make sure the decisions that are made are scrutinised properly.  It is inappropriate to give the Minister of the day a free hand to make any decisions he or she deems necessary &mdash; in this case, shifting powers around &mdash; without having to consult this House or the D&aacute;il.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the points I have made.  If she is not willing to do so, I will have to call a vote on these amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate that the link between the principles and policies in primary legislation is being strengthened in this Bill.  Any decision that is made by the Minister will have to be made in that context.  The focus of this Bill is relatively narrow.  Senator Cullinane referred to the wider issue of local government reform, which is not encompassed in what we are talking about.  We should confine ourselves to the narrow focus of this Bill.  There is a long-established precedent that the Minister should be able to make these decisions.  As I have said, I do not propose to accept Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the Minister of State has said, a specific provision in the section of the Bill dealing with local government will allow a single official to manage both of the electoral areas that are to be merged until the new system is put in place.  I suggest that consultation is extremely important in this regard.  In that context, I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister of State correspondence sent by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to county managers in recent days.  The Minister wants a questionnaire to be sent to every local authority member in the country.  It seems that will be done by means of a very circuitous route.  The questionnaire will be sent to the county managers, who will send it on to each councillor in his or her area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this relevant to the amendments before the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be relevant in a second, if the Chair allows me to finish.  I would like the Minister of State to ask the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to extend the amount of time that is being provided for this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We talk about consultation and inclusiveness.  Most councillors have not yet seen the questionnaire but are being asked to return it by tomorrow week.  I take this opportunity to ask the Minister of State to deal with the matter urgently and to ask the Minister to extend the date to at least 22 June.  It is archaic in this day and age to send out a document to each county manager to be sent on to elected representatives.  Why could it not be sent directly to each elected representative?  I ask the Minister of State for a direct response on this and I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me contribute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I can see where the Senator is coming from.  We do not want powers removed from local government but on the other hand we do not want to tie its hands or those of the Minister if he sees the need for immediacy in the establishment or dissolution of a body.  We are aware of the circuitous route legislation can take.  Therefore, I can understand why the Minister of State will not accept this amendment because the Bill is tight and focused.  In general, all of us would be against removing powers from local government.  We seek devolution of power rather than its removal.  I know where the Senator is coming from on this, but I can envision issues and avenues arising where immediacy is required and where the Minister&rsquo;s hands should not be tied behind his or her back.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Landy on the need for a time extension because of the circuitous route the e-mail is taking.  I took it on myself to send it directly to some councillors because I am aware that sometimes people sit on an e-mail for a few days before forwarding it.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, lines 4 and 5, after &ldquo;centralisation&rdquo; to insert  &ldquo;or localisation&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;or localisation&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;centralisation&rdquo; in lines four and five on page five.  The intent of the Bill is set out in section 5, paragraph (<i>d</i>), which refers to &ldquo;the desirability of regionalisation or centralisation&rdquo; but it does not mention localisation.  The focus or logic of the approach of Government and local government reform and governance during the past decade or more has been on centralisation, sucking more power into the centre.  We have seen that in local authorities, the health service, with the disbandment of the old health boards, and other areas as well.  The principle of subsidiarity should also underpin what the Government does.  There should be no predetermined outcomes of simply wanting to centralise or regionalise, there should be a localised element to it as well.  The Minister of State and her party when in opposition would have made similar arguments, namely, that democracy is best served at the lowest possible level.  Senator Landy made an interesting point yesterday in response to a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator that France and the UK have a much higher representation of local public representatives per head of population.  I am not saying we should have the same model as France or the UK but we do not have a big number of public representatives in this State by comparison with the UK.  If we were to continue on this drift towards centralisation and regionalisation and not have a local focus, that would be a mistake.</P>
        <P>I will not labour the point because our problem with the wording is that it sets reform on a path that is about centralisation and not one that could be about localisation and devolving power to authorities in the local government.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment, as the Senator said, requires the Minister to have regard to the desirability for localisation as well as centralisation of services in making decisions in regard to the establishment of a State body.  Localisation of service delivery is the existing default position.  In other words, it is assumed under the subsection that the local authority provides the service.  In order to maintain the services with diminishing resources it is necessary that staff and management in local authorities work together to find efficiencies of operation and share service delivery where possible.  I do not propose to accept the amendment on the basis that it is already the default position that the service would be provided locally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is default position, it should be easy for the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I support the amendment.  It may be that small is beautiful.  The managerial speak of the Department with responsibility for local government from many of its manuals, which are about 20 years out of date, assume that people at the top know better than others what they should think and do.  The problem with that is that it comes without numbers.  We have numbers from an bord snip nua, which I put on the record yesterday, that the number of senior civil servants rose by 72% in a period in which the number of ordinary civil servants rose by 27%, and we also had two rounds of benchmarking.  If we had done the numbers on whether things are best localised or centralised, we might get a different result than that which is assumed, namely, that big is beautiful and that small is ugly.  I am concerned there is a momentum behind this that operates without reference to the numbers.</P>
        <P>I would cite Mr. McLoughlin in the review group&rsquo;s report and I wish more Ministers would update us on his report, a point to which I return.  He dealt with the impact of the moratorium on recruitment in a paper he presented to the Kenmare conference two years ago and found that the number of directors was down by 7%, clerical and administration staff were down by 4%, professional and technical staff were down by 3.7% and outdoor staff were down by 13%.  Too much managerialism in the system leads to loss of appreciation of what can be done locally.  Mr. McLoughlin had an interesting photograph in his paper of a man called Andre digging a hole, obviously depicting the productive part of local government and he had nine managers looking at it, and they said &ldquo;We might need to get rid of Andre as part of our new efficiently drive&rdquo;.  There should be an annual report at this stage on the progress of the implementation of the recommendations in Mr. McLoughlin&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I mentioned Jennifer Hough&rsquo;s article which set out that there are five directors of services in a local authority in a small county such as Carlow while Westmeath, with nearly twice the population, gets by with two.    In the same article, Ms Hough observed that having read what the Minister, Deputy Hogan, had to say in the Seanad debate, &ldquo;all Mr. Hogan offered was more platitudes and the promise of yet another report&rdquo;.  Moreover, elsewhere in the article she noted &ldquo;the Dublin city librarian earns more than the prime minister of Spain&rdquo;.  Consequently, one must consider different ways to deliver local government.  At present it appears to be highly bureaucratic, at a time when it is getting rid of the outdoor workers.  In addition, one must know what managerial efficiencies will be available on foot of the loss of large functions in respect of roads, housing, health and refuse collection.  Members also have voted recently to transfer the administration of driving licences to the people in Ballina and responsibility for water is about to be moved out.  When do such managers actually become accountable?  Should the concept that small is beautiful not be considered in respect of local government?  There is a problem and I am unsure whether the Custom House as a whole is addressing seriously these issues, even though the Secretary General of the Department sat on the group that produced the McLoughlin report.  The House should be told the numbers from these efficiencies and the gains.  While everyone supports the need to reform this country because of the difficulties in which we find ourselves, I hope that when Ministers make speeches about local government in Ireland without referring to the McLoughlin report, it is not because they intend that it simply go away if nothing is done about it.  Ministers must confront the senior people in county councils and in the Department itself to ascertain what they are doing because they are extremely expensive and there appears to be less and less product emerging at the far end.  Perhaps it is time to have more localisation in local government as proposed in this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Lest it be thought I was opposed to this amendment because of my opposition to the devolution of powers to local government, I wish to speak to the Act and to the amendment, in that the Act referred to as &ldquo;the Act of 1971&rdquo; is the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971.  The Minister of State referred to the local government body that has responsibility at present and so this is the Act that is governing the body.  Consequently, Members are discussing and are working on local government.  This is not at all about devolution of functions but pertains to the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971.  I would be completely in agreement with the amendment, were it the case that local government was being left out and regional government or centralisation was being included in an Act, or that some functions were being taken that were not there.  However, it is the opposite because this Bill pertains to the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971, which is a local government Act.  The amendment should be ruled out of order because it does not refer to the points on which the Senator has spoken.  I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s point that local government should always be considered in any devolution of function or powers at local level.  However, I wish to put on record that I will be with the Minister in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator Keane&rsquo;s comments.  While I have the highest of respect for Senator Cullinane, he has misinterpreted the original statement within the Bill.  He probably has honed in on something and perhaps has had a little bit of tunnel vision in this regard.  Consequently, having heard the clear and eloquent explanation given by the Minister of State, I ask the Senator to withdraw this amendment.  It is clear that what he has sought to have included by way of an amendment already is encompassed in the body of the Bill and with the greatest of respect, I ask Senator Cullinane to withdraw this amendment as it is unnecessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senators Keane and Landy have just noted, this provision does not in any way preclude any decisions in respect of devolution.  This part of the Bill relates to section 3(1) of the 1971 Act and consequently, this is not about precluding any devolution of functions or powers to local government.  This provision is specific to this particular area and as I have already stated, the default position is that a service is delivered locally.  This is where a decision is being made to deliver it either regionally or centrally.  Consequently, it does not in any way preclude decisions in respect of further devolution of powers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There was no misunderstanding.  I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s point that Members are dealing with local government powers.  However, this section of the Bill outlines the purpose for which bodies may be established under the 1971 Act.  The Bill&rsquo;s digest sets out for the first time the nature of the services that may be provided by any body that would be established under the Act.  It pertains to the provision of procurement services, the supply of goods and related services and the provision of agency services, including the collection of charges and late payment fees, as well as the provision of shared and centralised services.  Consequently, I see no contradiction in including a formula of words because while I acknowledge the possibility of centralisation or regionalisation is there, localisation can mean a number of different things.  It could mean shifting power from one local authority to another, such as, for example, from a city council to a town council or whatever.  There has been no misinterpretation by Sinn F&eacute;in in this regard.  Our problem is the entire drift is towards centralisation and towards sucking power to the centre.  The entire focus and mindset is on that and not on localisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the assertion that somehow there is a focus towards centralisation.  This legislation pertains to efficiency and there are reasons one would do certain things in a shared way.  This does not mean that somehow the entire focus of local government reform is on centralisation.  I reject that proposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>While it might be difficult for Senator Cullinane to accept he is wrong, perhaps on this occasion he might accept he is not right.  Perhaps he will leave it at that without forcing an unnecessary vote.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, line 11, to delete &ldquo; &lsquo;services&rsquo; includes&mdash;&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo; &lsquo;services&rsquo; not already being provided by boards may include&mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will not speak for too long on this amendment because I want to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response before coming back to it.  In some respects, this amendment is related to the first two amendments which sought a greater level of consultation.  We are still on section 5 which deals with bodies that may be established under the 1971 Act.  It states that the Minister can only establish a body to provide services which relate to the performance by him of his functions or the performance of a local authority and its functions.</P>
        <P>Our problem is that we are trying to provide services which can be taken on by such bodies but which are at the moment, by and large, already being provided by local bodies and are not being transferred.  It goes back to the point we were making initially about giving the Minister powers to make these decisions.  We do not believe the Government should be undermining local government.</P>
        <P>We are concerned here with the provision of procurement services, the supply of goods and related services, the provision of agency services, including the collection of charges and late payment fees, and the provision of shared and centralised services.  Some of these services may be transferred from different bodies and the Local Government Management Agency, which is what this Bill is about.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that services which are being provided by local government are not transferred into some national body without consulting the Oireachtas.  Although it does not say so, it is related to the first two amendments.</P>
        <P>Before I consider whether or not to press the amendment, I will listen to what the Minister of State has to say.</P>
      </Speaker>

Any services to be provided for by the new bodies will have to be contemplated by the Oireachtas under the new subsection (9).  Therefore the description of services at subsection (9)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>k</i>) is sufficiently comprehensive and encompasses any services now performed by the existing agencies, and any services likely to be provided by an amalgamation or reorganisation of existing bodies, or indeed the establishment of new bodies under the legislation.</P>
        <P>I suggest therefore that the amendment is not required and I do not propose to accept it.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, line 40 and in page 8, line 1 to delete paragraphs (<i>f</i>) and (<i>g</i>).</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment concerns the dissolution of the Limerick regeneration agencies for the north and south sides of the city.  I am sure the Minister of State will be aware that many people in regeneration areas have genuine fears about the future of the process, not just in Limerick but in many parts of Dublin where regeneration was also promised.  In order to allay such fears the Government should clearly spell out what it intends to do for the future of regeneration, including what will happen in Limerick, Dublin, Cork and Waterford where they are still waiting for regeneration schemes.</P>
        <P>I understand that this measure specifically deals with the Limerick regeneration boards.  There is a need to set out clear targets and timeframes for the completion of an ambitious building programme.  It should be part of a stimulus package.  There is much talk of the need for investment at the moment and a growth agenda, as well as using State funds whether from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, selling off State assets or using money from NAMA.</P>
        <P>I agreed with the Labour Party&rsquo;s election manifesto pledge for a national retrofit programme to generate jobs.  I fail to see, however, how that sits with abolishing these boards and the consequences that may have for regeneration programmes.  Will regeneration remain as a stand alone programme within a local government structure or will it be totally subsumed to the extent that its focus will be blurred because of the Government&rsquo;s many pressing priorities?</P>
        <P>In my speech on Second Stage yesterday, I mentioned that when the Limerick regeneration plan was first announced it was done with great fanfare.  Yet we have seen 1,000 houses knocked and only 34 houses built.  I assume that since the Minister of State is from Limerick herself, she is concerned about the slow pace of progress on these regeneration schemes.  Perhaps she can indicate for us the logic of disbanding these boards and what exactly the Government intends to do to ensure that the promised regeneration schemes, which were necessary for Limerick&rsquo;s social integration, will go ahead.  The Government should also ensure that people will not be left behind in this respect.  I assume the Minister of State agrees that there is a lot of fear and concern in the directly affected communities about how all of this will play out.  Is regeneration going to happen and, if so, at what pace and what is the timeframe?  This amendment is about our concerns for the regeneration process.  I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an important point in Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s amendment.  Yesterday&rsquo;s debate did not refer to the savings to be made from the abolition of these two agencies.  I am trying to get a more cost-conscious approach to the issues arising from the McLoughlin report.  The Government needs to live within budgets, but no statement has been made on how much will be saved in this context.  At the time, it might have seemed like a good idea to abolish both agencies but we have to see what costs and savings are involved.  Will it enable us, as we all want, to build more houses in Limerick?  I would be obliged if the Minister of State could give us an estimate of the savings from the abolition of the two quangos.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment seeks to remove the provision to dissolve the Limerick regeneration agencies.  The agencies had a cessation date built into their establishment orders, which is this summer.  The Oireachtas confirmed this in the context of the Confirmation of Orders Act 2008.  This Bill merely provides for the administration of that process.  As stated earlier, the regeneration office will take over the regeneration function.  I do not propose therefore to accept the amendment.</P>
        <P>I wish, however, to respond to both Senators.  It is my absolute intention to ensure that not only will we continue with regeneration but that we will speed up the process.  Primarily, the winding up of these two agencies will not save a huge amount of money.  We are talking about a structure that does not have a large number of people working for it.  It will, however, speed up the process because it will all be brought under the one office.  Up to now, for example, the council was responsible for most of the housing elements, and the regeneration agencies were responsible for other elements.</P>
        <P>They are the three pillars of regeneration.  There is physical, social and economic regeneration.  The physical and the economic areas had not been progressing as well as we would have preferred but I am confident this will accelerate progress.  Senators will be interested to learn that on Tuesday Limerick City Council approved a manager&rsquo;s report on the construction of 79 houses on Edward Street in the Ballinacurra Weston area.  Other housing developments are progressing and, as Senator Cullinane noted, the intention is that 100 units will be under way this year.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I recognise that Senator Barrett is concerned with quantifying the money saved but this measure is not as much about saving money as about making the process more effective.  I am confident that the winding up of the agencies will improve the process rather than hinder it in any way.  I have engaged with people on an implementation plan for completion of the projects.  That plan has to be agreed through local consultation, something of which Senator Cullinane will approve.  Extensive consultation is ongoing with local communities on every element of regeneration.  That will continue because their representation will continue.  The intention is to bring further clarity to local residents on what is happening through these implementation plans, which we expect to be agreed in the near future.  After extensive consultation with locals in all four of the regeneration areas in Limerick, I am confident this will improve the process.</P>
        <P>In regard to the other regeneration projects, Ballymun has its own agency and a process is being agreed in this regard.  I agree that other parts of the country also require regeneration.  A number of areas in Dublin, in particular, require regeneration.  That process has started but we need to ensure the money we invest is wisely spent so we can spend it on the work that needs to be done in the various parts of the country where regeneration is especially needed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that the process is speeded up in the way the Minister of State describes.  I wish her well in that regard and welcome that Limerick City Council approved the construction of 79 new houses.  She also mentioned an implementation plan.  I support local consultation but I think we can agree that extensive consultation has already taken place with the relevant agencies.  The problem is that the agencies have not fulfilled their mandate.  I cannot hold the Minister of State responsible for that because previous Governments were to blame.  Many of the residents with whom our public representatives have spoken genuinely fear that if the regeneration programme is subsumed into local government it will make matters worse rather than speed them up.  It is not clear to us what effect the programme will have once it comes under the remit of local government.  I listened to what the Minister of State had to say but I must also heed our public representatives on the ground in Limerick when they relay to us the concerns of residents.  While I hope she is correct in her prediction that it will speed up the process, I am still minded to press the amendment because of our genuine concerns about the agencies being subsumed into the local authority.</P>
        <P>On the broader issue of regeneration, if the Government was to introduce some form of stimulus in the short to medium term an investment in regeneration and retrofitting would get people back to work and bring social and economic dividends.  This is an area in which our limited resources would be well spent in terms of stimulating the economy and any initiative in this regard would get the full support of my party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was genuine concern when it was first announced a couple of months ago but consultation has been ongoing since then.  I have personally participated in meetings with community representatives from each of the four regeneration areas as recently as last Friday.  The positive nature of this development is understood.  If the Deputy takes a different view, however, he is perfectly free to press his amendment but I assure him that people have been reassured by the consultation that took place subsequent to the announcement.</P>
