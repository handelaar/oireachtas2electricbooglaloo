	<P>I have received notice from Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to outline his views on the reduction in the home-school liaison allocation to Riverchapel national school, Gorey, County Wexford.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">Go nd&eacute;anfaidh an tAire Oideachas agus Scileanna r&aacute;iteas maidir le todhcha&iacute; na sc&eacute;imeanna scol&aacute;ireachta tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al neamhtheoranta agus teoranta &oacute;n nGaeltacht, Seachtain na C&aacute;sca agus Donagh O&rsquo;Malley a bh&iacute; ann go dt&iacute; seo; c&eacute;n l&iacute;on acu a bhronntar go bliant&uacute;il, c&eacute;n luach at&aacute; ag baint leo agus c&eacute;n bhuis&eacute;ad a chuirtear ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh gach bliain.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Thomas Byrne of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to discuss his response to the Irish Cement industrial dispute in Meath and Limerick.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Michael Comiskey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to allocate emergency funding to Cregg House in Sligo which provides care, education and support for 214 people from the north-western region, given that efforts to resolve funding issues have been unsuccessful.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator David Cullinane of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social Protection to review the issue of supports for people who are unemployed in accessing third level education, with particular reference to the eligibility criteria for the ICT skills programme 2012 and the requirement to be unemployed for six months or more to qualify for social welfare payments.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to provide capital funding for upgrading works on the St. Johnston sewerage scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Michael D&rsquo;Arcy, Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Thomas Byrne and Michael Comiskey and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Cullinane may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise. I regret that I had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill because the relevant Minister has no responsibility in the area. It is a matter for Donegal County Council. </P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union) Bill 2012 - Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 3 p.m., if not previously concluded; No. 2, motion pursuant to section 23 of the Referendum Act 1994 concerning a statement for the information of voters, to be taken without debate &mdash; although I am sure it can, if necessary, be discussed during the debate on the Bill &mdash; at the conclusion of No. 1; and No. 3, statements on the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, to be taken at 3 p.m. and conclude not later than 6 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed six minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 5.50 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to inquire whether the Leader has an update in respect of the report of the working group on pyrite.  I welcome his indication yesterday that the House will engage in a debate on this report and also on building control issues relating to Dublin and other areas throughout the country.  Will the Government support the call from the residents of Priory Hall to the effect that when he meets representatives from the Irish Banking Federation later in the week, the Taoiseach should insist that the federation and the relevant mortgage lenders take part in the conciliation process?  As stated yesterday, I welcome the fact that such a process is taking place.  However, the involvement of all stakeholders, particularly the banks, is required.  If the Leader would convey my message in this regard to the Taoiseach I would be very grateful.</P>
        <P>As each day passes, it is incumbent on the House to engage in a full and proper debate on the Government&rsquo;s position with regard to water charges.  I indicated yesterday that the problems in this regard follow on from those relating to the debacles involving both the septic tank and the household charge.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, has confirmed what people in Dublin already knew, namely, that up to 39% of homes in the capital and the surrounding county are not suitable for metering and that a flat charge will, therefore, apply.  This means that certain people will not be obliged to pay for the water they use.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Figures released in recent days show that the Government has spent over &euro;7 million on obtaining policy advice from private consultants.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and his Department paid PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, over &euro;130,000 for advice on how to establish Irish Water.  PwC clearly stated that the latter should be a separate State entity which should not be held under semi-State control.  When it received this advice, the Government effectively threw it in the bin along with the &euro;130,000 paid for it.  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, paid Goodbody Economic Consultants &euro;300,000 to produce a report on how to go about selling VHI and then promptly decided to discard the advice offered.  These figures represent only a small proportion of the &euro;7 million spent overall.  The latter amount does not include the money Government Ministers are paying to private spin doctors.  I will not even refer to the breach in salary caps which the Government continues to condone.  The money paid to the private spin doctors to whom I refer has not really been well spent, particularly when one considers their performance, and that of the Government, in the past three to four weeks.  If I was a member of the Government, I would seek to obtain assistance from others in the context of matters relating to communications.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, come before the House to explain the position with regard to water metering and the proposed property tax and the figures that are being bandied about in respect of both.  There is total confusion with regard to water charges and different messages are being issued by different Ministers and Departments each day.  The only contributor to the debate on water charges from the Labour Party has been the T&aacute;naiste, who commented on the Sunday before last that a decision had not been made when, in effect, it had been made.  Obviously, there is a drive on the part of Fine Gael to impose these charges on people.  As already stated, over one third of people are not going to be in a position to have meters in their homes.  The Government is to spend over &euro;1 billion putting a system of water metering in place but it does not really have a clue as to how it is going to proceed.  It is important, therefore, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, should come before the House today to explain the position and to provide clarity in respect of this matter.  If my amendment to the Order of Business is accepted, perhaps Deputy Hogan, as the senior line Minister, might be able to provide clarity once and for all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien raised the issue of water charges.  I have gone on record in the House previously &mdash; I am happy to do so again &mdash; to indicate that I am very much in favour of such charges.  It is important to ensure sustainable use of this scarce resource.  As has been stated previously, so much rain falls in Ireland that it is difficult to believe it is a scarce resource.  It is, therefore, important to use water in a sustainable way and we must encourage people to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We must manage our resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>In other countries where people are charged for the use of water, the price falls and it becomes more economical.  In principle, I am very supportive of the notion of water charges.  I accept, however, that there are some issues with regard to how such charges will be imposed.  I was certainly dismayed to read the comments attributed to one person who suggested that it would be difficult to put in place meters at all properties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">Senator Bacik to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>If I could finish, the decision makers in respect of this matter are all in the Cabinet.  It is important that they should make a decision based on the experience elsewhere.  Ireland is the only country in the OECD which does not charge citizens for water.  I presume that other countries have overcome the difficulties relating to putting meters in place in apartments.  Professor Richard Tol has put forward some very useful suggestions with regard to alternative ways to ensure that people can be charged based on usage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Charge them by the bucket.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;rather than being obliged to pay an average charge.  I am sure there is a way around the difficulties in this regard.  Water charges are not about to be introduced imminently and there is time to achieve a solution that will be both sensible and sustainable.</P>
        <P>The Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union) Bill 2012 continues today.  I welcome the reports in this mornings newspapers in respect of the T&aacute;naiste who, over the heads of certain union leaders, has appealed to trade union members to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum on the stability treaty on 31 May.  This is an important appeal and I hope that when it makes its decision tomorrow, ICTU will not direct its members to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Any rational reading of the treaty indicates that it would be against the interests of union members for it to be defeated because such an eventuality would give rise to the creation of a great deal of instability.  The latter would not be good for jobs or for union members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">Yes.  He stated that we had a gun to our heads.  As a lawyer, Senator Bacik should know that a contract extracted under duress is illegal.</P>

	<P>Senator Norris should desist.  Does Senator Bacik have a question for the Leader?</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>If Senator Norris would allow me to speak, I believe he will be interested in what I am about to ask the Leader.</P>

	<P>I am always interested.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am requesting a debate on the forthcoming merger of the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission.  The working group&rsquo;s report was published late last week and it contains some sensible and worthy suggestions, including that the new entity &mdash; the Irish human rights and quality commission &mdash; be independent and adequately resourced in order to allow it to carry out its task.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure whether the Minister for Education and Skills is due to come before the House to discuss any particular business in the immediate future.  In that context, I request that the Leader arrange for him to appear before us to inform us of his plans with regard to the establishment of institutes of education.  It appears the Minister has ordered a review of teacher education and today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> reports that this is expected to back the establishment of institutes of education.  It is obvious, therefore, that somebody in the media is being briefed as to what is going to be the likely outcome.  I am of the view that it would be appropriate for the Minister to come here in order to hear the opinions of Senators on this matter.  In general it would be a good idea if we would have centres of excellence in teacher training.  There is an interesting debate to be had about whether such centres of excellence should combine teacher training for pre-primary, primary and secondary level and whether it is necessary or appropriate that all teacher training should be provided within particular institutes.  What we could agree on easily is the need for diversity.  There has been much talk about the divestment of schools and there has also been the forum on patronage and pluralism.  There is also talk about the status of stand-alone schools.  It is clear we are looking at a future in which there will be much more diversity of identity, style and characteristic spirit in our schools.  What would be most important, therefore, is that we would have a plurality of types of teacher training rather than looking at some stand-alone, one-size-fits-all State model which should be avoided.  That is a very important point that will need to be made.  I hope we would have the opportunity to debate it with the Minister here.</P>
        <P>One critical issue that applies to schools is the issue of bullying.  Bullying for whatever motive or of whatever kind needs to be stamped out in every school.  I welcome the intervention yesterday of Mr. Jeremy Prince, father of the late Phoebe Prince, who as we know killed herself as a result of severe bullying in the US in 2010, and encourage the work of the National Anti-Bullying Coalition.  This should form the basis for a debate in this House.</P>
        <P>I commend the Taoiseach for the very open approach he took in consulting with the various parties and groups in this House about the proposed constitutional convention.  Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l raised a question in the other House as to what is happening with and what precise timetable there will be for the convention.  It would be useful if we would hear from the Government on this.  As there are so many diverse issues proposed to be considered by this convention, it is probably the case that we should ensure we vary Members partaking in the convention on an issue-to-issue basis.  It is important that whatever issue is discussed this House would set the standard for the diversity of viewpoints and ideals being represented on the constitutional convention, especially as it is not clear how the non-parliamentary members of the convention are going to be chosen or whether there is any particular way to ensure diversity in their choosing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Regarding water charges, if we go back far enough to the EU water framework directive and subsequent legislation we can see it is not a Labour Party or Fine Gael development.  As Senator Bacik said, in every country in Europe people pay for water and it is not because everybody wants to but for quality and sustainability of water supply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to investigate how the advice of Ms Marie Mackle, a senior official in the Department of Finance who courageously sought to demonstrate that Ireland&rsquo;s property boom was not based on sound fundamentals, was ignored?  We have all read it in the newspapers.  The Department of Finance was advising the Taoiseach of the day and this official was screaming for the madness of the property boom to stop but was ignored.  The warnings were dismissed and erased from public statements by senior officials in the Department of Finance.  Some of these officials are still occupying top posts in the Department. Are they still erasing what they think a Taoiseach should not hear? The scandal of this cover-up in the Department of Finance is documented in a full file compiled by Ms Mackle which she had intended&mdash;&mdash; </P>

	<P Just="Left">A senior-ranking person in the Department of Finance was charged with the responsibility of giving advice to the Taoiseach and answering parliamentary questions.  I want to put it on the record that this person did not release any information or file into the public domain.  Somehow, however, it got out there which warrants another investigation.  While it is good it got out there, her warnings were systematically removed and erased from draft answers to parliamentary questions to Fine Gael Deputies who were in opposition at the time and had begun to ask the relevant questions.  I want an investigation into this. The person in question has said she feels isolated in the Department. I am speaking out on her behalf to ask why this is. </P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking for a debate on it.  I want the Minister to come into the House after, not before, investigating the matter to give us some answers as to why this happened and if it is still happening.  It came from a woman who was serious and, had her predictions been listened to, it would have saved this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the proposed amendment of my colleague, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, to the Order of Business.  On a more positive note in these times of doom and gloom, will the Leader have a debate on agrifood exports with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, who has taken up the initiative set in motion by the former Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, in his Harvest 2020 programme?  I compliment the Minister&rsquo;s success on his recent trade mission to China, an initiative embarked on by the late C. J. Haughey and followed up on by Bertie Ahern.  This is a positive news story.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister to explain to the House how through Bord Bia and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, we can actually implement the plans for greater agrifood exports.  It deserves a lengthy debate.  I have read about the Minister&rsquo;s exploits in China.  Coming from a fishing background, I was interested to note that he has agreed on exporting boar fish to China.  This fish is relatively new in Irish commercial markets.  Before, when it was caught by our boats, it was minced up for food for fish farms.  This is an interesting development on which I hope we can embark.</P>
        <P>China will soon be the greatest economy in the world.  There are in excess of 100 million affluent Chinese people with another 100 million close to being affluent.  That is a greater market than America and the EU.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will attend the House for a full debate not alone on his exploits in China but on the agrifood industry and if BIM and Bord Bia can meet the export targets set for the next seven years.  This deserves a full debate as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague Senator Keane in her call for a debate on what has emerged from the Department of Finance regarding a cover-up.  It is most outrageous that a competent and conscientious public servant&rsquo;s advice was ignored and interfered with several years ago.  If that good advice had been heeded, we would certainly be in a less difficult situation than we are today.  This matter demands that it be fully investigated and debated in this House while we learn from the mistakes made in the past.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to raise the issue of excessive booking fees which is a scandal and a rip-off perpetrated by many air transport companies, particularly Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  When will the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation bring forward the legislation to stamp out these excessive charges? To give Members a rough idea, Ryanair and Aer Lingus are charging &euro;6 per person per one way ticket. Potentially a family of four could pay &euro;48 for the privilege of booking a flight. </P>
      </Speaker>
        
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an internal matter for the airlines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter of great importance to citizens.  Companies such as Ticketmaster are charging 12% to book a ticket for a show or match.  Citizens are being charged excessively and the Minister is taking the issue so seriously that he is proposing legislation which should be introduced as a matter of urgency.  At a time when people are stretched, having to pay such charges on top of the cost of a ticket is excessive.  The matter should be regulated.  While I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to introduce legislation, we need it urgently as we approach the busiest time of the year for travelling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I dispute the statement that water is a scarce resource in this country.  How could it be?  We are saturated with water; it is a badly managed resource.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Internationally it is scarce.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had this argument before, but people used the words &ldquo;in this country.&rdquo;  It is not a scarce resource in this country.  I fully approve of water charges, but it would be ridiculous for the Cabinet to spend time considering the details of the mechanical application of water metering.  It has no competence in the matter, whatever competence it might have in other areas.  This is an engineering matter which should be left to those with competence in it.  Of course, there are problems.  When I bought my house, the pipe that fed it also fed the factory behind it.  It is no longer used, but there is planning permission for an apartment block; presumably, therefore, I will supply water to that entire apartment block.  When I asked for the water to be separated, I was told the local authority would not do it.  That is a practical problem that can be multiplied across the country.</P>
        <P>The situation with water meters is getting close to the e-voting machines scandal.  Apparently, it is proposed people will have to pay up to &euro;800 for each meter.  They are available on the open market for &euro;80.  Why do we not practice what we preach and buy them on the open market?</P>

        <P>Whatever about the scarcity of this resource, there will not be any scarcity of it tomorrow, according to Met &Eacute;ireann.  If its forecast is right, we will have the entire rainfall figure for the month of April.  Will the Leader ensure, in such circumstances, that we will avoid the situation that arose so sadly in Cork the last time, when the electricity generating authorities did not make provision in time and when the dam in the hydroelectric scheme started to overflow, they released water that added to the flooding.  Can we have a assurance there has been a little forward planning and the Cabinet will direct its attention to this matter rather than the minutiae of water metering, about which it knows nothing?</P>

	<P>It is disappointing, to say the least, that the trade unions are recommending a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the upcoming referendum.  Workers are the ones who will benefit from the proposed measures included in the treaty.  We must restore confidence in the country.  The treaty has been designed to avoid the reckless spending that took place in the last ten to 15 years.  It has been designed to promote an economy that will keep money in reserve and not think in the short term.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>The days when money is flowing and there is cutting when there are difficulties must come to an end and keeping nothing in reserve is an idea we must avoid in the future.

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The last time money was held in reserve for the people was when the National Pensions Reserve Fund was set up.  However, that fund was emptied to pay back speculators and bondholders.  Working people in this country got nothing; rather they were saddled with mortgage arrears, while 460,000 are out of work and 150,000 have been forced to emigrate.  None of that money was used in their interests.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste can try all they like to go over the heads of trade union leaders, but the T&aacute;naiste has no credibility with working people.  Let him go over the heads of trade union leaders.  He might appeal to card carrying members of the Labour Party who may be trade union members, but he will not appeal to ordinary working people who are crippled with austerity.  They see no plans to create jobs or help those in mortgage distress or lift the domestic economy.  They see a treaty that will institutionalise austerity for decades to come and tie the hands of future Governments in seeking to borrow to invest prudently.</P>
        <P>Senator Ivana Bacik can shake her head, but the reality is social democratic parties across Europe have opposed the treaty, as has the European Trade Union Confederation.  The Labour Party in other European countries opposed parts of the treaty when it was going through the European Parliament but because the Labour Party here feels it has no choice because it is in government, it is asking the people to vote for a bad treaty for working people who know this is bad for them, there will be more austerity measures and that it could potentially bankrupt the country.  I hope, therefore, they will vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Last Wednesday and Thursday there was a debate in the D&aacute;il on the issue of abortion.  Diverse views were expressed in that debate.  There was subsequent acknowledgment that the debate was conducted with great civility.  Today, we are fortunate to have the opportunity to hear someone who has campaigned internationally against the abuse of forced abortion, particularly in a number of Asian countries where female foeticide, gendercide and human trafficking are major and co-related problems.  The House has a proud record in taking on and advocating women&rsquo;s issues across a range of areas. Last year, Senator Bacik raised the issue of female genital mutilation and legislation forbidding this is now on the Statute Book. In an effort to continue that record, I urge Members to go to the audio-visual room at 4.30 p.m. to hear Ms Reggie Littlejohn, who has devoted a considerable portion of her energies and life&rsquo;s work to opposing the abuses of gendercide and human trafficking. The meeting will be enlightening for us. I urge Members to go. Whether one is on one side or the other of the abortion debate, I have no doubt that we re <i>ad idem</i> in opposing forced abortion, gendercide and female foeticide.  I call upon the group leaders in the House to bring forward an all-party motion condemning that practice and seeking changes. If we secure a place on the United Nations Human Rights Council this should be one of our main platforms during our tenure on that body.  I urge people to attend the audiovisual room at 4.30 p.m. </P>

I received an invitation to this event but it did not make any reference to abortion.  I find that disingenuous.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Once again, a request has been made for a debate on water charges.  Having a vote, morning after morning, on requests for the Minister&rsquo;s presence, apart from the politics of the matter, does not solve the broader issue.  If the water charges produce the full amount of money expected, that will still be a minuscule portion of overall Exchequer requirements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I repeat the call I made some weeks ago to ask the Minister for Finance to come to the House to talk about the broader future taxation requirements of the economy.  We all realise that the current tax base is limited and that we will have to look at new revenue raising measures and, I presume, some difficult options.  We need to discuss that range of options.  A number of commissions on taxation have produced ideas but these normally get as far as the Oireachtas Library, where they rest in peace.  It would be helpful if the Minister for Finance came to the House to discuss the general principles of taxation and outline the range of options that might or might not be on the cards, fiscally and politically, in the next decade or so. If we are to spend endless time talking about water charges which will bring in a possible &euro;150 million or thereabouts, how can we solve the bigger problems where billions of euro are required. </P>
        
        
        <P Just="Left">I agree, in general, with the comments of Senator Mullen on the constitutional convention.  It would be helpful to learn more about its make up.  I would not like the convention to take away the role of the Oireachtas.  I have no difficulty with expert groups or constitutional conventions looking at any subject under the sun.  However, we should not forget that we, the elected Members of the Oireachtas, are the people who must lead the debate and take the decisions.  Advice is all that can come from an expert group or constitutional convention.  We, the elected representatives, are the ultimate constitutional convention and we must not see our powers reduced in that regard.  While constitutional conventions are debating so-called great topics, we need to keep up the debate in this House. It is here, where elected people can be hired and fired by the people, that decisions must, ultimately, be taken. </P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the expressions of concern regarding the civil servant whose remarks were widely publicised in the media at the weekend.  I also compliment the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts who has stated that the committee will investigate this issue, as well as other related issues.  This is not the first time the media have revealed advice given to senior officials in the Department of Finance, which they studiously ignored at a critical time in the country&rsquo;s development. Our party suffered from this to an extraordinary degree, as history now reveals. Questions are now being asked about what went on during that period. That is why I welcome the promise of the investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts. It will investigate the issues surrounding the events of that time. </P>
        
        <P>About a year ago, it was reported in the newspapers that a freedom of information request had revealed that, for a year following the introduction of 100% mortgages, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, constantly and regularly corresponded with the Department of Finance to warn of the adverse impact of 100% mortgages on the ability to repay of many of those who were taking up these mortgages.  The advice was studiously ignored.  In fact, the Department of Finance went so far as to say that the percentage of those who would acquire 100% mortgages was so small that it would have no impact on the housing market.  We now know this is a major issue and it is regularly debated in this House.  The Government is grappling with the consequences of the introduction of 100% mortgages.</P>
        <P>It is somewhat ironic, in light of today&rsquo;s debate on the fiscal treaty, that Ireland kept within the rules up to and including the crash of 2008.</P>

	<P>I wish to make reference to the decision of some trade unions, announced at the weekend, to oppose the fiscal treaty.  I ask the Leader to write to these unions and to other parties who oppose the treaty and ask the following question.  Should Ireland need further assistance from the EU, where do these unions, and others who are against the treaty, suggest that we get the money to fund their members&rsquo; increments, allowances and wages in the event of the treaty being rejected?</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Social Protection to the House to explain the delays of up to 18 months in the awarding of some social protection entitlements.  Hundreds of public servants have been transferred from other Departments and areas to the Department of Social Protection, yet the waiting lists are getting longer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In our discussions on water, there are aspects of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report which deserve our consideration.  First, the engineers have sought to portray the 41% of water that is unaccounted for as people wasting water in their houses.  One&rsquo;s house will flood.  In the garden, one&rsquo;s garden will flood.  It must be in the pipes outside houses and that is where the responsibility should lie.  Page 41 of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report states that only 52% of the commercial water rates are collected. I am sure the Leader will advise the Minister to get those local authorities to go and collect the money. At this stage, we are short of money. People are uneasy that the wastage problem is being visited upon them when it properly rests somewhere else and that money due to the water authority is not being collected. </P><P Just="Left">The final worrying part in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, on page 55, is that there is a substantial excess cost. They looked at 13 water authorities in Britain and Ireland and on all the indicators, Ireland is far behind. In Scotland, which seems to be the same kind of place with, as Senator Norris pointed out, much rain, the operating cost per connection is &euro;70 and ours is approximately &euro;230. There must be some emphasis on extracting efficiency out of that water industry before we start issuing bills to the public. </P>

	<P Just="Left">There is much merit in what Senator Barrett stated.  What we need in this House is a dedicated water day, where we look at all the elements of water supply.  This House should lead the debate on it.  Water is a precious commodity.  There are millions of people around the world who would only love a glass of water which we take for granted in this country.  A dedicated water day should look, in the first instance, at water conservation and lead the charge on educating the people on the vital necessity of water conservation.  This country needs a water conservation charter to which all citizens sign up.  Although there is 41% unaccounted for, there is a significant percentage of water wasted.  It is criminal to see that amount of water being wasted.  Furthermore, we could then look at best practice internationally because other countries have been charging for water for years. We need to look at what is happening in other countries and educate ourselves and the people as to what is happening elsewhere because we seem to have a tilted debate here. We need to wake up to the fact that in every other country people have been paying for water for years and the reason there is a botched water infrastructure is we have been giving it away for nothing. The only ones who have been paying for water are the farmers and business people, those who have been paying for a great deal in this country. We need to wake up and have a mature debate on water provision and we could start that by having a full day&rsquo;s deliberations in this House on the future of water services in this country. </P>

	<P>I support the comments of previous Members about the trade union movement and the fiscal treaty.  From listening to and reading media reports, it seems that there is a certain amount of confusion among many commentators.  The confusion seems to arise from mixing up two distinct economic elements: first, the need for the stability treaty to pass; and second, the need for a stimulus package.  The misunderstood link between both is that without access to international funding, there is not the slightest possibility of creating a stimulus package and without passing the treaty, there is not the slightest possibility of achieving access to international funding.  I call on the trade union movement to reflect upon this and reconsider its recommendation to its members that they reject the treaty.</P>

        <P>Senator Bacik stated that all decisions on water, and all other matters, are decisions for the Cabinet.

        <P>Senators C&aacute;it Keane and other speakers referred to recent revelations of a cover-up in the Department of Finance.  No person should feel isolated in such circumstances as the individual in question apparently did in this case.  As Senator Paschal Mooney mentioned, this matter will be dealt with comprehensively by the Committee of Public Accounts.  We all wish it well in its deliberations.  We can have a debate on the matter after it has produced its report.</P>
        <P>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan called for a debate on the agrifood and fisheries sectors.  The two debates we have had on agriculture and fisheries, both attended by the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, were among the best we have had in the House.  I am sure the Minister will be willing to come to the Chamber to report on the positive implications of his visit to China and debate whether, as Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan mentioned, Bord Bia and Bord Iascaigh Mhara can meet the targets outlined for them.  That would be the basis of a good debate and I will certainly seek to arrange it with the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Michael Mullins referred to the excessive booking fees charged by airlines.  I will ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport when he intends to introduce legislation to deal with this matter.</P>
        <P>Senators David Norris, Sean D. Barrett and others raised the need for forward planning in water management.  That is the reason the new body, Irish Water, is being established.  As I outlined previously, the service will remain in public ownership, which is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Senator David Cullinane referred to points made in reference to the forthcoming referendum.  I was disappointed that only one Sinn F&eacute;in Member had contributed to the debate on Second Stage of the Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union) Bill 2012, but I am sure that will be rectified on Committee and Remaining Stages.</P>

	<P>I also note Senator Paul Coghlan&rsquo;s comments on the referendum.</P>
        <P>Senator Jim Walsh referred to the issue of abortion.  I have indicated on numerous occasions that, in accordance with the programme for Government, an action plan was submitted and an expert group established under the chairmanship of a distinguished judge, Mr. Justice Sean Ryan, which is due to report in July.  The Government considers that group the appropriate forum in which to examine this complex and sensitive matter, to which we will return once its report has issued.</P>
        <P>Senator Paul Bradford called for the Minister for Finance to come to the House to discuss a range of options regarding the broadening of the tax base.  I will certainly ask the Minister to partake in such a debate.  The Senator also referred to the proposed constitutional convention.  I agree that the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas must be paramount in respect of any proposed changes and that all proposals must be debated in both Houses before being acted upon.</P>
        <P>I have referred to the point made by Senator Paschal Mooney on the role of the Committee of Public Accounts in investigating issues that have emerged relating to the Department of Finance.  The last Government did run surpluses on many occasions, but, as we learned to our cost, they were not built on sustainable foundations.</P>
        <P>Senator Tom Sheahan referred to several social welfare issues.  The Minister for Social Protection will be in the House all day Friday and again on Monday next, during which time the Senator will have ample opportunity to raise these issues.</P>
        <P>Senator Sean D. Barrett rightly points out that almost half of commercial water rates have not been paid.  I acknowledge that, in some cases, the businesses in question are no longer in operation.  Notwithstanding this, ensuring a more efficient method of collection of these charges is necessary if we are to make progress.  However, that is a matter for the local authorities.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary M. White referred to the attitude of union leaders to the forthcoming referendum, a matter I have dealt with.  I welcome the Senator&rsquo;s acknowledgement that confidence is beginning to return to the system, which we all hope will lead to the creation of more jobs.  A positive outcome to the referendum will certainly add to this.</P>
        <P>I will endeavour to accommodate Senator Mary Moran&rsquo;s request for a debate on the practice of symphysiotomy.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello.  Before Committee Stage commences, I would like to deal with a procedural matter relating to Bills to amend the Constitution.  The substance of the debate on Committee Stage relates to the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment which is contained in the Schedule to the Bill.  The sections of the Bill are merely technical.  Therefore, in accordance with long-standing practice, consideration of the sections is postponed until consideration of the Schedule has been completed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is like putting the cart slightly before the horse.  In other words, the Schedule is agreed to first, followed by the sections of the Bill.

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, and the debate on the fiscal compact treaty, even if it is in the context of processing the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>On the Order of Business many Members mentioned the trade unions which have come out against the treaty.  As the Minister of State knows, several trade unions have been very clear in their opposition to the treaty because they do not believe it will be good for Ireland and working people as it will enshrine austerity in law for decades to come.</P>
        <P>The backdrop to the debate on the treaty is provided by what is happening in the economy.  There are still far too many out of work and no real plans to get people back into employment.  People see the domestic economy floundering.  Further evidence of this was presented in a Bank of Ireland report published yesterday which stated domestic indicators remained weak, unemployment remained elevated and residential property prices did not appear to have fully stabilised.  It also stated there were heightened concerns about other eurozone economies.  This proves that across the European Union austerity measures are dampening economic growth and having the opposite effect of further job losses by taking money out of people&rsquo;s pockets.  The trade unions which represent working people have sensibly come out in opposition to what they see as a bad treaty.</P>
        <P>To be honest, the treaty does not solve the real problems in Ireland or Europe.  Many social democratic parties, with which the Labour Party is affiliated, and the European Trade Union Confederation have come out to state &ldquo;No&rdquo; to a treaty which will not work.  The ink was barely dry on the treaty when the conservative right-wing Spanish Prime Minister opted out of the fiscal adjustments which his country was asked to make.  We see the same happening in Holland where there are tensions between coalition parties in government because they cannot make the tough fiscal decisions because of the effect they will have on the Dutch economy.  Looking back at all of the budgets since 2008, we know we are no closer to being out of the economic mess than we were in 2008.  While Jack O&rsquo;Connor, general president of SIPTU, has not come out against the treaty, he did say the national executive council of SIPTU had decided that if the Government implemented a jobs stimulus plan, it would be prepared to recommend in favour of the treaty in the referendum.  Otherwise it cannot endorse it.  He has made the same point as Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>
        <P>The big issue in Europe is the lack of investment and growth.  The treaty will lock us into decades of more austerity and not deal with the real problems.  It will implement existing fiscal rules, already in place since the Maastricht treaty was agreed to, and the debt brake rule which asks member states to reduce their debt-GDP ratio to 60%.  Ireland&rsquo;s current debt to GDP ratio is 105%, with the Government telling us it will be 120% by 2015.  It must be remembered what that debt is.  Some of it is money borrowed in the sovereign bond markets by the previous Government.  Some of it is what we are borrowing because of the big black hole in the public finances.  However, some of it is also money used to recapitalise the banks and bail out bondholders.  We are being asked to pay back this debt faster, with no write-down.  After 2016, what will a reduction in the debt-GDP ratio from 120% to 60% mean?  It will mean more tough budgets and austerity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are also the fiscal discipline deficit rules, with the existing 3% Stability and Growth Pact rule and the structural deficit target of 0.5%.  In a useful briefing document from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service I note many economists differ on what the structural deficit is and how it is to be measured.  It was explained to us that a structural deficit would preclude short-term shocks or interventions in the cycle of an economy, with the longer-term cycle of an economy being considered. The deficit would be calculated on that basis. There are no clear guidelines or measurement of targets for how this is calculated but we are being asked to put these elements into Irish law and the Constitution. </P>
        
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">During the Order of Business, a number of Senators from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party also made the point that we had budget surpluses for years; therefore, we were not borrowing recklessly.  Greece was borrowing for day-to-day spending but in Ireland we had budget surpluses.  Even if we were to adopt the fiscal compact treaty, it will not ensure we never have a Celtic tiger scenario again.  It will limit the ability of member states to invest or borrow for day-to-day spending, forcing governments, where possible, to balance the books.  That does not accept the reality, as no small to medium-sized business would be able to operate under those very strict guidelines.  One can imagine if a small business could only borrow 3% above what is being taken in within a given year.  How could a business borrow to expand?  It would not be able to do so and the same applies to an economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all accept we must reduce the deficit and there must be an element of fiscal discipline.  We are going from an extreme where those in Europe argue there was much reckless borrowing but the reckless borrowing in Ireland was not done by the State or the taxpayers but by bondholders, banks and people lending to the banks.  Those banks in turn loaned money to developers who were speculating on the construction sector, and that is where there was recklessness.  This treaty does not deal with such issues, such as banking regulation.  We are not getting the real solutions to the problems in the economy, which is part of the dilemma and why many people will vote against this treaty.  We are simply locking ourselves into more fiscal discipline rules.</P>
        <P>There are times when governments can balance the books or when there is a surplus, which is great, but there are also times when a deficit is needed and one must borrow to invest as an economy needs it.  We are going from an extreme, with reckless spending and borrowing in the likes of Greece, to another extreme where we prevent any kind of real borrowing despite countries needing to borrow to invest.  If we are honest, much of this is about getting Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy over their respective elections.  They wanted tight, draconian and Germanic fiscal rules imposed on member states.  The treaty was concocted primarily by those two countries, with all the others asked to come in behind it and support the treaty.  Perhaps people felt we had no choice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question being levelled at those who oppose the treaty is where we will get the money.  I will deal with the issue and pose a number of questions to the Minister of State in that regard.  The first consideration is access to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, funding, which must be approved by the Oireachtas.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have indicated that the D&aacute;il will not make any decision on the ratification of the ESM until such time as the people have their say on the fiscal compact treaty.  If we say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the fiscal compact treaty, as I hope we do, I do not believe any Irish Government will accept the terms of the ESM treaty.  The fiscal compact treaty is intergovernmental and we can simply opt out, as is our choice, with other countries proceeding with the terms if they so wish.  Britain has opted out, as it saw this as sensible and in its own interest.</P>
        <P>Those in the Government are asking where we will get the money.  The Labour Party leader and T&aacute;naiste, at his party&rsquo;s national conference &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; loosely &mdash; said that Ireland would be back to the bond markets within the next two years.  He proudly proclaimed that, and if it is the case, we will not need access to the ESM funding.  The Government is accusing those who are opposing the treaty of scaremongering and being inconsistent but there is a clear inconsistency at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s comments.  On the one hand, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste are arguing that we will return to the bond markets and reclaim our sovereignty because we are making the right decisions but on the other hand they are saying that just in case that does not happen, we need the ESM as an insurance policy.  We are in a bailout programme and we are financed up to the end of 2015.  As a result, the issues only kick in after that time and it will only happen if the terms of the first bailout fail and we do not get to the 3% deficit target of the Stability and Growth Pact.  If we fail to get to the 3% target in the bailout terms, it will prove again that austerity measures put in place since 2008 would have failed.  That is the only reason we could be asked to get into a second bailout and apply for money under the ESM.  Why would we lock ourselves into more austerity in that respect?</P>
        <P>We had a good three hour discussion last night and yesterday, with only one contribution opposed to the treaty.  I know a number of Senators are shaking their heads when I am speaking but there is a different world outside this Chamber.  This room does not reflect public opinion and a good 40% of people have indicated they will oppose this treaty, with more people open to the argument.  People are not convinced by what the Government is saying, and the more trade unions and civic leaders come out to make the right stand for Ireland and its people &mdash; standing by the interests of those people &mdash; the better it will be.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The funding issue is a complete red herring.  That element was inserted into the treaty on purpose to blackmail people.  Mr. David Begg said the treaty was socially and economically wrong and if that is so, why should a single citizen in the State vote for it?  The response has been that we may need the money.  The reality is that Europe will not and cannot afford to allow Ireland &mdash; a eurozone member &mdash; sink.  The Government is convinced Ireland will return to the bond markets, which we want, and we should take different approaches in reducing the deficit, separating private banking debt from sovereign debt.  We should have a strategy to grow the economy in order that we can get back to the bond markets.  However, this country will not get there because of the kind of policies being implemented by the Labour Party as part of the Government.</P>
        <P>We have an opportunity for a proper debate, and this is only my initial contribution.  I hope we can have a robust, honest and strong debate about the implications of the treaty.  I also hope the Government will be honest about what the treaty can do for Ireland.  Many of those advocating a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, including many economists on the political right, are also indicating this is essentially a bad treaty.  Very few people are arguing this is great or good because it is not.  Our work will be tough, but if the treaty is ratified, it will be much tougher for this country.  The real danger will be long-term as we will tie the hands of future Irish Governments in the ability to manage the economy and fiscal and budgetary affairs.  Giving more power to the European Commission and the European Court of Justice is dangerous, as is the potential to impose sanctions on this country, which the treaty would also allow.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity for further debate on the treaty and hope there will be more balance in today&rsquo;s contributions, where there will be a flow as opposed to the statements we had on Second Stage yesterday.  I hope it will be a robust and honest debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins"><NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will address some of the points made by Senator Cullinane in particular.  Nowhere in the title of this treaty does the word &ldquo;austerity&rdquo; appear, and the Senator should be very careful in using the word.  The well-being and future of the country is at stake and the Senators should get that into their heads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>We understand it.  It is an austerity treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins"><NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>This treaty is about transparency and accountability, which Sinn F&eacute;in seems to be against.  It is also about precluding Governments from engaging in the reckless type of behaviour and spending policies of the past.  That is why I urge the Minister of State to ensure what the treaty stands for is outlined in clear, concise, layman&rsquo;s terms in the information leaflet being sent to every household.  That is imperative to prevent fudge, which would allow opponents of the treaty to make hay.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>If I was to allow my heart to rule my head in this debate, I would agree with what Senator Cullinane outlined.  He has made a coherent, cogent argument as to why the treaty should be rejected by the people.  However, he made a reference to living in the real world and perhaps it would be instructive to reflect on what is happening in the real world.  I hope the Minister will respond to this comment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Political upheaval is under way in France with the expected demise of President Sarkozy and that has implications for the eurozone and for relations between France and Germany if Monsieur Hollande is elected, as he has indicated he will renegotiate the treaty and add a growth element to it.  There was shock news yesterday out of the Netherlands, one of few countries with a triple A rating.  Its Government has collapsed because it could not agree budgetary proposals which, by comparison to what has been imposed on the programme countries, pale into insignificance, as they comprise a relatively small amount.  A wind of change is sweeping across Europe which is reflected in the first round of voting in France with the concerted rise of the far right vote and in the collapse of the Dutch Government, which is also centre right.  The message seems to be that people are beginning to increasingly question the concept of austerity and how long it will last.</P>
        <P>From an Irish perspective, the real world is that as a result of the upheaval yesterday, Irish bond yields, which were on a downward trajectory over the past number of months because of the work the Government was engaged in and because of the manner in which it was selling Ireland, increased.  Investors who have money dictate bond yields and, ultimately, whether Ireland can return to the bond markets and borrow money at a reasonable interest rate that will not put further obligations on the Government, the very thing Senator Cullinane and his party constantly tell us we should avoid.</P>
        <P>While the world will not come to an end if we reject the treaty, we will send a clear message to the very people we hope to go back to for money in two years&rsquo; time.  They will say, &ldquo;You are not even prepared to get your own house in order.  You are not prepared to pay back the money you have borrowed so why should we give you anymore?&rdquo;  David Begg is right on two fronts.  He is right about his attitude towards the treaty but he is equally right that it is effectively a gun to our heads in that if the Irish people fail to ratify the treaty, it could close off all the opportunities we have to access further funding that we will need.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I stated earlier on the Order of Business that I had no wish to rewrite history.  We can feel grievously wronged because we played by the rules until the bank crash in 2008 while France and Germany were not adhering to the Stability and Growth Pact agreed under the terms of the Maastricht treaty.  Ireland continually returned budget surpluses.  In 2006, the much maligned former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, was Minister for Finance and he generated a budget surplus of &euro;3 billion, &euro;2 billion of which was set aside to reduce the national debt with the remaining &euro;1 billion invested in the capital programme.  That has been forgotten in the tsunami of insults and attacks thrown at the Fianna F&aacute;il Administration for being reckless.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since 2008, when the bank crash happened, we have been saddled with bank debt, as have other countries.  It is instructive, and perhaps the Minister will respond to this, that economists now suggest that because of the fear surrounding Spain and its increasingly unsustainable debt, Europe will have to look at the sustainability of bank debt in the medium and long term.  Large economies such as Spain could have a greater trickledown effect if they go under and have to enter a bailout programme than tiny Ireland.  A debate is beginning as to whether the ECB should step in or whether eurozone governments should examine the possibility of reducing the unsustainable Spanish bank debt.  Spain is in the same position as Ireland, except on a much larger scale.  If that is the case, it would be sensible and selfish to send the message that the people will vote for this treaty on the basis that we agree that we need to get our house in order. We cannot continue to sustain massive deficits and I am glad Senator Cullinane and his party agree that the gap should be bridged. He agrees that we cannot sustain a &euro;15 billion budgetary deficit annually. Neither he nor Sinn F&eacute;in has indicated at any time where they would get the &euro;15 billion but that is for another day. He has at least conceded that this is unsustainable. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">We are getting our house in order.  There is a dispute over the EUROSTAT figures that emerged in the media in the past day or two but it seems that we are ahead of target at 9.6% of GDP and moving towards an end of year total of a little over 8%, which will eventually reach 3% by 2014.  It is not as if we have stopped progressing.  We are moving towards balancing our books.</P>
        <P>When one weighs all of that up, it is not just about today.  It is about what will happen in two years and when we achieve a balancing of the books, we can look to return to the bond markets for money.  Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s party says there are times when governments can borrow into deficit for investment purposes.  If we fail to pass the treaty, the message that will send could be hugely damaging to the country.  David Begg is correct that the unions will be pulled kicking and screaming into accepting that the treaty has to pass but he is a realist.  Who is living in the real world?  The treaty is no panacea and the wind of change blowing across Europe suggests the treaty and its implications may be revisited.  We are staring into a hole of uncertainty because economic circumstances are ever changing.</P>
        <P>Our reality is that we are moving in the right direction.  The Government hopes to get into the bond markets within the next two years and we will be close to a balanced budget at that point.  We will then be able to argue the case that the bank debt is unsustainable and I agree with Senator Cullinane and many others about this.  We cannot allow this albatross to sit on the shoulders of future generations.  It has to be addressed and I believe it will be.</P>
        <P>Let us take tiny steps first and cross every bridge as we come to it.  The fiscal treaty is the bridge we now face, flawed and all as it is.  No detail is outlined in the treaty to address the questions raised by Senator Cullinane and others about the definition of &ldquo;structural deficit&rdquo; and what sanctions will be imposed if we breach the budgetary target of 3% of GDP.  The reality is that we want to send a message of a strong and confident Ireland that is trying to get its house in order and balance its books to ensure the gap between income and expenditure on essential public services is bridged in order that we can convince those who have the money that we are a good bet and have not defaulted on our debts.  At that point, the case to be made for tackling the unsustainable bank debt would be so strong, with the aid of what is happening in Spain, and possibly Italy, which is suffering under much larger bank debts, that the logic would be that some form of compromise and accommodation will be agreed.  For my part, I believe that will be quantitative easing, a devaluation of the euro.  It has been proven in other countries, when a country has control of its currency to the point where it can adjust it to take account of the economic realities, that it is a way out of the austerity to which Senator Cullinane referred.  That is an argument for another day.  What we are faced with is our immediate future as a country and whether we are capable of sending a message to the people on whom we will rely that the steps we are taking are difficult and painful.  I am opposed to austerity.  It appears to be an unending saga, worse than the longest running soap on television.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with great interest to Senator Mooney&rsquo;s contribution.  I agree entirely with him.  He put the case cogently in favour of the Bill.  Senator Cullinane made an eloquent Second Stage speech.  On Second Stage I thought we teased out the issues.  None of us is suggesting the treaty is utterly great or that it is a panacea.  We are all realistic about it, as Senator Mooney has said.  It is not helpful for those on either side to speak in overblown language on either sides.  The approach on both sides must be measured.  As others have said, David Begg&rsquo;s comments were measured.  He made the point that he is not widely enthusiastic about the terms of the treaty but accepts the alternative &mdash; the instability and uncertainty and the message it sends to potential investors and others &mdash; is worse for working people.  That is why, on balance, it appears he is taking an approach in favour, although we must wait and see what ICTU does.</P>
        <P>The referendum, if passed in accordance with the Bill, would put into the Constitution the text that the State may ratify the treaty.  It does not put the text of the treaty into the Constitution.  That is an important point that has, perhaps, been overlooked in the debate.  Others have asked the Minister about the text that will go to households along with the text of the treaty.  I presume families will also see what they will be asked to vote upon on 31 May and will see the text of the amendment to the Constitution.  It is important that people get advance notice.  We have had referenda where people had only seen the text in the polling station.  That is not helpful to ensuring people vote in an informed manner.</P>
        <P>In response to a couple of the points made by Senator Cullinane, and without making another Second Stage speech because I spoke yesterday, there is not a simple left-right divide on the issue at EU level.  The party of European socialists did not vote against the stability treaty but against some elements of the Stability and Growth Pact at an earlier stage.  Ultimately, those who voted against the treaty included not only Sinn F&eacute;in but UK conservatives and the UK independence parties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt the Senator.  It is worth making the point that this is not a simple and straightforward divide.  There are many parties and individuals on the left in favour, just as there are many on the right and on the far right who are opposed to the treaty.  The potential incoming French President has made the point that he will include more elements of growth in the treaty, which is something we argued for from an Irish perspective.  Page 1 of the preamble to the treaty refers to growth.  The Library and Research Service gave an excellent briefing to Senators in advance of our previous debate on 14 March.  A key point I took from the briefing was that 90% of the content of the treaty has already been agreed and is in place through existing measures such as the Stability and Growth Pact.  Therefore, there is not a great deal that is new in the treaty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Mooney that none of us in favour of austerity.  How could we be?  To speak of the treaty bringing in decades of austerity is not helpful to the debate.  What the treaty is trying to do and what those who negotiated it are trying to do is to fix the causes of austerity.  This is only part of the jigsaw of different measures and nobody is saying this is the golden solution; far from it.  We have to be realistic, but it is one way of trying to hold the euro, which is our currency, together.  Yesterday, Senator Barrett made an eloquent speech about the flaws in the original design of the euro but, as I said in response, we are where we are.  We must move on with what we have and try to shore up our currency for the sake of the people and the economy to ensure jobs and stability are maintained and we move towards growth.  It is helpful that we have a measured and reasonable tone, that we do not shout abuse across the Chamber at each other on this issue and the debate at national level is conducted in the same way.  That is what we would all hope for in the debate.  On Committee Stage it is useful to reflect on the actual words in the Bill.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is another classic example of the democratic deficit.  A colleague in the other House, Deputy Catherine Murphy, who sent around a very interesting document, pointed out that although we are just discussing the Schedule, which is a short brief piece of prose, it contains wording that has only been used three times before and always in situations when there was a substantial ceding of sovereignty from this country to centralised bureaucracy in Europe.  That is a point that should be borne in mind.</P>
        <P>The whole treaty is a farce from beginning to end.  The Minister, whom I know as a former neighbour and regard still as a good friend, despite our political differences on this specific issue, knows perfectly well it is a farce.  What are we voting on?  Let us look at the political situation.  I said yesterday it is likely that Monsieur Hollande will be the next president in France and he has committed himself to changing the treaty.  What we are going to vote on will be changed.  It is an illusion, a mirage.  There is also the situation, which I find intriguing, of the Dutch Government having collapsed because Geert Wilders got out of it.  He is right wing but he cannot stomach and does not believe the Dutch economy, one of the few AAA rated economies in Europe, can take the &euro;15 billion cuts that will be involved.</P>
        <P>We have been told, very honestly, that Mr. Begg has said the single reason for voting for the treaty is we have a gun to our head.  He is absolutely right.  People are trying to point a gun at our head.  Senator Bacik, as a distinguished lawyer, must know that a contract extracted under duress has no legal force.  If the gun is pointed at our head and an attempt is made to pull the trigger, it will not blow us out of the water.  It will blow our assailants out of the water and expose them for what they are, a collection of bullies who do not know which direction they are going in.  There has been no centralised leadership in Europe whatever.</P>

	<P Just="Left">No, not necessarily, but I am against centralised folly.  Let me just examine a few of the other clich&eacute;s that have been delivered today.  First, I believe it was Senator Bacik who said &ldquo;we are where we are.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I was using it ironically.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What a novelty.  I do not think I have heard that before and I shall certainly write it down in my little book for further reference.  Senator Mooney on our side of the House tells us that he is living in the real world.  I think I am living in the real world too, but we just take different views on it.  The world is either real or it is not real.  To say that one is living in the real world does not mean that one can use that phrase to discredit other people&rsquo;s opinions.  We just take different views.  That is what I call civilised debate.</P>
        <P>In regard to the impact of this treaty, we were told that passing this referendum will show that we are a strong and confident country.  Like hell we are.  I wish we were a strong and confident country.  I would love it if the rate of suicide was not continuing to climb because of the economic pressure, not just in this country but throughout Europe.  I would love it if the citizens of Europe were not queuing at soup kitchens in the centre of Amsterdam.  I would love it if people were not living in cardboard boxes in Syntagma Square.  Two weeks ago I was in my local supermarket in Cyprus and when I came out, an elderly man and two young fellows were collecting to buy food for the people in Greece.  We are witnessing the slow disintegration of capitalism.  Those on the left should be proudly raising the red flag and asking people to look at the real alternatives.  This process was initiated in the United States by co-operation between what I regard as international criminal elements, namely, Goldman Sachs, which was paid &euro;600 million for cooking the books for the Greeks to get them into the euro in the first place, and the ratings agencies, about which I have been speaking in this House for at least the past five years.  I think we are seeing the beginning of a sort of disintegration and the only way forward is to put humanity and respect for citizens at the core of our policy.  I have been making this point for quite some time.</P>
        <P>When the banking issue was being debated in this House, I said to the people who are now sharing this side of the House with me and to the late Brian Lenihan, who was making the point that Anglo Irish Bank had to be saved because it was of systemic importance to the Irish economy, that although I was not an economist, my analysis of the language of his speech suggested he was saying the preservation of the system was of more significance than the welfare of the people.  That is wrong.  The welfare of the people must come before the preservation of the system and let us deal with what happens to the system after the shake-out.</P>
        <P>My point is that our primary responsibility is to the people in this country.  In total, 50% of young people in Spain are unemployed, but in a region in the north west of Spain, the exact name of which I cannot remember, things are doing quite well because the people have taken control by developing co-operatives and everything is done on a co-operative basis, including banking.  It is rather like what our building societies used to be before people, such as Mr. Fingleton, with the active encouragement of some Members in the other House, who now pretend they did not do it, privatised the operation.  In that region of Spain, the banks are owned by the people, agricultural and pharmaceutical production as well as the manufacturing of goods such as refrigerators, televisions and so on is done by co-operatives, all of which are in profit.  The bank is the seventh largest bank in Spain and it is about the only one that is not in financial trouble.  There are other ways of looking at this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We do not have to sign up to a treaty that we all know is a farce, which is confused in its terminology and in respect of which it is not known how to measure or quantify the elements that constitute its significant parts.  The difference between structural and fiscal deficits is not known.  They have been shown to have been got wrong in the past and we all know it will lead to the bankruptcy of this country.  We heard Romano Prodi say yesterday that increasing austerity will lead to revolt.  There must be hope.  Where is the hope in this?  Senator Mary White said on the Order of Business that we needed inward investment and to be part of Europe and so on.  We will still be part of the European Union.  We are entitled to vote against the treaty.  We are lucky to be one of the few to have the opportunity to vote on it.  Democracy has been taken away.  Let us look at the shameful examples in Greece and Italy.</P>
        <P>We have been the good boys and girls in the class.  All the way along we have paid everybody else&rsquo;s debts, we have volunteered in a way that goes beyond the wild successes of Christianity, where we were told that if a man attacks you, you give him your coat.  We have gone beyond an excess of Christianity in paying other people&rsquo;s debts.  There is a cynical side, which is that no good deed goes unpunished.  Every time we did it, the reward was a slap.</P>
        <P>I am not sorry to see capitalism in trouble.  I did not gloat about the death of communism, as most of my colleagues did.  It was never tried.  Stalin was not a communist.  Mao was not a communist.  None of them was.  There was a noble effort in Nicaragua to try to bring together people with the motives of humanity, society, co-operation and the incentive &mdash; the carrot &mdash; of the natural human instinct to gain some kind of regard or advantage.  That is the direction in which we should go.</P>
        <P>I do not believe for one single solitary second that this instrument, which I refuse to call the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, rather the treaty on instability, will bring about stability.  I do not doubt the motives of all my colleagues, but I wish to share this nugget.  I was one of a very small number of people who spoke against this treaty on the Order of Business yesterday, but there were members from every single party who came to me privately and said they wished they were able to say the same things, because that is what they believed.  I think it is important that we be honest.  I do not believe in signing up to a tissue of lies that we know we cannot achieve.  The Spanish have done it.  They were honest about it.  They were honest about their dishonesty.  That was great.  They signed the treaty in the morning and in the afternoon they said, we will not reach the objectives because they are quite impossible.  Is that real politics?  Is that honest politics?  Is it what we need to get us out of this mess?  I do not think so.</P>
        <P>I hope my remarks were within the limits of civilised debate.  I do not think I said anything that was personally offensive to anybody.  If I did I regret it &mdash; partly.  I said what is in my heart and what I believe is true.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It remains to be seen whether the people will vote for the treaty.  It is their decision, as it should have been the decision of every single country in Europe, not just a tiny minority.  It should not be left to governments.  That is as sensible as what was said on the other side of the House on the Order of Business, when we were told the Cabinet would supervise the installation of the correct kind of water meters because it, rather than professionally qualified water engineers, had the intellect and power to deal with the matter.  I wish it would think about something more serious.  It should be each to his own particular <i>m&eacute;tier</i>.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I trust he will bring back the views, questions and concerns on all sides to the Cabinet.  It is good to have this robust debate.  As Senator Norris said, this kind of debate is not happening in other European countries.  I do, however, wish to address some of the comments made by Senator Cullinane, particularly towards the end of his contribution.  While it is true that perhaps public opinion is changing, as he and we all know, public opinion does not necessarily direct the right thing to do.  We need to have robust analysis where we look at the content of the treaty.  I appreciate the reflections of my colleagues today and yesterday.  This, ultimately, will be a political judgment on the basis of that content.  That judgment is based on political as well as ethical interests, which we all know.  It is important to keep that in mind.</P>
        <P>I want to focus on the Bill, in particular the wording of the referendum to be put to the people.  I have a couple of questions and one serious concern.  Senator Bacik directed us to Part 2, which is the wording to be put to the people.  As Senator van Turnhout said yesterday, it is not the actual rules of the treaty, rather that the State will ratify the treaty.  My concern, which was raised in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Murphy, concerns the second sentence on what will be put to the people.  The Bill states: &ldquo;No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State that are necessitated by the obligations of the State under that Treaty or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by bodies competent under that Treaty from having the force of law in the State.&rdquo;  What precisely does that mean?  I hope I can have a response to my question.  I am sure the people wish to know what that means.  Does it mean that no laws which are implementing the provisions of the treaty can be considered unconstitutional?  If the people pass the referendum and we ratify the treaty, does that mean when we want to pass legislation as law-makers, no laws to implement the provisions of the treaty can be considered unconstitutional?</P>
        <P>I refer to the phrase &ldquo;laws ... that are necessitated by obligations of the State under [the] Treaty&rdquo;.  Can these laws be decided by Irish law-makers or will they be imposed on us by outsiders, such as what is decided collectively at an EU level?  This is the heart of the concerns around the ceding of sovereignty.  Does it effectively constitutionalise the ceding of sovereignty?  Is this Part of the Bill, Schedule or wording that will be put to the people absolutely necessary?  I understand the T&aacute;naiste said it is necessary technically and legally because this is an intergovernmental treaty, as other Senators have said.  We should not so tie the hands of Irish law-makers that we cannot look to our own context later on, have dialogue with EU partners and perhaps choose some significant change in terms of how we balance the governance of the EU with that of Ireland.</P>
        <P>I want to try to tease out and clarify the meaning of the second sentence.  Is there a difference between absolute constitutional protection of the treaty or a straightforward ratification of it?  Why can we not simply put to the people that the State may ratify the treaty?  It is the usual practice that where articles of the Constitution or amendments to it are in place, laws are then enacted and citizens have a democratic right to challenge them constitutionally.  Will this not be the case for any laws we or other law-makers enact to implement the obligations of the treaty?  If not, why not?  My questions will help to inform my decision on how I vote on the Bill but not necessarily on the treaty.</P>
        <P>My second concern is about the timing of the referendum.  As we all know, it will take place on 31 May and today is 24 April.  Information is required by our citizens for an informed, adequate and public debate.  It seems to me members of the public have a very short period of time to get the information to debate among themselves and make an informed judgment.  We demonstrate here and in the D&aacute;il that people first need to understand the content of the treaty and then make a political, ethical and legal judgement about it.  That takes a considerable amount of time.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State knows, research has shown if there is less time for information, people are more likely to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; because they do not understand the question.  The Minister of State referred in his speech yesterday to the fact that the public information campaign has been launched.  Is it fully accessible to the public?  The Minister of State referred to the website which was launched relatively recently.  Even if one had not listened to his speech or had not heard about its launch one might have a sense that something is going on and search on Google for information.  That is what I did after I heard about the website.  One would want to know how one can find the public information.  I put the term &ldquo;fiscal treaty Ireland&rdquo; into Google and an advertisement for the fiscal treaty appeared.  I was not directed to any website such as the one created by the Government.  The first bullet point referred to the Institute for International and European Affairs and what was termed its infographic, which laid out the European Union&rsquo;s response to the euro crisis.  It comprised a map of all the problems and weaknesses in dark colours.  There were references to the weak finance sector, weak economies and weak governance.  It would not make me feel confident in voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and did not have any of the explanation or information I was looking for.  I then put the term &ldquo;Irish fiscal treaty referendum&rdquo; into Google and found scholarly articles and news such as &ldquo;Kenny calls for a yes vote and the unions call for a no vote.&rdquo;  When I visited the website <i>stabilitytreaty.ie</i>, I found it was very good.  The Government will be sending out information leaflets.</P>
        <P>To come back to my first point on the need for clarification, with regard to the language that will be put to the people in the referendum to which they will say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;, the website states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The amendment will not include details of the rules agreed under the Treaty.  If this amendment is approved by referendum, the details will be dealt with in laws made by the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">However, it does not state these laws cannot be challenged constitutionally.</P>
        <P>As other colleagues have noted, the position is continuing to change at European level.  Recently I was in France where many think we are going to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; at this stage.  However, as I said to them, whether we vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;, is it not great that we are having this debate and that the treaty is being put to the people?</P>
        <P>I reiterate my concern about the second sentence in the Bill and ask if the treaty is simply about providing for austerity constitutionally.  Last week the T&aacute;naiste said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; that it was about &ldquo;managing our debt and managing it in such a way that, over time, taxpayers&rsquo; money goes not into servicing debts but more and more into public services and targeted growth initiatives to create jobs.&rdquo;  If that is the case &mdash; it is a political judgment based on the content &mdash; we need more time to have a fully informed public debate about the treaty in order that the people will be able to come to a democratic decision.  A fully genuine democratic decision is always one that is adequately informed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo much of what has been said.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, and thank the Ministers of State, Deputies R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall and Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, who stood in for him yesterday.  </P>
        <P>Some 90% of the content of the treaty has been agreed to already, as Senator Ivana Bacik pointed out.  Is that not the problem?  Take the situation in which Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Belgium and, latterly, the Netherlands and France find themselves.  This is an arrangement of which the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic are not part at this time, while Denmark and Sweden were not included the last time.</P>
        <P>We have to say the eurozone, as constituted, is not an optimal currency area.  This is the problem we are trying to solve through this harsh fiscal regime.  As we went through the issues involved yesterday, I hope I do not tread on the patience of the Chair in the points I wish to make.  We always kept to the 3% rule, as well as the 60% rule, until the tsunami of the banking crisis hit us.  Article 4 involves trying to redress the balance over a 20-year period by a figure of one twentieth each year, which would impose incredible burdens on the country.  I estimate that to move from where we are, where there is probably a 120% debt-GDP ratio, to a figure of 60%, we would probably have to run a surplus of &euro;4 billion to &euro;5 billion a year.  However, we have all the economic evidence we need that this is not the way to go.  Ireland&rsquo;s role is to say this in Brussels.  As Senator Katherine Zappone said, we should say, &ldquo;By the way, we consult the people.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his undertaking that this will happen once and that we will not keep running the referendum until we get the right verdict.  Adopting such an approach seriously undermined democracy previously.  I welcome the fact that the Cabinet decided to hold the referendum, although, apparently, it might not have been judged as strictly necessary.  The Attorney General and the Cabinet have done democracy a service.</P>
        <P>For how long is it the wish of people in Brussels and Frankfurt that Germany should run huge surpluses, while other countries experience mass unemployment?  Is it not time to say that when one blows up the laboratory, the experiment is over?  This is the basic problem that has to be addressed.  Rather than saying, &ldquo;If we pass this referendum, people in Brussels will think we are great,&rdquo; perhaps we might say it is about time the Irish stopped touching the forelock.  Instead of saying, &ldquo;We will receive a subsidy if we vote for it,&rdquo; we should say nobody believes this and that, while it may infringe on the egos of those who promote the euro in its current form, it is time to end the experiment.</P>
        <P>I want to put one important technical question to the Minister of State.  The reference is to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, but the only place it is mentioned in the treaty is in Article 8.  The place where it is stated we will not be eligible for any more ESM money if we do not vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 31 May is not the treaty, as I see it, but in the preamble.  While I have not received legal training and Senator Ivana Bacik is not present, is it not the case that what is included in the treaty prevails over what is in contained in the preamble?  What is stated on page 7 of the eight page preamble is exactly what the Oireachtas information service has reported to us, namely, that if we do not ratify the treaty, we will not eligible to receive ESM funding.  However, Article 2 in the body of the treaty takes precedence and states the treaty &ldquo;shall not encroach upon the competences of the Union to act in the area of the economic union&rdquo;.  What is happening is undermining the European Union because it is imposing hardship on countries such as Greece and Portugal, as well as this country, as the Minister of State and others more experienced than I in the field of politics will find on the doorstep.  I am not sure the world would come to an end if we were to take into account what Article 2 states, namely, the treaty &ldquo;shall not encroach upon the competences of the Union to act in the area of the economic union&rdquo;.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The system is obviously not working, with massive unemployment, in particular youth unemployment, throughout the European Union.  Article 4 will impose severe burdens on us.  I agree with Senator Paschal Mooney&rsquo;s point that the 40% of debt incurred to save the banking system owing to the bad design of the euro should be a priority for removal.  That is what is stopping the European Union from working and is resulting in mass unemployment.  The currency was a step too far and has not worked.  There is no longer any point in face-saving for those who promoted it.  As Milton Friedman and others pointed out, we sleepwalked into this.  One of the lessons is that the Government needs an economic service to serve all Departments, with a level of expertise that could have prevented us from sleepwalking into this arrangement which has now come to a sorry end.  We need an exit mechanism and to recognise that one-size-fits-all interest rates do not work.  We need a regime of fiscal transfers, which means the Germans should share some of the surplus with the countries being impoverished by these arrangements.  We need protection against the tsunamis of mass credit provision which destroyed the banking system, as happened in the case of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Are we permanently shut out of the ESM by the preamble, or does Article 8 take precedence?  Could we use this issue because we are voting, unlike anybody else in Europe in which there is obviously such huge dissatisfaction?  We are the leaders for democracy.  I am proud of the Constitution and those who gave it to us as it respects our right to be consulted.  I am proud we have a Cabinet that is consulting us instead of doing this behind closed doors.  That is one of the reasons so many in Europe sleepwalked into joining an unsatisfactory common currency that is not working.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  Much of what has been said on both sides of the House has been directed towards people living in the real world.  Listening to the contributions I have been thinking to myself that every one of the Senators who spoke must be on the plus side with his or her bank, given the way he or she has been talking.  I am surprised by the point made on the preamble by Senator Sean D. Barrett, a man for whom I have massive respect.  In the real world I know that if I do not pay my bank and if I was, like many in the country, 90 days in arrears on my mortgage, and I then went into the bank to seek a business loan, there would be only one answer &mdash; &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  That is what is happening in the real world and with banks in this country. Ultimately, our bank is the European Central Bank because that is where the money which is bankrolling our country at present comes from. However, terms and conditions apply. </P>
        
        <P>Senator David Norris stated that any contract signed under duress is invalid.  I suggest that 90% of mortgages signed in recent years are invalid if that is the case.  I know of people who went to the auctioneer on a Thursday and when they returned on the Friday to make a down-payment of 10%, the house had increased in value by &euro;25,000.  Such madness was taking place and that is what people are burdened with now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other Members referred to austerity.  No one wants to introduce austerity or to ask our people to take the pain they are enduring, but what is the alternative?  It was stated earlier that some in government were asking the question, "What is the alternative?"  If we reject the treaty and we are told by those in Europe that there is no more money, where will the money come from?  We are with the lender of last resort at present.  Therefore, where will the money come from to pay public servants and to keep services going?  There is austerity but no hospital or school has closed yet.  No emergency department is being closed.  That is what it could be like and that is what I am concerned about.  People have said the treaty is not perfect, but we are with the lender of last resort and these are the terms and conditions for the ongoing financing of the State.</P>
        <P>I would love to have seen Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government when there were budget surpluses of billions of euro every year.  I would like to think we would not have squandered it.  I would like to see Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government sometime when we have a budget surplus.</P>
        <P>When people call for an honest debate, they are usually talking out of the corner of the mouths while stirring it in the background.  If there is to be honesty in the debate about austerity, we should admit that there is no longer a border between here and Northern Ireland.  It is simply imaginary.  As part of a power-sharing arrangement, Sinn F&eacute;in has no difficulty ramming austerity down people&rsquo;s throats in Northern Ireland.  It has no problem with a property tax in Northern Ireland where it is in government in a power-sharing arrangement.  It has no problem with people paying for water in Northern Ireland.  If it were in power in this jurisdiction, I would like to see what it would do.</P>

They do not have to take it but Sinn F&eacute;in is ramming it down the throats of the people they represent and those whom they guide in the North through the power-sharing arrangement.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the real world and the bank loan.  I meet a vast number of people who are in negative equity and who have substantial bank loans.  I meet business people every day.  I hope the new legislation coming from Government with regard to the loan guarantee scheme will help.  People come to me with viable business ideas and so on but they cannot get the finance to put them in place.  I call on people to bear in mind that this treaty is not perfect but it is one of the terms and conditions that we are getting from our financiers, the financiers of last resort.</P>

        <P>There has been a good deal of discussion in the debate today about living in the real world.  It is somewhat rich of a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator to tell us that we are not living in the real world since they lived in a parallel universe for so long.  The real world for those of us in Sinn F&eacute;in is the world of the carers campaigning outside the gates at the moment and that of the lone parents who are holding a press conference because of the cutbacks resulting in such austerity for them and brought in by the Government.</P>
        <P>Senator Sheahan&rsquo;s lack of understanding of the situation in the North surprises me since we have raised it on numerous occasions.  Senator Sheahan does not appear to understand that the North is governed under Tory cuts from a block grant from Westminster.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I note that when the Lisbon treaty was being debated, much of the same rhetoric was being used by members of Fianna F&aacute;il and former Taoisigh with regard to the groups opposing the referendum.  That did not help the tone of the referendum.</P>
        <P>Many Members have asked about the Sinn F&eacute;in alternative.  Senator Mooney stated he never heard about an alternative put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.  That was repeated by several Senators yesterday.  A calculated alternative was put forward in our pre-budget submission and previously which commented on these issues, and again I call on the Senators to read it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>A work of fiction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>One measure referred to in the pre-budget submission was the introduction of a wealth tax.  It is interesting to note that Monsieur Hollande in France has brought up the issue there and he is considering the imposition of a 75% wealth tax for people who have more than &euro;1 million.  It is an option that can be considered and implemented but the Government has chosen not to do it here.  Another measure we referred to was the introduction of a third rate of income tax at 48%.  To suggest there are no alternatives is simply untrue, but it is possible the Government simply has no wish to consider them.  I realise the Minister will come back on that point and I appreciate he may have alternatives.  Alternatives exist which should be debated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We live in the real world where people are struggling.  Having read the fiscal compact in detail and having studied the arguments on both sides, we do not believe it will solve the real problem.  There is a problem with the eurozone.  We honestly believe the fiscal compact will not solve it.  Therefore, it will not improve the situation in Ireland or throughout Europe.  We believe it will lead to more austerity budgets.  We believe the rules imposed on us which would be enshrined in the Constitution if accepted in the referendum will impose a type of fiscal straitjacket for years to come.  This will mean that we must cut billions from the economy for several years to come.  Many economists on both sides of the argument concur with this view.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another argument put forward is that we need a stimulus such as the one we suggested.  That would involve talking to the European Investment Bank about getting a loan and using money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to create a jobs stimulus package.  I understand the Government is considering that option, and we welcome that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a great deal of misinformation on this issue and it would be welcome if the Minister would clarify a number of questions which are based on some of the comments I heard yesterday and other comments in civil society.  If we do not sign up to this treaty, will the Minister clarify that we will remain a member of the European Union because there appears to be confusion about that?  We were told yesterday that we will be out of the EU if we do not sign up to this treaty.  Many other groups are saying that also.  I note correspondence from the Irish Farmers Association which Members may have received also, stating the reason farmers and their families should vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the fiscal treaty.  It states regarding a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote for the economy and growth, that membership of the EU and a stable euro are critical for exports, jobs, inward investment and economic recovery.  The IFA is implying that if we do not vote for the fiscal compact we will be outside the EU in some way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister might clarify also that if we do not sign up to the fiscal compact whether we will be thrown out of the eurozone.  It is our understanding that we will not.  We will still be a member of the eurozone.  An argument being implied, certainly by people on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side, is that in some way we will be outside the euro if we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Who said that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The other sense I got from some of the contributions yesterday was that if we do not vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for the treaty, in some way we are bad Europeans in that we are not playing ball with our European counterparts.  Does that mean that, for example, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, the Danes and the Swedes, who have opted out of certain elements of EU treaties in the past, are not good Europeans?  I do not believe that is the case but it is an important point.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister also clarify that this is not an EU treaty?  There was a sense in the debate yesterday that this is an EU treaty.  It is not.  It is an intergovernmental treaty outside the EU treaties.  That bears reference to the point made by my colleague, Senator Barrett, about the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  The ESM is enshrined in an EU treaty and therefore it is open to question as to whether we would be able to access the ESM post-treaty if we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  That issue is not cut and dried.  As the ESM is enshrined in EU treaties, this so-called insurance policy or clause is only noted in the preamble to this treaty, which is an intergovernmental treaty.  I am not an economist but I am aware that there are eminent economists and legal people who would question the strength of that so-called insurance clause.</P>
        <P>Another comparison made yesterday was that this is only putting in place the type of rules one would have in a good household or business because budgets have to be balanced.  That might have made sense in good times but I do not know many families in Ireland at the moment who balance their budgets.  They are borrowing today to pay for yesterday&rsquo;s debts and as Senator Sheahan said, a huge number of households are in negative equity and finding it very difficult to survive.  They are borrowing to get themselves out of a hole in the hope that in the future they will get out of the difficult situation in which they find themselves.</P>
        <P>I have done a B.Comm degree and one of the things we were told was that when a business was in difficulty the wrong approach was to cut back everywhere but rather market, invest and sell to increase one&rsquo;s market, and one would have to borrow to do that.  That is a basic principle of business I was taught, although it might have changed in the interim.  Our reading of this fiscal compact is that it &ldquo;straitjackets&rdquo; future Governments in terms of being able to invest for growth and expand.</P>
        <P>We do not see anything about job creation in the treaty.  In addition, there is an issue around the holding of the referendum on a Thursday because it does not give a fair chance to people who might want to vote at the weekend, for example, students or younger people on whom this will have a definite impact in terms of being able to vote.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of other questions arise.  I apologise if my contribution is lengthy but it is important to put all of the sides of the argument.  How does the Government envisage this treaty stimulating growth?  The economic straitjacket we find ourselves in under the troika deal is not having that effect.  Growth is being stymied across Europe.  Countries which had triple A status are losing that status.  I understand there are now only three countries across the EU with triple A status.  The unemployment lines are growing.  There has been some positive news on employment, mainly from multinationals, but my argument would be that is not enough to get us out of the situation we are in.  Multinational companies can be quite fickle.  They will move to wherever is best for their interests and where they will make the most profit.  There is no guarantee that they will stay here, as we have seen with Aviva in Galway.  The real growth and stability for the economy is built on the small and medium enterprise sector but under the current austerity that sector is finding it very difficult.  It is very difficult for those in the sector to get credit and because of the amount of money that must be paid back on promissory notes, etc., and in terms of the banking crisis, the Government does not have the ready cash to support those SMEs in the way that should be done.  It is difficult to know how the current troika deal and a new deal which imposes a similar type of financial constraint will stimulate growth not only in Ireland but across Europe.  If we cannot stimulate growth and investment in the economy, how will it create jobs?  It is not clear to us that this treaty will create jobs.</P>
        <P>We welcome the fact that a number of unions have come out in opposition to the treaty, and fair play to them for being willing to do that.  SIPTU is straddling the fence on the issue.  It has stated that it has serious issues with the treaty but that if the Government gives it a deal on a jobs stimulus package it is willing to call for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  I might be open to correction but I believe one of the Labour Party Senators said yesterday that there was no question of such a deal being done.  The Minister might tell us now if the Government intends to try to buy off SIPTU by promising a jobs stimulus package and then asking it to ask its members for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  Alternatively, will he tell us that the Government will not try to buy the election on that type of promise?  In that way any ordinary member of SIPTU, many of whom contacted me yesterday to say they were uncomfortable with the union&rsquo;s position, will then know that if that promise is not on the table they should vote against it as SIPTU has recommended.  It would be clear for them to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  We need to know whether the Government intends to give that type of clarification to SIPTU.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated in a state of the nation address that this crisis was not our fault.  One of the fundamental problems we have with the treaty is that if it was not our fault, why are we still paying the penalties?  That comes back to much of what Senator Barrett outlined.  Many other socialists across Europe do not agree with the treaty.  We have seen the stance taken by Monsieur Hollande in France.  A renegotiation would be needed if the type of change he is talking about has to be brought in and it will change the fundamental nature of that treaty.  He has toned down his comments somewhat because he is in the run-up to a general election but if he is elected he will be more robust in that regard.  The Dutch Labour Party and the German Social Democratic Party have serious misgivings, and even the European trade unionists have an issue with this treaty.  There is a broader body of people who are raising the types of questions we are raising.  We live in the real world and it is important that many of these issues would be addressed.</P>
        <P>A number of other important issues were raised, including the idea of sovereignty.  We have a massive issue with the loss of political sovereignty in this situation because if we sign up to the treaty, as the Minister is aware, we will be open to much more scrutiny from the EU Commission in terms of the rules and regulations for our economic management in a troika style fashion.  In many of the contributions yesterday from those on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side of the argument we were asked the reason we would be worried about that.  I would be worried about it because we are told daily that many of the decisions made by this Government are because the troika told it to make them.  If this treaty is passed all we need to do is change the troika for the Commission.  We will be told that we must bring in these charges to balance our budgets because the Commission told us to do so.  The realpolitik will be that we are handing over the political decisions and what we can and cannot do from an economic perspective to the EU Commission.  That is the reason Sinn F&eacute;in argues that, under the treaty, Ireland will cede sovereignty from a political perspective.  We will also cede legal sovereignty because the European Commission rather than the High Court, the Supreme Court or the Houses of the Oireachtas will exercise control over what we do economically.  If the Commission concludes Ireland is not meeting the targets set down in the treaty, it may take us to court and impose a penalty calculated as a percentage of GDP.  Moreover, any other member state which believes Ireland is in contravention of the treaty and not playing by the rules will also be able to take us to court.  My party has a major difficulty with handing over legal sovereignty to the European Court of Justice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The penalties laid down defy the purpose of the treaty.  As Senator Sean D. Barrett noted, if we are found to be in contravention of the requirement to reduce the government debt ratio to 60% over a number of years, we may be required to introduce annual cuts of up to &euro;6 billion.  However, as well as being taken to court for failing to meet this requirement, we may also have penalties imposed on us.  As a result, countries that are broke will be required to introduce further cuts to reach the specified targets and will also pay penalties.  Not only will they not have money in the bank, but they will also be required to impose further cuts and pay more into the European Stability Fund because they were bold boys in Europe.  This does not make sense and will not help countries emerge from difficult economic problems.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the leeway the Acting Chairman, Senator Marie Moloney, has shown me.  However, it is important to voice the arguments against the treaty and I note some of the Senators opposite are itching to make counter arguments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The text restates some of the old rules and strengthens more recent ones.  However, placing these rules in an international treaty and giving it the protection of the Constitution makes these rules binding and permanent.  In doing so, we will impose a specific and austere type of economics on the current Government and all future ones both in the State and the other member states which ratify it.  These are the rules by which the signatory states will have to play, irrespective of whether their citizens like it.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not agree with this approach because it is not in the best interests of the population of the State or other countries across Europe which may wish to take an economic approach which, as Senator Sean D. Barrett noted, takes account of citizens as opposed to bondholders and the economic powers that be who have considerable influence on the European model and approach.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw Senators&rsquo; attention to the fact that the treaty title, Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, does not refer to growth, water charges, carers or any of the other issues raised by Sinn F&eacute;in Senators.  Europe has been much too slow to take action on the euro and the current process is an attempt to bring under control the tsunami that has hit the single currency.  For this reason, the treaty is long overdue.  Given the control the troika exerts over Ireland, the points made about sovereignty are nothing more than rhetoric.</P>
        <P>On the requirement to produce regular reports, I remind Senators that member states have been required to submit regular reports to the Commission since we signed the Maastricht treaty, which was not yesterday or the day before.  While Ireland will be subject to greater scrutiny, so too will other member states.</P>
        <P>It is nonsense to suggest membership of the euro is not in the country&rsquo;s better interests.  Any step that can be taken to improve the stability of the single currency is good news.  Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh is correct that we are facing a crisis.  The number of European states with a triple A rating has fallen dramatically and now stands at only three.  We are in the middle of a crisis and the sooner the European Union takes the measures required to get us out of it, the better it will be for the country.  Ireland&rsquo;s position as a small, open economy makes comparisons with Sweden, the Czech Republic, France and Britain irrelevant.</P>
        <P>The euro has been highly beneficial for Ireland.  Before we joined the single currency, we were buffeted on the seas of economic crisis.  For example, inflation was rampant in the 1970s and there were currency problems in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Within a short number of years the value of the punt had declined from &pound;1.20 sterling to 80 cent.  Stability is what we need if the country is to recover.  The treaty is a very important part of regaining stability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The treaty is not about membership of the euro.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is correct.  The treaty is not about being a member of the European Union and anybody who makes such a suggestion is scaremongering.  However, on the question of whether it is about membership of the euro, although that may not be the case in the immediate short term, rejection of the treaty would fundamentally undermine our membership of the euro in the long term.</P>
        <P>It has been made abundantly clear that we will not have access to the European Stability Mechanism if we do not become a party to the treaty.  While we can argue the legalities of that position, it appears to be the view of most of those who have expressed a legal opinion on the matter.  As a number of leading companies which do business here have argued, if we cannot access the ESM, it will undermine the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for foreign direct investment.  There is no doubt that is the message of the commentary on the issue.  While one can accept or deny that reality, foreign direct investment is critical to the future of the country.</P>
        <P>I have enormous respect for Senator Sean D. Barrett, but, as he is aware, 20 years is a long time.  With a little quantitative easing and inflation, we could see a dramatic turnaround in the economy&rsquo;s fortunes.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Paschal Mooney for his excellent speech.  I agree that a number of questions arise, for example, as to whether the treaty is sufficient.  It probably will not be enough on its own.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the greater emphasis on growth and would not have any difficulty ratifying a growth treaty 12 months from now.  We need measures to promote growth.  The European Union has been too reticent in tackling the issues of growth and unemployment and too focused on the interests of core countries rather than those of countries on the periphery.  As I have stated on a number of occasions, countries on the periphery need to come together in a wider European Union context.  The treaty is not, however, the end of the story but one piece of a jigsaw.  Growth and measures to address unemployment are other pieces of it.</P>
        <P>The reality of the matter is that we are where we are.  Nothing that is required of us in this document is anything greater than what is required of us already.  All that will be asked of us is that there will be greater penalties if we do not accede.  I take the point that it is difficult for a country to comply if it does not see itself currently in a position to be able to tick all of the boxes immediately, but there is a recognition for that in the treaty.  There is a recognition that programme countries like ourselves will require greater leeway.  We are where we are, as I said, and that is the bottom line.  We have to look forward to a strong euro, to stabilising that euro and to taking the measures necessary to have a stable euro.</P>

	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and formally congratulate him on his recent elevation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a nominated Senator with no experience in EU politics or in the governance of our country, today is a day that I sometimes dread, a day in which I have to contribute to debates like this.  It would be easy for me not to appear in the Chamber today, to excuse myself and hope there was no vote, and then try to make some kind of decision.  However, as a Senator nominated by the Taoiseach, I have a responsibility to try to make sense for myself and the community I represent, whether they are artists or whatever, on what we should do in respect of the fiscal compact treaty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The language within the treaty itself is very clear and very understandable.  Whether one disagrees with it or not is a separate issue.  I will talk briefly in a minute about what Senator Zappone said about the second sentence of Part 2 of the Schedule, which is very obtuse in both Irish and English.  As I read the treaty, I noticed that many of the rules in the fiscal compact treaty are already provided for in EU law.  The provisions of the treaty do not alter a large part of what we are doing already in respect of the governance of our economy and our budgetary relationship.  There are significant issues regarding the excessive deficit procedures, but we also know that countries which are subjected to an excessive deficit procedure have a three year transitional grace period before they have to conform to the provisions of the treaty.  Therefore, Ireland would not be subject to the provisions of the existing treaty until three years after 2015, which brings us to 2018; therefore, we have a period of time to assess this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My colleague, Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, was acting in a very conciliatory fashion.  Although he might be voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;, I thought some of his points were excellent and he was being consensual in his comments, unlike his previous Sinn F&eacute;in colleague.  I listened with intent and tried to understand the reasons how he might vote on this.  Austerity is not mentioned in the treaty, but emotionally we are looking at somehow legitimising the austerity budgets that are going to come before us in the next few years.  That is a fact, although we should not scaremonger about that either.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was interested to hear what Tom McDonnell of TASC said.  We know that there is no consensus among economists &mdash; Senator Barrett is one  &mdash; about how one might approach fiscal policy.  My reading of the fiscal compact treaty is that it is quite an inflexible document.  That is not a judgment call, more a description, and it does tie us in.  The challenge I have is to decide which way to vote.  Will I accept that this one-size-fits-all inflexibility will somehow support the country to manage itself out of this crisis?</P>
        <P>The second issue is that we must be careful to realise that the fiscal compact treaty is not a panacea.  It will not resolve all our issues.  It will not resolve the problems facing our management of the euro and will not resolve other measures either.  I have to come to terms with that as well.  The idea of the debt brake superseding other economic considerations is problematic.  It can prevent governments from borrowing to make investments that pay long-term dividends, such as in education or in the provision of general purpose technologies, unless the peripheral countries have the flexibility to borrow to close their infrastructure deficit relative to the eurozone core.  This is something that TASC raised and it would be a concern of mine.  There is an increased inflexibility within the inflexibility.  In other words, if we sign up to this and if we agree that the fiscal compact treaty is the only way, then we also have to accept that there is a greater amount of inflexibility involved.</P>
        <P>We owe it to our fellow citizens to say it quite clearly that the communication of this is important.  I commend party leaders and the T&aacute;naiste who came out quite clearly to support it on the front foot.  That has to continue and, as Senator Zappone said, clarity is required in this Bill.  I am a native speaker of Irish and there are many words in the Irish version of the treaty that I just do not understand.  It is really important that we learn from the very recent experience, which is the experience of the previous two amendments to the Constitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of my day jobs is to sell tickets for shows and to ensure people come to see those shows.  A part of that is about communicating to many different stakeholders and many different audiences.  I need almost 12 weeks&rsquo; notice to sell 500 seats for one night.  I would not underestimate the challenge facing the Government.  I strongly urge the Government to delay the date for the referendum and to learn from the Referendum Commission&rsquo;s report, which was laid before the Houses only on 20 April last.  Regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with the fiscal compact treaty and whether I will vote for it, which I will make known in the House, my concern is that civil servants and politicians, who are fantastic communicators, need a lead-in time for this.  Today is 24 April and it is only five weeks to the referendum.</P>
        <P>The following sentence is from Part 1 of the Schedule to the Bill:</P>
        <P LI="1">N&iacute; dh&eacute;anann aon fhor&aacute;il at&aacute; sa Bhunreacht seo dl&iacute;the a d&rsquo;achtaigh, gn&iacute;omhartha a rinne n&oacute; bearta a ghlac an St&aacute;t de bh&iacute;thin riachtanais na n-oibleag&aacute;id&iacute; at&aacute; ar an St&aacute;t faoin gConradh sin a chur &oacute; bhail dl&iacute; n&aacute; cosc a chur le dl&iacute;the a d&rsquo;achtaigh, gn&iacute;omhartha a rinne n&oacute; bearta a ghlac comhlachta&iacute; at&aacute; inni&uacute;il faoin gConradh sin &oacute; fheidhm dl&iacute; a bheith acu sa St&aacute;t.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag labhairt as Gaeilge ansin.  N&iacute; thuigim neart de c&eacute;ard at&aacute; &aacute; r&aacute; ansin.  Is &iacute; sin an buairt at&aacute; orm.  T&aacute; g&aacute; leis an gcumars&aacute;id seo.  Ba cheart go mbeadh meas againn ar &aacute;r gcomhshaor&aacute;naigh ionas go mbeimid in ann am a chaitheamh ag cur f&uacute;inn.  N&iacute; ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh br&uacute; orainn &mdash; go mbeimid ag panice&aacute;il, mar a deirtear i mB&eacute;arla &mdash; cinneadh a dh&eacute;anamh agus gan ach m&iacute; f&aacute;gtha.  That is my concern.</P>
        <P>I will now read out two recommendations of the Referendum Commission that were laid before the House:</P>
        <P LI="1">Reviewing as a matter of urgency the referendum process, including the statutory remit of the Referendum Commission, having regard to the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Code of Good Practice on Referendums (March 2007).  The review should have particular regard to the need for voters to be given sufficient time, to have access to impartial information, and for a clear question being put to voters. Regard should also be had for the need to have balanced campaign material from the proposal&rsquo;s supporters and opponents available to electors.  Allowance might also be made for either strict or proportional equality between parties rather than the current strict equality.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is just not going to happen.  We have five weeks and we are already ignoring this rule.  I think that is something we should reflect upon and the message should go from the Seanad back to the Government in support of this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Government decision to put the treaty to the people in a referendum.  The final part of this contract is that time should be given in order that some of Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh&rsquo;s friends, namely the IFA, will not be given the high moral ground and the panic button to press in terms of the emotional mood music that can get people to vote one way or the other.</P>
        <P>The second recommendation of the Referendum Commission is to give the commission a period of at least three months to explain a referendum proposal properly.  Where procurement of services is required, an additional two months is needed.  The Referendum Commission was publicly attacked by some Ministers who were under extraordinary pressure in delivering highly complex information.  This is a highly complex document.  Simply put, the treaty is well written.   My concern is about the language in the Act.  My genuine concern is that time and respect would be given to our fellow citizens in order they would be able to parse this information, deliberate on it and give a reasoned view on it once all the information has been put into the public domain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  I had not intended contributing but I will do so now.  Before my colleague and friend, Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, leaves the Chamber, I want to tell him that I am anxious to engage with some of the points he made.  I have struggled to find meaning in much of what he said.  I am not opposed to or in favour of what he said, I just found that some of his points lacked meaning.  I will give a few examples.  Sinn F&eacute;in, in its recent public utterances, is for good quality ground water but against septic tank inspections.  It is for expansion of local services by county councillors but against financing them.  It is against increases in the marginal rate of VAT and increases in duty, including those on alcohol and cigarettes.  It is against paying its debts but in favour of a unilateral default.  It is against any kind of a cutback but in favour of expanding those services.  It is for massive investment and against every treaty, and it is for taxing rich people.  Its members say they are living in the real world but their world is not the world I know.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh acknowledged that the State does not have the money to stimulate growth.  We need to borrow money to do so.  Who will give it to us?  Has Sinn F&eacute;in another, unspoken reason for its opposition to the treaty?  Perhaps it is because it is against fiscal responsibility.  Perhaps this treaty would preclude Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s policy of massive Government borrowing to fund massive Government overruns when, God help us, it gets into government.  Perhaps fiscal responsibility is something of which the speakers in Sinn F&eacute;in are not in favour.  Those are my points in response to what Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said.</P>
        <P>I spoke yesterday about the language being used around the treaty.  My colleague, Senator Bacik, said yesterday that when people name the treaty, they portray or demonstrate their position on it.  I was taken aback yesterday and disappointed to hear an RTE journalist on RTE radio&rsquo;s &ldquo;News At One&rdquo; refer to the treaty as an austerity treaty, not in quoting someone else but in referring to the treaty as that.  It is inappropriate for our national broadcaster to use value judgments in this respect.  Reporting by RTE, our national broadcaster, in its news programmes should be value free.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed also with some sectors of the trade union movement in recommending a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the referendum on the treaty.  One union has demanded a &euro;10 billion stimulus in return for a recommendation of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  Where do the people making such statements think we will get the money to make such an investment?  We all want to invest, provide a stimulus and see everyone return to work.  There is nobody more anxious about that than the Government, but we have to live in the real world.  We have to ask where we will get &euro;10 billion to invest.  We will be in the programme for another 12 months and we hope to return to the markets next year.  The stability treaty, if passed and I hope it will be, will go some way towards creating conditions for confidence and stability to return to the markets at a reasonable rate.  These are some of the points that I wished to make and I ask that they be honestly addressed.  Much of the public comment I hear being put forward on the treaty is nice mom and apple pie argument, but when one examines it, it seems a bit vacuous and hollow.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett referred to section 8 and access to the ESM in the event of the treaty being passed or not.  That section is part of the treaty.  If we ratify the treaty, we will become part of it and if we do not, we will not.  The preamble to the treaty suggests we have no access to the ESM.  That is a matter of legal opinion and I sought one on it.  It is a question of logic as well as one of legal opinion.</P>
        <P>There is much more I could say and we will probably debate the treaty much more.  I hope we will do so robustly, on the door steps and in public halls in towns throughout the country as well as in the Chamber.  I look forward to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to respond to some of the comments that were made because it is important we have a robust exchange of views on the treaty, on its implications for Ireland and on the positions being put forward by the respective political parties.  A number of Senators referred to the real world.  I remember a speech given by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, when he was an Opposition spokesperson and he talked about two different worlds.  He talked about one world where bankers and developers were getting huge sums of taxpayers&rsquo; money and were being bailed out.  He talked about the people who benefited most from the Celtic tiger were the very people who were being bailed out and supported and the people who benefited least from the Celtic tiger were living in a different world and were those who were being asked to take the painful adjustments &mdash; the medicine &mdash; in terms of the budgets being put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party at the time.  He robustly opposed all those budgets because he felt that austerity would not work and that the budgets were unfair.  Any of the Labour Party Senators present can correct me on this but I understand that every Labour Party Deputy voted against all the budgets in 2008, 2009, 2010 but magically voted in favour of the budget in 2011, even though it was broadly in line with all the previous budgets that were brought into play.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The real world is one in which 460,000 people are out of work and 150,000 people have left the country.  It is where on going into any town, village or city in this State, one will see shops closing and empty premises.  The real world is explained very clearly in the Bank of Ireland report published yesterday, which shows that our domestic economy is still floundering.  The real world is where we have major problems, not only in Ireland but also in Greece, France, Holland, Portugal, Spain and right across the eurozone.  The problem is that we are not coming up with real world solutions to the problems which are evident in Ireland and the EU. That is the point we are making. That is the flaw that is at the heart of this treaty. This treaty was designed, we are told, to solve those big problems. What the treaty does not do is put in place any new regulations around how banks operate. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Everybody in this House would accept that one of the problems that led to the collapse of the economy was the fact the public finances were built up in a construction, financial and consumer bubble.  When it collapsed, the bottom fell out of the public finances.  We ended up with the big deficit we have had to reduce every year.  The reason that happened, and we can take Anglo Irish Bank as the perfect example because everybody accepts it is a toxic bank, was that we had international lenders who were getting cheap credit and cheap money, especially from banks in Germany and France, to lend to Irish banks.  Then we had the race to the bottom between all the banks, where they all rushed to get as much money as they possibly could to give out to a golden circle, an elite in this country, who used it to speculate on land which created the property bubble which was fuelled by Government policy.  These guys were also behaving recklessly by giving into banks like Anglo Irish Bank which then lent recklessly and people borrowed recklessly.</P>
        <P>The treaty does not deal with any of that.  There is not one line in the treaty that puts in place any&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>When the hectoring is finished, I am talking about arrangements between private banks that still operate in some parts of Europe.  Even though taxpayers technically own the banks, they are still seen as private entities and we do not own them.  The treaty does not deal with what any of the individuals in the private sector were doing but it deals with what Governments can do.  Nothing in the treaty would have prevented the boom or dealt with the problems we have at present.  The trade union leaders who are calling for stimulus measures are sensible, even if people disagree with them about the treaty.  We have a gap of &euro;15 billion and the latest figures show the general Government deficit is running at 13.1%.  We must reduce that over the next few years to reach the 3% Stability and Growth Pact level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The big issue then is where we go beyond that.  We made our position clear.  Sometimes people do not want to listen but we accept fiscal responsibility and have put forward a strategy for deficit reduction.  We believe we must be prudent in spending, a point I made earlier this morning.  In Greece there was reckless borrowing, which must be addressed, but that was not the case in Ireland where we had surpluses.  We are borrowing now because the bottom fell out of the public finances when the property and construction bubble collapsed.  That is why we were left with the gap we must now fill.  The treaty does not deal with any of that.  It also does not deal with debt. Even the IMF accepts our debt is not sustainable and that at some point we must default. The treaty introduces a debt brake that forces us to get to the 60% debt to GDP ratio; we will get to 120% in 2015 and then we have to bring it back by 5% every year after 2016 to bring it down to 60%. </P>
        
        <P>I will not rehearse all of the proposals Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward.  Every time we put forward our solutions, the mantra from those in the other parties is not to give them the party manifesto, but they cannot have it every way.  If people want me to go through the full list I can do so but I refer the House to the contributions made when the Minister for Finance was here, when I went through the entire list, putting forward costed proposals from the Department of Finance&rsquo;s own figures.  I do not always believe the Department of Finance but that is a different day&rsquo;s work.</P>
        <P>It is a difficult decision.  I am the first to accept that it is hard for all of us; there is no silver bullet or easy way out of the mess we are in.  We can all accept that.  No party is claiming to have a magic wand that will sort out the problems we have economically.  Nor is anyone saying that if we reject the treaty, that is the end of the problems we face.  We are saying that if we accept the treaty, it will exacerbate the problem and make it worse.  We will see a tightening of spending in the eurozone countries with more austerity causing more problems.  It is not that people are not in favour of fiscal responsibility.  It is trying to do what we all want in an impossible timeframe and in a way that will exacerbate the problem in our public finances.  The examples have been there to see since 2008 but we still have not dealt with the situation.</P>
        <P>Those who oppose the treaty are very clear in their opposition in that they are looking for a different fiscal approach to reducing the deficit, and the same holds for the rest of Europe.  We should not just force countries to reduce their debt to GDP ratio by making them pay back private debt.  There must be an element of debt write-down, which we have not seen.  If that was the case people would be more open to fiscal discipline rules.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">There must also be a strategy for growth.  That is the big issue.  There is a difference of &euro;15 billion between what we take in and what we spend and the Government wants a combination of revenue increases and cuts to address that.  There is, however, no mention of growth.  If we grow the economy and have more income, that negates the need for the painful adjustments.  It makes sense, therefore, that trade union leaders who are standing up for working people who have suffered a great deal because of what has happened, want to see a strategy for growth and job creation.  One Fine Gael Senator said the trade unions were putting a gun to the heads of the Government.  That is not the case, they are standing up for what they believe, the people and, in particular, working people.  They know better than anyone how the recession is impacting upon people.</P>
        <P>We are honest about our views on this, despite some of the commentary from the Labour Party benches.  We have put forward solutions and we believe in fiscal responsibility.  I can rebut all of the points made by Senator Gilroy but I will not.  It is not that long since Senator Gilroy was a member of Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have listened to every word that was said by Senators Cullinane and &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  They have not indicated a single positive result that would be achieved by voting against the treaty.  That is what people need to concentrate on.  What is to be gained if the country did vote against the treaty?  This is a small, open economy and we need as many friends as we can get within the European Union.  We have economic and fiscal difficulties and there are major problems in Europe.  This treaty will not solve all the problems of Europe but it is a step along the road to protecting the euro.  As previous speakers have pointed out, it is our currency and a strong euro is of benefit to us.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane said this treaty will not solve the banking crisis but this is not a banking treaty.  It was never designed to solve the banking crisis but it is a first step in strengthening the euro and bringing order and stability to the euro.</P>
        <P>Much has been made of the negative comments of some trade union leaders, who are opposed to the treaty.  Some of them are far removed from reality, on fat cat salaries, out of touch with ordinary trade union members.  We would be well advised to listen to the chambers of commerce and the multinational companies that are creating jobs.  We should listen to the farmers&rsquo; organisations that are urging support for the treaty on the basis that we are better off within a strong European movement.  We should listen to the small employers who are urging support for the treaty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important the people face up to the realities because we cannot afford a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  Is Sinn F&eacute;in prepared to take the gamble we will not need a second bailout from the ESM?  How is it going to explain to the people of Ireland that we are unable to pay salaries or maintain services? </P>
        
        <P>The people will have some very serious decisions to make on polling day.  I urge strong support throughout the business and farming communities.  I urge those employees who are represented by some of the trade unions that are urging a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote to consider the implications of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote for the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Acting Chairman and all the Senators who contributed to the debate yesterday and today.  It was the equivalent of two Second Stage speeches all round.  The rhetoric and eloquence of the Seanad remains as impressive as ever.  I thank everyone for a wide ranging debate.  Everything that could possibly be covered was touched on, from both sides of the argument.  I welcome that.</P>
        <P>I will not refer to everything that has been said.  If I did we would be here for a very long time.  I will make a few general comments and then refer to some specific areas for clarification.</P>
        <P>It is important that we look at the treaty in its broad context.  This did not happen by chance.  We are in a situation none of us would have liked to be in.  The treaty is not a panacea for all our ills.  No one is arguing that it is.  We are, however, in a serious economic situation.  We are very close to being in an economic recession and this has been the case for the last four years.  It is not of our choosing.  A situation arose.  We can cast blame in whichever way we wish, in terms of political economic or banking decisions or the manner in which regulation or lack of regulation contributed.  We have an enormous debt.  While the Government changed last year, the debt remained.  It must be dealt with and we cannot turn our backs on it.</P>
        <P>Our debt arises from various decisions that were made, particularly the decision to take the banking debt, as well as the sovereign debt, on board.  That made the situation more complex.  We have a serious sovereign debt as well as the banking debt.  The previous Government entered into an arrangement through a memorandum of understanding with the IMF, the EU and the ECB to plot a pathway through the difficulties.  The Government took on that responsibility and decided to deal with the situation through the memorandum of understanding and to seek to negotiate it where that was practical and possible.  Steps have already been taken along that course.</P>
        <P>Is this proposal before us, the Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, in Ireland&rsquo;s interest?  The Government thinks it is.  It will give stability to the markets and we see daily how easily instability can be created in the marketplace.  Today, alone, we see what has happened in the Netherlands.  A Government fell when one eurosceptic partner in the Government withdrew because it was not prepared to face up to the forthcoming budget.  How easily the markets can become negative in such a situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We cannot take decisions in isolation.  We must recognise that this is a small country that exports 85% of everything it produces.  We depend on trade to survive.  We also depend on foreign direct investment to provide so much of our manufacturing industry.  We are more open to the winds of the markets than, perhaps, any other country in the world.  If we do not take this into consideration we are not in the land of reality.  Stability is crucial for us.</P>
        <P>The treaty proposes to provide stability and to put in place what we already have as guidelines.  The Maastricht treaty included the Stability and Growth Pact requiring the maximum budget deficit of 3% and the 60% debt to GDP ratio.  The structural deficit deals with the long-term cycle of a country&rsquo;s economy.  The treaty is not a straitjacket.  It exists in a broad context.  It is not a straitjacket and was never presented as such.  On top of those provisions we have the insurance mechanism of the ESM.  That is an integral part of the treaty.</P>
        <P>Ireland is already in a precarious situation.  We need stability for markets to survive and to get back into those markets.  We also need to be sure that if things go wrong, as is happening in the Netherlands, if further winds of negativity are abroad in the marketplace and if our timescale for returning to the markets in two years time is not possible, there is an available market in the European Union, which is the ESM.</P>
        <P>We would be very foolish not to ensure that we can avail of that mechanism.  By saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the treaty we would be making a statement that we will not avail of the mechanism, because it is tied in to the treaty.  If we said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the treaty we can only imagine how volatile the markets would become.  I believe we will reach our targets and fulfil our obligations to the troika and within the terms of the memorandum of understanding, but we may very well not.  We are not fully in charge of the marketplace.  The global marketplace is so volatile that instead of improving, the market situation could disimprove.  There could be a global deterioration in the marketplace.  If we have to address that situation we will need to have access to funding.</P>
        <P>There is nothing in the treaty provisions that is damaging to the pathway we have laid out to get ourselves out of the mire we are in and regain our sovereignty.  I say to Sinn F&eacute;in Senators, in particular, that when we commemorate the events that brought about the foundation of the State and the freedom of the country we should have regained our economic sovereignty.  We must focus on the steps that are necessary to do that.  We should not pick holes in the steps we are taking if they are leading towards the conclusion we have mapped out.  The treaty fits into that plan.  It does not take from the pathway that is planned by the Government through the memorandum of understanding and our own activities.</P>
        <P>The key issues are those of growth and jobs. The treaty is not, ostensibly, about those issues.  However, by creating stability we say to the markets that we will have tighter discipline.  This was already in the guidelines which were breached by some of the bigger countries, giving bad example.  By accepting this discipline we make it clear that we are now in control of our housekeeping and that we expect every other European country to adhere to the same housekeeping rules.  That is what the treaty is about.   This is solidarity as well.  There are 25 other European countries party to it.  It would be great to have the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom party to it as well, but they are not.  There are 25 other European countries party to this intergovernmental treaty.  That is a bond and there is solidarity.  From that point of view, it will give stability and will help the markets.  That will also help Irish jobs and investment.</P>
        <P>To look at it from the other side, the first thing the Government did when it came into office was to create a jobs initiative, having stated that within the first 100 days it would provide a stimulus package to create jobs.  We followed that up with an action plan, the Pathways to Work scheme and a range of other measures to deal with long-term unemployment.  It is difficult to do so when we do not have funding.  We do not have a stimulus package and we had to impose the pension levy to get the funds together.  There is not a large amount of money of which we can avail.  There is a very small amount of money left in the pension fund, and we have used what we can.  There is a &euro;2.2 billion schools capital project, which has been announced by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and which will create 1,600 jobs.   That is quite a substantial capital project in which we are engaging.  We have got agreement from the troika that if there are sales of assets &mdash; we will not engage in any fire sale or the sale of any core asset &mdash; a proportion of the proceeds can be used for a stimulus package.  That would be funding that would become available for us to use, and no doubt we would embark on that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have not been idle in the past while with our friends in Europe.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have emphasised repeatedly at all Council of Ministers and all European Council of Heads of State and Government meetings that growth and employment are key areas that have been neglected for some time by the European institutions.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have succeeded in getting the European Council to have jobs and growth as a central core item at every meeting.  It is now on every agenda of every Council meeting.  That was done by the Irish Government, not any other Government.  We always saw that jobs and growth were the key to success.</P>
        <P>I recall when I was first elected to this House in 1989 that Ireland had a debt-GDP ratio of 137%.  We got out of our predicament because there was partnership and strict discipline and we created enough jobs and growth.  Unfortunately, we left government in 1997, just at the time when we were creating 1,000 jobs every week, and we were not in a position to make decisions on what became the Celtic tiger and on the surplus funds that became available.  That will remain the priority for the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of further stimulus, which has been mentioned quite a few times, we will hold the Presidency of the European Union next year.  Ireland will be the country which will be in charge, as Chair and as holder of the Presidency of the European Union, when most of the decisions will be made on the multi-annual financial framework which will determine the spend of &euro;1.075 trillion within the European Union between 2014 and 2020.  That will deal with the Common Agricultural Policy, and one may bet one&rsquo;s life that the farmers are well aware of that because Europe has been very good to the farming community.  Almost certainly, the new CAP will be finalised during our Presidency.  In fisheries policy, Cohesion Funds and Structural Funds, all of the key decisions on the next six years of investment by the European Union will come under our Presidency in the first half of 2013.  A great deal of funding for stimulus is available for Ireland and other European countries which should stimulate the European Union market.  Neighbourhood policy is built into that for all countries not in pre-accession to the European Union and a significant level of neighbourhood policy funding goes to surrounding countries.  That is another area where there will be quite a lot of stimulus.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not consider this an austerity treaty.  One cannot describe this as such under any circumstances.  Taking it within its own context, it gives stability, opens us up to investment, steadies the markets and gets us back to the bond markets in a shorter space of time.  In the broader context, however, the Government has the issues of jobs and growth running in parallel with all that we are doing here, and they all fit together.  One does not pass legislation dealing with jobs and growth, rather it is a question of making the policies and getting the injection of stimulus.  That is what we are engaged in as well.  This is a good treaty and it is good for the people.</P>
        <P>There are issues that people might call scaremongering, such as that the treaty ensures money is kept in people&rsquo;s pockets by providing us with a source from which to borrow.  Our sovereign deficit is more than &euro;16 billion.  That must be bridged, and we can borrow that money at 1% from the ECB.  We cannot borrow it from the markets where the rates are between 7% to 8%, although that is down enormously from 14%, which it was not long ago.  We must have access to funding.  There is no good stating we can default.  Anybody who says that is not facing reality.  There are many public servants who must be paid weekly and monthly and there must be access to funding for that.  There must be insurance that if we do not reach our targets within the terms we have negotiated, there is a further source of cheap funding available to us until we are able to go back to the markets.  This is crucial to the decision.</P>
        <P>A number of Members mentioned the issues of clarity and simplicity, which are crucial.  It is not so much the length of time we have, as some Members mentioned, but the clarity of the information that is issued.  It is good that, for the first time, the Government is doing what has not been done before and would have been difficult to do in the case of the Lisbon treaty.  I was involved, as director of elections for the Labour Party, in the second Lisbon treaty referendum.  It was difficult to get such a treaty out to the people because it was a huge document and merely referred to other treaties.  The Lisbon treaty did not have a meaningful text of its own and it was almost impossible to get to the members of the public a meaningful text they could read.  It would have been virtually impossible to have provided an explanatory memorandum.</P>
        <P>This is a simply treaty and a simple matter on which people will vote.  It looks like legal text, however, and we need the memorandum.  The treaty itself will be given to everybody by the Government, along with an explanatory memorandum and a further leaflet.  These will be for the purposes of information and explanation.  That is what people were crying out for during the Lisbon treaty referenda.  They want to see neutral information explaining what is before them, and once they have that, they will be satisfied rather than frustrated or angry, and they will make up their minds.  Irish citizens are well capable of making a decision as they see fit.  Our job is to facilitate them in doing so.</P>
        <P>Senator Sean D. Barrett referred to the references to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, in the treaty.  To clarify, the preamble to the treaty which makes reference to the ESM is part of the text.  It should be read together with the main body of the treaty, its purpose being to show how the treaty is to be interpreted and applied.  It is an integral part of the treaty.  Article 2 deals with the relationship between the treaty and EU law and is not relevant to the functioning of the ESM which will operate under an intergovernmental treaty.  These are completely separate issues which should not be connected.  The ESM and access to it are stand-alone issues.  If we cannot return to the markets to raise money at low interest rates, we must have a backstop.  That is simple and straightforward.  It makes no difference whether these provisions are set out in the preamble to the treaty or in one of the articles.  I hope that clarifies the point raised by the Senator.</P>
        <P>I accept Senator Katherine Zappone&rsquo;s point that this is a complicated text.  I recall that when the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, undertook a consolidation of the criminal justice legislation, we encountered legislation from the 18th and 19th centuries which was totally unintelligible.  That is not to say, however, that modern legislation is always easily intelligible.  In fact, we are always provided with explanatory memorandums.  Having said that, the amendment is set out as a standard text, similar to that brought forward in respect of the Lisbon treaty.  It is not something new but merely what is required, as determined by the Attorney General.  The second sentence of the amendment is intended simply to facilitate the introduction of legislation in accordance with the treaty, namely, the laws we will design such as the fiscal responsibility Bill.  Its purpose is simply to facilitate us to produce the required legislation in keeping with our long tradition of honouring our international obligations.  It is important to note that there is no ceding of sovereignty, rather it is about the honouring of obligations.  The legislation will be presented in the normal fashion to the two Houses of the Oireachtas and will be debated therein.  It is we who will make the decision on the substance of the legislation in the context of the treaty.</P>
        <P>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail asked when the treaty would begin to impact.  We are on a path to correct our excessive deficit up to 2015 and would, therefore, expect to become subject to the so-called preventive arm from 2016 onwards.  The Senator is almost correct &mdash; we will have a three year transition period, but it will be from 2016 to 2019 rather than from 2018.</P>
        <P>Senators David Cullinane and Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh made several points on behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party.  If the treaty is not ratified, Ireland will clearly still be a member of the European Union, about which there is no question.  However, a failure to ratify will, of course, raise doubts in the market and undermine investor confidence.  The question is whether we want to stay at the heart of the eurozone, on which the Government&rsquo;s view is that it is extremely important that we do so.  We have always said this and I am confident everybody in the House agrees with it.  The treaty enables us to do so.  To clarify, it is not an EU treaty but an intergovernmental treaty signed by 25 of the member states.  We should be careful not to confuse voters in this regard.</P>
        <P>On the question of bringing a legal action to the European Court of Justice, the Commission is not permitted under the treaty to do so.  Article 8 provides that the Commission will make a report on how each contracting party implements the debt brake provision of the treaty.  If it finds that a contracting party has not implemented the provisions properly, another contracting party, that is, another member of the European Union but not the Commission, may bring legal proceedings.  The Commission has an oversight role, as it has in every matter dealing with treaties, but it is only individual member states that may take an action to the European Court of Justice.  If the court finds that the member state in respect of which the complaint is made has not properly implemented the debt brake, it will be given the chance to set its house in order.  It is only where it fails to do so that a second set of proceedings may be brought seeking the imposition of a fine.  What is envisaged is a democratic process involving the member states of the European Union.  It is a careful process in which nothing takes place in an emergency or a high-handed fashion.</P>
        <P>On the status of the European Central Bank, we have long argued for a more robust role for it.  In this context, we welcome the recent moves to make additional liquidity available.  However, there is a great deal more the bank could do.  For example, we have called on it to review how it can support efforts at recovery, an area in which Ireland will continue to engage.</P>
        <P>Senator Paschal Mooney spoke eloquently about confidence in the markets, including investor confidence.  I am delighted that Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting the treaty and that its Members have spoken strongly to that effect in both Houses.  It is all about restoring the stability required in respect of the euro in order that the economy can continue to grow and provide more employment for citizens.  On the other side, the uncertainty that would arise following a rejection of the treaty in the referendum would completely undermine the prospects for stability and the progress of efforts to create jobs and so on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The measure before us does not seek to solve all of our problems, but it does represent a step along the road to recovery.  That is as much as we can say.  It is in line with what is required, namely, a level of internal discipline within the European Union.  A great deal has been done in terms of the regulation of the financial sector and the rules in that regard are in place.  The six pack, the forerunner to the treaty, has been presented.  The treaty tightens these arrangements by providing for a statutory provision.  Side by side with this, we are focused on the job creation mechanisms required.  We have succeeded in encouraging the European Union to make this the first priority and we must now exert pressure to ensure that this remains the case.  There will also be a need for the ECB, the European Commission and other institutions within the Union to ensure that the necessary requirements, including a focus on borrowing and stimulus packages, will be placed at the heart of what is done as the member states move forward.</P>
        <P>The first step we must take is to vote in the referendum at the end of next month.  We must, therefore, ensure that the people understand exactly what is involved.  Those of us who believe that the treaty represents the right way forward must knock on doors and convince people that it is good for Ireland and its citizens and is a step forward in the context of recovering the economic sovereignty we have lost.  We would like everybody to assist us in achieving this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>The only people who would describe this treaty as good would be those in the Tea Party in America.  Those individuals would be very proud of the treaty and what it seeks to do.  This debate is marked by a dichotomy which goes to the heart of the treaty and the language people use to describe it.  For example, the Minister of State refers to it as a stability treaty and he actually used the word &ldquo;stability&rdquo; on perhaps 30 occasions during his contribution.  He also stated that it is not an austerity treaty.  However, he and other Government representatives have informed us that the treaty is aimed at reducing our deficit.  To do this, the Government must ensure that we adhere to the targets and rules contained in the treaty.  The latter will obviously involve making adjustments to budgets.  In turn, such adjustments will obviously involve austerity.  If the Minister of State is in a position to offer a different interpretation of what is meant by &ldquo;austerity&rdquo;, perhaps he will make it known to the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State referred to clarity and simplicity.  Such clarity and simplicity must relate to what the treaty will do and what will be the real problems.  A number of Government representatives, including the Minister of State, have indicated that the treaty is not about private debt or what is happening with the banks.  They have also stated that it is not primarily about jobs but that it is rather about fiscal discipline.  Therein lies the problem.  The main difficulties Ireland is experiencing involve unsustainable levels of debt and a lack of growth and investment.  Many people are asking what the treaty is all about, particularly as it does not deal with the real problems we face.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be another treaty for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Here we go again with the interruptions.  What is involved here will place a straitjacket on future Governments in the context of their being in a position to manage and control our budgetary and fiscal affairs.  It is not possible to state that the treaty imposes very strict rules in respect of fiscal discipline and then state that it will not place future Governments in a straitjacket.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State also referred to returning to the bond markets and he again peddled a particular view in respect of ESM funding.  I have a number of direct questions for him on this matter.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, stated at the Labour Party conference that Ireland would return to the bond markets within two years.  How will this be achieved?  If it is achieved, I am sure the Minister of State will accept that we will not then require access to ESM funding.  Does he also accept that the ESM treaty is different to that which is the subject of the Bill?  Does he further accept that Ireland has a veto when it comes to the implementation of the ESM treaty?  The Minister of State indicated that it would be very foolish for the Irish people to reject access to ESM funding.  This is where the difficulty lies.  We are being informed that we will not require such funding because we will be returning to the bond markets but at the back of people&rsquo;s minds is the fact that access to the ESM is a form of insurance policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The treaty to which the Bill relates is an intergovernmental treaty.  A number of individuals, including the Minister of State, have said that we will not be out of the euro, the eurozone or the European Union if we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  If we do vote that way we will, like Britain, simply be rejecting the fiscal discipline rules.  It will still be open to other countries to proceed with the treaty if they so wish.  However, the question arises with regard to whether the D&aacute;il has a vote in the context of the approval of ESM funding.  I understood the Taoiseach to have stated that said vote will be taken when the people have made their decision.  My question for the Minister of State in this regard is very simple.  If the people vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum, will his party recommend that we should approve the ESM treaty and, essentially, prevent ourselves from accessing the funding involved?  Will the Government do the sensible thing if there is a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote and state that the people have spoken in respect of the fiscal discipline rules, that the position on ESM funding is different, that we have a choice and that we are saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to what is proposed in respect of the ESM and that the rules can be changed in order that Ireland, if necessary, might obtain access to ESM funding?  The issue in this regard has been resolved. Before now, we would have been putting the cart before the horse by holding the referendum after we accepted the ESM funding. I hope a response in respect of this matter is written on the piece of paper that has just been handed to the Minister of State. </P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I will forgive the interruptions.  If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum, what choices will be left open to us in the context of the ESM treaty?  Regardless of the way in which the people vote, what will be the process for the implementation of that treaty in the aftermath of the referendum?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the very important and forthcoming anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  He said that as we move towards 2016 we will hopefully get back into the bond markets, reclaim our sovereignty and achieve everything the Government has stated it wishes to achieve.  It will be interesting to see whether any of this happens.  The 1916 Proclamation refers to &ldquo;cherishing all of the children of the nation equally&rdquo; and to the nation having control over its affairs and destiny.  Giving more powers to Europe, the European Commission and the European Court of Justice in respect of how we run our budgets, etc., runs contrary to what is contained in the Proclamation.  All the children of the nation have not been cherished equally in response to the economic crisis.  I do not believe anyone could raise his or her hand and state that there is anything fair about what has been done.  The reality is that not one of those who were responsible &mdash; be they bankers, developers or whatever &mdash; for the huge mess that has created massive economic distress for working families has been imprisoned.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State spell out in clear terms what will be the process in respect of the ESM funding?  Will he outline his view on what will be the Government&rsquo;s approach if the people vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum and if we are obliged to then make a choice on the ESM treaty?</P>

I have tried really hard to come to terms with Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position but I cannot do so because it does not make any sense.</P>

	<P>We have emerged from a period when there was a lack of discipline and regulation and when rules were bent, broken, ignored, abandoned, etc.  The latter explains, in some part, why we are in the mess in which we find ourselves.  Senator Cullinane can shake his head all he likes but what I have said is true.  I would have thought that a level of internal discipline to which we can all sign up in equal part makes plain common sense.</P>

	<P>I am talking about Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s argument, the one it would put to those people who may be deciding to invest in Ireland because they believe economic progress is being made here, albeit slow, painful and difficult.  I would love to hear how Sinn F&eacute;in and others who oppose this treaty would explain to those wishing to invest in Ireland how budgetary and internal discipline is not a good development.  The fact is Sinn F&eacute;in never gets challenged to do this.  Its members are able to talk at great length involving all kinds of things but they have never been in the position as members of the Government having to talk about policy and budgetary rules to companies considering investing in Ireland.  Effectively it gets away with its own imaginative play on words, trying to persuade the public to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; when we all know job creation is important.  The only way we can achieve future job creation and encourage companies to consider this small island off the Atlantic as a place worth investing in is by continuing to rebuild and believe in ourselves.  This is only one small piece of an enormous jigsaw.</P>
        <P>The Europe 2020 vision for the social market economy has headline targets which must be translated to national targets.  We have to strive for 75% of the population to be employed.  Up to 30% of EU GDP must be invested in research and development over the next five years.  It also sets out climate and energy targets, the taking of millions of people out of poverty and all school leavers having a diploma.  These are real targets for which the Government will be responsible for achieving, albeit far more slowly than most of us would like.  Voting for this treaty will be a step in that direction because it will bring discipline across the Union.</P>

	<P>Regarding Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s query about the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, that is dealt with by a separate intergovernmental treaty.  We cannot veto the ESM treaty.  It is required to be ratified by member states whose initial financial contribution to the ESM is 90% of the total.  All member states must ratify the amendment to the treaty on the functioning of the EU that refers to the ESM.  That amendment, however, will not necessarily establish the ESM.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane then referred to cherishing the children of the nation equally.  How can anyone who wants to cherish the children of the nation not vote for the ESM treaty?  We need it to ensure we have maximum surety and stability and can avail of the assistance of necessary funds.  Without having the ESM in place, there is no guarantee that we will be able to go to the markets.  Anyone in their right mind would be in favour of the insurance mechanism which is the ESM.  I would have thought Senator Cullinane would have recognised that and how it is a natural progression to an insurance mechanism as contained in the treaty.</P>
        <P>This treaty is part and parcel of the pathway forward that the Government has planned and is working through effectively.  We recently had the first economic growth in the past four years.  Our export markets are very effective.  Agrifood businesses have done extraordinarily well with a 30% increase in farmer earnings last year.  There is light at the end of the tunnel.  This treaty fits into the planned pathway to recovery by providing terms of fiscal discipline, stability and structure.  The Government is also focused on growth and job creation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This treaty is a good package.  It is important to sell it to the people and ensure they know what is intended.  I thank Senators for their wide-ranging and knowledgeable contributions.  No issue was left out and I thank both sides of the House for their arguments.  It is important we tease out in detail all the elements of a measure as important as this treaty which will be presented to the people.</P>

    <Title>Report of Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to attend the House to discuss the final report of the Mahon tribunal.  By now, more than one month after its publication, Senators and those outside the House will have had an opportunity to begin to digest the full findings of the report.  Its size &mdash; at more than 3,200 pages &mdash; makes this no easy task, but it is important for various reasons that we understand and, more crucially, accept its findings as the culmination of long years of investigation and public hearings.  While it was a long time ago, it is worth recalling how, in 1995, two concerned citizens placed an advertisement in the name of a firm of Newry solicitors offering a reward for information leading to convictions for planning corruption.  The late James Gogarty came forward with astonishing allegations of widespread corruption at the highest levels, from which events snowballed, leading to the resignation of former Minister Ray Burke and the setting up of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In the intervening years the tribunal held more than 900 days of public sittings; called more than 400 witnesses before it; generated approximately 60,000 pages of transcripts; and exhibited more than 80,000 pages of documentation in public hearings.  By any standards, this was a monumental task.  In this regard, I pay tribute to the chairman of the tribunal, Mr. Justice Alan Mahon, and his predecessor, Mr. Justice Fergus Flood, as well as to the other two members of the tribunal, Judges Mary Faherty and Gerard Keys.  Without doubt, they have rendered the State a considerable service which will be a turning point in how we collectively deal with corruption, most particularly in the planning system.</P>
        <P>By any stretch of the imagination, the tribunal&rsquo;s final report makes for difficult and dispiriting reading.  The venality of those found responsible for accepting corruption payments and the cynicism of those willing to offer them are truly shocking.  The poor judgment shown by those found to have acted improperly is equally disturbing.  The headline findings are, by now, well known.  The report makes findings of corruption against a number of named individuals, including former Minister Padraig Flynn, the late Liam Lawlor, the lobbyist Frank Dunlop and developer Owen O&rsquo;Callaghan.  It also makes findings of corruption and-or impropriety against no less than 32 councillors.  In addition, the tribunal concluded that former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern had not provided a truthful account as to the sources of various funds and, because of this, it was unable to determine their provenance.  These events span the 1980s and 1990s.  From this, we can conclude that we are not, unfortunately, dealing with isolated individuals or cases but widespread corruption and impropriety.  The report states unequivocally that &ldquo;corruption in Irish political life was both endemic and systemic&rdquo; and that it &ldquo;affected every level of Government from some office holders of top ministerial offices to some local councillors&rdquo;.  There can be no more damning finding of the system.</P>
        <P>However repulsed we may be, we should not and cannot avert our gaze from the findings of the report, nor should anyone seek to minimise, downplay, obfuscate and dissimulate in apportioning blame and responsibility to those who have brought the idea of public service into such disrepute.  Unfortunately, all have been present in the debate which has ensued on the final report.  However, we cannot throw our hands up in despair; rather, we must seek to rebuild our systems and procedures to strengthen the hand of the vast majority of those public servants, both elected and unelected, who go about their business with honesty, integrity and sincerity.</P>
        <P>In the immediate aftermath of publication of the Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s report and having regard to its serious content, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government referred it to the Garda Commissioner, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the chairman of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The Garda Commissioner has since referred the report to the head of the Criminal Assets Bureau with a view to identifying what, if any, criminal offences have been disclosed which may require investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It will be a matter solely and exclusively for these State bodies to decide on what action, if any, to take on foot of the report.</P>
        <P>In addition, on 27 March, only five days after its publication, the report was formally considered at a Government meeting.  The primary outcome of that meeting was that it was agreed that the relevant Departments, working with bodies under their aegis, as appropriate, would consider urgently the recommendations of the tribunal and, by the end of April, revert to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with proposed actions to be taken on foot of the recommendations made and a timeframe for their implementation.  The intention is that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will report back to the Government as early as possible in May with a whole-of-government response to the report&rsquo;s entire set of recommendations.  Senators will appreciate, in view of the foregoing, that I am not in a position to provide a final and definitive Government position on the recommendations of the report.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, I would like to discuss the main recommendations in detail.  As Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, I have a special interest in this area and, in particular, the ten recommendations the Mahon tribunal made about planning out of a total of 64 recommendations.  In the first instance, before getting into the details of the recommendations, it is important to point out that planning corruption is not a victimless crime because it subordinates the public good of proper planning to the private good of developers who have deep and corrupt pockets.  The Mahon tribunal revealed the wholesale degradation of the physical public sphere, particularly in Dublin, for the benefit of the few to the detriment of the many.  I am keenly aware of the strong relationship between the need to have a planning system operating with integrity and efficiency and our efforts to overcome immense economic challenges and prepare for the country&rsquo;s economic and social recovery.  I also wish to underscore the strong synergy between the planning recommendations of the Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s report and recent and ongoing reforms to the legislative underpinning and operation of planning.</P>
        <P>In 2002 Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national spatial strategy was published.  It was followed by the introduction of regional planning guidelines in 2004 and their substantial revision in 2010.  Together, the strategy and guidelines provide for a more strategic approach to planning, where the debate is less about whose field is to be zoned and more about how places are to be used in the longer term.  The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 has gone some way to establishing statutory recognition of the national spatial strategy and the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 provided for further amplification.  For instance, the 2010 Act strengthened regional co-ordination, delivered a better alignment of planning nationally, regionally and locally, and introduced a new requirement for core strategies in the development plan process.  This requirement is intended to secure a strategic and phased approach to zoning that will facilitate infrastructure provision &mdash; showing the location, quantum and phasing of proposed development and clearly demonstrating links to housing strategies, retail policies, transport plans, new schools, etc., while showing the adoption of consistent national policy across all our regions.  This process is one that local authorities are strongly engaging with because they recognise the need for a stronger, plan-led approach to development that will facilitate careful management of, and prudent investment in, infrastructure provision at a time of acute pressure on the public finances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal indicate that the progress achieved to date is not a panacea.  While the 2006 and 2010 Acts have brought improvements there is still a significant job of work to be done to ensure that a coherent, forward looking approach to planning informs all decisions taken at local, regional and national levels.  I do not want to prejudge the outcome of deliberations on the tribunal findings.  However, Senators will appreciate there is a need for far-reaching reform of the way elected members, officials and others interact with the planning process.</P>
        <P>The need now is to re-examine zoned land and to move to a position where all zoning is based on a quantifiable need that is community based rather than developer-led.  The population targets which are used in the Regional Planning Guidelines 2010-2022 have been incorporated into core strategies and will prove critical in helping to plan for future development.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 has provided a strengthened legal and policy framework for local area plans, particularly in relation to zoning at local area plan level.  This underpins the need for consistency from the national spatial strategy, through the regional planning guidelines, to the development plans and finally to local area plan level.  This is critical as, in reality, it is often at local area plan level that the strategic zoning decisions are taken.  Development plans will incorporate the core strategies and local authorities will consider whether the relevant local area plans require subsequent changes to ensure consistency within the overall planning system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The benefits that this process is bringing are significant, most notably the following: planning is better supported by evidence-based requirements and is linked to the Government&rsquo;s strategic plan, for example, through the national spatial strategy and capital allocations; there is a coherent basis to ensure planning and investment in infrastructure and services is focused on the most suitable locations; there is a tackling of the legacy of over-zoning and a move towards a more co-ordinated and joined-up approach to the delivery of critical services such as schools, public transport, water services and social housing; there is a focus on revitalising our city and town centres, moving against the tendency of the pre-tribunal era to envisage extensive, even sprawling extensions of our cities and towns, drawing the lifeblood out of older, established central urban areas; the elected members of the planning authorities are now required to bring together the key messages of a typically long and detailed development plan into a clear message about future plans and priorities in their area; and a level of certainty is being achieved about where development will take place, which will provide a level of certainty for developers.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I take the opportunity to outline some initiatives in which I have been involved during the short period since I took office, which are pointers for the way forward.  Recently I received the regional planning guidelines implementation annual report 2011, which was prepared by the eight regional authorities, having particular regard to the core strategy provisions of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 and ensuring proper oversight of the alignment of plans at national, regional and local level.  This report is very significant because it improves strategic oversight of the planning system by effectively measuring how local, regional and national planning strategies are being co-ordinated through the core strategy-related provisions of the 2010 Act.  The report of the regional authorities clearly demonstrates that serious progress is being made and must continue to be made in tackling what was often the planning systems historical addiction to zoning as opposed to focusing on the issues that matter most to local communities.  The 2010 Act is aimed at decreasing the need for ministerial intervention in development plans and local area plans by bringing clarity to the legal responsibilities of planning authorities to have reasonable and evidence-based plans, rather than rely on the Minister&rsquo;s intervention in the plan process.  This does not automatically rule out the need for my future intervention, in particular in the context of ensuring local plans and development plans are consistent.  I will closely monitor their consistency with the now adopted core strategies in development plans.</P>
        <P>On 4 April last, I launched an innovative Internet-based planning information system called <i>Myplan.ie</i> which for the first time draws together all the zoning maps of every development plan and local area plan in the country.  The aim of <i>Myplan.ie</i> is to create a one-stop shop for information about plans and also to provide other information which is relevant to planning decision making, such as census information, heritage sites, patterns of housing development and so on.  The system is fully accessible to the public on-line and is free of charge.  As such, it enables a much more open and transparent approach to tracking the integration of plans across the country, and it promises to be a game-changer in terms of how the public will view the operation of the forward planning system.</P>
        <P>I turn to the planning recommendations of the Mahon tribunal report.  Recommendation No. 2, on direct election to regional authorities, will be considered in the context of the forthcoming policy proposals of the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, concerning further local government reform, to include the regional dimension.  Recommendation No. 3, to an extent, has already been acted upon in recent legislative amendments.  Recommendation No. 4 is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</P>
        <P>Other recommendations propose sensible improvements to enhance accountability, transparency and fairness in the planning process.  I believe we would all largely agree on these but we must study them closely and consider them carefully as we prepare to respond to them in greater detail.  I have already met officials in order to progress these recommendations, particularly, in the planning section of the Department.</P>
        <P>Without question, however, the most fundamental recommendation is for the establishment of an independent planning regulator.  In this one recommendation, the Mahon tribunal essentially tells legislators that notwithstanding the roles of local authorities and the Minister, and progress made in recent years in tightening up a previously lax system, planning, especially the forward planning process, needs independent oversight.  This oversight function must have the appropriate legal mandate and resources to determine whether plans are in compliance with legal requirements and, if they are not, to determine what intervention may be necessary where serious policy departures have taken place, or where there is strong evidence of bad practice or systemic failure.  In other words, the tribunal&rsquo;s assessment is that Ireland needs to introduce an element of independent review of forward planning and planning administration practice in the manner that An Bord Plean&aacute;la undoubtedly delivers in overseeing our planning application appeals system.  I intend to look at this recommendation and consult on it.  My main focus in all this is to improve accountability and transparency.</P>
        <P>In the short term, Senators will also be aware of a legacy of planning complaints on foot of which the previous administration had announced a planning review that was intended to assess the application of planning legislation, policy and guidance within the development plan and development management systems at local level and to inform further policy development in these areas.  A number of planning authorities, representing a broad geographical spread of urban and rural areas and large and small authorities, were selected to assist in the review of policies and practices by reference to a number of cases raised with my Department.  I assure Senators that work on this is progressing at a pace and I expect to receive a report from my officials in the near future following which I will make a public statement, including any appropriate actions to be pursued in regard to further policy development and guidance while also taking account of the need to develop wider proposals for improving the transparency and openness of the planning system, as recommended in the final report of the Mahon tribunal.  While I do not want to prejudice the outcome of the process, if warranted, I will instigate further investigation of any matters requiring this.</P>
        <P>I turn to some other recommendations of the final report which fall within the remit of my Department.  There is no doubt that the whole issue of political donations was at the centre of many planning controversies.  As Senators will be aware, the Electoral (Amendment)(Political Donations) Bill 2011 has progressed through this House and is before the D&aacute;il.  I am pleased to note that a number of specific recommendations of the tribunal are already being addressed in that legislation.  Under the Bill, the books of political parties will be opened up to public scrutiny.  The maximum amount that can be accepted as a political donation will be more than halved, with significant reductions in the thresholds for the public declaration of political donations.  Other measures in the Bill provide for greater transparency by both donors and those in receipt of political donations.</P>
        <P>Building on the relevant commitments in the programme for Government, the Bill goes further than any previous legislation in asserting the right of the people of Ireland to know how their political system and political parties are funded.  The Bill is informed by an understanding that excessive and secretive corporate funding of politics is corrosive to democracy and to public trust in politics.  Therefore, the Bill aims to see the development of a system of political funding based on a large number of small donations from citizens, rather than a small number of large donations from corporate bodies.  As part of the analysis under way, my Department is reviewing the report&rsquo;s recommendations in relation to electoral matters with a view to facilitating early Government consideration of the need to bring forward amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage, where appropriate.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These reforms go a considerable way to preventing the kind of wholesale subversion of the planning system by those willing to fund corrupt payments, often in the guise of legitimate political donations.  This is a particularly insidious process, as it threatens public trust in the legitimate funding of the political process and political parties.  By developing and open, transparent and moderated system of political funding, the room for corruption corresponding narrows, although, of course, it can never be eliminated.</P>
        <P>Another issue which has come under close scrutiny in the tribunal&rsquo;s final report is that of the ethics framework.  Within my Department&rsquo;s remit the ethical performance of elected members and officials in local authorities is a key consideration.  The Local Government Act 2001 introduced a comprehensive ethics framework for all those involved in the local government service, both members and employees.  This framework which came into effect in 2003 imposes a duty on all to maintain proper standards of integrity, conduct and concern for the public interest.</P>
        <P>The requirements contained in the Act are developed in the Local Government Act 2001 (Part 15) Regulations 2004 which include an obligation on members and relevant employees to complete annual declarations.  In addition, two codes of conduct, one for members and one for employees, were issued in 2004.  The aim of these codes is to set out the standards and principles of conduct and integrity for local authority employees and councillors, to inform the public of the conduct it is entitled to expect and to uphold public confidence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The tribunal report&rsquo;s recommendations will be examined closely in the context of the existing ethics framework to ensure we take whatever further steps are necessary to restore and underpin confidence and transparency in the local government system, to ensure the highest standards are adhered to and to provide protection for the vast majority of members and staff who behave with probity and integrity.  It should also be noted that the conduct of local authority members and employees comes within the remit of the Standards in Public Office Commission which oversees compliance with the requirements of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  In this regard, my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who has previously highlighted the importance of ensuring the legislative framework in regard to ethics is robust, modernised and relevant in today&rsquo;s world is now examining the Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s final report and the Moriarty tribunal report within the Government&rsquo;s overall political reform agenda.  In this context, it is worth noting that in its recommendations the Mahon tribunal explicitly calls for the establishment of a statutory register of lobbyists incorporating minimum disclosure requirements, as well as the introduction of a cross-sectoral whistleblower protection Act.  The Government&rsquo;s recognition of the vital role that can be played by effective whistleblower legislation in discouraging and disclosing serious wrongdoing is fully in accordance with that of the tribunal.  The current position is that at the end of February the Minister published the general scheme of a protected disclosures in the public interest Bill, while work has commenced in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the drafting of a Bill.</P>
        <P>On lobbying, in the light of the firm commitment in the programme for Government and following the completion of a call for evidence at the end of last month, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is drafting a policy paper on the introduction of a register of lobbyists.  This paper will form the basis for further consultation on the operational design of the proposed regulatory system and is intended to lead to Government approval for the drafting of a Bill for publication later this year.</P>
        <P>Beyond the registration of lobbyists and the introduction of whistleblower legislation, a large number of recommendations in the final report relate to conflicts of interest, characterised by the Mahon tribunal as the root cause of corruption.  Collectively, these recommendations point to the need for an extensive overhaul of the legislative framework in regard to ethics.  In particular, the Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s report identifies a range of important issues relating to effective control of conflicts of interest, actual and perceived.  These include the introduction of extended disclosure requirements; the removal of exceptions to disclosures; more timely updating of disclosures; a prohibition on gifts or benefits other than those of a nominal value; and extending the enforcement role of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  In responding fully to these recommendations of the tribunal, further examination will be necessary of how ethics legislation might be simplified and also the case for adopting a more integrated approach with other related legislation.  This may be required in order to ensure a comprehensive and coherent legal framework will be in place in the future to seek to guard against the abuses revealed in the tribunal&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>For everyone in the House and all others outside it, the findings of the final report of the Mahon tribunal present a truly awful picture of some aspects of political life in the 1980s and 1990s.  There can be no, nor should there be, gainsaying of this basic conclusion.  These findings and the associated recommendations place a heavy burden on the existing body politic to ensure, simply, wholesale corruption is never again allowed to flourish unchecked in local and national government.  Work to this end has commenced.  Having referred the report to other organs of State, they must now be left to do their work independently on following up on what happened in the past.  In addition, the Government has embarked on an urgent and active consideration of the tribunal&rsquo;s recommendations in order that we take whatever steps are necessary.  The overriding aim is to ensure what has been set out in the tribunal&rsquo;s report will never happen again and work towards restoring public confidence in the political system.  Nothing less is expected of us and nothing less will suffice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her opening statement.  As all Members will agree, the basic foundation of any political system is confidence that decisions are made through the right processes and for the right reasons.  The Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s report massively dented that confidence in its over 3,200 pages.  It details the most appalling and outrageous betrayal of trust at all levels in the country, from a former Taoiseach and leader of my party who failed to give a truthful account of the source of over &pound;200,000 to a dozen councillors of various parties who took corrupt payments to buy their support for planning proposals.  From reading the report, what is most damning, apart from references to the individuals involved, is Mr. Justice Mahon&rsquo;s findings that corruption in Irish political life in the 1980s was systemic and endemic.  The individuals involved have a lot to account for, but the problem was much wider than this.  There was a culture of seeking and taking bribes to support rezoning proposals.  The Mahon tribunal examined particular areas in Dublin for which it had a brief.  I have no doubt, however, that questions could be asked elsewhere. </P>
        <P>As the Minister of State who has responsibility for housing correctly pointed out, the report displays a culture in which people made decisions on housing developments and condemned families to live in badly planned developments, with poor access to schools and transport.  Some people live in places in which there are no paths out of their estates.  Decisions were made in order that developers and businessmen could make the maximum profit, with no thought for families who have been condemned to live in such estates.</P>
        <P>I will return to the implications of the report for my party.  Apart from the individuals concerned, at its most damning level the report reveals that the culture was well known at the time.  Mr. Justice Mahon said it was widely known and widely tolerated.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has outlined how, as a member of Dublin City Council, she had to beat a path through developers to attend council meetings.</P>
        <P>The report also reveals that senior politicians, while not found to have taken money, coalesced or, at least, acquiesced in the fact that others did nothing about it, including another former leader of my party.  The tribunal made no personal findings against a former leader of Fine Gael.  When asked about Councillor Hand&rsquo;s request for a bribe, he said neither Fine Gael nor the world was populated by angels.</P>
        <P>From start to finish the report reveals that even those not personally involved in taking bribes were aware that there was such a culture.  Fine Gael Councillor Mary Muldoon said after the report was published that it was her view that 50% of the councillors with whom she had served had taken bribes and that she had been punished for the fact that she had not.  She said that those on councils who were not trusted at the time were not those who were dishonest but those who were honest because colleagues who were on the take did not trust others and were afraid they might blow the whistle about what was going on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s report details startling planning corruption at a local level which I appreciate is what today&rsquo;s debate is about.  It is also important to briefly make the connection with the Moriarty tribunal&rsquo;s report.  The two reports, taken together, show different levels of corruption.  The Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s report refers to corruption at a local element, while the Moriarty tribunal&rsquo;s report refers to national politics and the corrupt selection of the winning bid for the most lucrative State contract in Irish history.  It reveals in quite startling detail how 15 donations were made to the Minister&rsquo;s party in the lead-up to that contract being awarded.  I say that not to make a political point, because that is not where I am coming from on this, but to say the two are just as important.  As we talk about the Mahon tribunal report today, it is important we do not lose sight of the points made in the Moriarty tribunal report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appreciate that while I have mentioned breaches of ethics, trust and basic political standards, other parties have been implicated.  To be fair to the Labour Party Members present, none of that party&rsquo;s members has been mentioned in the report, or while one individual is mentioned, that person left the party a long time ago.  The Mahon tribunal report shows that proximity to power was central and the reality is that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael councillors were the ones who had the power over the period and that, in many ways, was accompanied by corruption.  While other parties were implicated, there is no doubt, and in any contribution I have made to this House I have accepted, that Fianna F&aacute;il members have been associated with some of the worst breaches of ethics.</P>
        <P>The findings of the Mahon tribunal and the other negative findings that have gone before it represent a serious betrayal of the trust that has been put in Fianna F&aacute;il public representatives.  It is not only gutting for people who have supported us over the years and genuinely believed those they voted for were honest and would do the right thing, it is particularly gutting for our members, the ordinary volunteers who have never got a penny out of being involved in the party and who have freely given up their time to go out at election time to knock on doors in support of candidates they have thought would make a positive contribution to their communities.  While the report refers to a small number of corrupt individuals, I completely accept that the impact for Fianna F&aacute;il is much wider than that, and not just because there are leaders involved.  When leaders are either openly involved in taking payments or, as I said, openly acquiesce in the fact that others have, this sends a very negative signal about the organisation.  I appreciate, therefore, the shadow the Mahon tribunal report has cast on Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is the case even for younger members like me as well as those like me in this House who have never taken a corporate donation.  While I was never in the Galway tent and was in primary school when most of the things written about in the Mahon report occurred, I still fully accept that many people do not fully trust the party as a whole.  I appreciate the challenge that exists, even for younger members of the party, to regain that trust and to show people we deserve it and that Fianna F&aacute;il representatives are honest and decent people.  Again, the majority of people involved in the party will never get a penny out of politics.  They are honest and decent people who have been let down, although I appreciate we have a job to do to convince people of that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister talked about some of the changes that have happened in recent years, for example, improvements in the standards in public office legislation, including declaration of donations, the procedures that have been put in place for civil servants and local authority staff and some of the improvements that have been made in the planning process.  In the Mahon tribunal report, Mr. Justice Mahon accepts that things have changed and ethics requirements have improved a lot in the past 20 years.  Huge weaknesses remain, however, which the Minister acknowledged in his contribution today, including the lack of transparency regarding lobbyists, the need for legislation on whistleblowing and the very high threshold before donations have to be declared.</P>
        <P>When the political funding Bill came through the House, the view of Members on both sides of the House, including myself, was that while donations limits were being lowered, this was not going far enough.  A lot of change still needs to happen at national level.  I regret that the independent planning inquiries were closed down because, while they are being looked at under a separate process within the Department, independence is important.  With regard to corporate donations, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government said in the House his advice was that a referendum would be required to ban corporate donations.  This is a matter that should be looked at by the constitutional convention.  Equally, while we are looking at donations, the expenditure side also needs to be addressed and I hope it is on the Government&rsquo;s agenda.  The reason people raise so much money currently is that they can spend so much money.  There is no doubt many changes are needed at national level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To return to Fianna F&aacute;il, the party in its initial response to the Mahon tribunal report was very strong and immediate.  In fact, I was criticised on some shows for the fact it was too fast, which I thought extraordinary.  It was positive that when the report was published in the morning, by the evening our party leader had made it clear that motions would be brought to expel certain members from the party.  I believe Fianna F&aacute;il must go further than that.  While I hope changes will be made in national politics in the areas I have mentioned such as donations, lobbying and so on, Fianna F&aacute;il should set the highest standards of all parties.  We have already done some of that.  At our recent Ard-Fheis, we brought in a motion on new procedures whereby candidates, before they get on the ticket, will have to make declarations to the party about donations similar to those made to the Standards in Public Office &mdash; SIPO &mdash; Commission.  Other changes are needed such as publishing our audited accounts and going further than the SIPO requirements in regard to publishing donations and the like.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The majority of politicians in all parties are genuine and honest people.  The Mahon tribunal report massively damaged people&rsquo;s faith in politics, which needs to change.  I believe Fianna F&aacute;il, given the events outlined in this report and elsewhere, needs to be the standard bearer and needs to set tougher standards than anybody else in order that it can restore trust in the party.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss this important report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments.  It is important this House provides the necessary time to consider a report of such profound significance for the fundamentals of politics, planning and public life in Ireland.  The publication of the report last month has brought to finality a process that began in November 1997, when the tribunal of inquiry was established in response to serious public concern in respect of allegations of corruption relating to the planning process, in particular in so far as this related to the Dublin area.</P>
        <P>It has been a long and protracted process that has taken 15 years to complete and has cost in excess of &euro;250 million.  That being so, I believe we can all agree that the workings of the tribunal have had a profound and formative influence on the planning system in Ireland.  The Minister of State commended the judges who took part in the tribunal and I join her in that.  The tribunal has established the truth in a way no other investigation into planning corruption has ever done.  I want to put on record that I accept all the findings of the tribunal unequivocally.</P>
        <P>Some have complained about the delay in finalising the tribunal report.  I know we had a referendum as to whether there is a better way to investigate systems when things go wrong.  We saw what was done by the Committee of Public Accounts and the money this brought in to pay for its investigation.  The tribunal has done good work and is to complimented.  There should be ongoing scrutiny of all issues, however, and there should be a cost-effective way of doing it.  I ask the Minister to consider this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Corruption in public life, which we now know on foot of this report was both endemic and systemic, affected every level of Government from some holders of top ministerial offices to the many local councillors who were mentioned.  The report made adverse findings against elected representatives at every level of elected office from county council level to the office of Taoiseach, including two Taoisigh from Fianna F&aacute;il, Senators, Deputies and a European Commissioner, again from Fianna F&aacute;il.  Is it any wonder people do not trust politicians?  It is a sad day that politics and politicians have been brought into disrepute.  Senator Averil Power said it involved people from all parties but, as she recognised, it was Fianna Fail in office which really brought disrepute to the system and damaged confidence.  I know there are many in Fianna F&aacute;il, such as Senator Power and others, who are saddened to see that all three individuals who led Fianna F&aacute;il from 1979 until May 2008, all of whom held the office of Taoiseach, have now been the subject of adverse findings by tribunals of inquiry, be it the beef tribunal, the Moriarty tribunal, whereby Deputy Lowry was thrown out of Fine Gael, or the Mahon tribunal.</P>
        <P>Senator Averil Power referred to the Moriarty tribunal.  I am keen to see one of the suggestions made at the end of the Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s report implemented.  If people in politics are found to be tainted, they should not be afforded the same services as others with regard to meeting Ministers and so on, even if they are re-elected.  I call on the Minister to re-examine the matter in the case of people in my party and others and that of people who were expelled from parties and re-elected.  Such action must be considered.</P>
        <P>The reports of the planning tribunal have far exceeded what many thought possible when the tribunal was established.  They set out clearly how the planning process in Dublin in the 1980s and 1990s was undermined and corrupted by several developers and some councillors who sought to enrich themselves.  I was a member of Dublin County Council at the time and party to the decisions on the rezonings in question.  I was newly elected in 1991 when they were made.  I was concerned about them, but I had no proof of anything.  I was not a member of Mary Muldoon&rsquo;s party at the time.  No one came to me to explain that some people were being paid for their vote and to ask whether I was being paid.  No one asked me these questions.  I can say that much with hand on my heart.  One had to make up one&rsquo;s own mind.  One must be sensible.  I am pleased with the tribunal which has rooted out corruption in planning.  I was concerned at one stage when I saw a cheque being waved in the air, but there was no proof.  There was no preliminary investigation at the time into the suggestions and innuendos made.  This left councillors such as me in the lurch.  If something had been thrown out into the open, perhaps many people might not be in trouble now.</P>
        <P>Tribunals must possess political and financial independence and enjoy public trust and confidence.  The report&rsquo;s findings merit full consideration by all relevant organs of State.  The Government has brought the findings of the report to the attention of the relevant authorities, including the Garda Commissioner, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the chairman of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The Minister of State has outlined what she and her Department, as well as the Minister responsible, Deputy Phil Hogan, are doing.</P>
        <P>I understand the report was the subject of an initial consideration by the Cabinet on foot of which all relevant Ministers were asked to consider the recommendations which fell within their remit.  The Minister responsible, Deputy Phil Hogan, stated last month that the initial consideration was to be completed by the end of April or early May and that the Government would return to the issue collectively.  The Minister of State has indicated what she is doing.  I am keen to hear an update on the collective view of all Departments involved.</P>
        <P>There can be no doubt that the findings of the report have done significant damage to the reputation of and the level of public trust in the political system.  However, in vigorously condemning the corruption, abuse of office and significant ethical lapses disclosed in the tribunal&rsquo;s report and taking all necessary and appropriate steps to prevent their recurrence, it is imperative that we do not fall victim to pessimism and despondency with regard to ethical standards in the public service and among the holders of public office.  This was properly characterised in the tribunal&rsquo;s report as the mistaken assumption that everyone was doing it.  I was a member of Dublin County Council and everyone was not doing it.  People in every party, including Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, were not doing it.  It is sad some have given politics such a bad name.  Perceptions such as this lead to a culture of pessimism and cast a dark shadow over the way in which our democracy operates.  The corruption that took place in the past must never be allowed to recur.  The Minister of State and the Minister have outlined some of the steps being taken to prevent history from repeating itself in this context.</P>
        <P>As long as there are outside bodies involved in political funding, politicians may leave themselves open to accusations of engaging in inappropriate actions by accepting funding at election time or at a later date.  There has been a major discussion on this issue.  It is a difficult matter, but everyone must take personal responsibility.  Everyone should not make mistakes and should ensure he or she does not find himself or herself in the position in which some councillors and ex-councillors now find themselves having accepted inappropriate contributions.</P>
        <P>I commend the Government for the progress made during its first year in office and in advance of the publication last month of the tribunal&rsquo;s final report.  This demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s determination to minimise the risk of a repetition of some of the occurrences on which the tribunal made findings.  Planning is an issue that pervades the tribunal&rsquo;s work and analysis.  I welcome the systemic transformation of the planning system in recent years undertaken, albeit belatedly, by the last Government, as Senator Averil Power remarked.  Reform is continuing under the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, who should be commended for their work.  The planning review announced by the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley, was intended to assess the application of planning legislation, policy and guidelines within development plans.  The Minister stated the cases involved were being considered and that a report would be finalised in May.  The Minister of State will issue a public statement on the matter, including details of further actions necessary.  Senator Averil Power is wrong in this regard.  I imagine the Minister of State will come back to the point in her concluding remarks.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government made clear the intentions of the Labour Party and Fine Gael in the matter of the reform of political funding.  This was before the Moriarty and Mahon tribunal reports were published.  The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 is one of the Government reforms and the Minister has referred to what needs to be done and further actions need to be taken.  The Government is also developing whistleblower legislation.  The Minister of State has outlined what the Government is doing in this regard.</P>
        <P>The findings of the Mahon tribunal are totally negative and unacceptable with regard to the practices engaged in in the past, as evidenced by the Government&rsquo;s response.  We must review the case for deepening and intensifying various reform commitments contained in the programme for Government which could help to deal decisively and definitively with some of the legislative gaps and regulatory weaknesses that permitted these abuses to occur.  I hope the report of the Mahon tribunal leaves behind an era of corruption that will never be repeated.  Senator Averil Power has admitted to this.  I believe her party has seen the light and that some of the newer and senior members have accepted this.  It should be acknowledged that certain members were thrown out of her party.</P>
        <P>The Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s report provides us with the recommendations and guidance that can help us along the road not only to economic but ethical recovery.  It is our responsibility to try to restore hope and confidence in the country and restore the trust that people should have in public institutions and representatives.  We must earn that respect by our words and actions and have systems and people in place who enjoy the respect and allegiance of all the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinMcAleese"><NameTxt>Senator Martin McAleese</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her attendance.  It is almost one month since publication of the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments &mdash; the Mahon tribunal.  The passage of time has not diminished the sense of shock at the implications of the report.  In fact, the challenges posed by its findings grow deeper the closer they are examined.  Many of the findings relate to individual cases, to some of which the Minister of State has referred.  They give rise to significant concerns.  However, several of the general findings are especially disturbing and I wish to comment on their wider implications.  </P>
        <P>The first finding is stated in paragraph 1.12 of the report: &ldquo;The Tribunal&rsquo;s inquiries uncovered evidence of deep-rooted, systemic corruption in Irish public life&rdquo;.  This statement demands our attention and should halt us in our tracks.  It is expanded on in paragraph 1.21:</P>
        <P LI="1">Given the existence of such rampant public corruption, the obvious question is why it was allowed to continue unabated.  The short answer to that question is that it continued because nobody was prepared to do enough to stop it.  This is perhaps inevitable when corruption ceases to become an isolated event and becomes so entrenched that it is transformed into an acknowledged way of doing business.  Specifically, because corruption affected every level of Irish political life, those with the power to stop it were frequently implicated in it.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These findings reflect badly on public and political life.  Rampant and systemic corruption is hardly the hallmark of a country that anyone wishes for himself or herself or his or her children.  However, that is the truth, as found by the Mahon tribunal, and it is incumbent on us to face up to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the immediately concerning aspects is that the tribunal&rsquo;s inquiries and findings were confined by its the terms of reference to &ldquo;certain planning matters and payments&rdquo; within defined time periods and mostly in the Dublin area.  Given the finding of systemic corruption in Irish public and political life, the obvious concern is that many more instances of corruption may be as yet undiscovered in other geographical areas, during other times, or in fields other than planning.  The fact that the report took 15 years to complete and at a cost in excess of &euro;300 million must also be a concern in terms of the message it sends to those who may currently be involved in corrupt practices or those who may be tempted to do so.  Could the controversy over the length and cost of the Mahon tribunal give undeserved comfort to those engaging in corrupt practices, that there will not be an appetite for future investigations and that they may not as a result be called to account?  We surely cannot allow that.  For the findings of the report evidence a serious breach of the trust placed by the people in our public and political structures.  It will take a long time to repair this breach of trust.  The lesson from this and other tribunal reports is that trust is no longer good enough.  What is needed is high quality, effectively enforced regulation and oversight to ensure the proper and transparent functioning of the State&rsquo;s public and political structures.  The immediate implementation of all of the report&rsquo;s recommendations would be a good starting point.</P>
        <P>It would also be appropriate to consider whether a tribunal is the most efficient and cost effective way to deal with these issues or future allegations which might be made.  Surely the key to exposing corrupt practices is by following the money trail.  As such, would these issues not more appropriately be dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners, if necessary by better equipping both bodies in terms of forensic accounting capabilities and resources?</P>
        <P>The public also have a role to play in recreating a more ethical public system and culture.  One of the greatest safeguards for the future would be the development of a culture of integrity where there is no public tolerance of corruption or circumvention of the law.  Creating a culture of this kind is an ongoing struggle and relies on the personal integrity of each and every one of us in our daily lives.</P>
        <P>The tribunal has done its job.  We now need to act on the &ldquo;deep-rooted&rdquo;, &ldquo;systemic&rdquo;, &ldquo;rampant&rdquo; and &ldquo;entrenched&rdquo; corruption which the report identifies in Irish public and political life.  Anything other than a full and urgent response from the political system to these overarching challenges will only serve to engender public cynicism at the very time when we most need a sense of togetherness.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is a downright disgrace. At this moment Fianna F&aacute;il Senators would be quite happy to come into the House and cause all kinds of arguments, to which they are perfectly entitled to do, but they are not here today and that makes a mockery of Senator Power&rsquo;s fine words about how Fianna F&aacute;il wishes to rebuild itself.  Much of that speech was about Fianna F&aacute;il and its need to rebuild itself but I am not interested in that and I do not believe many members of the public are either.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What we should be interested in is what the Mahon tribunal report means.  We cannot change what occurred in the past.  We can only try to change our future based on that past.  We can only do that if we remind ourselves of what happened and acknowledge it.  First, I acknowledge the work of those who wrote the final Mahon tribunal report and that of Judge Alan Mahon and his predecessor, Mr. Justice Flood.  There has been much complaint about the length of time the tribunal took to conclude its business but today I would rather concentrate on what the report means to us and what we might take from it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Mahon tribunal report follows in the footsteps of the Moriarty, McCracken and beef tribunals and it tells another instalment of the rotten structure that by and large was put together by Fianna F&aacute;il from its leaders, its Taoisigh, through its Ministers, its Deputies and its councillors.  This report is about planning matters and the payments to influence planning decisions and I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to reviewing the recommendation for an independent planning regulator and the recent launch of <i>Myplan.ie</i>, among other suggestions she has made.  The Mahon tribunal report is really about who we are, who we became and what was allowed to happen in the 1980s and 1990s.  What was allowed to happen was the slow growth of corruption at the heart of Government and, as a consequence, at the heart of everything because nothing with rotten roots can ever survive and so the edifice has fallen around us.  Ireland could never have survived or prospered under that kind of Government.  No matter what they said or insisted, it was a kind of a mirage, a gaudy painting, a promise that the good times would come and belong to all of us.  That was just a pack of lies.  The Mahon tribunal report makes sure that we know that it was a pack of lies, that public representatives and their sidekicks were lining their pockets at our expense &mdash; people essentially stealing from us by bending and breaking the rules to have things their way.  Those of us who tried to call a halt, who shouted &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; and who spoke out were variously ignored, laughed at, derided, bullied, sued, or, as in my case, charged, arrested and made to stand trial and also derided, bullied and sued.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Through these instalments of corruption &mdash; these various tribunals &mdash; three names stand out, three former Fianna F&aacute;il Taoisigh &mdash; Charles Haughey, Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern.  They were certainly able men; they turned their skills and energy, however, against the State.  They thought of themselves and their cronies first and they abandoned the principle of public representation and turned instead to private greed.  They found ways to use their power and status to reap a financial reward at our expense, directly and indirectly, in the short and the long term.  When one turns the pages of the Mahon tribunal report the one clear message that comes through is that public representatives sought corrupt payments.  The developers were not queuing up to pay them originally but pay they did when they realised that they would be left behind and would lose out in the terrible race for profit that had developed.  They saw that one had to be in with the crowd and they did what one would expect &mdash; they rushed headlong for a piece of the action.</P>
        <P>At the time this was happening I was working on the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme.  It was late 1992.  I had made the programme about corruption in the beef industry and the programme about abuse in the Catholic Church.  I had started an investigation into Charles Haughey who was the Taoiseach at the time because a very significant UK property developer had come to me and told me that a man whom he was willing to identify, and did identify, had come unannounced to his office demanding money on behalf of Charles Haughey so that a tender that he had put in for a significant property development in Dublin would be looked upon favourably. The property developer alleged that the bagman had in fact requested the money for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s republican activities.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Corruption does beget corruption and lies beget lies.  When one has this kind of corruption at the very epicentre of government in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office, it seeps out and spreads, and it did, and that was the damage and the rot.  In the end it included bankers, accountants, solicitors, civil servants, lobbyists, PR people and consultants &mdash; all seeking a share of this lucrative cake facilitating the slush funds and the brown envelopes with offshore bank accounts, false money trails and hidden pyramids of false companies and false trails of ownership.  They were then building a cosy cabal of business men &mdash; mostly, as opposed to women &mdash; bankers, developers, politicians and lobbyists, and they were delusional.  Out loud, they preached the prosperity message, that Ireland was growing, that citizens were benefiting, that this was a new Ireland where everyone could do well.  They were delusional too to the extent that they thought they would never be caught.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Those of us who tried to defy all of this were told - I was repeatedly told - that for &ldquo;the good of Ireland&rdquo; I should stop.  That has rankled with me for 20 years.  So great was this corruption that these people were quite prepared to sacrifice the people, all of us and ultimately the truth, for their own gain, their own profit, and Ireland could &ldquo;go hang&rdquo;.  It was the greatest lie of all.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party did everything in its power to keep this illusion alive, as evidenced by the litany of lies for two decades.  Judge Mahon uses imaginative variations to describe the evidence of former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, including terms such as &ldquo;failed to disclose&rdquo;, &ldquo;failed to account&rdquo;, &ldquo;rejected evidence&rdquo;, &ldquo;not provided with a truthful account&rdquo; and that the tribunal &ldquo;rejected his contention&rdquo;, &ldquo;rejected his explanation&rdquo; or that he &ldquo;failed to truthfully account&rdquo;.  Other phrases used in the report include &ldquo;contrary to the position he maintained&rdquo;, &ldquo;remains unexplained&rdquo;, &ldquo;unable to determine the source&rdquo; and &ldquo;unable to pronounce as to its source&rdquo;.  The report gives us a hint of what was going on.  There were strange transactions with money from the United States, the United Kingdom and Ireland, a safe in Drumcondra, bags of cash in hotel bedrooms and pubs, fund-raisers and whip-rounds and councillors queuing up breathlessly for some dirty money from a dirty bag man.  Let me be clear, however; we have had only the merest glimpse of the truth and reality of this dirty money and these dirty deals.  This was a banana republic, a mad place without rules and regulations and, ultimately, without decency, honour or honesty.</P>
        <P>The Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s report is a turning point on the road towards growing up.  We have had many turning points, for example, the beef tribunal, the report of which ultimately showed the lengths to which the authorities would go to try to keep the lid on the whole business.  They called me the guilty party and claimed the bag and envelope culture was a figment of my imagination.  The McCracken and Moriarty tribunals signalled clearly that the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, was completely corrupt and had friends in low places who were willing to play his game and be protected by him and his rotten cronies.  Ultimately, nobody stood up to him.</P>
        <P>We now have the Mahon tribunal&rsquo;s report naming and shaming the former Taoisigh, Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern, as well as Deputies and councillors who were methodically on the take because they could be.  We have had so many turning points that we have become twisted and contorted and, ultimately, confused.  The purpose of inquiry and investigation is to get to the truth and, ultimately, for all of us to see accountability.  After spending millions of euro, investing hours of energy and time and putting to use some good brains, all we have are shreds of truth and an absence of accountability &mdash; at least not yet.  It is no wonder people do not want to put their hands in their pockets again to bail out this country because they &mdash; in fact, we &mdash; were not the ones who corrupted it from the inside out.  We have not walked away with fat pensions, big houses and cars or lavish lifestyles.  There will not be a televised State funeral, after dinner speaking engagements, board memberships and lucrative globe trotting for us.</P>
        <P>Having looked to the past for some years now, we know there is no truth and we will not obtain it either.  There are too many faded memories and too much convenient amnesia.  The paper shredders have rearranged the past and we must be satisfied with the shreds of truth we have been given to serve as an indicator of what took place.  We must straighten up, turn to the future and look forward.  Let us bring those who have lied and cheated to trial and make them stand where I stood, in other words, they should assume the label &ldquo;accused&rdquo; and be required to answer in a court of law.  We must move on with a much greater appreciation that the rogues who can pull a fast one, love the con and bend the rules are no longer to be admired.  They have ruined our country.  Neither this nor any other parliament can legislate for honesty.  What we must do is legislate for greater accountability.  That is the rot that remains with us today.  The onus is on us to build a better country and the reports of the Mahon and other tribunals must inform the future, even though they have provided us with only an incomplete picture of our past.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators will be <i>ad idem</i> that probity in public life is a <i>sine qua non</i>.  People who are involved in politics must be able to exercise decisions independent of pecuniary interests and influence.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case throughout life.  Politics in this country is overwhelmingly kosher.  I have been involved for many years and there are very few instances to which I could point.  However, this was about very serious breaches of the fiduciary duty that people have to the offices that they held.  Like others, I would have no truck with that.</P>
        <P>The tribunal clearly showed us that there is a need for an effective and fair investigative process which can deal with these matters in an efficient and timely way, and which can bring anybody who transgresses to account.  There should be significant penalties and sanctions that would act as a deterrent to avoid any repeat.  In that respect, let me say that we have passed legislation in this House which restricts the quantum that a corporate entity can pay to a politician.  However, we can see from this report that individuals of those corporate entities are not limited to the same extent, and we need to look at that.  Throughout my public life, I have held a view that if one wants to be independent and be seen to be independent, then one should not accept political donations.  Any moneys raised should be raised from some kind of central system, either through the parties or centrally, for example, through SIPO.  People who contribute should say to whom they want the money donated.  A certain percentage would go to them and a percentage would go into a fund that would support the whole democratic process.  We just need to look at that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This report shone a light on these issues, but if we are to be objective about it, it also shone a light on the legal profession.  I have been a long-time critic of these tribunals.  Members of these Houses will have heard me in the last decade being highly critical of the length of time and the costs, which were absolutely unacceptable, as were the attempts made to keep those costs buttressed at levels that were never fair and never right.  I criticised the last Government about this issue, and the current Government has done nothing to arrest the profiteering within the legal profession.  It should not be allowed and within a properly structured democratic republic, steps should be taken in order that such privilege is set aside in future.</P>
        <P>I was not very long as a Member of this House in 8 October 1997 when, as one of my great regrets, I went on record to support the establishment of these tribunals.  The length and the cost of them was wrong.  We should have tackled the issues and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and SIPO should have the resources to get to terms with them in a timely way.  The tribunals were asked at that time to inquire urgently into matters of public importance.  It took 14 years in one case and 15 years in another case.  I used to drive home on a Thursday evening having left my office at 9.30 p.m., and I used to listen to Vincent Browne on the radio.  He would have a re-enactment of what took place in the tribunals that day.  It was highly entertaining but all it was doing was taking time and costing the taxpayer money.  Most of what I heard had nothing to do with the issues that should have been examined.  We need to recognise that, or else we will repeat the mistake of going the route of the tribunal in future.</P>
        <P>I am not alone in thinking this way.  I would urge people to read the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v. </i> Flood, when the Murphy family claimed their expenses because they had been disallowed by the tribunals.  Mr. Justice Hardiman was critical of the practices involved, and he was also critical of us and our propensity to establish tribunals, which he said did not compare with anywhere else in the world.  He said there was a total disregard for cost and for not getting to the truth.  He also implied clearly in the judgment that it infringed the due process to which every citizen is entitled.</P>
        <P>Most of us here would know many of the people who have been mentioned in the tribunals.  It looks to me as if the tribunal measured that if a person got a donation from any of these lobbyists at a time when there was not an election, it was a corrupt payment.  If the person got it during an election year, it was regarded as inappropriate.</P>
        <P>I would like to refer Members to page 3,132 in the appendices of the report, where two people are accused of making a statement to the chief witness, Mr. Gilmartin.  Neither of those people was called before the tribunal, either to validate of repudiate the statements made.  From talking to them, I know that neither accepts that the meeting ever took place.  Another person serving in the Government of the day was accused by Mr. Gilmartin in the tribunal one morning of a very corrupt offence.  He was absolutely appalled when he heard it.  He contacted his solicitor, who got a barrister to go down to the tribunal.  The tribunal refused him an audience until he insisted that he correct what Mr. Gilmartin said as being totally without foundation.  There is not a word about it in the report.  That raises some questions as to why that it is the case.  Would it have discredited the witness?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to finish by going back to Mr. Justice Hardiman&rsquo;s judgment in that Supreme Court case to which I referred.  He spoke about the separation of both the investigative and adjudicative process.  He stated that an investigator may become so invested in that one witness as to become blind or insensitive to things which raise doubt as to his credibility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to use this as a lesson to eradicate anybody from political life who is found guilty of taking bribes, which is a serious criminal offence.  Such people should be dealt with accordingly.  We also need to ensure that the light which was shone on the legal profession is also dealt with and that there is a system in place which will restrict the exorbitant costs and the extraction of moneys from the taxpayer.  We are spending millions of euro every year on this during difficult economic times.  People are paying taxes that they cannot afford which are being used to pay way beyond what is justified to barristers and others in the legal profession.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As I had called Senator Walsh out of sequence, I would like now to call on Senator Paul Coghlan, who was the missed speaker, and then we can resume with the normal rota.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank her for her commitment, observations and views on this report.  It is important we agree that we are dealing with this subject, given the seriousness of the report and the awful picture it painted.  It is a report of profound significance, which arose out of the serious public concern in respect of allegations of corruption in respect of the planning process, especially in the Dublin region.  One of the faults may have been the terms of reference, which were too wide initially. I do not know what Senator Walsh was doing about that.  His party was in the Government when it proposed those terms of reference.  They were agreed unanimously by both Houses of the Oireachtas at the time.  There is some anecdotal evidence that some of these practices were not simply confined to Dublin, but due to the planning tribunal&rsquo;s terms of reference, it did not get to investigate that.</P>
        <P>I accept that the vast majority of people who dealt with planning were above reproach.  The councillors of this country give of themselves unstintingly but unfortunately there were a few bad apples.  The tribunal of inquiry began in 1997 and had over 900 public sittings and called more than 400 witnesses, with many thousands of pages of evidence and correspondence.  It is important to say in response to Senator Walsh that it was frequently buffeted and challenged during the course of its work.</P>
        <P>The judges, Mr. Justice Fergus Flood and Mr. Justice Alan Mahon, who succeeded him as chairman, Ms Justice Mary Flaherty and Mr. Justice Gerald Keys, deserve great tribute.  They presided over many years of hearings and investigations and deserve our compliments for their comprehensive final report, which runs to more than 3,250 pages.  They pointed out that a module has been withheld, presumably with hundreds more pages.  I assume this relates to the Carrickmines module because matters involved in this are ongoing before the courts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sadly, the report finds corruption was both endemic and systemic in political life and affected every level of Government, from senior ministerial office holders to some local councillors and its existence, unfortunately, was widely known and believed to have been tolerated.  One of the most shameful aspects that occurred during the course of the tribunal&rsquo;s work were the attempts to undermine its independence, to express a lack of trust in it and by so doing attempt to frustrate the will of the Oireachtas.  The judges stated boldly in the report that they came under sustained and virulent attacks from senior members of the last Government at a critical stage of their investigation and that the legality of their inquiries, as well as their own integrity, was questioned.  This gave succour and support to the various court challenges to the tribunal that took place that greatly delayed it and held up its vital work</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government on receipt of the report and initial consideration of its findings rightly referred the report of the Garda Commissioner, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the Chairman of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The Garda Commissioner has already referred the report to the Criminal Assets Bureau for its urgent attention.</P>
        <P>In addition to its findings of fact, the report sets out a series of policy recommendations for consideration to help ensure similar situations do not arise again in future.  These 64 recommendations cover a wide area of matters, not just planning but also conflicts of interest, political finance, lobbying, bribery, corruption in office, money laundering, misuse of confidential information and asset recovery and confiscation.  We have the Minister speak on all of these matters.  Furthermore, the Cabinet decided all Ministers should be asked to consider as a matter of urgency the report&rsquo;s recommendations that fall within their respective remits and this is expected by the end of April.</P>
        <P>It is good to know some of the recommendations are already being addressed, such as reform of the tribunals of inquiry legislation and new legislative proposals in regard to political funding corruption, whistleblowers and the registration of lobbyists.  The Electoral Amendment (Political Donations) Bill is one such example.  This Bill will provide for greater transparency for donors and those in receipt of political donations.</P>
        <P>The ethical performance of elected members and officials in local authorities is a key consideration and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is examining the tribunal&rsquo;s recommendations closely to ensure whatever steps are necessary to restore and underpin confidence and transparency in the local government system are taken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Planning is an issue that pervades the tribunals work and analysis.  Thankfully planning has in recent times shifted from being developer-led to a more evidence-based and vertically integrated system.  It is good to hear the Minister of State make clear it is a policy priority of her Department that the planning system will continue to evolve into a more evidence-based regime in order that scope for incorrect zoning decisions is eliminated as far as possible.  We are all interested in the openness and transparency of the democratic process and the final Mahon report makes sound and sensible findings and recommendations of the most profound kind in this regard.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s confirmation that the report is being considered carefully and will be acted upon speedily and comprehensively.  We must ensure history does not repeat itself in any respect in what happened with regard to planning in the past.  This ongoing work will help restore public confidence in the political system, which is so important to the health of our democracy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin by reading a brief excerpt from the report of the tribunal because it highlights the cosy nature of the relationship between business and politics and the way politicians flouted and exhibited their influence.  It is on page 165 of the report of the tribunal in the chapter entitled &ldquo;The Leinster House Meeting&rdquo;.</P>
        <P LI="1">Mr. Gilmartin told the Tribunal that on a date in early February 1989, probably 1 February or possibly 2 February, he attended a meeting with a number of Government ministers and the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey in Leinster House.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Mr. Gilmartin said that some short time prior to this meeting, at the end of January 1989, he received a telephone call from Mr. Lawlor who informed him that &lsquo;<i>his boss</i>&rsquo; (a reference to the Taoiseach) wished to meet him.  Mr. Gilmartin wrote the following references into his notebook for Wednesday 1 February 1989: &lsquo;<i>5:30 meeting with Ministers. At D&aacute;il Eireann in (Leinster House)</i>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<i>Meet Mr. L. Lawlor at Buswells Hotel.</i>&rsquo;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Mr. Gilmartin said he arranged to meet Mr. Lawlor in Buswells Hotel on the day of the meeting.  Arriving some 20 minutes late, Mr. Lawlor beckoned to Mr. Gilmartin, whereupon Mr. Gilmartin followed Mr. Lawlor through the open gates of Leinster House, and into the D&aacute;il lobby.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Mr. Gilmartin said that he then accompanied Mr. Lawlor down a &lsquo;<i>long hallway&rsquo; </i>towards a lift where they encountered Mr. Ray Burke, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister for Communications.  Mr. Lawlor cursorily introduced Mr. Gilmartin to Mr. Burke who, while he acknowledged Mr. Gilmartin, did not speak to him.  Mr. Lawlor and Mr. Burke engaged in conversation in the lift.  Exiting the lift on an upper floor, Mr. Lawlor and Mr. Gilmartin turned right and travelled along a gangway past partitioned offices on either side towards a lobby area.  Mr. Gilmartin described being ushered by Mr. Lawlor into a room through dark oak double doors.  Mr. Lawlor remained outside as Mr. Gilmartin entered the room.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Mr. Gilmartin then proceeded to describe the actual meeting with a number of Government personnel.  He stated that in the room there was a large rectangular table and that Mr. P&aacute;draig Flynn, Minister for the Environment, sat at the top left hand corner of the table.  Beside Mr. Flynn was Mr. Albert Reynolds, Minister for Finance.  Beside Mr. Reynolds was a man whom Mr. Gilmartin believed might have been Mr. Gerard Collins, Minister for Justice.  Seated at the right hand side of the table were Mr. Bertie Ahern, Minister for Labour, Mr. Brian Lenihan, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mr. Seamus Brennan, Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Standing behind Mr. Brennan was a man whom Mr. Gilmartin did not recognise and to whom he was not introduced.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Mr. Gilmartin then described how Mr. Burke (whom he had met earlier in the lift with Mr. Lawlor) entered the room through a door located in the middle of the room, followed by the Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey.  Mr. Haughey proceeded to walk around the table to where Mr. Gilmartin stood and after Mr. Flynn&rsquo;s introduction Mr. Haughey&rsquo;s first words to Mr. Gilmartin were <i>&ldquo;I know you, you&rsquo;re Gilmartin from Lislary.&rdquo; </i> Mr. Haughey chatted to Mr. Gilmartin about his two schemes (Bachelor&rsquo;s Walk and Quarryvale) and complimented him for bringing such schemes to Ireland at a time when jobs were desperately needed.  Mr. Gilmartin was given assurances by Mr. Haughey that there would be no obstacles to his plans.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">In the course of the conversation, Mr. Gilmartin mentioned to Mr. Haughey that he knew Mr. Se&aacute;n Haughey (the senior official with Dublin County Council).  Mr. Haughey had taken this be a reference to his son, Mr. Se&aacute;n Haughey, rather than to his brother, and had proceeded to tell Mr. Gilmartin that his son was, or was about to become, Lord Mayor of Dublin, and encouraged Mr. Gilmartin to call to the Mansion House.  Mr. Haughey ended his conversation with Mr. Gilmartin by enquiring <i>&ldquo;if Liam was taking good care of me&rdquo;.</i></P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">To many people, this sounds like a scene from &ldquo;The Godfather&rdquo; or a similar film.  The potentially toxic way in which planning, politics and money colluded is clear from the way these men conducted themselves in the scene I have just outlined.  The tribunal&rsquo;s conclusions, and its criticism of the political elite in the State, are damning.  It stated that corruption in Irish political life was endemic and systemic.  It affected every level of Government, from some holders of top ministerial office to some local councillors and its existence was widely know and widely tolerated.  Corruption bred a culture of corruption; it was part of the way we were.  Corruption, backhanders and brown envelops became acceptable, a normal way of winning political favour, of rezoning land for profit and of buying votes and influence.  The golden circles of big business, speculators, bankers, financiers and developers, allied to a corrupt political elite, are not incidental to our current political and economic difficulties but are central to them.  It was in no one&rsquo;s interest to call a halt to the rapidly overheating housing market, other than those who ended up paying over the odds for their homes. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Political corruption is not a victimless crime.  It has caused widespread social damage.  The principal victims are Irish citizens, the people of this state.  They have seen the economy destroyed by the property bubble and the economic crash.  This is a direct result of the corrupt relationship between developers and politicians.  In addition, working class communities, especially those in west Dublin, have been affected by the poor planning at the heart of this and are still living with its consequences.  Corrupt planning allowed Dublin city to expand in an appallingly ill-planned way as property speculators and developers made big money.  Whole communities were moved into badly built housing estates with few facilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report has indicated clearly that there was a culture of political corruption in the 1980s and 1990s within the major establishment parties, but principally within Fianna F&aacute;il.  Fianna F&aacute;il is attempting to wipe out its corrupt past.  A former Taoiseach and a former senior Minister have jumped, disgraced, before they could be pushed.  They would like us to believe that is all in the past and that this is a new era for Fianna F&aacute;il.  However, there are Members of these Houses who have questions to answer.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, who was a senior member of Mr. Bertie Ahern&rsquo;s Cabinet, and several of his D&aacute;il colleagues have questions to answer regarding their actions at the time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report of the Mahon tribunal states that during 2007 and 2008, members of the Cabinet embarked on a sustained and virulent attack on the tribunal.  They questioned not only the legality of the tribunal but the integrity of its members.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and others need to clarify their parts in these events.  All that is required for evil to flourish is for good men to do nothing.  Did members of the Cabinet look the other way and were they complicit in this orchestrated campaign against the tribunal?  If the citizens of this state are to regain their confidence in the political system and justify the major cost of the tribunal, which was alluded to by a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator, the Government must implement Judge Mahon&rsquo;s recommendations. This is essential to combat corruption and ensure the planning process becomes more transparent and accessible and citizens are never again victims of the corruption that was endemic in the political establishment. </P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank her for her efforts with regard to the tribunal report.</P>
        <P>I welcome the debate on and the findings of the Mahon tribunal.  The last two decades of planning have shaken people&rsquo;s faith in politics to such a level that it will take a great deal of time to restore it.  People&rsquo;s faith in politics and in the body politic, rather than any person, ideology or party, has been damaged hugely by the findings of the Mahon tribunal.  I welcome the fact we have reached the end of the process.  I am glad the findings have come to light and we can begin to act on them and rebuild faith in politics in Ireland.</P>
        <P>One aspect of the report that alarms me, as it seems to everyone else, is its cost.  This warrants debate.  Efforts are being made to remedy the cost situation, even retrospectively.  I have a sincere belief we can achieve the same outcomes without dedicating the same level of resources.  That could have been looked at more closely.  The academic, Ms Elaine Byrne has stated, rightly, that tribunals cost &euro;500 million but raised &euro;1 billion, if one goes back as far as the McCracken tribunal.  This is true.  However, it must be kept in mind that tribunals prior to the Mahon tribunal cost &euro;200 million and raised &euro;1 billion.  The Mahon tribunal cost the people of Ireland &euro;300 million and was a serious drain on resources.  That other tribunals raised revenue is a distraction and is not entirely relevant.  The Mahon tribunal was the most expensive in our history.</P>
        <P>We need to look at a pragmatic step to curb tribunal costs in the future while maintaining the quality of their reports.  Keeping terms of reference relatively narrow, which other Senators have alluded to, would be one remedy.  Harsher punishments, financial or even otherwise, for those found to have misled or delayed the tribunal deliberately should be a minimum.  On the conclusion of the Mahon tribunal we heard repeatedly that certain individuals had gone out of their way deliberately to obfuscate and confuse the issues.  One prominent journalist wrote that at one stage they were rolling in the aisles listening to it.  Sometimes the untruths were obvious and the attempts to derail the process cost both time and money.  We need to work out a system of disincentives to curb such behaviour in future.</P>
        <P>I represented a client who was called before the Mahon tribunal, although he had no good reason to be called, which was ultimately proved.  This was at a cost of tens of thousands of euro, which were wasted.  There were numerous examples of such waste during the lifetime of the tribunal, which is very regrettable.  I read a report this morning that cuts of up to 87% have been imposed on the legal fees sought by witnesses to the planning tribunal.  I welcome this, although I doubt we will be successful in achieving that level of cuts.  This is one way to begin cutting costs.  We need to look at how we audit these costs in future, how we decide on a cost to benefit ratio and how we punish those who deliberately run up the cost of tribunals, or any such inquiries.  These costs are borne, ultimately, by the taxpayer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Mahon tribunal report and its findings but I do not welcome the price tag that came with it.  This price helped us adduce information many already had.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Once the Mahon tribunal report was published, it was inevitable the Houses would have an opportunity to debate it.  These debates in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad have not been a happy experience for members of Fianna F&aacute;il, especially those of us who were not aware of the decisions being taken or the corrupt practices being engaged in at a high level within the party.  That is not to deflect attention or responsibility.  The current leader of the party, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, moved quickly to place clear water between himself and those found guilty of corrupt practices by the tribunal.  The steps he took were unanimously approved by the wider Fianna F&aacute;il membership.</P>
        <P>There has been a suggestion in some of the contributions to this debate that Fianna F&aacute;il was not proactive and some of the people named in the report jumped before they were pushed, which is one expression that was used.  As a member of the ard chomhairle of Fianna F&aacute;il, I can inform the House that if those people had not jumped the decision of the ard chomhairle, consisting of more than 90 members and representing all aspects of the organisation nationwide, would have taken those decisions.   The fact that, once the party indicated it would expel them, the people named decided to resign should not, and I hope will not, detract from the very firm conviction of those of us in Fianna F&aacute;il today that if the proposal to expel them had gone before the ard chomhairle, it would have been carried unanimously.</P>
        <P>The period under discussion is the early 1990s.  Even the tribunal itself conceded a significant amount of legislation has been passed since to ensure the activities investigated and outlined by the tribunal will not be repeated, in so far as it is possible to legislate against corruption.  It is interesting to quote the tribunal report in this regard:</P>
        <P LI="1">Corruption is universally condemned, and for good reasons.  It undermines the equality of individuals before the law, produces unfairness in public policies and distorts the allocation of resources . . . It . . . [also] instills in [the public] the belief that the political system is there to serve vested interests rather than those of the public which it is supposed to serve.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Fianna F&aacute;il accepted the tribunal&rsquo;s recommendations immediately and without equivocation.  In making its recommendations it stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Tribunal has taken into consideration the very significant developments which have taken place in these areas since the period which formed the focus of its inquiries . . . since 1994 a number of other laws have been adopted . . . anti-corruption measures must have a dual purpose.  First, to control the abuse of public power for private gain and secondly, to promote public confidence in the fact that public power is being exercised in the public interest . . . While traditionally corruption has been viewed as an issue of individual morality, in recent years, advances in understanding both its causes and its consequences mean that it is now also viewed as a problem of systemic failure.  In other words, where an individual behaves corruptly, then the problem lies as much with the system which permitted or failed to prevent that behavior as with that individual.  Specifically, corruption is most likely to occur where there is a combination of low ethical standards, incentive and opportunity.  There will always be individuals tempted to use public power for their own personal profit and the task therefore is to devise a system which substantially reduces both the opportunity and, if possible, the incentives for doing do.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have said repeatedly both inside and outside the House that it is a fact of life that corruption, irrespective of the laws passed to address it, is very much a human failing.  On a purely practical basis, wherever corruption has proved to be endemic in a political system, it invariably arises as a result of power being held by those who are corrupted.  At its simplest, I have always subscribed to the view that money follows power.  Irrespective of what one might think of Fianna F&aacute;il, the public voted for it, which is what democracy is about.  The fact that there were successive Fianna F&aacute;il Administrations for such a long period of time created what the tribunal refers to as the environment that permitted those who were so inclined to be corrupt.  I hold no brief for those found to be corrupt or named by the tribunal.  While in no way trying to deflect or minimise the veniality of those who led Fianna F&aacute;il during that period, those involved in development who were bribing politicians and making corrupt payments to politicians did so across the political spectrum wherever they believed they could get a return for money.  While there is no problem with lobbying, it was enhanced by the payment of money and it was human failure on the part of those involved or who thought they would get away with it because of the environment in which they were operating that nothing would ever be asked.</P>
        <P>I have in my hand a document which runs to nine pages from one of the development companies named in the report &mdash; it is involved in a significant number of modules.  Every political party received money.  Not only was it paid to individual councillors and Deputies of all parties, but all political parties as entities were offered and accepted money.  I only make this point to emphasise that corruption was widespread at the time and those who were offering the money were the most corrupt of all because they knew they were playing on human frailty.  They knew that if they paid enough money, the chances were that they would get what they wanted and, in many cases, they did to the detriment of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I have said so repeatedly.  Human frailty was as much a factor as those who believed they could get away with it.  They accepted the money.  I am only making the point that because of the environment in which developers were operating, they gave money to everybody.  They were sloshing money around like snuff at a wake and it was being accepted across the board.  At the time and subsequently several politicians and parties claimed that in the environment of the time they had accepted them as they believed they were genuine, legitimate political payments.</P>
        <P>This leads us to the recommendations the tribunal has made.  With my party, I wholeheartedly support its recommendations and hope the Government will start to enact them in so far as it is possible to do so because there are constitutional requirements to be met in some instances.  The only way we can prevent it from happening again on the scale at which it happened &mdash; even the tribunal has stated it will never be possible to stamp out corruption entirely &mdash; is by passing the laws required under the recommendations.  Fianna F&aacute;il unequivocally and unambiguously accepts the recommendations of the tribunal and totally condemns those who have been found to have received corrupt payments.  They have brought shame not just on the country but also on the party.</P>

	<P Just="Left">What type of country would we now have if the tribunal had not been established?  At what stage would Fianna F&aacute;il have stated it was wrong?  Would it have been in 1997, 2007, 2012 or 2013?  It took this report to get it to admit that it and many of its councillors had been responsible for much of this.  This has been ongoing since I was a child when Charles Haughey was parading around the country encouraging people to follow him and become rich.  They followed him and became rich at the expense of ordinary people who today are living in properties that are falling apart, including in Priory Hall.  I could name properties in County Donegal in cases where a local voluntary housing association paid big money for housing units only two years old with dampness rising through them.  The rules in place were not followed.</P>
        <P>The country was reaching a stage similar to what happened in <i>Lord of the Flies</i>, whereby things broke down.  This showed in the planning system which operated on the basis of a nod and a wink.  I have been a member of Letterkenny Town Council and Donegal County Council.  Anytime I objected to or raised concerns about buildings clearly being built in the wrong places for the wrong reasons, the response I received from the local radio station, local newspapers and mainly Fianna F&aacute;il councillors was that I was standing in the way of progress.  They claimed they were creating jobs.  However, everyone, including the planners, could see they were creating ghost estates and communities with no infrastructure.  Those decisions are coming back to haunt us.  People living in these estates are complaining that they were promised services, including schools.  The whole system was corrupt such that not only was money changing hands but power was also changing hands from councillor to councillor.  It was a nod and a wink culture.  I have to put up my hand and say that in Donegal the planners were generally 100%, but there were certain councillors who seemed to have more influence than others.  That was also true in Letterkenny and Border towns such as Raphoe, Lifford and Carrigans which probably trebled in size in three or four years.  The houses are now being sold for &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000.  Everyone knew for 30 or 40 years what was happening.  Only the Mahon tribunal and those who instigated it brought the matter to light; otherwise things would be much the same today.</P>
        <P>The economic crisis can be traced back directly to corruption in planning.  The banking crisis is directly linked with property and the problems here have not been experienced in other countries to the same extent.  People in England, Scotland, Wales, Germany and France do not talk about knowing somebody who owns six, seven or eight houses.  This was the Haughey philosophy, that if one followed him and Fianna F&aacute;il one would become rich.</P>
        <P>Everybody is paying for the consequences of these activities.  There are people who cannot afford to pay the &euro;100 household charge living in properties that were built for the wrong reasons, in the wrong areas and without the necessary infrastructure.  We have been left to pick up the pieces in the wake of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s failure of governance.  I acknowledge Senator Paschal Mooney&rsquo;s honesty in this regard.  He and certain other members of his party have come out with their hands up, but the horse has already bolted.  The corruption in high places permeated right down to local government level.  I saw it happening in Donegal and we all know it was happening in Dublin and in every local authority in the country.  At what stage would Fianna F&aacute;il have said this was wrong if members of the party had not been caught with their fingers in the till?  All we can do now is hope that the culture of nod and wink politics is finally over.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recent report from An Taisce which identifies Donegal County Council as the local authority with the worst planning record in the State seems fairly accurate although not, I contend, 100% so.  One of the factors in Donegal&rsquo;s poor showing is the large number of vacant properties in the county, which was taken as a measure of poor planning.  However, one must take into account the high demand for holiday homes in the past decade, a great deal of which are now vacant.  If that cohort of properties were removed, the figures might not be quite so bad.  Having said that, planning practices in the county were undoubtedly poor, with certain areas being peppered with new builds without any view to the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Future generations will surely look back and reflect that the country was destroyed by bad planning and bad connections, by a corruption which emanated from the top and ultimately cost the people dearly in jobs and money.  It is an issue of which I have direct experience as a councillor.  Local authority members throughout the State were aware that certain parties, individuals and councils had an interest in planning matters.  Some of that corrupt interest was not for the purpose of procuring money but for power and political gain.  That is the sad reality.  I hope the report of the Mahon tribunal will ensure that corruption is eradicated for future generations.  I welcome its recommendations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P>One might say that I speak as both an insider and outsider in terms of the political process.  Like my colleague, Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, I am an Independent Member and not associated with any political party.   I have come in middle age to this part of my career with an outsider&rsquo;s perspective, which is the position from which I will make certain observations.  The reality is that there is a perception, whether correct or not, that the practice of politics in this country is and has been for a long time somewhat corrupt, which is why the outbreak of rectitude and umbrage we are seeing in the wake of the various tribunal reports is being greeted somewhat sceptically by many of our fellow citizens.  Most people would acknowledge that individual politicians are, with clear exceptions, not corrupt.  However, there is a tolerance within the system of the notion of corruption.  I have landed myself in trouble with certain party loyalists from different organisations for making this point.  The response is always that they themselves are not corrupt and would never tolerate corruption and to question how I should dare to accuse them and the many hundreds of thousands of people who voted for them of being tolerant of corruption.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reality, of course, is that this tolerance is buried deep in our political culture.  There is a Sicilian expression, <i>mafiosit&aacute;</i>, which refers to those who, although not associated with the Mafia, understand its place in Sicilian society and have a certain grudging acceptance of the role it plays in oiling the wheels of that society.  We had our own version of <i>mafiosit&aacute;</i> in this country.  For many years, individuals who were themselves beyond reproach in terms of their personal conduct and financial probity made a relative value system judgment that a certain amount of corruption on the part of politicians was acceptable because they had a higher loyalty &mdash; whether to party, to Civil War values or to their idea of what constituted patriotism or order &mdash; or a distaste for the other major party, which led them to the view that although so and so might be somewhat corrupt, he is still &ldquo;our guy&rdquo; and, on balance, he has it right.  As a medical student and young doctor, I often heard this said about a certain politician who shall remain nameless.  As it was famously said, the dogs in the street knew this person&rsquo;s conduct of his private financial affairs was not beyond reproach, yet he remained untouched for many years.  One frequently encountered the attitude that he was certainly a crook but then a crook was just what we needed.  That was a view one commonly encountered in the 1970s, 1980s and through to the 1990s.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Why did this tolerance persist for so long in this country?  Although Fianna F&aacute;il is taking the bulk of the criticism in this regard, I do not accept that the average member of that party is any more or less intrinsically ethical or moral than the average member of Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  The mere fact that Fianna F&aacute;il, because of an unusual demographic factor that arose in the aftermath of the second election following the Civil War, had a near permanent slight plurality of support meant that, on average, its members were in power more often than not.  Lord Acton was absolutely correct in observing that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Therein likes the bulk of the explanation for why the type of behaviour we are discussing took place more often on Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s watch than on anybody else&rsquo;s.  I suspect that if another party had been in power for 11 out of every 15 years, or whatever the arithmetic is, there would be a certain number of bleached bones lying in the political desert, the bones of those who had to step down as a result of various scandals.  That is the very nature of being in power unchallenged for too long.  Having said that, there are other factors to consider.  For example, there is little to choose in terms of fundamental values and policies between the two major parties historically.  That, together with a Whip system and a heavily incentivised parochialism in the way we select our politicians, meant it was easy to think of reasons to turn a blind eye to a certain level of corruption.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where have all of these revelations left us?  In a practical sense we have spent some &euro;300 million on the Mahon tribunal and God knows how much on the other tribunals.  When I first returned to Ireland the major scandal was the &euro;30 million cost of the beef tribunal.  At the time I was seeking approval for a drug called Taxol for ovarian and breast cancer patients but met with serious reservations from Government on the grounds of cost.  I made the point at the time, in those naive days, that the total bill for the beef tribunal would have met the cost of supplying the drug to every patient who needed it for five years.  I was contacted by the producers of &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; today, which has had a succession of patients calling in to say they cannot obtain a particular drug for the treatment of malignant melanoma.  This is a drug the cost of which to the Exchequer could probably be halved simply by way of a proper bulk purchasing strategy by the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health.  It could be made available to every patient who needs it at a total cost of &euro;5 million.  However, we apparently cannot find &euro;5 million for patients suffering a cancer which without treatment is invariably fatal, but we can spend &euro;300 million on a tribunal.  What does that tell us about the way we do public life in this country?</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I said, I am speaking as something of an outsider in making my observations.  I am sure some Members are wondering who the hell is this guy &mdash; I am not sure whether I am permitted to use that word in the Chamber &mdash; to say what I am about to say.  It looks to me and many of those looking at it from the outside that the tribunals were set up primarily to fail.  Consider the whole process in terms of how they were gunged up for so long, how it was possible for people to give evidence that was economical with the truth, how there have been so few prosecutions and how they gobbled up so much money.  One wonders whether we should have a dedicated police unit that investigates suspected crime.  Should we not have a prosecution service that is politically independent and which, when there is evidence staring it in the face that something is wrong, can go ahead and investigate it?  Must we instead have this great panacea whereby we cannot comment on, discuss or legislate in response to certain matters because they are before a tribunal which may not produce any findings for 13 years and will cost hundreds of millions of euro?  An independent detective unit within the Garda could have dealt with some of these issues straightaway.  A district attorney model might have taken up the cudgel of investigating and potentially prosecuting people a decade ago, with consequent vast savings for the Exchequer and benefits for the credibility of the political system.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that the system has finally brought forth an outcome.  The value of the result it produces, when set against the opportunity cost of the money that is gone and the reputational damage to Irish democracy, is probably questionable.  I hope people will examine the report carefully and take on board the larger lessons rather than indulging in cross-aisle finger pointing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that all parties have accepted the findings of the Mahon tribunal.  I genuinely feel sorry for the thousands of people involved in the major political parties who have dedicated their lives to politics and who were let down by a small group of corrupt politicians.  The latter effectively destroyed the reputation of politics.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I agree in principle with much of what Senator Crown stated.  Had actions such as those he suggests been taken a long time ago, we would probably be in a very different position.  However, I contend that we were right to spend &euro;300 million to ensure that our descendants will read the correct version of Irish history and not an incorrect one.  If the Mahon tribunal has done one good thing it has been to ensure that the history books will be written correctly and that the record will be kept straight.  Until people are put behind bars, however, the members of the current generation who have been so badly let down by those in whom they placed their trust will remain of the view that the Mahon tribunal has not served its purpose.  I call on the Garda Commissioner and those around him to ensure that all resources will be made available to those carrying out the investigation into this matter in order that criminal prosecutions will be brought, as a matter of urgency, against the people who were named and shamed by the Mahon tribunal.  Justice must be seen to take its course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was much which the Mahon tribunal could have investigated had it had the necessary remit.  The entire west coast has been completely destroyed by property development of the most outrageous kind.  There have been all sorts of rumour and speculation about the county in which I live, Clare, but none of this can be proved because no one is in possession of the facts.  Some of the developments that have taken place in seaside resorts in County Clare are both disgraceful and appalling.  Tax designation schemes, which went against everything that is right and which favoured the rich, were used to facilitate developments that should never have proceeded.  The planning process facilitated the type of development which has absolutely destroyed our coast.  We have a most wonderful landscape in this country but, unfortunately, it has been polluted by bad, poor quality development that took place in the 1990s and the early to mid-2000s and which should never have been allowed to proceed.</P>
        <P>I am sure that one would be obliged to question the integrity of those who made a number of key decisions in respect of the type of developments to which I refer.  I do not just refer to politicians in this regard; I am also talking about planners and other officials.  There was so much money flying around during the period in question that it was possible to almost buy anything.  We are in a recession at present but perhaps that is what is required to bring back some dignity to this country.  During a recession, money cannot buy one everything that one wants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What happened in this country in the recent past was appalling.  I contend that the Mahon tribunal report is merely one chapter of the book which could be written.  Unfortunately, we possess neither the resources nor the capability to carry out the type of forensic investigation required and which I would like to see happen into the events which occurred in the recent past.  I am a realist and I acknowledge that such an investigation is just not practical.  I recall many people, including one famous politician, stating that we need to draw a line in the sand.  I regret that at this stage we do probably need to try to move on.  The planning legislation that has been enacted has improved the situation to a significant degree.  Had many of the checks and balances that are now in place been there before, it is probable that we would not be in the kind of mess in which we now find ourselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must do everything possible, including introducing new legislation, to ensure that adequate prison sentences will be handed down.  As legislators, we must do whatever is necessary in order to ensure that there will never be a recurrence of the events that are the subject of the Mahon tribunal report.  People need to go to prison for their part in those events.  Until this happens, the people will be of the view that the Mahon tribunal has not served its purpose, namely, to put those who are corrupt behind bars.  I would like the House to revisit this matter six or 12 months from now.  I hope some action may have been taken by that time.  Action is what people want.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Politics in this country must undergo a fundamental change.  I do not believe in skirting around the edges or engaging in a bit of window dressing.  Clientelism, both large and small in nature, has become a major factor in politics and this must change.  Such a change would probably require an alteration to the electoral system.  I do not have the answers in this regard but I am confident that the constitutional convention which has been established will commence the debate that is required in respect of the matter to which I refer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My final point relates to the media.  Media organisations must work with us.  We all, including those in the media, have a responsibility to do the right thing.  When major decisions relating to the future of this country are being made, the media needs to work with those elected to represent the citizens of this country.</P>
        <P>I could speak for a long time on this issue because I feel so strongly about it.  The Seanad has a key role to play in facilitating and fostering debates of this nature, particularly as they relate to the future of our country.  I see the Mahon tribunal report as a starting point for reform in Ireland.  Reform can only happen through action and there is no doubt that action is required.  In that context, people must be placed behind bars and the political system in this country must be changed utterly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House for this debate and wish her well in her role.  This debate brings back to me the difficult time my party, its members and I experienced in the aftermath of the publication of the Mahon tribunal report.  The period in question was very upsetting for us, particularly as people in whom we had placed our faith and whose evidence we had waited to be adjudicated upon were found extremely wanting by a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
        <P>It is worth considering the findings of the tribunal and engaging in the type of political commentary and criticism to which they have already been subjected.  That is certainly the entitlement of Members on all sides.  However, all parties must look to their own records and their own dealings with this and other tribunals.  A number of media commentators, particularly in the context of the Moriarty tribunal, have questioned the value of tribunal findings.  Those in the media need to question their own actions and opinions.  A tremendous amount of forensic investigation was done in the context of following a particular money trail relating to a number of individuals and a huge amount of evidence was gathered.  I recently saw some documents which provide details of the donations made by one particular company during the 1990s.  It would appear that there was something for everybody in the audience, including elected Members, all parties, constituency organisations, etc.  All of this is documented in the tribunal&rsquo;s findings.  The donations to which I refer were not found to be corrupt, although some of them may perhaps have been.  In the context of this debate, we must look to ourselves and our parties.  We must also look to the future in order to identify what we can change.</P>
        <P>The tribunal was established by Fianna F&aacute;il in 1997.  I accept that it was necessarily established and that there was no great act of bravery involved in its being set up.  The tribunal had to be established in light of the serious allegations that were floating about at that point.  Who would have thought it would have ended almost 15 years later with significant costs?  It is relevant to talk about the costs but not in the context of trying to undermine the tribunal and the findings it made.  There is a debate to be had not just on tribunal costs but legal costs in general.  I heard one commentator pointing out the State is the largest procurer of legal services and effectively sets the price.  That is what happened in the tribunal.  We set the price and, in fact, the price filtered down to the rest of the legal services.  This must be addressed because the costs are not worth it and could have been done much cheaper.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My party had some devastating findings made against some of its members.  These were acted upon within 24 hours.  We fully accept the findings of the tribunal.  We have to because we set it up.  There is much talk about the tribunal not having any legal effect and just being a judge&rsquo;s opinion.  The findings of fact, however, are there and were made by learned judges.  They must be accepted by Members of the Oireachtas.  As I said, they should also be accepted by media commentators.  Over the past few days, several of them have come out of the woodwork, employed by certain individuals, to state the findings are just judges&rsquo; opinions.  That is not correct and it does not bode well for law and order if judges&rsquo; findings are not accepted in whatever forum they are made.</P>
        <P>We must look to the future too and how the planning system can be changed.  The single most significant measure contained in the report was the establishment of a planning regulator.  Significant progress was made by the previous Administration with the planning and development legislation which corrals councils into a certain course of action decided at national level, a good development.</P>
        <P>The tribunal did not agree that planning regulation should be carried out by a Minister.  The fact that the ultimate decision and power is moved away from councillors to an independent person who should not be subject to lobbying or corruption is a positive step forward, one which I support.  It is important the planning regulator will do a better job than other regulators have done who have become captured by the very utilities they are supposed to regulate.  Regulators always seem to go with the companies they are regulating.  I would hate to see that happening with a planning regulator.  Any planning regulator should have a short term of office and be replaced every two years to ensure he or she does not fall into the same trap the financial regulator did, where there was a game of golf with the banks every so often.  Who is to say that could not happen again?  The only answer to that is to have short terms of office for a planning regulator.</P>
        <P>The tribunal judges saw much of what went wrong with planning.  There was much crime which has been and is being dealt with by the courts.  The judges recommended breaches of ethics should be a criminal offence.  They recommended an increased role for the Standards in Public Office Commission and that politicians should be restricted from land deals for two years after leaving office, as well as providing audited accounts.  Much of these measures are already in the proposed legislation on corruption and are to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The disclosure requirements should be updated.  Annual disclosure is not enough.  If a politician comes into assets or property, he or she should be subject to a short disclosure period subsequently.  We should have to declare any loans we have.  The public interest requires we declare our assets but also our mortgages.  In this tribunal and in other reports, it came to light there was a certain amount of insider dealing in obtaining mortgages involving the political system as well as media figures and other people of influence.  They were all able to get loans on an easy basis from certain financial institutions which partly contributed to our economic collapse.  For politicians to be above reproach, we should have to declare our mortgages too.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the proposed legislation arising from the tribunal&rsquo;s recommendations.  Since the tribunal was established, Fianna F&aacute;il introduced many measures in planning legislation.  They have not all worked, however.  While it is important to have a centralised system for setting out guidelines, some of the national guidelines have not worked.  The retail planning guidelines were a disaster.  Shopping centres were built in areas which are now empty.  It was not councillors but An Bord Plean&aacute;la which sited these shopping centres after objections by residents.  That was a failure of national guidelines on which, presumably, An Bord Plean&aacute;la was acting.</P>
        <P>I have also heard that regional guidelines are defective.  I often say I do not want to get involved in this area as it is not my concern.  If politicians move away from highlighting flawed guidelines, we could have some of the mistakes of the past made again.  There will have to be a role for politicians in some way to advocate on behalf of their communities and the broad general interest.</P>
        <P>This report, as well as the Moriarty tribunal report, is with the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda.  Nothing has happened with the Moriarty findings.  Who is to say nothing will happen with the Mahon report?  I suppose certain things have happened with some people serving time in jail and other cases before the courts.  However, I am not sure the type of retribution and justice required by the public will happen.  This would be a shame after so many years and so much money spent.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, to the House.  This has been a long debate on the findings of the Mahon tribunal.  I want to acknowledge Senator Mooney&rsquo;s apology, on behalf of his party, for what some of his party members did.  I fully respect the fact there are many thousands within the Fianna F&aacute;il Party who had no hand, act or part in what went on in the matters that led to the Mahon tribunal.</P>
        <P>There is a term, however, that can only be used in Ireland, the &ldquo;likeable rogue&rdquo;.  It is a contradictory term but was the one used in my constituency, Tipperary South, by many local authority officials to describe several politicians in my time as a local councillor for over 25 years.  It meant many things to be a likeable rogue.  Ultimately, however, it meant that one was a rogue.  Rogues found ways of circumventing the laws of the land.  What disturbs me about the Mahon tribunal is that it concentrated only on Dublin.  The Minister of State, who was a member of a local authority herself, and every other Member who was on a local authority knows there could be a Mahon tribunal for every council.  What was investigated in Dublin went on up and down the country.  I saw it with my own eyes for 25 years.  It was brought to an art form with the language and methodologies used, as well as the people involved, who constituted a clique.  They succeeded and some of it will never be unearthed because the trails were well covered.  People like my colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, the Minister for Social Protection, were talking about this 20 years ago but were ignored.  I spoke about it in my constituency and was told I was anti-development and anti-progress.  Some of what happened has come out through Mahon but it will never all come out.</P>
        <P>Having praised Senator Mooney, I have to take issue with his claim that money was sloshing around and given to everybody.  It was not given to people in my party because we did not accept it.  The one party member who did was thrown out of the party within ten days of doing so.  That is on the record of the Mahon tribunal.  Trying to paint everyone with the one brush and suggesting that everyone was at it at the one time is an unfair analysis of what happened.</P><P Just="Left">How satisfied is the Minister that what has been unearthed will not lead to further tribunals? If one remembers how all this started, it was when one individual was vexed by the comments of an arrogant politician. That can happen any day, in any place from now to eternity. How are we ever going to get to the bottom of this? Are we only just scratching at the surface? </P><P Just="Left">Much play has been made regarding the provision of a regulator to deal with planning issues. I respectfully suggest that people who are elected, whether to a local council, the Seanad or D&aacute;il, should be willing to serve for the betterment of their community and not their own pocket or those of party colleagues. They should not be elected to be in a clique. That is from where this issue stems, and there will never be a system that can ensure people are elected for the right reasons. </P><P Just="Left">I support Senator Conway, who spoke about the need to see proper penalties. We have seen people proven guilty of corruption but we have yet to hear mention of someone being jailed. There are places across Europe where senior politicians were found to be corrupt, and those politicians, especially in Germany, for example, served time behind bars. That was a message to the public and those who believe in democracy and how it should operate. If the trust of the people is breached, not alone will a person not be re-elected, he or she will also face the rigours of the law. Until we bring that into legislation, we will not even begin to solve the problem. </P><P Just="Left">The 2001 planning Bill was fine legislation but there were ten amendments to it within 24 months, most of them formulated in the Galway tent, which ensured the onus on completing housing estates was handed back to local authorities rather than builders. In simple terms, some pipes did not require to be covered by a metre of earth because that would need shuttering and more money to be paid out by builders in constructing houses. Instead, they only had to be covered by 18 in. of earth. That cost hundreds of millions of euro following the big freeze during 2010 and 2011. It came about because somebody suggested that a section of the legislation should be amended to ensure money could be saved in the building of houses. That was formulated by people in the clique. </P><P Just="Left">I could go on but we must face the truth of what happened. I look forward to the Minister bringing legislation to this House to deal with these issues. The strong arm of the law should be implemented to ensure those in breach are dealt with meaningfully. That will send a message that we have a real democracy and people will pay if they try to corrupt it. We will never have a democracy worth talking about if that does not happen. I thank the Minister of State for attending and I look forward to her returning to the House soon with legislation dealing with these issues. </P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased we have the time to consider this momentous report in detail because it has major significance not only for our planning system but also for our political system.  The report has made adverse findings against elected representatives at all levels of elected office, from county councillor to Taoiseach.  I express my appreciation to the members of the tribunal &mdash; Judges Mahon, Faherty and Keys and, previously, Mr. Justice Feargus Flood &mdash; for the work they have done and the reports they have produced.  Their work is all the more remarkable given the obstruction and attacks to which the tribunal was subjected over the course of its hearings and investigations.</P>
        <P>The report is very wide-ranging and makes findings of corruption against a number of named individuals.  The essential point of the report is the need for everyone in public life not just to talk about high standards but also to be willing to behave and act on them no matter the personal inconvenience.  The Government is committed to responding promptly and effectively to the findings and recommendations of the report.  Since publication, the Government has responded with authority to those findings and recommendations.  As has been stated, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has sent the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda Commissioner, the Revenue Commissioners and the Standards in Public Office Commission for consideration and appropriate investigative steps.  I understand the Garda Commissioner has referred the report to the Criminal Assets Bureau and asked the head of the bureau to lead the Garda examination of the report and follow-up action.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, has instituted civil forfeiture proceedings relating to matters investigated by the Mahon tribunal in the past 15 years and the report notes that the Comptroller and Auditor General estimated in 2008 that the CAB and the Revenue Commissioners have recovered in excess of &euro;51 million.  It will be a matter for these organs of State to decide what action, if any, to take on foot of the final report.</P>
        <P>In addition to its findings, which are well known at this stage, the report makes a total of 64 recommendations on planning, conflicts of interest, political finance, lobbying, bribery, corruption in office, money laundering, the misuse of confidential information, asset recovery and confiscation, as well as other miscellaneous matters.  The Government has decided that all relevant Ministers should consider its recommendations and revert to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the co-ordinating Department, by the end of April with proposed actions.  That is with a view to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, reporting to the Government for a collective response to the tribunal recommendations as early as possible in May.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The intention to bring this matter to the Government again within a number of weeks will ensure we produce a whole-of-government response to the tribunal&rsquo;s recommendations, with a comprehensive and in-depth response to each of the tribunal&rsquo;s findings.  Some of these recommendations are in the course of implementation through reforms of the tribunal of inquiry legislation and the new legislative proposals relating to political funding, corruption, whistleblowers and registration of lobbyists.  These legislative reforms have been brought forward by this Government in the first 12 months of office.  With all that has been invested in the tribunal to date, it is crucial the report is considered carefully and acted on speedily and comprehensively in order that we can help restore public confidence in the political system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s comprehensive commitment to breaking the link between big money and politics is evidenced by the introduction of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011.  This legislation sustainably reforms political funding in Ireland and, as such, has endeavoured to implement the recommendations made in the Moriarty tribunal report.  The trust and confidence of citizens in the political system has been badly damaged by the revelations of this report.  The evidence in the report of the many individuals who did everything they could to expose corruption and who are commended by the tribunal therefore should also be conveyed to the public.</P>
        <P>The Government faces many challenges relating to the economy and our system of government.  The Government is committed to ending the legacy of corruption detailed in this report, as outlined by several Senators during this debate.  The Government has taken the necessary steps to ensure that what has been shown in the report can never happen again, and we must all strive to that end, no matter what side of the House we are on.  The actions outlined in the report can never happen again and people must be brought to justice.  That process will take its course, with people being jailed if found guilty by the courts.  The law must take its course.  Like other Senators, I am hopeful those named in this report as being found corrupt will receive the treatment they deserve, namely, being brought to justice and jailed if found guilty by the courts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryBrennan"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire Stait go dt&iacute; an Seanad.  We have had a good debate which, to be fair, has been embarrassing for many of us.  I agree with previous speakers that the costs of the Mahon tribunal, at &euro;300 million, were astronomical.  It was a bonanza for a great part of the legal profession and the time it took to complete its deliberations &mdash; 15 years &mdash; was extraordinary.</P>
        <P>I would like to refer to an instance of corruption in the United States involving the former governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich.  Barack Obama was a state senator in Illinois at the time and when he left office, the governor had sole responsibility for appointing.  Mr. Blagojevich was lobbied by the hierarchy in the state on behalf of particular individuals to succeed Mr. Obama.  He indicated that it was a responsible position and that financial reward would be required.  He was subsequently captured on tape stating what were his requirements.  His demands to make the appointment were a substantial salary for himself, his wife to be placed on various corporate boards through which it was estimated she would earn $150,000 annually, promises of campaign funds up-front in cash and a cabinet post or ambassadorship to Serbia.  He had to pay the price for corruption.  He was tried on corruption charges and sentenced to 14 years in jail last December.  President Obama has not completed his first term.  It did not take the US 15 years to make a decision on what was wrong and it did not cost &euro;300 million to do so.  In addition, the governor did not receive a single penny.  As previous speakers stated, proper penalties must be enforced in this country and examples must be made of people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the tribunal report because it highlights the wide ranging corruption that took place.  Everything that happened was underhand and shameful.  While the report has been referred to the Garda, past investigations point to the fact it is unlikely it will be acted on.  I would like to be proved wrong but the judges&rsquo; findings are based on the balance of probabilities, which is not enough to satisfy a court, where something has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  The editorial in The Sunday Business Post on 25 March 2012 asked, &ldquo;why our justice and political systems did not act years ago on much of what has been uncovered, the details of which were abundantly clear from the evidence given at the tribunal&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Perhaps I did not understand the difference between a court and a tribunal regarding the balance of proof necessary because one of the fundamental questions is whether the tribunal was established to give certain people more time.  In other words, was it a method of postponement of certain facts until a more appropriate time?  Perhaps we will never get the answer to the question.  How many more cases lie undiscovered?  We must now act on the weak links between business and government and introduce transparency to lobbying and fund-raising.  This can all be done online now.  We must even extend this to all levels of society and, for example, put everything on public spending online. I am not sure why the Government is not doing more on lobbying and documenting spending in an easily accessible way for every citizen.  There must be also a real threat of prosecution if it is to work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards political donations, we have to go much further than recent legislation and protect whistleblowers.  I proposed that we give whistleblowers some reward and that has not been even considered.  Given that some may be taking a massive risk to their career and family, why can we not provide an incentive for them to blow the whistle?  What if some low ranking banker in the former Anglo Irish Bank highlighted the wrongdoings in the mid-2000s?  Would we be in the crisis now?  It is interesting to consider.  We are still not doing enough to combat corruption and we are still behind the times on that.  John Devitt of Transparency International Ireland said, &ldquo;Other forms of abuse are possible because of the weak or non-existent regulation of lobbyists, the concentration of political power in the hands of government ministers and weak oversight by the Oireachtas ... the planning and public contracting system still creates incentives for bribery.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the US, businesses are obliged to reveal the policies they are seeking to influence and the clients on whose behalf they are working.  We have to introduce something along those lines.  What about former politicians working for lobbying companies?   We have all witnessed former politicians walking around Leinster House who are clearly here to lobby.  There is nothing wrong with that but it should be above board.  Should the Oireachtas be more picky about who is allowed in?  We should have fines and deadlines for not signing up to a register of lobbyists or even for furnishing misleading statements.  In the UK, it was recently proposed to introduce fines of up to &pound;5,000 for missing deadlines or higher fines and a maximum two year jail term for knowingly making misleading statements.  That is a real method of countering unethical business-government relations.</P>
        <P>The Mahon tribunal has highlighted many issues such as this.  It has shown we do not have a system that works and we need to do something about that.  I acknowledge legislation on lobbying and whistleblowing is proposed but we can take many other measures.  Most of us did not realise the problems but it is obvious from the Mahon tribunal that the problems were abundantly clear and yet no action was taken.  It is time to take action.  Given that the tribunal is a public service it should have been undertaken much earlier and should have had more legal weight.  It is welcome that we can speak on the subject openly because often those who speak on it are perceived to have a vested interest.  We have got to clean that up and make it possible for us to act above board.  It is in our hands to do that in the immediate future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank her for contribution.  I wish her well in her deliberations and in her portfolio.  I was sorry at the circumstances surrounding the departure of her predecessor but Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan is the ideal Minister of State for the Department at this time.  If she keeps in mind the spirit of her original political mentor, the late Jim Kemmy, what she will do in the Department and for the Government will be valid.  She will need to show courage and leadership to ensure that when all the speeches have been made, action will be taken.  I wish her well in her efforts.</P>
        <P>The Mahon report and the Moriarty report are twin products of a culture of greed and cronyism in Irish politics.  When I came into the House, half way through the debate, my colleague, Senator Conway, was speaking about the need to fundamentally change Irish politics.  Bad planning in Ireland stems from bad politics.  At the core of politics in the State, since its foundation, is cronyism and &ldquo;cute hoor&rdquo; politics, as some have called it.  In a political system where many politicians and sometimes entire political parties can virtually stand for nothing, they therefore cannot stand for anything.  Where a person&rsquo;s worth is described by the media and commentators in terms of the number of votes secured at election time, rather than the value and quality of his or her ideas and convictions, the political system is not working.  Whether it is the Mahon or Moriarty report or the state of the economy, it was almost inevitable that, since the State was formed, the political system would land us in this situation.  Therefore, we need new politics.  New politics is not as shallow as pronouncing that the Seanad should be abolished, it is a much bigger picture.  Part of the new politics must be a new approach to fund raising.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned the Government&rsquo;s deliberations on the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Donations) Bill 2011 on which we had a positive debate, having commenced in the Seanad, with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, who indicated he was open to further thinking on the matter.  That was some months ago.  Since then and following publication of the Mahon report there is a need to reflect on the question of donations to politicians.  During the debate I made the point that I thought the Minister had gone as far as he could and if we want to remove corporate donations and funding the taxpayer will have to pay.  There are no marches by taxpayers saying they want to fund politics.  It will be difficult to say to them that they must fund politics, even though they are doing so to a considerable extent.  It may well be the case, arising from this and previous reports, that the link between business and politics by way of fund raising will have to be abolished.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well in her deliberations on that issue.  As part of her deliberations on the constitutional convention on politics itself, the electoral system which puts a premium on localism, clientelism and single issue politics rather than the bigger picture will have to be reviewed.  We cannot rebuild the country and the type of government required with the current electoral system where virtually all Members of this and, particularly, the other House, spends most of their time looking over their shoulder at their constituency colleague, generally from their own party.  That is not how one would run a company and it is not how one should run a country.  All those issues which are central need to be addressed.  The position has changed in recent months since the publication of the report and our reflection and recollection of other reports to the extent that the ideas expressed here on political donations some time ago are probably already out of date.</P>
        <P>In politics we all live in glasshouses.  No political party can claim to be above reproach.  We can all improve and seek to do business and politics openly and transparently.  We are duty bound to accept the reports of the tribunals.  As they have cost a good deal of money and time, we must note and respond to what has been said and the information that has been ascertained.  As the Leader of the House has pointed out, the various agencies of Government and State are deliberating on the findings.  There is an expectation on the part of the public that there will be a reaction, legal and otherwise.</P>
        <P>Senator Brennan gave a vivid account of how things can happen quickly in another jurisdiction.  We need due process here.  Those whose names have been listed and who have questions to answer must answer.  There was a categorisation of difficulty which must be noted.  The public expect strong action to be taken where corrupt practices took place.  The tribunal report strongly pointed to a number of cases where such corruption has, apparently, happened.  We await the outcome from the various legal investigations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish the Minister of State and her Department well in their deliberations.  The cleaning up and reform of politics is crucial.  There must be absolute confidence in the political system and in every appointment, from a judge to State board appointees to peace commissioner to local dog catcher, that it is all above politics.  For many generations the biggest party on this side of the House, Fine Gael, always saw itself as playing second fiddle and complained and looked on jealously at another party which appeared to get everything.  Since we are the dominant party, perhaps there is a feeling that we should be the winners in all the contests.  We must move beyond that thinking to a position where every appointment we make is above reproach.  I do not care whether the appointee is Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, former Progressive Democrats or whatever.  He or she must be the best person for the job.  New thinking is what is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  There used to be an old joke at college as to what was the cost of planning permission?  One lecturer wrote the answer &ldquo;10%&rdquo; on the blackboard and he left it at that.  To a certain extent that was true.  We have moved on, thankfully, from the first tribunal report when the only person threatened with jail was the Senator who sits beside me for votes, namely, Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe, because she would not reveal her sources.  That is a good thing.  What strikes me in the Mahon report is the household names who have debased and diminished all involved in politics.  Some had been defended to the hilt for a long time.  Others who sought to question what was going on were accused of taking their character.  The report is welcome.</P>
        <P>I take Senator Thomas Byrne&rsquo;s point that he and his young colleagues are trying to come to terms with its impact on their party and are working for a new future for politics, as I hope are all.  I hope some will get their just desserts.</P>
        <P>I hope to bring forward proposals to reduce the costs.  I refer Members to the secretary of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse who, having forensically examined the costs, reduced them significantly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank all the Senators who participated in this high quality, wide-ranging and thought provoking debate.  I think 20 Senators from all sides participated.</P>
        <P>It is very important to state that not everybody was at this practice, that a small number were corrupted, whether they were developers, professional planners or politicians.  Others resisted and stood up to what was going on, and as Senator D&rsquo;Arcy said, one Member of this House was taken to court for it.  We need to recognise that.  While the point was made about the corruption of people in power and those who had things to gain were likely to be corrupted, which we need to protect against, not everybody was corrupted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of speakers have made the point that we are the current crop of politicians and we must ensure we are in politics for public service, not personal gain.  We must ensure this is what motivates Members on all sides in both Houses of the Oireachtas and all those in local government.  We can retrieve the name of politics if we put our minds to it.  At issue is the way we see our role.  I do not accept we are all subject to corruption, if the opportunity arises, because I do not think that is the reason most people are in politics.  We must put measures in place to stop those who might be subject to corruption from succumbing to it and getting away with it. That is the reason we are putting in place the measures concerning planning, which I outlined in my contribution, as well as the whistleblowers, ethics and registration of lobbyists legislation to which Senator Quinn referred. We must put these measures in place. </P><P Just="Left">I agree with the point made by Senator Bradford and others that the issue must be kept under review to see whether we need to take further steps in respect of donations. We intend to do that. </P><P Just="Left">In response to Senator Keane&rsquo;s points about ongoing scrutiny and implementation of the recommendations, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, will come to the Cabinet in early May with the departmental responses. These will not just be the initial responses of Departments. There will be timeframes for further discussions. </P><P Just="Left">I take Senator Conway&rsquo;s point that the issue should be discussed in the Seanad again. This will not sit on the shelf, as it were. We will ensure we monitor the implementation of the recommendations and the measures we need to take to ensure politics does not fall to the standards of that time. Senators McAleese, O&rsquo;Keeffe and Landy referred to that. </P><P Just="Left">Senators McAleese, Landy, Harte and Quinn referred to examples of corruption in other places which could possibly be ongoing. I accept we will never again put in place such costly tribunals, on which we are all agreed, but we must ensure we have mechanisms to deal with corruption. Commissions of investigation, for example are a cheaper way of doing that. </P><P Just="Left">I will speak briefly on the issue of cost. The measured cost to date of the Mahon tribunal is &euro;110 million, but the most recent projected cost the tribunal received in April was &euro;200 million. I heard the figure of &euro;300 million referred to several times in the debate. It may well go higher than &euro;200 million, but at this stage I cannot give a definitive figure. There are measures in place, including the establishment of a dedicated unit to deal with third party costs arising from both the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals. This is located in the State Claims Agency and has experience in the areas of, for example, personal injuries and property damage claims against the State. That will help to minimise third party costs. There are ongoing third party costs that have not been determined. There is an outstanding module, the Carrickmines module, that has not been completed. There are measures to reduce the cost of the rest of the work of the tribunal and we hope they will be successful. </P><P Just="Left">We need to have a more specific focus in carrying out investigations in the future. The current tribunal embraced all sorts of things at various stages and we must learn from that experience ways in which to curtail costs. </P><P Just="Left">The tribunals have done significant work in shinning a light on a culture that must be eradicated. Others as well as I have made the point that there is not just a financial cost but also a cost in terms of ghost estates and communities on the edge of Dublin and other towns that have been developed beyond the bounds of sense. We cannot allow that to happen again. We must ensure measures are put in place based on what we have learned. I give an undertaking to the Seanad that my colleagues and I in government will put planning and other measures in place.</P><P Just="Left">To respond to Senator Byrne&rsquo;s query, the review of the retail planning guidelines is almost complete and has been sent out for public scrutiny. There will be a specific focus on town centres rather than suburban sprawl. </P><P Just="Left">I will be willing, as I am sure will my colleagues, to return to the Seanad to have a further debate on the issue of the tribunal report. We as public representatives must ensure we learn the lessons from it and put the measures in place to regain public confidence in political activity. We owe that to future generations.  I thank all Members who contributed to the debate.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to speak first.  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, for coming into the House to respond.  I know the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, is abroad promoting the country, about which I will not complain. </P>
        <P>My Adjournment matter concerns the strike at the Irish Cement plants in Platin, County Meath and Limerick.  Over 100 workers are on strike over the refusal by Irish Cement to implement a recommendation of the Labour Court which partially found in favour of both the workers and the company.  The Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendation read:</P>
        <P LI="1">Taking all matters into account, this court recommends as follows:</P>
        <P LI="2">1.) The company should pay to the staff concerned the &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; amounts outstanding for 2011</P>
        <P LI="2">2.) The Court notes that while pay costs have been significantly reduced in line with the decline in over production levels, the pay structures and/or pay rates have not been reduced to date.  From the information made available to it the Court was not in a position to make a considered or definitive recommendation on this basis.  Accordingly, the Court takes the view that the parties should, on an on-going basis and where appropriate with the assistance of the appropriate advice, engage with each other regarding the total cost base of the company with a view to bringing it into line with the levels necessary to protect the maximum number of sustainable jobs in the two plants.  Depending on the precise information exchanged between the parties and developments in the company itself and/or in the sector that affect the company&rsquo;s trading position and any consequent threat to jobs or profitability, this may involve a review and adjustment of the pay rates structure of the coming year.</P>
        <P LI="2">3.) The Court will remain available to assist the parties in this process.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The recommendation is short and to the point.  In one respect, it benefits the workers and in another gives them a huge challenge.  This was fully accepted by them but not by Irish Cement.</P>
        <P>The workers went through all of the formal procedures available to them in the industrial relations mechanisms of the State.  Mediators and financial analysts were involved.  The Labour Court recommended that the company pay the bonus which has been treated as pay, not an extra, and, if necessary, enter into negotiations on its cost structures.  As I understand it, Irish Cement has refused to pay the workers the money owed until they accept a wage cut of 18%.  The workers have already accepted significant changes to work practices in terms of hours worked and, as such, are earning a lot less, as acknowledged in the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendation.</P>
        <P>This is the first serious breach of industrial relations in the company for over 20 years.  I grew up beside it and it commands tremendous respect across the region and country.  People are reluctant to give out about Irish Cement because of the employment it provides, but in this case it is my considered view the workers are being treated shabbily.  It is not right that the company is withholding wages as a bargaining chip to secure a considerable reduction in pay and that companies can refuse to comply with Labour Court recommendations when they do not suit them.  During the years the majority of Labour Court recommendations went against workers.  However, when one partially goes against a company, it refuses to implement it.  We have to have a fundamental examination of labour law and labour relations.</P>
        <P>What is the point of the Labour Court if workers who go to it to look for their rights and entitlements and find that it agrees with them then find the company does not implement its recommendations?  I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State to intervene in the dispute and talk sense to Irish Cement which has a good export business, which we welcome.  Something needs to be done to support the workers.  As I said about another industrial dispute in the same sector in my constituency, it is a pitiful sight to see men and women on a picket line throughout the night and during holiday periods.  When I travel home at midnight from meetings in my constituency, they are on the picket line.  They need help and support from the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.   Industrial action by 110 workers at the Irish Cement production plants at Platin, County Meath and Castlemungret, County Limerick began on 3 April.  I understand the Labour Court&rsquo;s most recent recommendation of January 2012 in the dispute was the culmination of protracted dialogue between the company and the group of unions representing the workers on restructuring issues that had already involved three successive Labour Court recommendations, the previous two being in August 2010 and December 2011.</P>
        <P>In its recommendation in January the Labour Court recommended the company pay to the staff concerned the bonus amounts outstanding for 2011.  In addition, the court concluded that it was not in a position, on the basis of the information provided through a report of the financial assessor undertaken following agreement between the parties, to make a definitive recommendation on an adjustment of pay rates and pay structures for the future.  Accordingly, it urged the parties to engage with each other on the total cost base of the company.</P>
        <P>The Labour Relations Commission was subsequently closely involved in facilitating talks between the company and the group of unions which were aimed at finding an agreed solution to the matters in dispute.  That process of dialogue proceeded to the stage at which proposals for a settlement of the dispute were rejected by the trade unions concerned and a work stoppage commenced.</P>
        <P>According to the company, pay rates have remained unchanged since 2008 and are currently 60% higher than the average industrial wage for unionised staff, despite the unprecedented deterioration in the construction sector.  According to the Irish Cement group of unions, the company has insisted on a pay cut before outstanding bonuses are paid.  The Labour Court previously noted in its first recommendation of August 2010 that it was clear the company was facing severe market conditions that required significant changes to enable it to compete and survive.  It was equally clear that the unions were prepared to engage seriously on these issues with the company with a view to reaching agreement on a viable way forward that would optimise employment levels and conditions of employment, consistent with the current and medium-term financial and trading environment.  With the exception of the issue of the pay cut sought by the company, it appears it was possible for the parties to reach agreement on a number of issues in dispute.</P>
        <P>I urge the parties involved to have regard to the continuing availability of the industrial relations dispute resolution bodies to assist them in seeking a settlement and addressing the underlying challenge presented by a major restructuring of the company in the face of the dramatic changes in the building industry.  I urge them to put their difficulties and differences behind them and approach the process in good faith with a view to accepting the outcome of the process.  Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is essentially voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or other collective disputes, rests with employers, workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement mchinery to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.  Even what appears to be the most intractable of disputes is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process.  The principle of good faith implies that both sides in a dispute will make every effort to reach an agreement and endeavour, through genuine and constructive negotiations, to resolve their differences.  I urge the parties involved in this dispute to work together to break the impasse by utilising the established dispute resolution machinery which is available to assist at short notice.</P>
        <P>I again compliment the Senator for raising this very important issue.  I hope the parties involved will take the clear message from the Government that there is a mechanism in place to resolve it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>What has to happen is that the Government must put pressure on Irish Cement to implement the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendation.  The workers have been through the process and the Labour Court has acknowledged that pay costs have reduced significantly.  Shift allowances and overtime payments have been withdrawn.  While rates of pay are still the same, what workers are taking home every week is much lower because of the various changes made to work practices.  The workers are prepared to talk about pay cuts, which is what the Labour Court recommended.  However, they must be paid what is due to them immediately.  No Irish company should be allowed to get away with this.  It is, therefore, incumbent on the Government to put serious pressure on the company to pay the money owed.  The staff must then respond and deal constructively with the second part of the recommendation of the Labour Court which they have accepted and which refers to pay cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify, I urge Irish Cement to take action and pay the bonuses due.  The system of industrial relations is essentially voluntarist in nature, with the terms and conditions of employment of workers being determined, in the main, by a process of negotiations to reach agreement without direct intervention by the State.  Nonetheless, I hear clearly what the Senator is saying.  In general, the law does not try to impose a solution on parties to an industrial relations dispute, rather it is designed to support them in resolving their differences.  The State takes a supportive role by providing a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper, rather than taking an interventionist course.  Institutions such as the Rights Commissioner Service and the Labour Court were established to assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers.  It is important to indicate the expertise of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery offers the best avenue for resolving issues in dispute.  It is expected the parties to a dispute will come to the process in good faith and, as a consequence, are prepared to give serious consideration to the decisions or recommendations made.  Even what appears to be the most intractable of disputes is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith.  As I said, the principle of good faith implies that both sides will make every effort.  However, responsibility for the resolution of disputes remains with the parties involved and as such, there are no plans to make changes to the Industrial Relations Acts to compel either party to accept a Labour Court recommendation in disputes referred to the court under the Acts.</P>

        <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The issue is one for the Department of Education and Skills and concerns third level scholarships.  We have had an illustrious history of providing scholarships through the Department for various reasons.  However, times are tough and I seek clarification on the scholarship schemes in existence.  I am aware of five &mdash; the limited, unlimited, Gaeltacht, Easter week and Donogh O&rsquo;Malley scholarships which are awarded for different reasons to student who show great skill in the work they are doing in school or do particularly well in their examinations.  What was the value of these scholarships?  How many of them have been awarded and what are the future intention for them?  In these financially difficult times it is more important than ever that we have very good scholarship schemes available to act as a great incentive for young leaving certificate students to try harder, do better and pick up a scholarship to allow them to proceed to third level to complete their education.</P>
        <P>Bheinn an-bhu&iacute;och den Aire St&aacute;it freagra agus soil&eacute;iri&uacute; a fh&aacute;il maidir leis na scolaireachta&iacute; seo.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the issue of the need for the Minister for Education and Skills to make a statement on the future of the important third level scholarship schemes known as the unlimited, limited, Gaeltacht, Easter week and Donogh O&rsquo;Malley scholarships.  I am grateful to have the opportunity to outline the changes to the schemes and refer to the introduction of the new bursary scheme.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware, in addition to the student grants scheme, the Department of Education and Skills also operates a number of scholarship schemes to assist students at third level.  Each year undergraduate scholarships are available from the Department through five scholarship schemes, namely, the Easter week 1916 commemoration scholarship scheme, an sc&eacute;im scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al do scol&aacute;ir&iacute; on nGaeltacht, an sc&eacute;im scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; Gaeilge tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al (neamh theoranta), an sc&eacute;im scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al (tr&iacute; Ghaeilge: teoranta) and the Donogh O&rsquo;Malley scholarship scheme.</P>
        <P>The total number of new students awarded scholarships under the five scholarships schemes for the 2011-12 academic year was 60.  The value of the Easter week and Donogh O&rsquo;Malley scholarships in the 2011-12 academic year is &euro;6,053.  The three Irish scheme scholarships are awarded at two rates, the adjacent and non-adjacent rates which for the 2011-12 academic year are &euro;1,230 and &euro;3,067, respectively.  The total allocation for these schemes in the 2012 financial year is some &euro;1.7 million.</P>
        <P>The Senator has referred to a commitment announced in budget 2012 to replace the five scholarship schemes for higher education with a new scheme of bursaries.  The current scholarships, with one exception, were awarded without the application of socioeconomic criteria.  The new bursaries, on the other hand, are designed specifically to target students attending DEIS schools in disadvantaged areas and also indicating a level of personal or family disadvantage by virtue of having qualified for a medical card.  Awards will be made regionally on the basis of the leaving certificate examination results achieved by the students.  The awards under the new scheme will be fixed at &euro;2,000 per student per year and recipients will also be entitled to apply for student grants towards the cost of maintenance and the student contribution or fees.  The bursary will be an extra support and incentive to recognise high achievement for such students.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that some 60 students will receive a bursary this September.  This number will rise in each of the next three years, with over 350 students a year benefiting by 2015.  This change has been made to make the best use of scarce resources so as to focus on the best performing students in the cohort of those most in need of financial help.</P>
        <P>The bursaries will include a small number focused on students who undertake studies in the STEM areas.  These bursaries will be named the Walton bursaries after Mr. Ernest Walton, Ireland&rsquo;s only Nobel laureate in science and the man who, with Mr. John Cockcroft, became the first person to split the atom.  We hope they will help to ensure a new generation of Irish people will strive to replicate his achievements.  These changes will not impact on those who already hold scholarships under the existing schemes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh maith ag an Aire St&aacute;it agus f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an soil&eacute;iri&uacute;.  I welcome the clarification.  I am attempting to do some basic mathematics but it was not my strongest subject at leaving certificate level.  Although I welcome the fact that a new scholarship scheme will be put in place for DEIS programme students &mdash; they certainly need a scheme &mdash; it is disappointing that the other scholarships have been scrapped.  Some children in Gaeltacht areas are not linked to a DEIS programme school but can do very well and are certainly in a position of disadvantage.  They would have accessed the other schemes previously.</P>
        <P>There appears to be a considerable cutback in funding.  Some &euro;1.7 million was available in 2012 for the five existing schemes.  According to my rudimentary mathematics, only &euro;120,000 will be spent and there is only &euro;62,000 available in grants this year.  Even in three years when we reach the full cohort of 350 students, the amount comes to &euro;700,000.  That is a cutback of &euro;1 million to &euro;700,000.  At a time when families are finding it difficult to make ends meet and given the increasing costs of sending children to school and college and the increasing costs of transport, etc., it is a shame that these other scholarship schemes have been cut back.  I called on the Minister of State to contact the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and ask him to reassess the funding available and to return it to the level of &euro;1.7 million at a minimum.  He should consider that students who do not attend DEIS programme schools may also be in a position of disadvantage and may need support.  They may need a scholarship as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have listened carefully and understand the message from the Senator.  I will take the message clearly to the Minister responsible, Deputy Quinn.  Unfortunately, given the financial austerity everywhere, the fact is that by 2015 there will be less money but recognition is given.  In many cases it is a matter of giving recognition to students.  A student may have won a special award but he or she may still qualify for support in other areas and for maintenance and grant fees as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us consider the allocation by the State to students attending third level colleges.  There is a great sense of pride in a student if he or she is given a special designated scholarship even though the money may not be as much as in previous times.  By 2015 there will be 350 students recognised by the State as being exceptional.  The DEIS programme areas of greatest need will be given accelerated funding.  It is all based on the funding and scholarship.  The payment of maintenance allowances and fees is based on family support and income as well.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, is mindful that the scheme put in place by Donogh O&rsquo;Malley has been in place for a long time, for several decades.  It is no harm to revisit it now.  The Minister will carry out an ongoing evaluation of the scheme.  I have no doubt the Senator&rsquo;s concerns will be taken note of by the Minister in any future evaluation.  One encouraging factor is that by 2015 a greater number will be acknowledged by the Department as being exceptional students from disadvantaged areas.  Of itself, this recognition can be a great accelerator for further education.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  My motion relates to cuts in funding to Cregg House, Rosses Point, County Sligo.  There was a large turnout in Sligo town last night to protest against the cuts, which amount to approximately &euro;1.3 million.  This is on top of a cut that the order of nuns, the Daughters of Wisdom, were subjected to last year.  They look after approximately 214 residents with severe disabilities from the area.  They have been looking after people in the area for up to 50 years.  It is important that these cuts are reversed if possible to allow them to continue to provide the services.  In addition, there are more than 200 people employed in the service.  It is a vital employer in the region around Sligo.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am thankful for the opportunity to respond to this important issue.  I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter and I am pleased to take the opportunity on behalf of the Minister to outline the position on Cregg House.</P>
        <P>Wisdom Services is a voluntary body operated by the Daughters of Wisdom.  It provides services for people with a disability in the north-western region.  It supports more than 200 service users, with 111 on campus, 75 in the community and 20 day attendees.  The disability budget was cut by 3.7% nationally in 2012.  The HSE national service plan states that at least 2% of this should not impact on services and must be generated from other savings and increased efficiencies.  Through its national consultative forum on disability, which includes representatives of organisations and agencies from the disability sector, the HSE is seeking to identify and agree a framework to address the savings required with minimal impact on front line services.  The HSE has assured the Minister that it will endeavour to ensure that residential, day, respite and personal assistant services are protected where possible from reductions in front-line services.  Some reduction in services will be unavoidable even with such efficiencies.  However, this will be done in such a way as to minimise the impact on service users and their families as much as possible.  As a first step, the HSE has introduced a general reduction of 3.7% from the budget of disability agencies, pending the outcome of its discussions with agencies at local level.</P>
        <P>Wisdom Services has indicated to the HSE that it is experiencing financial difficulties and has estimated that it will have a significant budget deficit in 2012, even before cost containment measures take effect.  The HSE has been working with Wisdom Services for some time to try to reduce the deficit which has been building up since 2010.  Although Wisdom Services has a cost containment plan for 2012, and has had some success, it still faces significant challenges to address the deficit.  Wisdom Services advised the HSE that it could not sign a service agreement for 2012 and may have to transition from the service if the HSE could not provide additional funding to address the deficit.  The Minister for Health shares the HSE&rsquo;s disappointment that a service level agreement has not been agreed at this point for 2012.  The reduction in the Wisdom Services budget for 2012 is consistent with other disability service providers in the region.  Unfortunately, in the current financial climate, it is not possible for additional funding to be allocated to address the deficit in Cregg House.  However, the Minister for Health is reassured that the HSE and Wisdom Services are working together to ensure that all service users will continue to receive the care and support they require, and that discussions are taking place on the most appropriate arrangements and funding for the various services, including the scope for savings.  I understand that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, along with HSE and departmental officials, will meet Oireachtas representatives tomorrow evening on this matter.  In this context, it is vital that all providers of disability services work creatively and co-operatively to ensure that the maximum level of services are maintained for service users within the funding resources available.</P>
