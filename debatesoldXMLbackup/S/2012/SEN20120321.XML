	<P>I have received notice from Senator David Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health to ensure the continuance of the STEER programme and allied services at St. Dympna&rsquo;s Hospital, Carlow.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to support the people of Malahide by ensuring Fry Model Railway is housed in Casino House, Malahide, thereby availing of a donation of &euro;1.5 million and ensuring that Bus &Eacute;ireann does not needlessly waste &euro;1 million in refurbishing the Eblana Theatre in Bus&aacute;ras for this project.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator David Cullinane of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to clarify the reason capital funding for Gaelscoil Philip Bar&uacute;n, Tramore, County Waterford was not provided under the five-year schools building plan announced last week; the criteria used in making such a decision; and if he intends to review that decision or offer an appeals process.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jillian van Turnhout of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality, in light of the launch of the steering group report on a national substance misuse strategy and the recommendation therein to commence section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, relevant to the sale and display of alcohol in the off-trade sector, to clarify the manner in which section 9 is to be implemented given the two very different options available.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Martin Conway of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to reassure the community of Miltown Malbay, County Clare that the present Garda arrangements in the town will not be affected by any proposed change in rostering.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Norris, O&rsquo;Brien, Cullinane and van Turnhout and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Conway may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Finance Bill 2012 (<i>Certified Money Bill</i>) &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at 2 p.m. and conclude not later than 5 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 4.45 p.m.; No. 2, Clotting Factor Concentrates and Other Biological Products Bill 2012 &mdash; all Stages, to be taken at 7 p.m. and conclude not later than 8.30 p.m., with the contributions on Second Stage of group spokespersons not to exceed six minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed four minutes and the Minister to be given ten minutes to reply, and with Committee and Remaining Stages to be taken immediately after Second Stage; and No. 20, Private Members&rsquo; business,  motion No. 8, to be taken at 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy Leader will have informed the Leader that there was no Minister present to hear our Private Members&rsquo; motion last Wednesday.  All sides of the House agreed this was a very unwelcome departure and not good enough.  Has the Leader had a response from the Chief Whip or the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office in regard to this?  Can he confirm to me and my colleagues on all sides of the House that this will not recur?  While I look forward to debating the Private Members&rsquo; motion this evening, I would like to hear an update on what occurred last week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are to take Second Stage of the Finance Bill today and the debate tomorrow is to be open-ended, which I welcome.  We ask that the Leader facilitate us, as he has done with other Bills, to allow us to table recommendations until 10 a.m. tomorrow.  We need to hear what the Minister has to say in the House today.  Will the Leader facilitate us?  We insist that we be given adequate time to respond to Second Stage.</P>
        <P>I asked the week before last about the pyrite committee the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, set up on 15 September 2011.  Up to 72,500 houses, predominantly on the east coast, could be affected by the pyrite problem.  How many times has the committee met?  When does the Government expect to receive a report from it?  Every week that the problem continues to feature and action is delayed, an increasing number of people will be statutorily barred as the statute of limitations applies only for six years.  HomeBond has washed its hands of the matter.  I intend to raise this matter regularly.</P>
        <P>The Leader and all fair-minded colleagues across the House will agree that the Government&rsquo;s management of the household charge has been a debacle.  Fair-minded members of Government parties, such as Deputy John Deasy and Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, have called it a fiasco.  I agree with them.  We have said so.  The legislation was rushed.  There is a court challenge over the fact that, once again, legislation is not being translated into the first official language, Irish.  With regard to the public information campaign, the first radio advertisements were last week.  The low rate of payment of the charge among the public is not just because people do not want to pay it; it is also because they do not know how to pay it.  Last week, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government said he would allow payment at post offices but that will not be the case now.  Anyone looking at this with a cold eye would say the whole manner in which the Government has gone about collecting the household charge has been nothing short of pathetic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s public utterances, unlike some of his private utterances on golf courses in Connemara which we will not go into today, on the household charge have left me with no confidence that the Department can manage this.  I want to hear directly from the Minister as to whether he will allow an extension of the payment date.  To help him out of this bunker, he should extend the payment deadline to the end of April.  Accordingly, I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business, that the Minster for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, attend the House to advise the Seanad on his proposals to ensure there will be as much compliance with the household charge as possible.  I must remind the Government that we tabled a series of exemptions which were all defeated.  The charge has turned into a fiasco.</P>

	<P>I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minster for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, attend the House to answer if he will extend the final date of payment of the household charge to the end of April, to explain why a public information campaign on the charge has been such an abject failure and why hundreds of thousands people still do not know how to pay this charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In my capacity last week as Deputy Leader and further to my promise to the House then, I did write to the Taoiseach about the concerns expressed by Members on both sides about the delays in making progress on the problem of mortgage arrears.  He and the T&aacute;naiste spoke publicly about their concerns at the lack of progress and delays in this area at the end of last week.  I hope our letter had some impact.</P>
        <P>On Thursday of last week, I wrote to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste in strong terms expressing my concern that no Minister could be found to deal with two hours of Private Members&rsquo; business in the Seanad.  I also expressed concern that the business of the Seanad was not treated with respect.  I am awaiting a response to the letter.  I assure colleagues it was taken seriously on this side of the House as well.  It was a most regrettable occurrence that a Minister was not available and Private Members&rsquo; business had to be deferred.  The Leader and I will take all the steps to ensure it does not happen again.</P>
        <P>Today is the United Nations day for the elimination of racial discrimination.  I commend the work of all the different groups that have come together from civic society to form the NGO Alliance Against Racism.  I had the privilege of speaking at its conference on racism yesterday and hearing some its members speak to the justice committee earlier.  It has prepared an excellent report on monitoring Ireland&rsquo;s international commitments against racial discrimination and has raised several issues with us as legislators which would be worth debating in this House.  I call, therefore, for a debate on the report and how best to ensure our civil and criminal laws are compliant with the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  In particular, we need to review our laws on sentencing to ensure racism can be officially seen as an aggravating factor in sentencing which it is currently not.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also need to debate, perhaps in advance of the legislation, the proposed merger of the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission.  This is being approached with some apprehension by many of the NGOs working in the area.  There is a real concern that the merged body would retain the powers and functions that both bodies had previously, as well as ensuring sufficient staffing and resources are provided for the new merged body.  It is also important we ensure it is independent in its functioning and accountable to the Oireachtas rather than to the Minister or the Executive.  A general debate would be helpful on the infrastructure to provide for greater equality and how best we tackle racial discrimination which is a real occurrence on the streets across Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the adoption by the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva last Thursday of the report of the working group on Ireland&rsquo;s universal periodic review, UPR.  During the review on 6 October last, UN member states made 127 recommendations to Ireland concerning our human rights record.  As the Leader knows, I noted on the Order of Business before that the Government immediately accepted 26 recommendations, was unable to support 15 and undertook to further examine 50.  On Thursday&rsquo;s adoption, His Excellency, the permanent representative to the United Nations, Gerard Corr, announced that of the 50 pending recommendations, the Government had fully accepted 29, partially accepted one and was unable to accept four.  In total, Ireland has made a commitment before our UN peers to implement either fully or partially 108 of the 127 recommendations.</P>
        <P>I applaud Ireland&rsquo;s civil society organisations for their valuable and committed engagement to the UPR process and commend their representatives who spoke so eloquently at the adoption of the working group report.  I welcome the permanent representative&rsquo;s announcement that he will publish a voluntary interim progress report on implementation in October 2013.</P>
        <P>As this first cycle of the UPR comes to a close, the process does not end.  We now embark upon the second, and the most important, cycle, the implementation of the recommendations.  For that reason, I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to provide the House with information on how the Government is planning to implement the recommendations and the structures that will be put in place at national level to ensure effective implementation.  The House has a role to play in monitoring and ensuring Ireland upholds its UN obligations.</P>
        <P>In light of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill debate in the House last week, the commitment made by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the vote that took place, will the Leader call on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to bring in a system of vouched expenses for the party leaders&rsquo; allowance without delay?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I would like to let Members know that tomorrow I will be formally seeking permission to move the Privacy Bill which will be taken in my Private Members&rsquo; time this day week.  It will be an important debate in which I hope Members will take part and research areas where people&rsquo;s privacy has been invaded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As somebody technically classified as elderly, I want to dissociate myself totally from remarks attributed to a spokesperson for Friends of the Elderly in the past day who said transition year was self-indulgent, should be scrapped and young people were not entitled to self-realisation or self-fulfilment.  Yes, they are.  I have seen what transition year has done for young people.  I have spoken in schools where sometimes the parents were concerned their children might just fool around or be misused on it.  I recall well in Clonakilty in how transition year students isolated an effulgence of seaweed and turned a problem into a positive outcome.  It is an offence to me as a so-called elderly person that some middle-aged man should presume to tell young people that they are self-indulgent and not entitled to self-realisation and self-fulfilment.  I am totally on their side as I have worked with Friends of the Elderly and Age Concern for many years.  If they want to do something useful, they should ensure every service is available to people who do not use computers.  There is a real discrimination that those who do not use computers are not allowed to get aeroplane tickets but they are allowed pay the new household charge, I think.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">It is total madness that we are proposing to destroy an extremely significant record of genetic material contained in the heel-prick cards from infants.  There are over 1 million of these cards which carry genetic information.  I am all in favour of an opt-out clause but why are we destroying the entire collection?  It is utter stupidity and bureaucracy gone mad.  If necessary, we should pass retrospective legislation.  I usually do not agree with it but in this case who knows what diseases may be prevented or cured?  Other countries such as New Zealand have done this.  However, we were not prepared once again and it is the fault of the law-makers that we were not.</P>
        <P>If it is agreeable, I second my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s motion on the household charge.  I want the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, to attend the House to explain the blackmail.  I have not received a leaflet yet.  Maybe it is because I live in Dublin 1 in what he probably regards as a slum.  There was a problem printing the leaflets.  If they were his election leaflets, there would not have been as much of a problem printing or distributing them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is extraordinary.  We are told that councils will accept payment, yet when citizens try to pay, they are told that there is no machinery for accepting the money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I just wonder whether the pigs have started to run the farm.  It appears that we are in a chaotic situation.</P>
        <P>I will end on a serious note and support strongly my friend and colleague, Senator Bacik.  We fought against the forced combination of some organisations that fought for human rights.  We fought against the extinction of the Combat Poverty Agency.  We have a way to go in terms of racism.  Holding the debate that the Senator called for would be excellent.  I hope the Government side allows it.</P>
        <P>On that note, I pass my sympathy to the people in Toulouse, in particular to the family that lost a father and two children, leaving a wife and one child.  I cannot begin to imagine that woman&rsquo;s feelings.  It appears that there was a racist and anti-semitic motive.  We in Europe should be utterly disgusted by such acts and show our contempt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>Would it be possible to discuss with the Minister for Finance the levels of tax that people pay?  The British Government has introduced personal tax statements to make the tax system more transparent and understandable.  There is a perception that, if not for the banking crisis, our country would not be in difficulty.  However, there is a deficit.  People need to be made more aware of how the taxes they pay every month or week are being utilised by the Government.  We should consider introducing this system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On my way to the Chamber, I heard that AIB was proposing to charge transaction fees in respect of customers with less than &euro;2,500 in their current accounts.  The Minister should consider this matter urgently.  The people with the least money will be hammered again.  Hitting the most vulnerable is an appalling move by AIB.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On behalf of my group, my leader has asked me to express our sympathy with the devastated people of Toulouse.</P>
        <P>I endorse my leader&rsquo;s call for the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to attend the House to discuss the mess that is being made of the household charge.  I expect that the Minister will attend when a debate on the Mahon tribunal is scheduled.  In this light and given that today is the first anniversary of the Moriarty tribunal&rsquo;s report, we need a follow-up debate.  I accept that it would be subsequent to the Mahon debate.  I am not trying to run away from the issues that might arise from it.  I am sure that plenty will for our party in particular, but also for other parties.</P>
        <P>In the week that the Taoiseach is in New York with many people, including Mr. Denis O&rsquo;Brien, and when Fine Gael is proposing the sale of State assets, something with which the Labour Party is going along, it is important that we reflect in due course on the findings of the Moriarty tribunal.  There was a debate in the House prior to the last Seanad election.  The report was published while I was on the Seanad election trail, but we have not had a full and proper debate on the tribunal.  I am giving advance notice that we will have a debate in due course after other matters have been addressed.  I hope that my group will endorse my call.  We can examine the judge&rsquo;s findings and what has occurred in the meantime, although little has.  All sorts of shock and anger were expressed during the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s debate.  Shock and anger will undoubtedly be expressed by all sides in respect of the Mahon tribunal.  It is important that we in public life learn lessons from both tribunals and make the necessary changes to ensure that State assets are protected and nothing of the sort ever happens again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Leader for an urgent debate on the future of wind energy.  This issue is separate to my Bill on wind turbines&rsquo; minimum distances from residential premises.  In terms of the economic viability of wind power, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, has inherited a considerable problem from the last Government.  The experts claim our policy is wrong.  I support Senator Barrett&rsquo;s previous call for a cost benefit analysis of wind energy.  The Prime Minister of the UK, David Cameron, has stated that England will move away from wind energy because it is not viable.  The same is occurring in Wales, Scotland and the US.  Denmark, the wind farm capital of Europe, is moving away from wind energy because its electricity costs are 30% higher than Ireland&rsquo;s.  Professor Colm McCarthy stated that we will need a NAMA for wind farms at some point.  Will we continue building castles in the sand while providing significant subsidies to the farms&rsquo; developers?</P>
        <P>My main concern stems from the independent legal advice I have received.  I have been told that the State is leaving itself liable to be sued because we are not in compliance with World Health Organization, WHO, guidelines on noise levels or with the Aarhus Convention, which gives people the right to participate in any planning process prior to contracts being signed.  We are defying their rights.  Eight cases involving wind farm developments in Cork are before the High Court.  I fear that there will be an &ldquo;Army Deafness: Part 2&rdquo; case, that the floodgates will open and that we will be sued.  We need an urgent debate on this matter and to take our findings to the Minister.</P>

        <P>I call for two education debates that I have asked for in recent weeks.  Rural schools are still in limbo in terms of the Government&rsquo;s proposed cuts to the one to four-teacher rural schools.  At the weekend, a large crowd turned up at P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh to protest against the cuts.  Schools have received no indication as to where they stand.  The teachers who are lost to rural schools will be asked to go on panels, after which they will be out the door.  We need an urgent debate on the issue with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  We also need to discuss with him Gaeltacht schools, which have been dealt a double whammy.  In light of the capital allocations and the way in which the cuts are being implemented, it would appear that urban schools are being given preferential treatment over rural schools.  We will not take that.</P>
        <P>I asked for a debate on the issue of newly qualified teachers.  Perhaps the Minister could take both debates in tandem.  Following a presentation in Leinster House for all Deputies and Senators, Members from all parties agreed that the way in which newly qualified teachers were being treated was unfair.  The new regime will be detrimental to them and will force them to emigrate.  It is not good enough to educate young people to leave.  We need a full, frank and honest debate.  At the presentation, there appeared to be support from all sides of the House on what was deemed an unfair issue.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I speak with some recent experience, as my son just completed transition year in our local school, Calasanctius College in Oranmore.  While he had a good year, I see great merit in continued community service.  There is no reason transition year cannot become a community service year under the tutelage of transition year co-ordinators and with rewards of points.  In Singapore second level students are not allowed to graduate without completing a period of community service.  These are valuable life skills for young people who are looking for a balanced educational experience that allows them to become rounded adults.  There is no reason community service could not be carried out in the mental health area, with disadvantaged groups or in the community.  Let us consider the merits of this proposal, in Senator Norris's sense as well.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I support Senator Healy Eames on her proposal.  For several years I have had the pleasure of awarding prizes to transition year students from a local school.  I am constantly amazed at the amount of work they do over the year.  The Senator referred to the valuable life skills they develop.  It is mind-boggling to think how much can be achieved by youngsters at the age of 15 or 16.  They cover such a wide range of activities that it makes sense to make everybody take transition year.  A considerable number of schools do not offer transition year, which is a shame.</P>

	<P>Transition year is very worthy and we should give more attention to it.  It is a topic that deserves to be debated in this House.</P>
        <P>I read in yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers that the household tax leaflet will only be delivered to between 86% and 94% of homes.  Apparently it was never the intention to deliver it to every home because the Government reached a deal not with An Post, which it owns, but with a body which does not deliver to every house in the country.  How can one introduce a household tax in the absence of distributing information on it to every home affected by it?  I cannot understand the Government&rsquo;s decision in this regard, particularly when it owns a company, An Post, which could deliver the leaflets.  It may have been able to get a cheaper deal from the other organisation but if we are introducing a new tax we should at least ensure everybody expected to pay is informed about it.</P>

        <P Just="Left">However, the person who most concerns me this morning is not a role model.  The chief executive of Bank of Ireland drew down a staggering &euro;831,000 in payments last year.  This is not only absurd but is also obscene at a time when the country is going through a recession.  I cannot understand how the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste allowed this to happen.  They have to stand up to the banks.  This bank would not be in existence were it not for the taxpayer.</P>

I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Finance to outline the actions the Government intends to take on this matter.  This is happening in a year when senior Bank of Ireland executives withdrew &euro;30 million of their own cash from the bank.  Where has that money gone?  How can we have confidence in them if they lack confidence in their own bank?  This has to be stopped.</P>

        <P Just="Left">However disappointing the dissemination of information might have been, the position adopted by certain elected Oireachtas Members is reprehensible.  They have the privilege of representing the people in the Oireachtas and had the opportunity to vote against household charges.  Once they happened to be on the losing side they advised the public not to support the charge and, in effect, to break the law of the land.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Deenihan, to the House to address the ongoing problems experienced by the Moore Street project, which is sponsored by the families of the 1916 leaders.  Representatives of the project presented their case to an Oireachtas committee this morning.  An area of Moore Street is designated as a national monument but Dublin City Council granted permission for the redevelopment of part of the street.  I understand the Minister has sought a report on the matter.  The findings of this report will be critical to whether the proposed sterile retail development, which is now in NAMA, will proceed instead of the plans put forward by the 1916 families, which would allow for a vibrant and suitable memorial to the 1916 leaders based on the traditional Moore Street market.  If the Minister could finalise the report and explain it to the House, it would be the first step in building a fitting monument.  It would be a disgrace if 2016 comes and goes without a fitting monument to our heroes in the Moore Street area.</P>

	<P>I want to share some good news about banks, for a change.  MBNA in Carrick-on-Shannon has been sold, thereby protecting the 250 jobs in the Irish side of the business.  It is no accident this welcome news was released on foot of the successful visit by the Taoiseach and Ministers to New York.  It is very good news for the workers concerned after a period of great uncertainty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must also take action on the price of diesel, petrol and home heating oil.  Every time there is a price increase, the Government gets more in tax.  It is time to take a look at the issue of tax on oils, particularly diesel as most transport in the country is diesel.  As someone from the agriculture sector, I am aware that now that spring is here, significant amounts of diesel will be needed for farming.  The higher prices are a major factor in this area and will affect and reduce progress made in farming in the past few months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the request made by Senator John Whelan that we send our sympathy to the family of Jim Stynes in Melbourne.  He was a wonderful example of an Irishman who had contributed so much to his adopted country, particularly Melbourne.  I would also like to be associated with the proposal made by Senators Thomas Byrne and David Norris to send our sympathy to the people of Toulouse following the horrible murders there of innocent children and others.  A rabbi and his two children were assassinated by this anti-semitic individual.  I hope he will be caught and brought to justice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris made a point with regard to an issue highlighted last night on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;.  This relates to genetic material which has been stored over a long period from blood samples taken in heel prick tests.  I cannot understand why the Data Protection Commissioner, Billy Hawkes, and the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, would decide to destroy some of this invaluable information.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children should be given the opportunity to study the issue before this action is taken.  The information is invaluable and I cannot understand why the Data Information Commissioner should interfere in this issue.  The information has a long-term effect and could be of benefit to many people in the future if stored carefully and safely in Dublin.  I commend &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; for its excellent programme highlighting this also.  The Minister should decide to prevent the destruction of this information, which is crucial to future research, before it is destroyed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan on the issue of the household charge and call for the Minister to address the House on this crucial issue.  I read a statement from Donegal County Council today which stated that it may have to revisit its 2012 budget due to the shortfall in funding that will arise due to the non-payment of the household charge.  The same councillors from Donegal County Council who are calling for members of the public not to pay the charges are now telling the public that the service from Donegal County Council will be reduced.  The manager and executive of Donegal County Council have said that Donegal will be short, to the tune of &euro;8 million, for services vital to the county.  For these people to tell others not to pay their household charge is tantamount to subversion of the State.  As Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan said, we have a democracy and irrespective of whether we like it, our laws are passed in this Parliament.  People cannot make the laws out on the street or we will end up in anarchy.  They should not even suggest we break the law.  It is one thing to tell people they cannot afford the charge or that they cannot pay it, but telling neighbours not to pay their debts is totally irresponsible.</P>
        <P>I would like to highlight the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in does not know where it stands on the policy.  With the draconian system that operates in Northern Ireland, everyone pays.  The system there is not based on ability to pay, but on the value of property.  People in social housing must pay there also.  They have no choice.</P>

That is total hypocrisy and there is no way around it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was going to raise the issue of the household charge but in the context that only 15% of the people have already paid it.

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have.  Many people who are not paying the charge are not paying it because it is unfair and regressive.  They are not paying it because somebody who earns &euro;10,000 a week pays the same as somebody who earns &euro;10,000 a year.  That is unfair.  If people say that anyone who does not pay the household charge is subverting the State and democracy, that is shameful.  The Government should be properly funding local government in order that it has money.</P>

	<P Just="Left">What I would say to all those Senators who come in here week in and out and attack Sinn F&eacute;in and those taking a stand on this charge is that they have their chance.  On the same day as the expiry date for the payment of the household charge, 31 March, they should not pay the &euro;3.1 billion Anglo Irish Bank promissory note.  That is about 17 times more than what the Government will take in on the household charge.  That is the choice available to the Government.  It should not come in here attacking Sinn F&eacute;in, which is not in government.  The Government should do what it should be doing.  It should stand up for the people and not pay the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note.  It should go after the wealthy in this country, not the small and medium-sized businesses and low to middle income families who are being hammered by the Government and were hammered by the previous one.</P>

As we are all aware, part of that street is a national monument and we would all like to see a suitable memorial there, as outlined by the Senator.  I support the call for the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, to come to the House soon with the report from the committee to update us on this.  I hope the matter will be attended to as soon as possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Reference was made this morning to tribunal reports.  As we know, any recommendations that may be contained in such reports, for example, in the Mahon tribunal report which is imminent, is a matter for the Government.  It will look at the recommendations, if any, and presumably there will be some.  No doubt, any serious recommendations will be treated as such by the Government and legislation will follow.  I support the call for a debate on the issue, following publication of the report.  If any issues arise from any other tribunal reports, those should be dealt with in another debate.  I support the calls for a debate.</P>

It is appalling to think that young primary schoolchildren should witness such horror in the main town of County Clare.  I commend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on making arrests almost immediately.  This type of appalling behaviour should not be allowed in any town in any country, particularly in this country.  I hope justice will prevail rapidly and urgently.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the theme of education, I call for a debate on the overall curriculum at second level.  For a long time, I have believed that we should move away from the pressure-cooker points based system that engulfs the lives of young people for their final two years of secondary education and move towards a system of continuous assessment where the potential of young people, not just academically but in the arts, music and other areas, can be explored and developed.  We should be looking at a holistic approach to education instead of the thwarted approach currently adopted.  The current approach is focused on the academic side of education and is based on six or seven core academic subjects as opposed to an overall sporting, artistic, musical and creative educational experience.  Education should be about giving young people the skills to go through life meaningfully and productively and not simply to gain a few points to do an academic course at third level which they are unequipped to do.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Today marks the seventh anniversary of world Down&rsquo;s syndrome day and for the first time, the United Nations will officially observe this day.  In December 2011, the United Nations General Assembly declared this day and every future 21 March world Down&rsquo;s syndrome day, which I welcome.  Each year the voices of people with Down&rsquo;s syndrome and those who care for, and work with, them grow stronger.  It is great progress to welcome the first United Nations-recognised world Down&rsquo;s syndrome day.  It will go a long way to raise public awareness of Down&rsquo;s syndrome, what it means to have Down&rsquo;s syndrome and how people with Down&rsquo;s syndrome can play such a vital role in our society.  Down's syndrome is a naturally occurring chromosomal arrangement which has always been a part of the human condition and is to be found in all communities across the world.  It is vital that adequate health care access is available to all.  Early intervention programmes and inclusive education as well as appropriate research are vital to the growth and development of the individual.  I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on services for children with disabilities, in particular pre-school services for children with Down's syndrome.</P>

        <P>Other Senators raised the household charge but I have a suggestion for the Leader to make to the Minister.  People who have paid their household charge should be given free radon testing in their houses.  If the Minister could write off &euro;45 from the septic tank registration fee with the swipe of a pen, he could write with that same pen that people should be given free radon testing in their houses.  Areas along the west and east coasts show very high readings of radon.  The Minister could do that as a goodwill gesture.  Other Senators have called for him to attend the House and when he does, I will put this proposal to put to him.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the suggestion by Senator Noone that each taxpayer should receive a statement at the end of the year outlining where his or her tax moneys have been spent.  Sometimes much of the noise comes from non-tax paying citizens but the tax paying citizens should be informed officially as to how much of their tax moneys are spent on justice, health, education, social welfare, etc.  It would help to have an informed debate on tax and expenditure.  All of us should be mature enough to have such a debate on public expenditure and taxation in this House.</P>
        <P>There was much talk about the household charge today but let us be realistic about it.  This country is only a few steps away from bankruptcy.  Very significant progress has been made in trying to turn around the ship of state but this country is almost broke.  We must borrow billions to keep the country ticking over.  There is no magic solution.  Perhaps there is a way to use the copious amount of toner available to one party to photocopy the millions of Northern Bank notes and turn them into billions but it is not as simple as that.  We need to have a serious economic discussion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not realistic to expect the Minister responsible for the household charge to come to the House today but I agree with my colleagues who believe a contribution from the Minister to further clarify the urgent need for this charge and how and where it can be paid would be helpful.  I ask the proposers of the amendment to at least allow the Leader to have discussions with the Minister to see if it would be possible to have that debate tomorrow.  The Minster has come to the House to respond to Adjournment debates on the household charge but further public information and public debate is necessary.  However, the bottom line is that the Oireachtas, whether one likes it, has passed this household charge.  If a country stops respecting the rule of law, it enters the field of anarchy and nobody wants that.  We need further clarification but we must get it in a calm fashion.  I do not expect that to happen today but I hope the Minister will have the opportunity at the Leader's request to come to the House, perhaps tomorrow, to engage in constructive dialogue.</P>

If one is a member of a local authority, one is not entitled to hold one&rsquo;s seat if one has not paid one&rsquo;s rates by 31 December.  I was a rate payer and member of Cork City Council.  This year I had to pay &euro;7,000 for 1,500 sq. ft. of office space for my business.  I do not receive income from that business.  A hotel in Cork is paying &euro;500,000 per year in commercial rates, which amounts to &euro;10,000 per week and is the equivalent of paying &euro;100 for 1,000 houses in one week.  That is the reality of the payments being paid by the commercial sector.  Even if one does not make one cent in profit, one must pay the commercial rates in order to maintain services from which the public benefits.  We need to get real in regard to widening the tax base.  A huge mistake was made in 1977 when we abolished domestic rates.  We to widen the tax base and this is just the first step in this regard.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I refer to transition year.  As a Member of the European Parliament, I followed the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in working on one of the projects in our schools called Understanding Europe.  Each year the winners and runners up won a trip to Brussels.  It was a great project and more than 50 or 60 schools from around Munster entered it.  It was a considerable educational process and there are plenty of others like it.  The debate we are having is about looking at new projects like that.  There is a great need at this stage for people to start understanding the European Union and what it contributes to this country, in the supports in place for agriculture and many other areas.  Abolishing the transition year is not the way forward.  It is about growing and developing it and ensuring it gets the necessary support.  I would welcome a debate in that area.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A few months ago I raised the issue of VEC amalgamations and where headquarters were located.  I raised it in the Chamber, both with the Leader and as an Adjournment matter.  I asked for a clear and open debate on how the decision was made; I got answers in the form of criteria.  In a recent freedom of information request response from the Department of Education and Skills, however, I found that in a number of cases, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, went against departmental advice, especially in regard to value of money.  He used his personal preference to allocate the headquarters of a number of VECs.  Today we will talk about economic arguments and how we spend our money.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Skills or, at some stage perhaps the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to discuss decisions that were made on VEC headquarters, why the criteria we were told were being used were not used and how the Minister came to exercise his personal preference in this decision?</P>

	<P Just="Left">The special advisers and the top earners who are being paid from the public purse.  We must ask where are the salary caps about which we hear so much.  Why is a person heading up an organisation that has cost this country so dearly being paid four times as much as the Taoiseach?  Many people in this country would think that gentleman is not doing as good a job as the Taoiseach is even though he is being paid four times as much.  It is very difficult to convince people to pay the household charge when they see that sort of income being paid to the head of an organisation that is the cause of our having to find so much money to pay the banks.  These are all legitimate questions and might provide the basis for a good, useful and constructive debate in the House.  I ask the Leader to take that on board.</P>

        <P Just="Left">A number of speakers raised the household charge.  We have debated this topic on numerous occasions.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, attended the House to discuss the actual Bill and has been present on a number of occasions for Adjournment motions on this subject.  There is very little more he can say on the subject.  I understand the figure who have paid is 15% &mdash; I take Senator Cullinane at his word.  Nonetheless, the charge is due.  People have another ten or 11 days to pay it.  I am sure the vast majority will adhere to the laws of the country as passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I take great umbrage that Members of the Oireachtas advocate that people should break the law.  It is an absolute disgrace that legislators in this House, having gone through the legislative system, go out into the streets and advocate what amounts to anarchy by asking people not to pay the charge.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to set out the measures in this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill.  When the Minister opened the Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il on 14 February, he noted that the Chamber was somewhat sparsely populated.  As he remarked to Deputy Michael McGrath at the time, this must be a sign that the crisis is over with almost no one present to hear the beginning of the debate.  The idea that the passage of the Finance Bill through the Oireachtas should not attract attention beyond the average is to be welcomed.  This is important and complex legislation but it should be considered as just the routine annual implementation of budget and associated measures; it should not be associated with an air of high drama or crisis.</P>

	<P>What did Fine Gael Members do last year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Economic life in this country is slowly beginning to return to normal.  It will take time and there is a long way to go but the process has begun.  Many members of the Cabinet have just returned from representing us at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations in various parts of the world.  They all brought with them the important message that Ireland is open for business.  It is expected that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures to be released later this week will show that the economy has returned to full year growth.  The figures currently available show that GDP increased by an average of 0.7% in the first three quarters of 2011.  This is despite the considerable uncertainty in the global economy, particularly in the euro area, last year.  In this regard, the Minister is confident the concerted policy action agreed at European level will help stabilise and restore confidence in the euro area as we go through this year.</P>
        <P>It has been well documented that our economic recovery is being export-led.  Exports of goods and services are well in excess of pre-crisis levels.  This shows that the improvement in competitiveness, which has been evident in recent years, is standing to us.  This demonstrates the inherent flexibility of the economy.  Prices and costs in Ireland have fallen dramatically and further improvements are in the pipeline.  The strong export performance also means that our balance of payments with the rest of the world moved into surplus in 2010 for the first time in more than a decade and is expected to remain in surplus over the coming years.  This is encouraging and means that the nation as a whole is paying its way.  Obviously, as a small open economy whose recovery is being driven by exports, we will be affected by any weakness in the global economy.  However, the composition of our exports and competitiveness improvements will provide support.  Figures released by the CSO last week showed that the trade surplus in 2011, at &euro;44.7 billion, was at a record high.  Moreover, I emphasise that the general consensus amongst forecasters, both institutional and private, is that Ireland will record positive GDP growth again in 2012.</P>
        <P>The labour market has borne the brunt of the adjustment in the economy with unemployment at more than 14%.  Even though it is expected to reduce a little this year, it is clear that structural unemployment, a legacy of the construction boom, will remain a problem for some time to come.  To combat this, the Government has prioritised job creation and retention, introducing a number of measures, which include the jobs initiative, the action plan on jobs and the pathways to work scheme.  We have also successfully negotiated with the troika that some of the receipts from the sale of State assets will be directed towards job creation.  While unemployment remains unacceptably high, signs of stabilisation are becoming evident.  Employment figures showed the first quarterly increase in four years in Q4 2011.</P>
        <P>There are many uncertainties and considerable risks.  Obviously, the weakness of the euro area is a major factor.  However, recent economic data &mdash; domestically and internationally &mdash; have not been as poor as was first assumed.  For example, high frequency survey data have shown strong levels of global economic activity in both January and February, while in Germany, the ZEW indicator of economic sentiment has increased for the fourth consecutive month and is at its highest level since June 2010.  At home, goods exports rose by 10% year-on-year in January, while consumer confidence levels have also shown improvement.</P>
        <P>As the Minister said on Second Stage in the Lower House, the Bill contains a number of measures designed to support investment, stimulate research and, ultimately, create jobs.  It must be viewed as one element of a wider strategy to support economic activity.  We have limited resources and we must take these and apply them to areas with the best employment potential and returns.</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of the House to a number of the key measures to which the Bill will give legal effect, most of which were announced in the budget.  We have introduced the special assignee relief programme or SARP.  This incentive is about reducing the costs to businesses of attracting key individuals from abroad to work in the Irish-based operations of their employer.  The foreign earnings deduction for employees temporarily assigned from Ireland as part of their employment to Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa is designed to incentivise employees to undertake marketing trips to the countries involved, with a view to increasing Irish exports to the large populations of those countries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill includes a number of significant enhancements to the research and development tax credit scheme, as we need to encourage the productive, high value-added sectors of the economy to work our way out of the current downturn.  It introduces a package of measures to support the financial services industry.  This welcome industry employs more than 30,000 people and contributes more than &euro;1 billion in tax to the Exchequer.  The industry represents a bright spot in terms of recent employment growth in the economy with the funds industry alone creating more than 1,200 net new jobs in 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Turning to property reliefs, the legislation imposes limits on the use of legacy property reliefs.  These are in line with the programme for Government commitment to restrict property tax reliefs and other tax shelters that benefit high income earners.  As regards mortgage interest relief, the Bill gives effect to the commitment in the programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30% for first-time buyers who took out their first mortgage in the period 2004 to 2008.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">All these measures were explained in detail in the Minister&rsquo;s Second Stage speech in the D&aacute;il.  I would like to refer to other important measures not previously highlighted.  Perhaps of particular interest to Senators, during the debate on the Finance (No. 3) Act 2011 in this House, on foot of recommendations by Senator Zappone, the Minister undertook to have his officials re-examine the position on tax relief for maintenance payment arrangements where civil partners lived separately.  As a result of that examination, he decided to make two changes to the taxing provisions in this area.  The Bill provides that in cases where differences arise between civil partners and a legally binding agreement between the parties is drawn up, for example, a trust or covenant agreement or any other act giving rise to a legally enforceable obligation, this agreement will be recognised under new tax law.  The Bill also places civil partnerships on the same footing as married relationships where it is accepted that following the break-up of a relationship, often for economic reasons, persons may continue to live under the same roof.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill gives effect to the Minister&rsquo;s budget announcement to increase the exemption threshold for the universal social charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 for the tax year 2012 and subsequent years.  It also introduces an enhanced scheme of stock relief for registered farm partnerships, which is part of a range of measures relating to farming, which reflect the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting and facilitating growth and expansion in the key agrifood economic sector.</P>
        <P>I will now go through the Bill but will not cover each individual measure or section.  This is one of the largest Finance Bills in recent years, running to 141 sections, six Schedules and 324 pages.  It is the output of a major exercise, an effort not confined solely to officials or legislators.  Measures are not simply devised in Merrion Street but represent the product of much discussion and dialogue across all Departments and with industries, including a broad spectrum of representative organisations, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants and individual citizens.</P>
        <P>Part 1 deals with the income levy, universal social charge and income, corporation and capital gains taxes.  Section 2 deals with the universal social charge, about which I have already spoken.  The section also includes technical amendments on the application of the universal social charge.  It should be noted that as a result of this measure more than 300,000 people will be removed from the USC net.  These are, broadly speaking, people engaged in temporary and seasonal employment and people in receipt of low wages.  A key group of people, in terms of the workforce and the amounts of money they are earning, will directly benefit of this change, as per the commitment of both parties in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 2 introduces an additional amount of USC to be paid by investors in section 23 and accelerated capital allowance schemes who have gross incomes of more than &euro;100,000.  This property relief surcharge, which is effective from 1 January 2012, will apply at a rate of 5% on the amount of income sheltered by such relief in a given year.  In addition, section 17 provides that investors in accelerated capital allowance schemes will no longer be able to use any capital allowance beyond the tax life of the particular scheme, where that tax life ends on 1 January 2015.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 4 provides for a number of changes to income tax and the USC as they apply to share based remuneration.  Section 6, with section 105, provides for changes to the interim tax based health insurance scheme.  Section 6 makes changes to the age related income tax credit for 2012.  The credit will be in five year bands for individuals aged between 60 and 84 years with a final band for individuals aged over 85 years.  Section 7 gives effect to the budget day announcement that the tax exemption for the first 36 days of illness benefit and occupational injury benefit will be removed.  For example, in some circumstances an employee who is absent from work owing to illness and continues to be paid by his or her employer is often better off on sick leave than when working.  This change seeks to avoid such a situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sections 8 and 9, together with section 27, provide for the changes to the research and development, tax credit scheme and mortgage interest relief, both of which I have referred to, and certain other changes.  Section 10 provides that those signing for PRSI credits can now qualify for the Revenue job assist scheme.  Section 11 increases the amount of fees disregarded in respect of claims for tax relief on third level fees.  The disregard for claims in respect of students who are in full-time education has been increased from &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,250.  Where all of the fees paid relate to part-time education, the disregard is increased from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,125.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sections 12 to 14, inclusive, relate to the introduction of the special assignee relief programme and the foreign earnings deductions, which I mentioned earlier.  Section 15 was inserted on Committee Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  It introduces a number of changes to the provisions relating to the operation of the PAYE system.  These changes are largely technical and regulatory in nature.  Section 16 addresses anomalies created by undesired interactions between the high earners restriction and the claw-back provisions under the section 23-type reliefs, as well as the balancing charge-allowance provisions under the property based accelerated capital allowance schemes.  Provision is also made to remove the proposals relating to section 23-type reliefs provided for in section 24 of the Finance Act 2011, which were subject to a commencement order.</P>
        <P>Section 18 gives effect to a number of changes in the broad pension tax area as announced in the budget.  The Bill provides for the increase from 5% to 6% in the annual imputed distribution which applies to the value of assets in the approved retirement funds, ARFs where such funds have assets valued in excess of &euro;2 million.  The imputed distribution arrangements are also being extended to vested PRSAs on the same basis.  Section 18 also includes provisions to mitigate the harsher impacts at retirement for certain individuals resulting from the significant reduction to &euro;2.3 million in the annual allowable pension fund at retirement for tax purposes.</P>
        <P>Section 20 makes a number of amendments to the tax treatment of farmers.  These relate to carbon tax computation, young trained farmers courses and enhanced stock relief in certain circumstances.  Section 24 gives effect to amendments to the relief for investment in films.  These changes are aimed at encouraging compliance by qualifying companies with the reporting requirements of the scheme.  Section 28 increases the tax rates for life assurance policies and investment funds by 3%.  The increased rates apply to payments and deemed payments on or after 1 January 2012.  The section also deals with anomalies in the taxation of such income in the hands of companies.</P>
        <P>Section 29 exempts pension funds from life assurance exit tax.  This is in keeping with the current exemption from investment fund exit tax and overall exemption for pension funds from income tax and capital gains tax.  Section 30 aligns the rate of exit tax on collective investment undertakings with the rate applying to entities which are subject to gross roll-up regime at30%.  Section 31 amends the equivalent measures regime in relation to the exit tax for investment funds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sections 33 to 35, inclusive, will accommodate cross-Border mergers of investment funds and new master feeder structures envisaged under the recently implemented UCITS directive.  Section 36 gives effect to the increase in the standard deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, rate by 3% to 30%.  The rate for certain longer term saving products will also be increased by 3% to 33%.</P>
        <P>Section 41 amends section 113 of the Taxes Consolidation Act in three ways.  First, it extends the range of carbon offsets which a section 110 company can acquire to include forest carbon credits.  Second, it amends the definition of a qualifying company to acquire notification to Revenue within a specific timeframe.  Third, it ensures that the Finance Act 2011 amendments do not apply to a company operating in a State through a branch or agency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 47 introduces a new section 452A of the Taxes Consolidation Act to amend the interest deductibility rules to facilitate cash pooling businesses in the corporate treasury sector.  Section 45 extends the scheme which provides relief from corporation tax on the trading income and certain gains of new start-up companies in the first three years of trading so as to include start-up companies which commence a new trading year in 2012, 2013 or 2014.</P>
        <P>Section 47 extends the current group relief rules in section 411 of the Taxes Consolidation Act so that losses can be transferred between two Irish resident companies where those companies are part of a 75% group involving companies which are either resident in a jurisdiction with which Ireland has a treaty or quoted on a recognised stock exchange.</P>
        <P>Section 51 amends Irish tax legislation to reflect recent changes in company law.  Section 52 extends the existing unilateral credit relief, which currently applies to royalty payments, to include equipment lease rental payments.  This measure will be of particular benefit to the aircraft leasing industry.</P>
        <P>Section 53 provides for the taxation at 12.5% instead of 25% in the hands of an Irish resident company of foreign-sourced dividends paid out of the trading profits of privately held companies in countries with which Ireland does not have a tax treaty but which have joined the OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 55 provides for the capital gains tax, CGT, rate increase from 25% to 30% as announced on budget day.  Sections 56 to 58, inclusive, and 66 contain various anti-avoidance and revenue protection measures.  Sections 59 and 60 modify CGT retirement relief to encourage timely transfers of farms and businesses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sections 61 and 63  provide for CGT exemptions for State bodies, namely, Teagasc, local government corporate service bodies, the Grangegorman Development Agency, and disposals by the Dublin Institute of Technology to the Grangegorman Development Agency.  Section 62 provides that compensation for giving up the right to cut turf in special areas of conservation will be exempt from CGT.</P>
        <P>Section 64 gives effect to the property incentive announced in the budget, under which property purchased up to the end of 2013 and retained for at least seven years will be relieved from capital gains tax on the part of the gain attributable to the initial seven year holding period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 65 was inserted on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and is intended to facilitate the development of Ireland&rsquo;s holding company regime by providing that gains on foreign currency by holding companies will not be treated as capital gains but as investment income.  Section 67 was also inserted on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and provides that where a sports body makes a gain on a disposal any portion of the gain donated to a charity will be exempt from CGT.</P>
        <P>Part 2 of the Bill deals with excise.  Sections 68, 78, 81 and 82 give effect to the increases from &euro;15 to &euro;20 per tonne in the carbon tax announced in the budget.</P>
        <P>Section 69 gives effect to the increases in tobacco products tax announced in the budget.  In addition, the opportunity is being taken to make changes to the structure of the excise on tobacco by increasing the specific element of the excise in line with the greater scope offered by the relevant EU directive.  A minimum level of excise on tobacco is also being introduced, which will protect the Exchequer in the event of any downward pressure on prices.  This is the approach that has been adopted by the vast majority of member states.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sections 70 to 77, inclusive, were inserted on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and deal mainly with changes required to existing excise law, many of which are editing and re-structuring changes in preparation for an excise consolidation Bill.  Section 78 introduces measures to support enforcement work by facilitating monitoring and supervision of the oils supply chain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 83 contains provisions for the introduction of an export refund scheme, whereby vehicles exported from the State will be able to claim a refund of the residual VRT on a vehicle.  The section also includes a number of definitional and other changes consequent on the introduction of the scheme, as well as a revised definition of &ldquo;new&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Part 3 of the Bill deals with VAT.  Section 85 provides for the strengthening of VAT ministerial orders following advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  In conjunction with sections 91 to 93, inclusive, it also provides a mechanism to recover VAT and impose interest and penalties where VAT has been improperly claimed and refunded under any VAT refund order.  This is an anti-avoidance measure.</P>
        <P>Section 87 gives effect to the budget increase in the standard rate of VAT from 21% to 23% from 1 January 2012.  Section 94 revises the definition of bread for the purposes of the application of the zero rate of VAT, to reflect the breads currently available on the market, taking account of the development of bread for health, ethnic and other reasons.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 95 reduces the VAT rate applicable to district heating to 13.5% with effect from 1 March 2012.  It also reduces the rate of VAT on admissions to open farms and built and natural heritage such as waterfalls to the 9% reduced rate consistent with the application of this rate to the tourist industry last year.</P>
        <P>Part 4 of the Bill deals with stamp duties.  Section 97 provides for the introduction of a single stamp duty rate of 2% on transfers of non-residential property, including commercial and industrial property and farm land.  The section also provides for the abolition of consanguinity relief with effect from 1 January 2015.</P>
        <P>Sections 98 to 104 relate to exemptions and reliefs from stamp duty.  The provisions include an exemption for the Grangegorman Development Agency; relief from stamp duty for mergers of Irish public limited companies and for cross-Border company mergers; relief from stamp duty on ATM and debit cards to provide for a pilot scheme of basic payment accounts to encourage and facilitate participation in the mainstream financial sector among members of the public who are, or consider themselves to be, excluded from it; and a number of other technical changes.  In particular, section 100 contains nine separate technical stamp duty amendments which extend the range and scope of stamp duty exemptions applying to certain financial transactions and confirm the stamp duty treatment of options over shares.</P>
        <P>Section 105 gives effect to the new rates of the health insurance levy for 2012 of &euro;285 for individuals aged 18 years or over and &euro;95 for individuals aged under 18 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 5 of the Bill deals with capital acquisitions tax, CAT.  Section 109 provides for the CAT changes announced in the budget, namely, the increase in the rate from 25% to 30% and the reduction in the group A tax-free threshold for gifts and inheritances between parents and children to &euro;250,000.  The section also provides for the breaking of the link between the tax-free thresholds and the consumer price index.</P>
        <P>Sections 111, 112 and 114 contain various anti-avoidance provisions.  Section 116 moves the pay and file date for CAT from 30 September to 31 October, in response to concerns about the payment of CAT for individuals receiving an inheritance close to the filing date.</P>
        <P>Part 6 deals with miscellaneous provisions.  Section 119 was inserted on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and addresses some issues pertaining to Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations on the exchange of information with tax authorities in other countries.  Section 122 will require merchant acquirers and third party payment processors to make regular automatic returns to Revenue of all amounts credited to traders.  This is in response to emerging evidence that some businesses may be under-reporting card payment transactions.</P>
        <P>Section 126 will enable Revenue to require a taxpayer who has had a significant previous tax default to provide Revenue with a bond covering fiduciary taxes.  This measure is specifically aimed at delinquent businesses that have a track record of non-compliance and of walking away from tax debts.  Section 127 will provide Revenue with powers similar to those contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2011 regarding the provision of documents or information and in relation to privileged legal material.  These powers will only be available when Revenue is investigating serious tax offences.</P>
        <P>Sections 128 and 130 were introduced on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Section 128 changes the legislation governing the time limits that apply to the repayment of taxes and the related question of when a repayment of tax may be set off against other tax liabilities.  Section 130 updates the part of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 that deals with abusive tax avoidance schemes.  The amendment removes an element of doubt over Revenue&rsquo;s entitlement to make or amend the necessary assessment beyond the usual four-year period in order to collect the tax after a transaction has been judged to be abusive.</P>
        <P>Section 136 provides that the Irish citizenship condition for the payment of the domicile levy will be abolished for tax years from 2012 onwards.  This means it will not be possible for an individual who would otherwise be subject to the levy to avoid it by renouncing Irish citizenship.</P>
        <P>Section 137 sets out additions to the list of double taxation agreements and tax information exchange agreements between Ireland and other jurisdictions.  Following the enactment of this Bill, Ireland will have concluded double taxation agreements with 65 countries and tax information exchange agreements with 19 countries.  Negotiations to conclude a number of other agreements are ongoing.</P>
        <P>I hope the Seanad has found this explanation of the measures in the Finance Bill useful.  I reiterate that we all aware that our country is slowly emerging from the most severe downturn in the history of the State.  The Finance Bill 2012 is another important step on the road to economic and fiscal recovery.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  There is a lot to be said on Second Stage.  We will have an opportunity to go through the sections of the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage tomorrow.  The Finance Bill 2012 will bring into effect many of the measures that were voted on in the budget.  The ESRI has confirmed that it was probably the most unfair budget that was ever passed.  When the Minister of State replies at the end of this debate, perhaps he will set out the Government&rsquo;s response to the ESRI report, which states clearly that the poorest 40% of households will suffer the highest fall in income as a result of the measures in the budget.</P>
        <P>There has been a great deal of discussion about the growth forecast on which the budget was predicated.  A growth rate of 1.6% was forecast late last year.  I will give the Government credit by mentioning that we appreciate it is operating in a volatile international environment and a difficult economic environment.  I wish to focus on the budget measures and the targets that require to be hit, for example, in relation to our current budget deficit.  Is the Government still working on the basis of a projected growth rate of 1.3% for this year?  The median growth rate that is being forecast by independent groups and domestic and international interests is 0.5%.  That would leave us way off the mark.  I would like the Minister of State to give the House some clarification in that regard during today&rsquo;s discussion on the Finance Bill 2012.  What is the Government actually setting its measures against?  Growth is important.  Obviously, it will make everyone&rsquo;s job a lot easier if we can see growth coming into the economy.  There is a difference between the 1.3% growth rate that the Government is basing its figures on and the 0.5% rate that is being forecast by independent outside agencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where does the Minister of State think growth will come from?  He has mentioned a couple of items.  The Bill gives formal approval and legal basis to the increase in VAT.  The Government has decided to increase the VAT rate by 2% from 2012, rather than taking the staggered approach that was recommended under the agreement with the troika.  The VAT take was down in the last quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012.  Does the Minister of State envisage that our VAT situation will improve or disimprove?  His colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has failed to give a commitment that the reduced rates of PRSI for the hospitality sector will apply after December this year.  The Minister was probably right to question whether 6,000 jobs had been created in that sector.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s view.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to speak about a couple of the specific sections.  I gave a guarded welcome to the proposal to increase the level of mortgage interest relief provided for those who purchased property for the first time between 2004 and 2008.  I would like to hear an update on that in the context of the Keane report.  I know the Minister of State gave this House an update on it in good faith prior to the budget.  He suggested that the Government would produce a mortgage arrears implementation strategy in advance of the budget.  He referred to that as a &ldquo;bold statement&rdquo; to make in this House.  Although it was a bold statement, it has not come to fruition.  What is the Government&rsquo;s position on the publication of such a strategy?  The Minister for Finance gave a commitment in the other House that it would be published before the end of December.  When the Taoiseach met the former US President, Bill Clinton, before Christmas, he said it would be published within a matter of weeks.  He said on 8 October 2011 that the Government would make a decision in the next couple of weeks.</P>
        <P>Leaving politics aside, all of us will agree that the ongoing mortgage crisis is getting worse as people find themselves in growing arrears.  Some people say that a minimum of 8% and up to 10% of residential mortgages on principal private residences are in some level of distress.  The personal insolvency Bill will go some way towards alleviating those difficulties.  It will not go the full way.  The Minister of State has mentioned previously that the banks have been given money to write down debt.  It is a matter for them to decide how best to deal with it.  The measure the Government has introduced to increase mortgage interest relief will apply to everyone, regardless of income or mortgage situation.  Everyone will benefit from that.  The Keane report suggested that it would be better to increase the mortgage interest supplement payments that are made to people who are in difficulty.  When does the Government propose to publish the mortgage arrears implementation strategy?  Can the Minister of State give me a date for that?  This cannot continue further.  Members on all sides of the House have been raising this issue on a weekly basis in a non-partisan way.  I notice that Senator Gilroy is laughing.  I might have been a bit partisan.  All of share a genuine concern in this regard.  We really need to move on and do something in this regard.  That is covered in sections 8 and 9 of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I would like to ask a couple of questions about section 64 of the Bill, which relates to other property reliefs.  An overlooked aspect of the budget was the introduction by the Government of many new property reliefs.  In previous times, that would have been seen as a way of trying to fuel the property market.  I put it to the Minister of State that some of the exemptions that have been proposed in section 64 are designed to benefit speculators.  For example, those who retain a property for seven years or more will be exempt from capital gains tax.  Most of those properties would be investment properties.  Similarly, the reduction in stamp duty on commercial property will assist speculators.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, made broad-ranging changes to future property reliefs in the budget.  We all hope and pray that things will improve in the property market.  I wonder whether seven years after this Bill has been passed, we will compare these reliefs to those that were given for the valid reason of facilitating further hotel expansion.  They were badly needed at a certain time but should have been stopped within a given period.</P>

	<P>Good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I said that in the first instance.  How will we monitor the reliefs being provided for in section 64 of this Bill?  At some stage or another the position will improve.  I am concerned that we have given a speculator&rsquo;s charter on property in section 64.  The only people who are buying property are those with cash and investors.  I have no doubt we will revert to that issue tomorrow when we are not as constrained timewise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 105 provides for new rates for the health insurance levy.  There has been a 40% increase in the levy on private health insurance.  Is the Government concerned that more than 140,000 people have given up private health insurance as the cost has become prohibitive and that the public health system cannot handle that?  I am particularly interested in two items, the Minister&rsquo;s growth forecast and mortgage arrears.  I will deal with other matters in greater detail on Committee Stage and provide more clarification for Senator Fidelma Healy Eames tomorrow.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is easier to ask him to come to the House than any other Minister because he spent some time here and appreciates the work we do.</P>
        <P>To put things in perspective, as stated, last year &euro;13.4 billion was spent on health while the income tax take was &euro;13.397 billion.  There are measures in the Finance Bill that are tough on ordinary people.  It is not with any great pleasure that the Government has to introduce these measures.  However, one must look at the simple facts of the budgetary process whereby every cent and euro taken in through income tax was spent on the health service.  My view is that while there are people who knock the health service, it is not as bad as it is made out to be.  As a budget must be balanced, all one can expect from any government is that it does it in a fair and considered fashion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>

	<P>There are positive aspects to the budget and the Finance Bill, particularly in regard to the universal social charge where the exemption threshold increased from &euro;4,000 to &euro;10,000.  That exemption was most helpful to those on the lower pay scales.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I compliment the members of Cabinet on the work they did last week on behalf of the country in selling Ireland abroad and conveying the message that we are open for business.  In one week, two or three weeks ago, there were 1,000 jobs announced for Drogheda and 500 for Kinsale.  That was a week in which one could be proud to be a member of the Government.  What those jobs will mean to Haggardstown and Kinsale, west Cork, and the whole area is never considered but it was a proud day.  A priority of the Government is job creation, which is what will get us out of the financial burden.  Getting people back to work and paying their taxes supports investment and stimulates research.  That is a concept that is easy to grasp.  All Members should support that initiative.</P>
        <P>Sections 33 to 35, inclusive, deal with the important initiative of cross-Border mergers.  Section 20 which deals with farm taxation will enable the agricultural community to reach and possibly exceed the goals set by Harvest 2020.  Exports in the agricultural sector as a whole are proceeding well.  It is right and correct that the Government would support the initiative to reach the commitments outlined for Harvest 2020.</P>
        <P>Section 52 deals with royalty payments.  I am disappointed &mdash; I may be wrongly informed &mdash; there is no mention of natural resources in the section.  I wish a royalty payment would come back to the Government from recent and future fines.   Section 67 deals with tax relief on bodies that may donate to charity.  Will it lead to a Ladbroke&rsquo;s All-Ireland football final or a Paddy Power hurling final?  It would not matter to Kerry because we would win the all-Ireland no matter who sponsored it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 85 deals with an anti-avoidance tax measure.  It is quite worrying.  Of late business people have told me that banks are not giving credit to businesses and are closing them.  On the other hand, Revenue will close as many businesses, if not more, than the banks because it has become heavy-handed.  I will not ask the Minister of State to direct Revenue but I plead with him to ask Revenue in as nice a way as possible to do its best to thrash out deals with people in business rather than being heavy-handed because people are under pressure and cannot get finance to pay off Revenue directly.  I ask the Minister of State to also ask Revenue to be more lenient and to draw up agreements with businesses thus affording them an opportunity to pay.  All businesses want to pay and are willing to do so but if the rug is pulled from under them they will not have an opportunity to pay and turn themselves around.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My last question is on section 126 which follows my previous point.  It will enable Revenue to require a taxpayer who has had a significant previous tax default to provide Revenue with a bond covering fiduciary taxes.  That will be another hard pill for people struggling in business to swallow when they see a fellow down the road who has closed three or four businesses, yet sets up the following week, continues to do business for a year and a half and does a runner again.  Section 85 is recorded as an anti-avoidance measure of VAT but that Revenue should, as far as possible, reach an agreement with the genuine people about whom I talked, many of whom run family businesses that have existed for generations.  I ask Revenue to do the best it can to reach an agreement with them on repayments.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I especially welcome his opening comments on the expectation that the economy will return to full year growth.  I also acknowledge Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s comment on the ESRI&rsquo;s troubling analysis.  Is growth dependent on increasing the inequality gap?  The Government needs to pay attention to that.</P>
        <P>This afternoon I will focus my analysis of the Bill on the wider taxation code and the primary issue, the achievement of equivalence of treatment for civil partners with that of spouses in a civil marriage in the taxation code.  Can the Minister of State confirm that the Government is committed to achieving the equivalence of treatment?  If so, I argue that much more work is required on our taxation code for it to happen and for the Government to demonstrate its commitment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will start with the Bill.  I welcome a number of its provisions that seek to achieve the parity of treatment for civil partners with that of spouses within a civil marriage.  The Minister of State referred to a couple of those, for which I am grateful.  I am particularly grateful for his willingness to re-examine the tax relief for maintenance payment arrangements where civil partners live separately.  As he indicated, there have been a couple of changes in the Bill and that is terrific.  Sections 134(1)(<i>g</i>) and (<i>h</i>) have taken on board those changes and there has been a movement towards parity on those issues, which I appreciate.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that there have been other changes in the Bill and the State will now recognise the children of civil partners and the non-biological children of civil partners in some taxation matters.  For example, section 134(1)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>e</i>) have included children of a civil partner of an individual and I thank the Minister of State for these changes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also wish to note that the Bill does not include tax relief on maintenance payments for children of civil partners.  As everyone will know, when a marriage breaks down the payment of maintenance for children, from one spouse to the other, attracts tax relief for the payer.  Last July I recommended that tax relief be included on maintenance payments for children of civil partners when we debated the Finance (No. 3) Bill 2011.  I was told then that relief could not be given because under the civil partnership Act 2010 a maintenance order cannot be made against a civil partner who is not the biological parent for the support of a dependent child.  I was also told that tax law follows the general law and that is why the change could not be made.  That dictum makes perfectly logical sense but I do not understand three things.  Why are some sections of the taxation code changed to recognise the children while others are not?  What is the rationale for not placing an obligation on a civil partner to make maintenance payments to support a dependent child? Are we thinking about the children here?  Perhaps the Minister of State and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, might consider my first question.  I also ask the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to consider my second question.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will return to the primary issue and that is the achievement of equivalence of treatment for civil partners with that of spouses in a civil marriage in taxation matters.  The Bill offers some changes but one can argue that there has been a patchwork quilt approach to changing our tax laws to achieve it.  I can tell the Minister of State that a lot of patches are missing.  It would have been considerably less complex if the State had taken the decision to open the institution of civil marriage to same-sex couples rather than establish the second class institution of partnership.  We have civil partnership but there is a lot more work to be done to achieve equivalence in the tax laws and I shall mention a couple of examples.  First, the definitions of relative and family are used throughout the tax code.  These words take their ordinary meaning except when they are supplemented for the purposes of the tax code.  The ordinary meaning of these words usually turns on blood relationship or marriage.  Therefore, relatives and family of civil partners require an express reference in the tax code and a number of sections fail to do it or do it adequately.  For example, consanguinity relief has been extended to include transfers made to an individual&rsquo;s civil partner, the civil partner of a parent or the civil partner of a lineal descendent but fails to include all of the equivalent degrees of relationship that apply in marriage. It does not refer to the civil partner of a grandparent, the brother or a sister of a civil partner of a parent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill has similar omissions and I will give an example.  I referred to section 134(1)(<i>d</i>) that seeks to include civil partners in the principal private residence relief but only includes them as parents of the individual and fails to include parents or relatives of a civil partner of the individual when parents or relatives of a spouse are included.  In another example, in section 134(1) the payment of an annuity to a widow or widower is extended to a surviving civil partner but a tax credit available to a widowed parent has not been extended to a surviving civilly partnered parent.  Gentlemen and my fellow women colleagues can see that it gets a bit complex and technical.</P>
        <P>There were recommendations accepted and noted in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech such as tax relief on civil partner maintenance payments.  As they were accepted I would have thought that other sections of the Taxes Consolidation Act might have been amended in the Bill too.  Other sections of the Act, that relate to tax relief on dissolution, are sections on capital gains tax for the transfer of assets on dissolution, capital acquisitions tax and stamp duty on transfers and the deferral of tax on share options.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Prior to the introduction of civil unions in the UK in 2004, the Labour Government there conducted an audit of every Bill to ensure civil partners were included where necessary.  If parity of treatment is the stated goal of the Government, then I call for a similar exercise to be conducted here.  I have a legal opinion from a tax expert which I am happy to make available to the Department to assist in this process.  I have highlighted several gaps in the legislation on the advice I have received.  However, will civil partnership ever be fully equivalent to civil marriage in the tax code if omission after omission persists in successive Finance Bills?  Will the Minister look at my concerns from the Government&rsquo;s perspective and consider amending the Bill on the basis of a comprehensive audit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of the State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to the House.</P>
        <P>Ireland has experienced the most severe recession in the history of the State.  Some of this is as a result of international difficulties but some of our difficulties are the result of domestic mistakes made in the past.  I am not going to dwell on what other Governments did or did not do or whether the neo-liberal economic model has failed us, although I note our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues are not here.  Rather I am going to talk about some aspects of the Bill which will improve Ireland&rsquo;s economic future and its measures designed to provide relief for some of the worst hit in our society.  I will also make several suggestions for changes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The most significant change in this budget is the removal of 330,000 workers from the payment of the universal social charge.  Most of these will be in part-time and low-paid employment.  It is an important measure not just because it benefits many who most need this relief but it makes the return to part-time work more economically beneficial and helps economic recovery.</P>
        <P>The Government has also honoured its promise to ensure when it comes to the base rate of tax that no one is worse off than on 31 November 2011.  The VAT rate has increased but not on the price of basic food, domestic fuels, children&rsquo;s clothes and shoes while the Government has protected basic welfare payment rates.</P>
        <P>The Minister outlined some of the positive indicators of an improved outlook for the economy and the restored confidence in us as a country in which to do business.  However, the international uncertainty over the future of the euro and the sluggishness of the international economy is a factor which is holding this country back.  The resolution of the euro crisis is critical for Ireland which is a small, open and export-driven economy and stands to gain most from a return to some form of normality.  This Finance Bill, therefore, must not only deal with the current crisis and challenges but must also place us in a position to capture the recovery which will inevitably come.  Whether the measures in this Finance Bill achieve this is the ultimate measure of its success or otherwise.</P>
        <P>There are several provisions in this Bill which will help with Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  The special assignee relief programme, SARP, has been broadly welcomed in industry.  It is essential we attract key individuals in large organisations to locate in the Irish branch of their parent operation.  Significant international research shows that as much competition happens within large multinational organisations as happens between them.  Branches compete with each other for functions, particularly the location of research and development.  Making it easier and more attractive to locate key staff in Ireland is a critical factor in helping foreign direct investment to flow in Ireland&rsquo;s direction.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister has put in place measures to ensure Irish nationals who previously emigrated are not excluded from this scheme and he will be keeping it under review.  It is also important we review similar schemes such as those in the Netherlands and ensure we are at the races so to speak, although Cheltenham is not on this week.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the foreign earnings deduction for employees assigned from Ireland as part of their employment to the BRIC countries.  This measure will help Irish indigenous export-led companies to get a foothold in these significant emerging markets, many of which have not suffered from the international recession to the same extent as our traditional trading partners.  The encouragement of indigenous export companies is critical to job creation particularly when the return on jobs created is six times what it is for a foreign company located here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also welcome the changes to the capital gains tax, CGT, and capital acquisitions tax, CAT, rates from 25% to 30% as a move in the right direction.  I particularly welcome the change to the CGT rate.  The low rate of CGT contributed significantly to the culture of easy money in this country during the Celtic tiger years and was a significant driver in the speculation on the property market which, as we know, drove up prices to almost ten times the average industrial wage.  It is well known that well placed individuals invested sums as low as &euro;10,000 as booking fees on developments and turned over contracts as house prices rose, making returns as high as ten times their investment.  These properties were ultimately bought by some of the people worst hit by the mortgage crisis in Ireland today.  While I accept we must reward risk, particularly the type of risk that leads to job creation, we cannot tax a fair day&rsquo;s work at higher rates than we reward speculators.  Taxing a man or a woman who works an extra day at a higher rate than what is charged on unearned income does not contribute to an enterprise culture.</P>
        <P>I welcome the measures in the Bill to help those who purchased their homes between 2004 and 2008 by giving them greater mortgage interest tax relief.  I would have preferred a more targeted measure and to have included those who had bought not just their first homes in this period.  Many people upgraded from apartments to moderate family homes by necessity during these years and are indeed the worst hit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister give serious consideration to the position of those who are in rent-to-rent situations?  This group includes those who bought during the boom but for various reasons have been forced to move for employment reasons or because they bought small apartments initially and now require a family home.  We now have the ludicrous situation where such a family pays tax on any rental income received that exceeds the allowable deductions, also pays the non-principal private residence charge, is no longer entitled to mortgage interest relief and, depending on their lending institution, loses the benefit of a tracker mortgage.  Moreover, this family also pays rent but gets little or no relief on rent paid.  I am confident the tax code never intended such a situation.  Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, address this inequity?  The matter could be resolved by changing the mortgage interest relief rules and the definition of principal private residence.  Pressure should be brought to bear on those banks in State control to ensure the terms of mortgages on what are in reality principal homes cannot be open to change in situations such as I have outlined.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">We all accept that banks should not be allowed to use any excuse possible to get borrowers off tracker mortgages.  People trapped in rent-to-rent situations cannot move on until we deal with the wider mortgage crisis, a fact we must recognise.  The Bill contains measures to stabilise the property market.  It is now beginning to be accepted that the market has overcorrected.  For all of those home owners both in negative equity and arrears, a real line can never be drawn in the sand until the property market stabilises.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reduction in stamp duty on commercial property transactions from 6% to 2% will stimulate demand for commercial property and, perhaps, the construction sector.  The availability of good quality commercial property is important in the context of an expanding economy.  The capital gains tax incentive available on purchases to 31 December 2013 will perhaps stimulate demand for investment property.  The requirement to hold the property for seven years to benefit from the allowance will discourage the type of speculation to which I referred.  It is ironic that many of those who suggest measures to stabilise the market are preventing it from reaching its natural bottom and are the same people who claimed, when it was spiralling out of control, that we should not interfere in it on the way up.</P>
        <P>The real difficulty in generating demand in the housing market is the lack of available finance.  Recent figures show that mortgage lending is down to 1971 figures. The Minister for Finance has taken action with the pillar banks but the fact remains that we may have to consider more innovative action in this area.  We need new forms of lending institutions specifically geared to middle income earners and small businesses to bridge the very obvious gap in available finance.  There is every reason to be concerned at current trends in which we have almost 100,000 households on the housing waiting lists, rents in urban areas beginning to rise again and the construction sector fallen to a level where we risk losing the capacity we require when we experience recovery.  Let us hope history does not repeat itself.</P>
        <P>I also want to see an urgent change to the VAT laws relating to charities and that carbon taxes will be ring-fenced.  This country has a sad history of creating levies that last forever.  I look forward to the wider debate on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for the material he sent me this morning in his role over the Office of Public Works, OPW, on how to appraise capital projects.</P>
        <P>I agree with section 1&rsquo;s removal of people earning between &euro;4,000 and &euro;10,000 per annum from the scope of the universal social charge, USC, but most of sections 2 to 141, inclusive, are debatable.  For instance, will section 64 restart the property problem?  Section 52 benefits the aircraft leasing industry.  Why was that judged to be particularly meritorious?</P>
        <P>The problem is that our tax system grew.  The Minister of State has brought us 324 pages.  If we continue in this vein, there will be thousands of pages in the Government&rsquo;s lifetime.  When the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, was present, we made the point that these tax expenditures &mdash; interest groups negotiated tax deals for themselves with the Department of Finance &mdash; should have been appraised fully in the comprehensive public expenditure review.  They are taking a considerable amount of money out of the Exchequer.  People make the case that making movies or leasing aircraft will be meritorious and so on.  They get a tax break while the rest of society suffers and the tax system becomes so full of holes that it is like a colander.  We should ask the IMF to review our system.  It is a major obstacle to the country&rsquo;s growth, given that it is full of fiscal privileges and loopholes.  A large tax lawyer and tax accountant industry produces nothing and transfers money out of the Exchequer and into the pockets of clients.  The system is highly inequitable because the average citizen cannot afford the services of these tax lawyers and accountants.  It is a complete mess.  We must reform it.  As is stated on page 10 of the IMF agreement of April 2011, we will raise the tax burden by &euro;10 billion by 2015.  It would be a good idea to reform the tax system and remove the inequities, anomalies and so on.</P>
        <P>What should a good tax system be like?  When the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, was in the House last week, he referred to Adam Smith in terms of competition.  According to Smith, a tax system should possess horizontal and vertical equity, neutrality and certainty and be evidence-based and administratively efficient.  Large chunks of the Finance Bill infringe on all of these desiderata.  There is a widespread belief among economists that a tax system should have low rates without deductions and waivers, should not distort resource allocation and should not involve large administrative burdens, for example, the many pages in the Bill before us.  Let us try to simplify matters.  This should be the last of the old-style Finance Bills.</P>
        <P>We confer significant tax breaks on those who can afford tax lawyers and accountants.  This is inequitable and cumbersome and distorts the economy.  Deputy Broughan asked the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, about the fiscal privilege to the construction industry, which amounted to approximately &euro;2 billion over two years.  Do we not regret every penny that we invested in the construction industry through tax breaks when the money was needed in the Exchequer?  Is research and development the new bubble?  We do not know what the results of our investment therein will be.</P>
        <P>It was reported today that the UK Government will introduce a general anti-avoidance rule, GAAR, in the tax code, as recommended in a recent report by Graham Aaronson, QC, to crack down on abusive tax avoidance schemes.  One of last weekend&rsquo;s Sunday newspapers told of rock stars in a &euro;1.2 billion tax dodge by putting properties in the UK into offshore companies.</P>
        <P>Sections 122 to 130, inclusive, relate to compliance.  We must crack down on this industry.  Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins, a member of the income tax commission, writing in Professor John O&rsquo;Hagan&rsquo;s book on the Irish economy, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">In 2010 a minimum effective tax rate of 30 per cent of income was set for earners with incomes of more than &euro;250,000 in an attempt to minimise their use of tax breaks to reduce their tax bills. &mdash; a 30 per cent rate is equivalent to the tax level faced by a PAYE worker earning &euro;55,000 ... While there is merit in the provision by government of certain tax breaks, the evidence for many is limited and in some cases it is clear that they lead to unnecessary and arbitrary market distortions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regret that the Bill contains more such breaks.  The Tax Commission stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">We recommend that for all future tax expenditures, and reforms of tax expenditures, there should be an <i>ex ante </i>evaluation process in advance of decisions to implement or extend any tax expenditure.  As part of this process, the costs and benefits of the proposal should be assessed and the alternative of a direct expenditure approach should be considered.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If a proposal is so good, why does the Minister for X not put money from his or her budget into it?  Why must it go to the Department of Finance to get a tax break when, in many cases, we do not know the cost?</P>
        <P>According to another paper that Dr. Collins wrote, 28 tax expenditures relate to enterprise, but only in the case of 12 do we publish the cost.  In the case of 20 of 28 expenditures, we do not know the number of beneficiaries.  Twenty-eight tax expenditures relate to employment, but we have no costings for ten and no published numbers of beneficiaries for nine.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The tax system must be taken apart during the Government&rsquo;s term of office.  It is the fruit of lobbying.  The accountancy profession is resisting being brought within the terms of the new anti-lobbying legislation.  The system is the fruit of clientelism in politics, where people go up the back stairs at the Department of Finance to negotiate.  We never quantify these expenditures, the result of which is a tax system in which average workers pay more than higher earners.  This is a problem that we must address.  A candidate in the US presidential election, Mr. Romney, is very rich and could not get into the average worker&rsquo;s tax rate even if he wanted to.  We must tackle our tax shelters and fiscal privileges.  They are significant.  In Dr. Collins&rsquo;s estimate, 131 reliefs cost &euro;11.5 billion in tax revenue forgone each year.</P>
        <P>Each individual group will claim it is wonderful because, for example, it leases aircraft.  After a group receives support in the Department of Finance, the burden falls elsewhere and we get into trouble in terms of special needs assistants, SNAs, carer&rsquo;s allowance, DEIS schools and so on.  We must end this dreadful form of fiscal privilege, which is embodied in all of the sections of this legislation without any of the analysis that the Minister of State promotes.  We should have put these tax expenditures and the way we organise our tax system firmly under IMF review.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The people who make films believe their movies are wonderful.  The commission stated that they were not, given that they cost a great deal of money with little benefit.  This separate Exchequer is damaging the country, but I will comment on that matter later.  This should be the day when we say that never gain will we have such a Finance Bill.  We want a system that is simple and equitable and does not have tax lawyers or accountants.  The way in which rich people in Ireland do not pay taxes is not equitable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have noted Senators&rsquo; comments and will refer to them as I proceed.  Given the point at which we are in our economic cycle and the state of our finances, I compliment the Government on a number of the Bill&rsquo;s elements, but we should consider other measures to ensure greater equity and fairness in society in order that people can stay afloat.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Government on its focus on budget cuts rather than job-destroying tax increases. The Finance Bill confirms that budget 2012 focused on spending measures, not tax.  While there are spending cuts to services that every citizen will feel, at least people with incomes know that they will be able to take those incomes home.  It was a difficult achievement.  Similarly, the social welfare recipient was guaranteed that he or she would take home the same income.  That the Bill does not contain further income tax impositions is welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien asked the Minister of State to comment on where the growth could be found in the Bill.  I read it to identify the measures that will promote growth and capture the recovery.  The first measures I would point to are those aimed at supporting small and medium enterprises.  Key supports for this sector include foreign earning deductions to support companies which promote Irish exports to Brazil, Russia, India and China &mdash; the BRIC countries.  If we do not export, we will be in trouble.  We are a small open economy on the western fringe of Europe.  We are totally reliant on alliances and trade.  This is good news.  The three year period of tax relief for start-up companies is being extended to 2014, which should help to boost the population of entrepreneurs in this country.  This is a critical measure because small to medium sized enterprises, SMEs, are the backbone of this country.  The amendment and commencement of the employment and investment incentive will help SMEs to raise investments over and above the limits that applied under the previous business expansion scheme.  This will give companies an incentive to find capital.</P>
        <P>Three new measures are aimed at boosting research and development activities.  I was surprised to hear Senator Barrett ask for proof that research and development is going anywhere.  When we look at some of our top technology companies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Barrett spoke about the aircraft leasing sector, which is very important to our trade links with China.  Nine of the top ten aircraft leasing companies in the world have bases in Ireland, more than 3,000 aircraft valued at &euro;83 billion are leased out of Dublin and the sector contributes &euro;300 million in corporation tax annually and supports 2,000 jobs.  It is worth a bit of an incentive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Government for its seven key supports for farmers and the agrifood sector.  It is great to see agriculture coming into its own as the new, sexy industry.  The world needs food and Ireland can feed 36 million people.  We need to ensure people are educated and up to date in that area and tax incentives are worthwhile in this regard.</P>
        <P>Before I conclude, I draw attention to areas in which we need to make progress.  The price of diesel is creating a burden on consumers and the transport sector.  In regard to salary caps, it is pathetic to see Richie Boucher walk away with a package of more than &euro;800,000.  We should introduce legislation to prevent that from happening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should implement the split mortgages measure proposed in the Keane report.  That measure alone offers the means to help people hold onto their homes.  Nothing is more dignified than having a home.  Why would we put these people on the street in order that they become a burden on the State?  Let us do something just.  It is the one matter on which the Government will be judged and I want to be part of a Government that helps people to stay in their homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Barrett noted that the Finance Bill 2012 comprises 324 pages.  It will cost each household in this country &euro;2.50 per page, or &euro;800 per year.  That has not been mentioned in the succession of praise for all the great things we are doing for job creation.  Let us compare the cost of these measures to the &euro;1.3 billion bill for Irish households.  The special assignee relief programme is a tax break costing &euro;5 million.  The foreign earning deduction is worth &euro;1.5 million.  The renewable energy deduction is worth &euro;1 million.  New start-up companies will get corporation tax breaks worth &euro;5 million.  The research and development tax credit is worth &euro;5 million, as is the stock relief.  While I agree with Senator Barrett that many of these credits are probably unnecessary, even a supporter of them should question their value in the overall scheme of things if, as the Senator noted, they only serve to complicate the tax code.</P>
        <P>I welcome the &euro;52 million that families will be allowed in mortgage interest relief but the &euro;570 million bill for VAT has not been mentioned.  Only Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Zappone referred to the ESRI study which found that the greatest reduction in income is a fall of 2% and 2.5% for the poorest 40% of households.  This compares with a fall of close to 1% for the next 40% and only 0.8% for the top 20%.  I hope the Labour Party is proud.  We were constantly accused of pandering to the wealthy and looking after our so-called friends but our budgets have been shown to be progressive.  Those who could afford it paid the most but the opposite is now the case.  Every household will be paying &euro;800 per year.  I include the household charge in this figure but that tax is only a sideshow compared to the increases in VAT, petrol and diesel prices and inheritance tax for ordinary families.</P>
        <P>The ESRI has stated this is a regressive budget.  VAT is the most regressive tax one can levy.  People will pay larger bills for ordinary purchases.  Last year, the Government reduced VAT on a small range of services as part of its jobs initiative.  It paid in part for a VAT reduction in newspapers.  The fact that on the anniversary of the Moriarty report no reporter drew attention to the Taoiseach appearing in the company of Denis O&rsquo;Brien on numerous occasions during his visit to America suggests that the Government got a good deal on its VAT reduction.  Let us call a spade a spade.  Ordinary families are facing a 2% increase instead of a break.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some families may benefit from the mortgage reliefs.  Other speakers referred to the Keane report but progress has not even been made on the proposals on split mortgages contained in a report released three months before the previous Government left office.  Senator Barrett is correct that various sectors are getting something small out of the budget in order that the Government and lobbyists can pretend it is great for the economy.  It is only good for the lobbyists and advisers who can claim they achieved something big, but it is peanuts in the overall scheme of things.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was a great deal of boasting about the universal social charge but what was given to part-time workers was taken away in social welfare.  It is all spin and the families of Ireland are seeing the effect on their pockets, if not in their pay packets.  I accept that the Government has to increase taxes but why does it not do so on a fair basis?  We cannot continue to allow the rich to get away with it.  The only breaks in this Bill are for businesses, aircraft leasing and the sale of commercial property.  Why not give the ordinary family a bit of a break?  Come up with something that benefits families rather than the vested interests that seem to have more control over this country than they had before.</P>
        <P>We will be opposing this Bill and we will examine it section by section to find out why certain measures were included, what effect they will have and why the ordinary family is not getting a break.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Senator needs to refresh his memory.  The cutbacks he outlined were required because of the mismanagement of the economy by his own party.  Perhaps if previous Governments had been more careful we would not be in this position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Finance Bill 2012 and look forward to a healthy and robust debate on its contents.  It is widely accepted by most reasonable commentators that the legislative content of the Bill will go a long way towards implementing the pro growth measures the country requires.  I am sure Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and I will find plenty to agree on in the Bill.  However, I am afraid both the Minister of State and I will be a great disappointment to Senator Barrett.  I welcome his mention of the general anti-abuse rules of the United Kingdom.  This is something in which I have a great interest and I hope we can have a fuller debate on that at a later date.  It would be worthwhile and the Government would look favourably on such a debate.</P>
        <P>The Bill increases the exemption threshold from &euro;4,000 to &euro;10,000 for over 30,000 people and they are now no longer required to pay the universal social charge.  This must be welcome, even to the most negative among us.  We also note the new rate of mortgage interest relief of 30% in respect of qualifying interest paid by those who took out their loans between 2004 and 2008, at the height of the housing bubble.  I seem to remember a Minister of State with responsibility for housing exhorting people in February 2008 in a press release to buy a house, saying it was a great time to do so.  A few months later, the housing market collapsed.</P>
        <P>To support businesses, we have put in place mechanisms whereby new companies may be exempt from corporation tax for the first three years of their trading income.  This is welcome.  We welcome the fact that key employees engaged in research and development activities can avail of a reduction in their income tax liabilities also, thereby supporting and extending a vibrant research and development sector in the country.  This is an area in which we have made changes with regard to copyright, patents and trademarks and we are putting in place an infrastructure whereby Ireland can become and remain an attractive place for such investment.  Over half of the world&rsquo;s leading financial services companies have an Irish base, creating over 30,000 jobs and contributing approximately &euro;2 billion to the Exchequer every year.  This Bill puts in place a range of incentives that will ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place for this important sector.</P>
        <P>An important part of Ireland&rsquo;s recovery is investment in a strong and vibrant green economy.  The Bill provides numerous incentives to ensure that the green economy is supported and expanded.  In a move to ensure that the tax base is more evenly distributed and that the tax burden does not fall disproportionately on labour, the Government has decided to increase the standard rate of VAT to 23%.  This is in line with moves by other countries throughout Europe.  KPMG has pointed out that the average standard rate of VAT across the European Union was 25% until recently.  We see this in the context of a reduction in the standard rate of VAT to 9% across certain sectors of our economy that has helped to drive growth, especially in the area of tourism.  We see the evidence of this in the increased tourist figures from last year.  An increase in capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax goes some way towards ensuring that those in society who have the most will contribute most in terms of our economic recovery.  Everyone here would agree that is right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have a lot more to add to this debate at a later stage, but I will finish for now.  Suffice to say, the Bill gives effect to measures that will ensure the economy will recover.  All fair minded sectors in the House will agree that the Government strategy for economic recovery is working, albeit slowly and painfully.  The measure of the recovery must be seen in the progress we are making towards regaining our decision making power over our economic processes.  When we came into government last year, our international reputation was poor, we lacked political stability and it seemed we were at the bottom of an abyss.  Now 12 months later, confidence has returned, our reputation has been re-established and our political system is stable. We see evidence of this when we look at the interest rates being charged on our debt.  Ten-year money is now reduced to 7% from close to double that last year.  The measure of our independence is an ability to return to the financial markets, to borrow at sustainable rates and to control our economic destiny.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the Bill.  My daughter, Gillian, studied under Senator Barrett in Trinity College and graduated in 1988, one of a group of 38.  The day after her graduation, 37 of the group emigrated.  Those who talk about how difficult times are now &mdash; I agree times are difficult &mdash; should be reminded that we have gone through difficult times in the past.  What happened after 1988 was that we got it right in the following years and by 1992, we employed far more people.  I believe we can do the same now.  The reason we got it right then was that we decided to take the tough decisions.  We must take tough decisions now too.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is interesting to see that others around Europe are beginning to recognise we are taking tough decisions.  I am involved in an organisation in Brussels and go there regularly.  It was clear five, six or seven years ago that there was great regard for Ireland, but we lost respect in the past few years.  We are now beginning to get that respect back because of the tough decisions we are taking.  Recently, the intelligence unit of <i>The Economist</i>  has suggested that Ireland will create 20,000 jobs in the next three years and that 50% of those jobs will be in the financial services sector and another 25% in the IT sector.  The intelligence unit suggests the reason for this is that we are taking the tough decisions.  It is very easy for us to criticise a finance Bill that lists what we must do, but back in the 1980s we took those tough decisions.  Some of the credit must be given to the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government.  At the time, the leader of Fine Gael, Alan Dukes, said that if the Government took the tough decisions, he would support them.  We need the Opposition to do the same now.</P>
        <P>I would like to focus on some proposals of the Bill.  The Irish Credit Bureau gives information to lenders to help financial institutions decide whether to give credit to a business or individuals.  One positive aspect of this is that the credit bureau also compiles positive information, such as the fact that loan repayments have been made on time.  However, along with the compilation of information from financial institutions, it does not compile information from retailers, trade creditors or utility companies.  Some, including the World Bank, have highlighted this as a deficiency in our system.  We need to include this further picture when a business or individual applies for credit and should consider doing something about this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also wish to mention the special assignee relief programme.  This programme aims to cut employers&rsquo; costs in hiring skilled workers from overseas to work in their Irish-based operations.  Employees who signed up for at least one year and a maximum of five years will be exempt from income tax on 30% of their salaries, between &euro;75,000 and &euro;500,000.  As an employer, I am concerned that this will create some resentment in the workplace.  We have already seen some resentment at the high salaries being paid to some people.  I am also concerned that we will still find it hard to compete with other countries such as Holland and Malta, which have much more competitive schemes in place.  For example, Malta offers a personal tax rate of 15% in certain skilled areas of the financial services sector.  Should we not be looking to attract such talent in order to build up the financial services sector, which is of such importance?  Can the Minister of State be more specific with regard to the types of workers he wants to introduce through this programme?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Is it possible we can do something about providing more research and development tax credits for food and marine research?  We have significant potential in the food, agriculture and marine research area.  The number of agricultural colleges and the number of students in them are increasing.  We supply baby formula worldwide.  Did the Minister of State see the figures recently which indicate that one in five Chinese children receive Irish baby formula?  However, we need more investment in new agricultural techniques.  We also need to consider areas such as food research.  Can we attract more foreign direct investment to make Ireland a centre of excellence in food research?  I am involved in the institute of food and health in UCD where there is significant work going on behind the scenes.  There are great links between the institute and the agricultural university in China.  The Swiss food giant, Nestl&eacute;, employs 5,000 people directly on research and development around the world.  Can we establish similar centres or even attract them here with incentives?  It would be worthwhile because the investment is very good.  I know the Government is doing something about it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There are approximately 44 other things I wanted to say but I will touch on one thing I brought up before, namely, crowd-funding whereby people pledge investments online to new start-ups.  That has a great future.  It is now worth $2 billion per year in the United States.  I called on the Government to set up a new national network which could tap into the great finances available from the Irish Diaspora, especially in the United States.  I know the Government is doing something about it but we need to look at regulation in this area should we let it grow.  Currently, websites are mainly used as fund-raising vehicles for small projects, such as a simple invention or an exhibit.  Investors can donate as little as &euro;10 and, typically, receive a small thank you.  Can we do something more?  I believe it is possible to do so.  In October in the United States, a North Carolina Republican Congressman with a lovely name, Patrick McHenry, introduced a Bill aimed at helping small businesses to raise capital in a challenging economy.  One measure in that Bill was that one could sell securities through crowd-funding websites.  It is worthwhile looking at that.  They are some suggestions to ensure this Bill, which I support, is capable of being improved.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the debate on the Finance Bill 2012.  It is always one of the interesting set-piece debates in the Oireachtas.  A five minute contribution does not allow Members to go into any great detail on the Bill but the Minister of State will hear ideas and suggestions which may not end up in the Bill but which can be reflected on and planned for future inclusion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We said previously in this House that every Bill which comes before us should be jobs-proofed.  In other words, we should ask ourselves if the passage of the Bill results in more people going to work or more people going onto the dole queues.  We hope that as a result of the budgetary measures taken by the Minister of State and his Government colleagues, the incentive for people to go to work will be enhanced and the opportunities for employers to create work will be increased.  However, the jury is still out on this legislation and it is only with time that we will be able to look back and know what the jobs result is.  I certainly hope it will be positive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Notwithstanding my strong support for the Bill and, in particular, the Government&rsquo;s general economic management policies since its assumption of office last March, I am a little concerned about the VAT increases.  It is not rocket science to suggest history clearly shows that from an economic perspective, increased taxation might bring short-term gains but in the long term, it does not create jobs and economic activity.  When the Minister, Deputy Noonan, reduced the VAT rate for the tourism sector in what I suppose was called a &ldquo;mini-budget&rdquo; last year, it worked and it put people back to work.  I appreciate as much as anyone in the House the dreadful economic figures with which the Government must deal.  One must balance one&rsquo;s books as best one can and one must then borrow all these billions of euro to achieve the bottom line.  Extra taxation was required but the VAT option should always be the last one.  It is simple to think up and simple to collect but it does not provide a great incentive for the consumer to spend and when the consumer does not spend, everyone suffers and the dole queues are lengthened.  I hope the Minister of State and his officials will revisit the VAT issue at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of my colleagues mentioned the price of petrol and diesel on the Order of Business today and its impact on agriculture, in particular.  It is, of course, as a result of the excise changes which, unfortunately, were necessary in the budget.  On budget night, we have the political and legal capacity to introduce a change to the price of petrol and diesel the following morning.  It might be a long shot but will the Minister of State consider a reduction in the excise rate on fuel to try to reduce the price of petrol and diesel for those three or four important summer months for agriculture and for tourism months when we hope people will holiday in Ireland, use their cars to travel around the country and spend whatever few euros they have at home rather than abroad?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Motoring costs are now a huge financial burden on every family.  We must move beyond this idea of motoring being a luxury and that it is somehow so damaging to the environment that we must penalise every motorist in the country.  Motoring and motorists are necessary to keep our economy moving, if one will excuse the pun.  Will the Minister of State consider the idea of a short-term reduction in the excise rate on fuel in the three or four summer months to give people an incentive to use their cars to drive to a local restaurant, a local hotel or a local shop to spend whatever few euro they have and to send a message to tourists from abroad who are coming to Ireland with their cars that it is relatively cheaper to drive in Ireland than in the rest of the European Union?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Not surprisingly the House is again debating the household charge, as I am sure is the Minister of State&rsquo;s House.  I refer to his political House rather than domestic house as I am sure his domestic household charge bill has already been paid.  Over the years, various Governments set up commissions on taxation to look at the taxation system.  We must all accept that we have to broaden the tax base.  I accept that what I said about VAT perhaps negates this argument but we need to broaden the tax base and to have a mature debate on taxation.  My colleague, Senator Noone, made a very interesting suggestion on the Order of Business today that every taxpayer should receive a certificate at the end of the year indicating how much tax he or she paid, although we get that by way of our P60 or P21, and where his or her tax moneys were spent, including what percentage was spent on health, education and so on.  By educating the public more on how much it costs to run the country, how much taxes come in, how much money goes out and how much we are borrowing, it would help us to have a mature debate on taxation.</P>
        <P>I am not sure what the Government is planning in regard to a commission on taxation scenario but it would be healthy and helpful to the democratic process to have a debate on taxation, including on property tax, capital tax, wealth tax, income tax and on every possible tax so that the pros and cons of all those taxation methods could be looked at.  We did not need the IMF or the EU but we were too cowardly to recognise that our tax base was not broad enough and that new revenue raising measures would have to be taken on board.</P>
        <P>My final point in this inadequate contribution is that we have interesting debates on the budget and on the Finance Bill but then the whole issue disappears for 12 months.  For 20 years, the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, said that we needed a lengthy budgetary debate.  It would be great if, even before the summer, we started the debate on next year&rsquo;s budget and on the choices, options and the range of possibilities in regard to taxation and expenditure.  It should be more than a one day, a one week or a fortnight debate because it is of such fundamental importance to everybody in this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We had a different type of budget this year with the two-day budget with the two Ministers.  That was a small step forward but we need a much more expanded budgetary debating process in the Houses, in the Government and in the Department, in order that all the choices are put on the table and we can see the colour of everybody&rsquo;s money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to have such an audience for my contribution.  I am sure everybody will listen intently to what I have to say.</P>
        <P>It is now over a year since the Government was sworn in, elected on a promise that things would change and improve.  Earlier speakers spoke of the road to recovery but I am not sure I share their enthusiasm.  Are we are not still on the road to some sort of ruin?  To a large extent we have seen some of the same failed policies of the past being implemented.  This Finance Bill has been cited as incontrovertible proof that there is not a great deal of interest in, or much intention of, bringing about change in how we manage our economy, create sustainable economic growth and distribute the wealth of the State to bring about genuine economic equality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As we all know, this Bill is about implementing last year&rsquo;s budget.  Economic Thatcherism is being perceived as a choice, not as arising from necessity.  The Government is perfectly happy to impose austerity because that will see us signing up to the austerity treaty and making austerity part of our national law.  In recent days, my party has shown how the blackmail argument is merely a convenient choice of the Government in order to link to the treaty when it could actually veto the link between the austerity treaty and access to the ESM.  I call on the Government to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For many people, what is disappointing is not the bowing down to international capital in terms of the Anglo Irish Bank incident or the austerity treaty but the complete lack of change in political culture.  The Government can argue it has had no choice on the big economic issues and some people will believe that.  Undeniably, however, there are things that could have been changed but were not.  I refer, for example, to the continued practice by the Government of breaking its own rules on pay to special advisers.  Party hacks earn enormous money from the public purse and there are additional allowances for Ministers of State.</P>
        <P>There are aspects of this Bill I welcome, for example, the increase in capital gains and acquisition taxes.  We support these moves and regret they do not go further.  One area of particular concern, however, is the VAT hike, from 21% to 23%.  I find the short-sightedness of this policy extremely frustrating.  Coming from a Border county I know the effect this will have on already struggling Border towns and businesses.  Partition is a significant cause of economic displacement and inefficiencies and Border counties already bear the brunt of this.  Raising VAT by 2% will take a further toll on businesses in counties such as Cavan.  That is why in my amendments I will try to remove that hike in VAT from the Finance Bill and I call on all representatives from the Border area to support me in this attempt.  VAT is a regressive tax.  Crucially, it hits the spending power and disposable income of ordinary people which will result in a further drop in retail sales.  It will detrimentally affect domestic demand.  The rhetoric about progressive taxes and making those who can pay most pay, trumpeted by Government parties when they were in opposition, has long since gone out the window.  This Bill does not do anything to create the fair tax system we need.  Regressive flat taxes have once again been championed over progressive taxes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The removal of 300,000 people from the universal social charge net is also welcome.  However, the USC remains a crippling rock around the necks of most working families.  Again, it is an unfair, blanket flat tax that was imposed in a panic by the last Government and again the present Government continues a policy of Fianna F&aacute;il in supporting its retention.  The social effects of this conservative economic dogma will be brutal.  Likewise, the increase in the carbon tax charge will be another burden on struggling families and the reduction in tax credits for third level fees will copperfasten inequality into the next generation.  At the same time there is the use of the old Fianna F&aacute;il magic trick of the tax break.  The special assignee relief programme will see high-earning individuals from outside the State benefit from enormous tax breaks; they could earn &euro;635,000 tax free over five years.  Nobody should be allowed to earn that type of money without contributing.  There is nothing in the legislation about job creation.  It is a free ride and it is unjust.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has argued and will continue to argue for an alternative to austerity programmes.  We argue for a fair tax system in which those who can afford to pay more pay more and those who are least able to bear the cost are relieved to some extent.  We would remove all the 500,000 affected by the USC from the income tax net and have effective tax rates of 45.4% on income between &euro;100,000 and &euro;175,000, with 51% on income in excess of &euro;175,000.  Critically, we would move away from flat regressive taxes such as VAT.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  As a Government we must ensure we explain clearly to taxpayers where their taxes are actually going.  This move has recently been introduced in Britain; no doubt the Minister of State has heard of it.  In the UK people will be issued with personal statements detailing exactly how their taxes are being spent.  This is a simple idea although it may be complex to implement it.  We need to ensure we are communicating clearly with the public at all times.  The public has shouldered much of the burden of the economic crisis in the recent past and it is important that we explain how people&rsquo;s hard-earned taxes are being spent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a common misconception that were it not for the banking crisis we would not have a deficit but this is simply not the case.  Aside from the cost of the bailout of the banks we are spending more than we are earning.  Some clear information about the tax take and where it is being spent could help to counteract this impression.  For example, I do not believe most people are aware that about one third of all Government spending in 2010 went on social welfare.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A recent Edelman trust barometer indicated that while 77% of people want the Government to communicate honestly and frequently only 11% believe this is happening.  The British Government has decided to publish personal tax statements in order to make the tax system more transparent and easier to understand.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on the idea of the Government publishing personal tax statements.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, to the House.  I have spoken many times in the company of the Minister for Jobs, Innovation and Enterprise, Deputy Richard Bruton.  I am perplexed that he is not listening to the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, or the representatives of small and medium-sized businesses.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, recently drew our attention to the fact that this State had provided unlimited liquidity for the banks at low interest rates.  He also acknowledged that the SME sector was the main driver of job growth in the economy.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish banks were bailed out to the tune of &euro;63 billion of taxpayers' money, a move which effectively bankrupted the State.  While during the height of the Celtic tiger era the Central Bank and Department of Finance commented that the economy was overheating as a result of the property boom, they did not adequately alert the Government to this.  I call on the Governor of the Central Bank to alert the Government to the fact that there is no more liquidity available.  Irish small and medium-sized companies are finding it hard to access credit because banks are seeking collateral for loans and are applying much tougher conditions, interest rates and charges on loans.  Approximately 800,000 people, 45%, of all those in employment are employed by SMEs yet many SMEs are unable to borrow money to improve and develop their businesses.  Does anyone in the Government understand business?  It is not just an academic exercise, which is what many people believe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Jobs, Innovation and Enterprise, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, are not listening to the people who need access to credit in order for their businesses to thrive and grow, thus creating employment.  Senator Quinn frequently says that governments do not create employment.  I disagree with him.  If the Government cannot ensure the banks, which we have bailed out, make money available to businesses who then is in charge of the country?  Businesses cannot grow or expand without access to finance.  The issue of access to credit has been raised with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on many occasions during the past two months but no money has yet been made available.  The micro-finance scheme has not been put in place.  Nothing is happening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was stated last week by ISME that inflation was low because consumers were not spending.  We all know that as a result of this nothing much is happening in the economy.  The Government is responsible for our uncompetitiveness.  It is responsible for the imposition on companies of waste, rate and rent charges and transport and energy costs as a result of which we are once again losing our competitiveness.  Our competitiveness was improved by private businesses cutting back to the bone and people who work therein making sacrifices.  I call on the Governor of the Central Bank to use his authority in the bank, which is an institution of our State which has loaned &euro;63 billion to Irish-owned banks, to do something other than comment on the unavailability of credit.  There is no liquidity and the situation is dire.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I apologise for being so pessimistic but I do not see anything happening.  The Ministers, Deputies Bruton and Noonan, are not listening to the people in business.  Rather they are listening to the banks and the Irish Banking Federation.  I do not understand it.  I will continue to watch this brief closely in terms of delivery.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, to the House.  I am happy to support this Finance Bill on the basis that it delivers on a number of commitments made by the Government on taking up office, one of which was to increase mortgage interest relief to 30% for first-time buyers who purchased during the period 2004-08.  Some 270,000 people have benefitted from this change.  I also welcome the increase in mortgage interest relief to 25% for first-time buyers in 2012.  Previous speakers referred to the universal social charge, USC, exemption, the threshold for which has been increased from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 and benefits 330,000 workers.  They are significant changes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is welcome that income tax rates remain unchanged.  The Government is pro work and pro jobs and wants to ensure everyone is encouraged to remain in the workforce and to seek new employment opportunities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mary White spoke about job creation.  The Government is committed to job creation.  I believe Senator White is being a little harsh on the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  Rome was not built in a day.  While there are issues that remain to be resolved with the banks, the Minister has made significant progress.  There have been many positive changes as a result of budget 2012 which need to be highlighted, including the special assignee relief programme which targets the assignment of foreign based individuals to the Irish based operations of their employers.  This will enable Irish operations to attract key specialised personnel around which teams and processes can be built.  The modification to the research and development, tax credit is also significant, as is the introduction of the foreign earnings deduction which seeks to support companies that are promoting Irish exports to Brazil, Russian, India, China and South Africa and the extension to 2014 of tax relief for corporate investment in renewable energy.  These are all significant initiatives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recent jobs initiative ensures all Departments are working closely on the 270 actions identified.  Investor confidence is returning to Ireland.  As stated, significant job announcements have been made in recent times.  It is hoped that following the visits of various Ministers to different parts of the world we will see further significant investment in our country in the future.  Ireland is now a much more desirable place in which to invest.  Investor confidence is returning.  In addition, with regard to excise duty on petrol and diesel we are getting to the stage where the price of fuel is causing difficulty for many businesses and consumers.  Prices have rocketed in recent times and the Government needs to examine the level of taxation.  It is causing great hardship and difficulty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the fact that 25 cent was put on tobacco in the budget.  As the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, comes from a Border county he is aware of the large amount of revenue we lose because of cigarette smuggling and diesel and fuel laundering across the Border.  I do not have the figures to hand but I saw them recently and know we lose significant amounts of revenue through illegal activity with regard to cigarettes and fuel laundering.  I welcome the additional powers to investigate serious customs and excise tax offences contained in the Finance Bill.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the reference in the Bill to standards of accounting records and the under-reporting of credit card transactions.  I believe the non-reporting of online transactions by certain businesses is becoming an issue.  This is the equivalent of under the counter payments and the practice must be nipped in the bud.  The penalties should be particularly high to dissuade people from getting involved in this line of activity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to agriculture, capital gains tax retirement relief is being better targeted to encourage timely transfers of farms and businesses.  Milk quotas will be removed in 2015 and we are trying to grow the agribusiness industry.  Therefore, it is important to have timely transfers of farms from fathers to sons.  We also need to consider how to ensure land which is unlikely to be transferred to a relative in the short term can be utilised to increase our agriproduction.  We should have an incentive for people to lease such land or a measure to help grow our agribusiness.</P>
        <P>The scope of the Revenue job assist scheme is being widened to include those unemployed for more than 12 months and signing for credits.  This scheme had been accessible only to people in receipt of a social welfare payment.  I very much welcome this measure and all measures contained the Finance Bill which will help to get people back to work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus d&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis; bh&iacute; s&eacute; ar an raidi&oacute; ar maidin fighting the good fight.  It is causing great hardship and difficulty.  I wish him well in this regard.  When every Minister for Finance stands up on budget day there is a great degree of expectation among immediate supporters on the Government side and the general populous, particularly those involved in business, wait to see where the hammer will fall and the hatchet will be used.  Everyone on all sides of the House will appreciate the difficulties faced by successive Ministers for Finance since the collapse of the banking sector and the crisis of 2008, including the late Brian Lenihan and Deputy Michael Noonan.  They have had to face unprecedented challenges in framing a budget.  In this regard I would not wish to convey that we on this side of the House have been irresponsible in our opposition to some of the elements of this budget.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the current climate the question remains as to whether the line and direction taken by the Government will get us out of this period of austerity while at the same time providing a sense of hope and optimism for taxpayers and citizens.  This is the challenge.  Whether the Minister has achieved this is still being debated and discussed.  As he famously said in another context, only time will tell.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, in the current climate elements of this budget should be revisited and perhaps should not have been implemented, particularly the 2% increase in the VAT rate.  My colleague in the other House, Deputy Michael McGrath, raised this matter on a number of occasions.  The Minister of State will agree with me that any change in VAT rates have a knock-on effect on businesses in the Border counties because of the currency exchange between North and South.  We have heard much talk about the economies of scale which operate in Northern Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> its membership of the United Kingdom which make certain services and goods cheaper than they would be in the South because of our smaller market.  The concern about the 2% increase was not so much about the impact it would have in the Border counties but because domestic consumption has been flatlining and it seemed, to us at least, that such an increase would not stimulate optimism or consumption and would not encourage people to go out and spend their money.  From this point of view we do not favour it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The cry of the Government, as was the cry of the previous Government when the crisis hit, was to ask where it could get the money because it had to get it from somewhere.  The Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, has  made the point repeatedly, and I agree with him, that the gap between income and expenditure is such that there must be some way of finding it.  While our exports are thriving and roaring ahead and our balance of payments surplus is quite impressive in terms of our size relative to other European countries, and certainly in terms of where we are <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain, our domestic consumption is flatlining and this is the greatest challenge for the Government.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator White, has taken every available opportunity to raise the question of bank lending.  I am a member of the economic sub-committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly chaired by our mutual friend and colleague, Deputy Jack Wall.  Last week, an Oireachtas committee meeting heard evidence from Mr. Mark Fielding of ISME and from the Small Firms Association attached to IBEC.  We concluded we were more confused afterwards with regard to the state of bank lending in the country.  While ISME provided much evidence and quoted several instances from throughout the country of people refused loans, the Small Firms Association echoed the Government&rsquo;s view as stated in this House by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, that bank lending targets to the end of December had been met.  There is some confusion in this area.</P>
        <P LI="1">The overall strategy may well be pointing in the right direction, but all that the Department does will be of little consequence if business does not get access to sufficient levels of working capital.  If it is not available then the economic recovery will wither on the vine.  The key responsibility for the Department is to deliver increased bank lending rates to SMEs.  The commitment from the banks to increase levels of bank lending represents a step in the right direction.  The only reliable assessment of the banks&rsquo; commitment, however, will be the level of take-up of that additional finance.  If onerous terms and conditions or high costs continue to act as deterrents to accessing that finance then the additional funds will have little, if any, effect.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This was not stated about the Irish Government; it is from a British House of Commons library document on an assessment of lending criteria and the state of bank lending in the UK.  The point I am making is that it is not unique to this country.</P>
        <P>What is common to both jurisdictions is that there will be no resumption of the economic recovery that all of us wish to happen unless capital is freed up.  Given that its entire mandate is based on economic recovery, the Government is more keen than anyone else for that to happen.  The Minister for Finance must be a cricket fan because among the many goodies that appeared in the budget was an extension to professional cricket players of the tax relief on certain income that is available to sports people when they retire.  I would be interested to know where that one came from in the Department of Finance.  The Minister of State will agree that there is always one every year.</P>

	<P>It must be a north Dublin thing.  As I said at the outset, Fianna F&aacute;il has attempted to provide responsible opposition and will continue to do so.  We believe that elements of this budgetary strategy are not in the best interests of the Irish people as they will not encourage more spending and lift the economy.  All we can do is point these matters out as we see them.  I wish the Government well in its attempts to try to get us out of where we are.  Any success it achieves in that regard will benefit all of us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Mooney that politics is about choices.  Various options are always open to any Government.  The options chosen by the Government in last December&rsquo;s budget and in the Finance Bill 2012 were the wrong ones.  I do not believe they will solve the problems in the economy or uplift the  domestic economy.  Many of the measures in question are unfair and regressive.  As a previous speaker mentioned, during a radio interview this morning the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, spoke about how people saw the household charge as unfair and unjust.  Many people are choosing not to pay the charge for that reason.</P>
        <P>I would like to deal with a number of issues that are of relevance to the Bill.  A previous speaker mentioned that the increase in the threshold for the universal social charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 will take 300,000 people outside the scope of the charge.  That suggests that too many people in this country are on low incomes.  It is shocking that so many people are earning less than &euro;200 a week.  That has to be addressed when we try to make sure people have a good quality of life and have money to spend.  If we are to ensure the retail sector is thriving, people have to be paid well.  Figures like the one I have cited show that many people are very poorly paid, which is wrong.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The universal social charge, which is a combination of the old PRSI and a number of levies, should have been scrapped because it is not a fair tax.  It was one of the most controversial taxes to be introduced by the previous Government.  At the time, it was met with consternation from all Opposition parties, including Fine Gael.  The Labour Party said it would abolish the charge, but it is still in place.  It has been modified slightly.  As a result of other changes, people are getting less in return for all the new charges they are paying.  People are paying more in terms of the universal social charge, but they are also being forced to pay private health insurance, for example.  They do not get the dental treatment they used to get under the PRSI system.  Like the Minister of State and a number of Senators, I wear glasses.  We used to get something off the price of new glasses when we bought them but that is now gone.  A raft of benefits was removed from people.  The Minister of State might not have received them, but some people did.  The point is that these benefits were removed.  The universal social charge should have been scrapped.</P>
        <P>I will deal with some of the contents of the Finance Bill 2012 before I outline some alternatives.  A number of Senators have spoken about the VAT increase.  Any increase in VAT hurts the retail sector.  Reference was made to the impact the increase is having on Border counties.  The reality is that it is having an impact across the State.  As I have said in this House previously, many small retailers have made the point to me that they are working for less than the minimum wage.  They are trying to keep their premises open in the face of decreased footfall.  Due to their self-employed status, no safety net and no benefits are available to them if they have to close their doors.  If a self-employed person has a partner who is working part-time or full-time, he or she will not receive any support from the State.  The 2% VAT increase has been a regressive step for retailers at a time when they are trying to keep going and keep people in jobs.  It has also affected shoppers and people who had less money to spend in the first place.  The introduction of the increased VAT rate was the wrong approach for the Government to take, especially in the context of all the new taxes and cuts.</P>
        <P>As part of my Second Stage speech, I would like to mention an option that will be open to the Government in the future.  With a few exceptions, no real increase in excise duty on alcohol was provided for in last December&rsquo;s budget.  There has been a great deal of debate at the Joint Committee on Health and Children about what can be done in terms of pricing to reduce alcohol consumption.  I know the Government is considering minimum pricing.  I do not support minimum pricing because I do not believe it will work.  It will simply put more money into the hands of those who sell alcohol.  If we are minded to look at pricing as a means of dealing with alcohol consumption, a much better option would be to increase excise duty on alcohol.  Such an approach would ensure that 100% of any price increase would come back to the State.  That money could be ring-fenced for prevention, treatment and education measures.  That would be far better than minimum pricing.  I ask the Minister of State to take that suggestion back to the Ministers for Health and Finance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having proposed the abolition of the universal social charge and the 2% VAT increase, it is important for me to set out some alternative means of raising funds.  We conservatively estimate that a 1% income-linked wealth tax on all assets in excess of &euro;1 million, with the exception of working farmland and business assets, would generate approximately &euro;700 million.  We are proposing that all tax reliefs be standardised.  Some tax reliefs are available at the top rate of 41%, but we suggest that all of them should be available at the bottom rate only.  That would save &euro;1 billion, which is a huge amount of money, and would be much better than the imposition of flat and regressive charges like the household charge and the universal social charge.  In addition, we estimate that the introduction of a third rate of tax &mdash; we propose it should be set at 48% &mdash; on all income in excess of &euro;100,000 would raise &euro;400 million.  That could be considered.</P>
        <P>The alternatives that are being proposed by the Opposition should be examined seriously.  The ones I have mentioned were supported by the Labour Party when it was in opposition.  I accept we have to put measures in place to reduce our deficit &mdash; some of them will be painful &mdash; but we have to make sure we do not keep coming back to low and middle-income families and people who are out of work and expect them to be able to pay.  If we go back to the same well again and again, it will not work.  We are seeing that with the household charge.  I appeal to the Government to examine other options, such as the imposition of higher tax rates on higher earners.  We are not proposing that out of spite, but out of the need to reduce our deficit.  I ask the Minister of State to reflect on our proposals in the context of next year&rsquo;s budget.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, to the House.  Like my colleague, Senator Mooney, I must begin by saying I do not envy any Minister for Finance who has to put a budget together in a difficult economic climate.  The same problems were faced by the late Brian Lenihan when he was Minister for Finance.  Regardless of what one attempts to do in the current economic circumstances, one will affect somebody.</P>
        <P>I welcome some of the measures set out in the Bill before the House, including the decision to increase the exemption threshold for the universal social charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 for the 2012 and subsequent tax years.  I would like the threshold to be increased further in next year&rsquo;s budget, if possible.  I also welcome the introduction in this legislation of an enhanced scheme of stock relief for registered farm partnerships.  The scheme, which is one of the many measures in the Bill that I welcome, fits very well into the Harvest 2020 project.  This excellent and visionary document was put together by my colleague, Deputy Smith, and is now being implemented by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to a high level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the decision to increase the price of cigarettes by 25 cent.  While I would like a larger increase to be provided for, if possible, I remind the House of the need to consider the amount of revenue being lost to the State as a result of cigarette smuggling.  I suggest that the level of excise duty on petrol and diesel should be looked at and reduced, if possible.  At a time when employment in the State is decreasing, the incidence of diesel and fuel laundering is increasing, particularly in Border counties.  This is causing huge expense to the county councils, particularly Cavan County Council and Louth County Council, where a recent find cost the council &euro;50,000 to clean up.  This is an issue we should consider enforcing even more and redeploying people from underutilised areas of the Civil Service into the prevention of diesel and petrol smuggling and laundering.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 2% VAT increase from 21% to 23% is having an effect in the town of Cavan and in the whole Border area and as Senator David Cullinane said it is having an effect throughout the length and breadth of the country.  In the Border area people travel to the North to do some of their shopping and while they are there they do the rest of it.  Throughout the rest of the country, those who do not travel across the Border are not spending as much.  The 23% VAT rate applies to a wide range of goods and services including petrol, motor vehicles, electrical supplies, furniture, adult footwear and clothing, alcohol and soft drinks, tobacco, which I welcome, accountancy and legal services and tax advisory services.  It was the Minister&rsquo;s intention to raise &euro;670 million this year but I do not think that will happen.  Based on a conversation I have had with the chairman of Cavan Chamber of Commerce, the VAT increase is having an effect in Cavan, in the Minister of State&rsquo;s county of Louth and throughout the country.  I ask that the issue be examined before the Bill is finalised.  I do not envy any Minister who has to bring in a budget in these economic circumstances but that is one area I would like to have addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Finance Bill brings into effect many of the items announced on budget day.  By reducing the deficit to 8.6% of GDP and introducing adjustment measures totalling &euro;3.8 billion in the budget, the Government is acutely aware it will have an impact on the living standards of people.  I am particularly happy, as mentioned by other speakers, that the Finance Bill met the commitment in the programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage relief to 30% for first-time house buyers who took out mortgages between 2004 and 2008.  That was a commitment given prior to the election and in the programme for Government and has been delivered upon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the decision to simplify the rules governing tax relief on charitable donations which could not come at a better time for many charities who are suffering.  The Bill provides for the implementation of many pro-growth measures for business, yet some Members said the Finance Bill did little or nothing for business.  It has promoted measures such as the partial tax exemption for employees who travel abroad to develop markets in the BRIC countries and in South Africa.  There is an improved research and development and credit regime that will benefit the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, a new income tax incentive for employees directly involved in research and development activity, a scheme for corporate investment in renewable energy and a further extension of the tax exemption for new start-up companies.  These are some of the protection and growth measures for job creation and business included in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was mention of the universal social charge which has taken about 300,000 people out of the tax net.  We have heard Sinn F&eacute;in say it was an unfair tax.  This morning it said the household charge is an unfair tax and that the VAT increase was an unfair tax.  One could say that all taxes raised by any government can be seen as unfair to the people they affect.  However, the Government is faced with the problem of balancing the books which is a difficult job at this time.</P>
        <P>There are a few areas where we could raise revenue.  The delay in introducing licensing levies on companies involved in the promotion of gambling is a matter of concern.  While a new betting Bill will be introduced later in the year, at a time when online gambling is largely tax free a greater revenue stream for the Exchequer should be raised from this source sooner rather than later.  That is a revenue stream that should be taxed.  I hope measures could be considered in the Finance Bill to introduce these levies before the introduction of the new betting Bill.</P>
        <P>I refer to a number of items raised on the Order of Business in the past month.  On the question of cigarette smuggling and fuel laundering, mentioned by Senator Wilson, there is a need for a more focused approach, the penalties for which should be increased further.  Another matter raised by Senator Quinn relates to mileage rates for public servants which encourage the use of larger cars due to the larger mileage rates on such vehicles.  Has that issue been tackled or is it the intention to tackle it?  Those items can and should be addressed in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister for Finance to the House.  He has a difficult job to do under very difficult circumstances but he is bearing up well and the finances are in good hands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been an interesting and informative debate here.  I thank Senators for their comments.  Before trying to address these, I reiterate that while the Government is taking every step to support economic recovery there is no quick fix solution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Looking towards the medium term, the external environment is expected to strengthen from 2013 onward, as is export growth.  We expect to see economic activity begin to firm and broaden out gradually from being externally driven to domestic demand also making a modest contribution.  The continuing levels of inward foreign direct investment points to the fact that many of the underlying strengths of the economy remain.  We are on track to bring the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2015.</P>
        <P>The banking system has been recapitalised and the economy returned to growth last year following three successive years of annual decline.  In short, the Government is delivering a return to sustainable growth which capitalises upon the underlying strengths of the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I turn to points raised by Senators.  Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, Zappone and Byrne raised the issue of the recent ESRI publication, Distributional Impact of Tax, Welfare and Public Sector Pay Policies: 2009-2012.  I remind Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien that the publication concluded that since the economic crisis, losses imposed by policy changes in tax and welfare have been greatest for those on highest incomes and smaller for those on low incomes.  The Senator said also that first-time buyer's measures for mortgage interest relief were not targeted.    The targeting is inherent in this measure and in mortgage interest relief itself.  First, the measure is limited to the four-year period when house prices were at their peak.  Second, the measure is limited to first-time buyers who purchased their first property in that particular period.  Third, the relief is applied to the interest on the loan and is most effective in the early years of a mortgage when the interest portion of the repayment is at its highest.  I thank Senator Gilroy for his support for this measure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of mortgage arrears is of the utmost importance to the Government.  The fact that the Government has now established a committee, chaired by the Taoiseach, to co-ordinate and oversee the implementation of a whole-of-Government response to the problem is evidence of this.  There is no single or quick solution to the mortgage arrears problem.  The Keane report outlined a number of recommendations to address the problem and work is progressing on the implementation of these as approved by the Government.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien asked about the capital gains tax property incentive scheme in section 64 of the Bill.  Senator Barrett suggested it would overheat the property market again.  I do not accept this is a speculator&rsquo;s charter.  Anyone who wishes to avail of the incentive must hold the property for at least seven years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien mentioned the health insurance scheme.  The purpose of the scheme, which was introduced by the previous Government, is to ensure health insurance remains affordable for older people by providing for an age-related tax credit to reduce the cost of premiums for older persons.</P>
        <P>Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Zappone asked about growth rates.  The budget day forecast is for real GDP growth of 1.3% in 2012.  The budget forecast was prepared on the basis of economic information &mdash; domestic and international &mdash; available up to the end of November 2011, and was mid-range at that time.  Given the very uncertain environment, the budget documentation also pointed to a number of risks to this forecast, some to the downside and some to the upside.  These risks are still valid.</P>
        <P>While there are some differences between the outside agencies&rsquo; forecasts and those of the Department of Finance, the broad picture &mdash; that is, of an externally driven recovery, with domestic demand remaining weak &mdash; is much the same.  Moreover, and notwithstanding differences in the precise numbers, the expectation among domestic and international forecasters is that GDP will continue to grow this year.</P>
        <P>Senator Zappone has made some specific comments based on legal opinion she has received on the section amending aspects of the tax code to provide the same treatment for civil partners as for married couples.  I assure the Senator that my officials and officials in the Revenue Commissioners made a very thorough examination of tax legislation to ensure equality of treatment and have provided for this in consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in so far as is constitutionally possible.  The door remains open for the submission of information in regard to any remaining perceived anomalies or shortfalls in the legislation.</P>
        <P>On some of the specific issues mentioned by the Senator, the principal private residence relief from capital gains tax has been extended to dependent relatives of civil partners, and consanguinity relief from stamp duty has been extended to cover transfers of non-residential property to civil partners and relatives of civil partners.  Both these measures were in the Finance (No. 3) Act 2011.</P>
        <P>I am glad to see that Senators Sheahan, Hayden and Gilroy welcome the changes to the universal social charge, USC.  I reassure Senator Sheahan that, in regard to section 126 and the requirement for certain taxpayers to provide a bond, Revenue is aware that, in most cases, there are legitimate reasons businesses may fall into tax arrears.  The Revenue Commissioners made considerable efforts to reach agreements with such companies where there is a possibility of continued liability.</P>
        <P>I endorse Senator Hayden&rsquo;s and Senator Gilroy&rsquo;s supportive comments, particularly in regard to areas such as research and development, SARP and FED.  I have also noted Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comments on these topics.</P>
        <P>Senator Reilly referred to individuals qualifying for the special assignee relief programme not being required to make a contribution.  For each single individual who avails of the maximum amount of relief under this programme, more than &euro;227,000 will be paid to the Exchequer in income tax, USC and PRSI revenue that might not otherwise be received.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Hayden&rsquo;s concerns about those who have found it necessary to rent out their principal residence.  As the Senator observed, these individuals would no longer be in receipt of mortgage interest relief.  However, as they are receiving rental income, they may be allowed a deduction in computing the taxable rents from that letting of 75% of the interest accruing on money borrowed to purchase, improve or repair that property.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Senator Barrett referred to the high earner&rsquo;s restriction and unfortunately quoted some figures that would seem to be in error.  This restriction applies at an adjusted income level of &euro;125,000 and where an individual claims &euro;80,000 or more in specified reliefs.  Those subject to the full restriction pay a minimum effective income tax rate of 30%.  This is in addition to PRSI and the USC, with the latter at rates of up to 10%.  The actual effective rate of income tax for an average individual taxpayer on &euro;40,000 is 15.53%.  When PRSI and USC are added, the effective rate of tax for this individual is24.17%.  Single individuals in the PAYE system would need income of almost &euro;100,000 to have an effective income tax rate of 30%.  A married couple including a single earner, also subject to PAYE, with children would need income of around &euro;150,000 before reaching an effective rate of income tax of around 31%.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Barrett&rsquo;s remarks in regard to the section 481 film tax relief scheme.  The film relief scheme was subject to a major independent review in 2007 and, contrary to Senator Barrett&rsquo;s contention, the Commission on Taxation recommended in 2009 that the relief be continued, but it recommended that it be subject to regular review.  We fully support the principle of <i>ex ante</i> and <i>ex post</i> economic impact assessments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I advise Senator Barrett that section 52 is not a tax break or a tax expenditure.  Rather, it provides for a reduction in double taxation which can arise where lease rental payments are received from countries with which Ireland does not have a tax treaty.  Section 52 extends unilateral credit relief to leasing income.  The provision will remove barriers to Irish companies conducting business with persons resident in non-treaty countries where withholding taxes apply to leasing income.  The Irish aircraft leasing industry is one of the big success stories of the IFSC, which employs more than 30,000 people and contributes over &euro;1 billion to the Exchequer in corporation and payroll taxes.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">On the Senator&rsquo;s point on anti-abuse rules, section 811 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 sets out our approach on this issue.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Healy Eames for her support and, in particular, her endorsement of the measures in the farming and agribusiness sector.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn raised the adequacy of the provisions of the special assignee relief programme to allow Ireland to compete with other jurisdictions.  This programme introduces a much more flexible regime to replace that phased out in section 13 of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Senators Byrne and Reilly should be aware that the standard VAT rate was increased in the budget to focus revenue-raising on indirect taxation, which has a less adverse impact on economic activity and employment than income tax.  It should be noted that while income tax changes are more progressive than indirect taxes, they also have greater negative impacts on labour supply and thus on economic growth.  Economic research by the OECD supports a shift in policy from direct taxes to indirect tax.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of Senators questioned the rationale for business tax incentives, including the research and development tax credit.  The research and development tax credit scheme was introduced in the Finance Act 2004 as an incentive to foreign-owned multinational companies to increase investment in research and development in Ireland and to encourage Irish indigenous companies to increase the level of spending thereon.  The scheme was approved by the European Union as a general measure and is not a state aid.  It is open to any company undertaking research and development activities, including our indigenous food and other companies, to claim the credit on a self-assessment basis.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford referred to the current high fuel prices and the possibility of a temporary reduction in excise rates.  The increase in fuel prices is an international phenomenon.  Excise rates, including the carbon charge, on motor fuels are 58.8 cent per litre of petrol and 47.9 cent per litre of auto-diesel.  However, our rates remain lower than many of our main trading partners and significantly lower than our nearest neighbour, the UK.  There are no plans for temporary taxation adjustments, as to do so could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for the constructive debate we have had today and I hope I have addressed the points raised in the short time available to me.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> criticises the Government for reversing its position on a number of election pledges and for failing to implement a significant number of commitments contained in the Programme for Government;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> implement a complete ban on corporate donations as promised in the Programme for Government.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, back to the Chamber.  He is spending more time here than when he was a Senator.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated that he would produce a report card on his Ministers and the Government after one year in office.  On foot of the fact that he decided not to do so and given that all Ministers were on message to the effect that a solid start had been made, it is appropriate on the Government&rsquo;s anniversary that we table a Private Members&rsquo; motion on the Government&rsquo;s performance.  As Fianna F&aacute;il well knows and accepts from being in government from 2007 to 2011, the years of the economic crisis, it is a difficult time for the Government.  We have tried to support it when doing so was right, but it is incumbent upon us as a responsible Opposition party to highlight areas in which the Government is not performing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the run-up to the general election, several cast iron promises were made by the current Government.  I will start with the promise on the continuing mortgage crisis.  The situation has not improved since the Government entered into office.  Rather, it has worsened.  Since the Keane report was given to the Government last September, there has been no action in real terms with the exception of the welcome increase in mortgage interest relief for people who bought houses between 2004 and 2008.  The Government needs to understand this is a crisis.  I ask anyone who does not believe that to read a well researched report by Charlie Weston in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> on what is happening in our courts every day of the week.  I do not believe the Government can wait for the personal insolvency Bill because, while we accept aspects of it will make a difference, it will not deal with the thousands of people who wake up every morning wondering if they will keep a roof over their heads.  That is an area in which the Government has failed thus far.</P>
        <P>During the week prior to the election people who should have known better promised that they would not pay another cent into our banks.  Why were members of what is usually regarded as a responsible party, Fine Gael, allowed to make these promises?  They knew that the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government implemented the correct measures in saving our banks, despite their harsh criticism of the bank guarantee and recapitalisation.  I remind my Labour Party colleagues that prior to Christmas we insisted on a vote on the renewal of the bank guarantee.  I was glad that Labour Party Members had the opportunity to walk through the lobby for that vote because it was the only thing that could be done at the time.</P>
        <P>Where do we go from here?  A solemn promise was made to students that third level fees would not be increased.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, signed a pledge two days before the general election.  I know the Minister is not a fool but the cynical decision to sign a pledge on third level fees in front of Trinity College had an understandable impact on how our students voted.  That promise was subsequently reversed when fees were further increased.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Government Members have been beating their chests about rural and minority faith schools.  Our smaller schools are under threat from the Government.  Some of the most reasonable people I have met during my time in politics come from the Church of Ireland.  For the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin to express the belief that his community is threatened by this Government is a sad indictment of how it is treating minorities in this country.  Some 65% of Church of Ireland and other minority faith schools, including the only Jewish school in the State, will be affected by these cuts.  How does this reflect the promises made by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, when he came into government?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The schools building programme, which was announced with much fanfare two weeks ago, will invest &euro;1.5 billion over five years.  Anyone reading that headline would think this is great news because every new school is welcome.  However, it was not acknowledged that the original plan would have invested &euro;1.9 billion over four years.  Effectively, the programme has been cut by &euro;400 million, or &euro;600 million if one takes account of the fact that it is over a longer period of time.  I will not dwell on the details of the list but I am sure a number of my colleagues will be able to identify schools that have been announced for the fourth or fifth time.  Other Governments were also good at doing that on occasion but I found it interesting that the list of schools with construction workers supposedly on-site included a school in my own area, Loretto in Balbriggan.  The only people on site at that school are students and teachers.  That project was announced in 2009 and the school building has already been built and opened.</P>
        <P>The Government promised a new breed of politics involving openness and transparency.  It was going to cap salaries.  What has it done in regard to the advisers that every Minister employs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have an adviser.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not speaking about the Minister of State.  I refer to senior Ministers.  Many of us think he should be in the Cabinet but, unfortunately, he is not there this time around.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agreed with Senator Whelan&rsquo;s remarks on the Order of Business on capping bankers&rsquo; salaries.  The individual who introduced caps on bankers&rsquo; salaries was the late Brian Lenihan, God rest him.  People said at the time that the cap was too high.  What has the Government done about the special advisers to Ministers?  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform breached the salary cap he was responsible for policing.  The special adviser to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine wanted to be patriotic by working for his country but he was out the door after six months to take a job that offered double his salary.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has to lead by example.  The public gave it a mandate and if this motion does anything, I hope it will help the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues realise they are in government.  The time has passed when they can merely accuse others of failure.  I hope this debate will allow us an opportunity to debate the failures of the previous Government but never in the history of the State was more money invested in capital infrastructure.  The Government has halved that rate of investment.  One only needs to look around every town, village and parish to see the benefits in terms of infrastructure, sports clubs, roads and light rail.  There were mistakes but there were also many positive initiatives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did we halve it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I remind my eminent friend from Carlow-Kilkenny that every time a budget was proposed in the past ten or 12 years those who are now Ministers called for more.</P>
        <P>My colleagues will deal with each of the points made in the motion.  They will address the cynical promises made on the health service, the Defence Forces, the Garda and child benefit.  The individuals who made these promises knew they were telling untruths.  The public will have the opportunity to express an opinion on the truth or otherwise of their commitments.  The Members opposite broke their promise that they would not cut child benefit or social welfare rates.  They promised to protect education and the disadvantaged only to cut funding in these areas.  They are selling the State assets they promised to retain in public ownership.  They were going to bring forward a jobs budget that became an initiative which was paid for by robbing &euro;450 million from those who saved for private pensions.  Half of that money was put into job creation measures, yet unemployment increased from 13.7% to 14.2% between July 2011 and today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We will continue to be a responsible Opposition and will support the Government when we believe it is going in the right direction.  However, we will hold it to account when it goes wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the motion.  It is welcome to have this debate as we approach the first anniversary of the Government&rsquo;s election.  One of the biggest broken promises of all was the promise to implement the findings of the Moriarty tribunal which was published a year ago today.  However, nothing has happened.  Fianna F&aacute;il will not be found wanting in reacting to any other tribunal in comparison with the reaction of the Government on the Moriarty tribunal in the past year.   We will harp on about that because the Government has done nothing.  It has shamelessly avoided the issues and is associated with many of the persons named in it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The biggest broken promise was the promise to be different &mdash; the promise that the Government would do something different and that a different approach would be taken because the previous Government was completely wrong.  What has happened?  As soon as the Government has become comfortable in the seats of power, it has done exactly the same as the previous Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Shameless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been no changes of any substance whatsoever, except to disimprove people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been no changes in the approach to banking, although the system was opposed vigorously by the Government when in opposition.  There have been no changes to budgetary strategy, but the Government now claims the credit for a budget it completely opposed previously.  It was ironic to hear former Deputy Healy-Rae say on television the other night that he needed &euro;1 million to support the Finance Bill which set the foundation for the return to stability for this country and for which the Government claimed credit all last year.  The reason Deputy Healy-Rae&rsquo;s vote was required was because Fine Gael and the Labour Party ruthlessly opposed that Finance Bill in their own personal political interest and said they would vote against it again and again.  However, they claimed credit for the measures contained in it all last year.  The Minister at the time, Brian Lenihan, a man whose international reputation was beyond compare and beyond dispute, was forced to do a deal with an Independent, Deputy Healy-Rae, at the time for his vote because Fine Gael and the Labour Party would not act in the national interest</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>That was always Fianna F&aacute;il politics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>There was more than one leading it, to be honest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s amendment speaks about returning the economic, financial and political stability in the country to rebuild our international reputation.  This is a much repeated mantra.  I accept there was instability in the previous Government.  However, what have Ministers of the current Government done and how do they quantify that our reputation has been restored?  What steps has the Government taken to restore it or how do they quantify how bad our reputation was?  Ministers in our Government had huge international stature, much greater international stature than any Minister in the Government will ever have.  That is a fact, as we saw last year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has done nothing on the mortgage crisis.  Even I, as a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy going before the electorate, hoped there would be some kind of change after the election.  I hoped for the sake of the country that the new Government would do something different.  However, it has not.  It has stayed on the same road, but in the meantime has cynically broken a record number of promises.  I will be slightly parochial and mention promises specific to County Meath, such as pylons, the regional hospital, Navan rail line, Slane bypass, metro north and pyrite, on which nothing has been done one year into office.  On a national level, there are broken promises on mortgages&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Byrne not realise the coffers are empty after 14 years of Fianna F&aacute;il in government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael and the Labour Party took on the Government and the election based on finances that were available to them beforehand through confidential briefings and on the IMF deal.  They promised that they could make all these changes, although they could not be done.  I am reminded of the stag hunting ban and the organisation Rural Ireland Says Enough.  Deputy McEntee defined rural Ireland by reference to stag hunting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What about small schools and septic tanks?  It was ironic to read in the newspaper last week that one of the blacklisted areas for septic tanks was Deputy McEntee&rsquo;s home parish of Lobinstown.  What is the Fine Gael Party going to do about the effect of this imposition?  We have seen no change whatsoever in planning policy for rural housing from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and county councils continue to stick to the same policy.  We have seen attack after attack on rural Ireland, while the Government&rsquo;s definition of rural Ireland was confined to stag hunting.</P>
        <P>The Government has not introduced anything different, but it is about time it did.  It is about time it started taking radical action.  I hope, if I am ever on the Government side of either House, I will not be as conservative as the current Government side is.  It is too conservative and does not think outside of the box.  I challenge the Minister of State.  Last April, he came here and told us that jobs would come from the jobs budget, but when I challenged him to give the figures on it, he did not give them.  Unfortunately, unemployment has risen.  Now, we are asked to trust the Government that on the sale of State assets, &euro;1 billion will be spent on job creation.  That is pure madness and would be a total waste of money unless the Minister of State can identify line by line what each euro will achieve in terms of jobs.  The jobs budget did not work the last time.  It was just money flushed down the toilet.  We cannot let that happen again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We want change and something different.  Fianna F&aacute;il is changing and is looking for something different also because we believe an alternative vision must be offered.  We were in power for long enough and it is now the turn of the Government.  However, the public expected more and expected something different.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes:</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="bull66" /> the Government&rsquo;s first priority in the past year was to progress the restoration of economic, financial and political stability, and to re-build the international reputation of the country;</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="bull66" /> that Government has published its Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work to signal its determination to tackle the unemployment problem;</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="bull66" /> the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative which has already provided 5,000 internship places;</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="bull66" /> the ongoing work of Government to improve the EU-IMF programme which has seen a reduction in programme loan interest rates and an agreement for the reinvestment of some proceeds from the sale of state assets for investment in the Irish economy and the ongoing focus on easing the onerous cost of supporting the banking sector;</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="bull66" /> the comments of the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste concerning the need to do more to address the mortgage arrears situation and notes the establishment of a dedicated Cabinet committee on mortgage arrears to bring a new focus to the issue;</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="bull66" /> the Government is one year into a term of office;</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="bull66" /> the continued implementation of the programme for Government with a particular focus on job creation, reform and fairness.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I thank my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il for presenting this motion as it allows the House and Government to comment after the first 12 months of the new Government on the current economic and political situation in the country.  There was a tradition fad&oacute;, fad&oacute;, for such debates to take place at the end of every term in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad where this sort of issue could be discussed in a less politicised and less confrontational way.  Perhaps we should revert to that tradition, because it is important to reflect, debate and present our views on the state of the nation.</P>
        <P>I feel obliged to ask my colleagues to think back.  I appreciate that a week is a long time in politics and 12 months is probably an eternity and that it is easy for people to forget.  I ask Members to think back to the Ireland of November and December 2010.  Think back to a time when the Government was imploding before our eyes, when we did not know who was Taoiseach on one day, did not know who was a Cabinet Minister the next day and did not know which party was in power or in opposition.  The public was frightened and the few constituents we had who had money in financial institutions were ringing us to know what they should do with their money and to ask was it safe in the bank or post office.  There was a state of terror among the people.  That led to a general election and we all know the result of that.  Now, 12 months later, we can look back from a Government perspective with what I would call sober satisfaction on a job well done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The wording of the Government amendment is modest and its language is temperate.  That must be our approach because we cannot expect overnight and instant solutions to problems which were five, six or seven years in the making.  There is a different economic mood in the country today and there is a different political mood.  If the people were asked by way of referendum today whether they wanted the current Government or the previous Government, the answer would be very clear.  If the people were asked by way of referendum today whether they wanted Taoiseach Enda Kenny or Taoiseach Brian Cowen, the answer would be very clear.  If the people were asked today whether they wanted Taoiseach Enda Kenny or Taoiseach Miche&aacute;l Martin, the answer would be very clear.  This is not an idle boast but something we would all see as realistic.</P>
        <P>I recognise that much more must be done and that more progress must be made.  However, we must also accept and recognise that in the first 12 months, we have achieved the slow turning around of the country&rsquo;s economic position, its political situation and its reputation at home and abroad.  The Taoiseach and many Ministers were in the United States this week on important international duty.  We saw the reception they got and noticed a visible degree of interest by American business people in investing in Ireland.  Some weeks ago, the Chines Vice Premier visited Ireland and, again, we noted the level of Chinese interest in our country.  Would that have been the case 12 or 14 months ago?  No, it would not.  Confidence is returning slowly, but surely.  The rebuilding of the ruined economy will not happen overnight and progress will be slow.  We must ask all to accept that the difficult measures which are being imposed &mdash; these are not imposed with glee &mdash; will work.  We are beginning to see the signs of growth and a turnaround.</P>
        <P>I would like to highlight a few of the Government&rsquo;s achievements.  Look, for example, at the work being done by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, which will lead to the children&rsquo;s referendum some time in the next number of months.  That will be ground breaking legislation and a ground breaking referendum as far as the children of Ireland and future generations are concerned.  It will be an outstanding achievement of the Government.  The Taoiseach in his wisdom decided to appoint, for the first time in the history of the State, a full Cabinet Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  It was a profound political statement which will result in a profound difference in the lives of children and future generations in this country.  It was very laudable and is something of which we can be really proud.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the coming months, very radical decisions on local government will be made.  As a former member of a county council, I have always believed that our local authorities could be a huge driving force of not only local development but of economic development.  However, it will require hugely new thinking and planning of local government and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, will bring forward those proposals in May or June or thereabouts.</P>
        <P>We are seeing the beginnings of genuine political reform.  We have seen it in the Oireachtas with the way business is being done, including in the way the committees have been changed.  Further tweaking is required but we have seen the beginnings of new politics in this country, which is very welcome.</P>
        <P>Above all, it is the mood of the country which tells the tale.  People are not jumping with joy and have not won the lottery but there is a belief that Ireland once again has a future.  A solid achievement of the Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues has been to give back a sense of future to Ireland because all hope was gone.  We were not just a basket case economy but people were fearful of the future and saw no hope for their children and their children&rsquo;s children.  That hope has been regenerated.  I acknowledge that much more must be done but we have made a solid and steady, but modest, start.</P>
        <P>I invite my political colleagues on all sides of the House to work with us in this time of new politics because the last thing the people want to hear about is the future of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or the Labour Party.  As a political anorak, I watched much of the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis as I am interested in the goings on in all political parties.  However, when I hear all parties look inwards in regard to their future, I ask the question, who cares?  What people care about is the future of this country.  We should set aside party politics for the next five years to ensure that by 2016, our country is no longer a province of the IMF but is once again a free, independent and democratic country living within its means and with its own budgetary policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and commend him for the measured and constructive criticism he levelled against the Government because that is the job of a robust and good Opposition.  It is important that every Government is held to account.  I would like to address the issues Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien raised and make some points.  It is in the best interest of the House that in doing so, I ignore the Senator from Meath&rsquo;s obsession with stag hunting.  I do not know what it has to do with anything but it surfaces every day.  He needs to have it looked at.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important on the first anniversary of the Government and of the formation of the Seanad to look at the situation.  I do not believe for one second that the Labour Party or Fine Gael has a monopoly of good ideas or good policies.  For instance, I commend Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin on something for which the country will be eternally grateful, namely, the smoking ban in the workplace.  No one can take that away from him or from a previous Government.  The dividend to public health and the public purse will be a strong and proud legacy for generations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like my colleague, Senator Bradford, I also took an earnest interest in the goings on at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis and commend Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin&rsquo;s defence of small rural schools in his speech.  It is a matter on which I agree with him and which I will continue to bring to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills and the Government.  It is also a matter I discussed with the incoming president of the GAA, Liam O&rsquo;Neill, who is a Laois man and the principal of a small rural school with 35 pupils which is at the heart of the community.  To be fair to Fianna F&aacute;il, it has always been the vanguard of rural Ireland.  I commend it for that and share a common purpose with it in that regard.</P>
        <P>The question of small businesses was raised in Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin&rsquo;s speech at the Ard-Fheis.  The small business person and the self-employed person deserve all our support and any assistance we can give them.  While absenteeism remains a big problem and is a huge burden on the taxpayer &mdash; it is estimated at &euro;550 million per annum &mdash; at a time when we can ill afford it, the small business sector is not the problem and the burden of absenteeism should not be left at its door.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having made those points, I diverge in a substantive way from the Opposition motion which reads more like fiction than any sort of meaningful assessment of the Government&rsquo;s performance.  In fact, Bertie Ahern would be proud of the creative aspects of the motion.  I am sure it would qualify for tax exemption because it is so creative and fictional.  Like the public at large, we all await with bated breath the imminent publication of the Mahon report because, in a sense, it will punctuate a chapter in Irish public life and Irish political history.  It is important that the Government, as well as the last one, are held to account when the time comes.  That will be part of that process.  I look forward to the publication of the Mahon report and its findings.  For my money, it is worth every penny it cost because one cannot put a price on accountability and a free and fair democracy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The juxtaposition of people planning to emigrate queuing up at a jobs fair in Ballsbridge with the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis was a landmark moment which will resonate with Irish families for years to come.  Like so many other Irish families, members of my family and my children have been forced to emigrate.  We all know what it is like and no one can pull rank on that issue.  I agree with Senator Reilly from Sinn F&eacute;in that it is not a lifestyle choice or something that one does for the experience.  To be fair, we all know who coined that phrase first, namely, the former T&aacute;naiste, Mary Couglan, who said people were going off on a gap year, for fun and the experience.  I do not believe that is the case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some 252,000 people have been forced to emigrate since 2008.  As I turned to my good friend, the economist, Constantin Gurdgiev, for those figures, I do not believe anyone can say I am pulling them out of the sky.  It is not a lifestyle choice; it is a far more serious matter.  Many of those young people and families would prefer to stay in this country but they do not have the choice.  I do not know one who lays the blame at the Government&rsquo;s door.  We must be given a chance to address the issues.</P>
        <P>The motion calls for the reopening of Army barracks.  That is very interesting.  Why do we not reopen all the Army barracks Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea closed when he was Minister for Defence, including the one in Kildare town where buachall&aacute;ns are growing and which is a campus for anti-social behaviour?  It is a redundant eyesore in the middle of the town.  If we are going to be constructive, let us be consistent.</P>
        <P>I would like to see the Fruitfield plant, the Jacobs factory and the sugar factory in Carlow, which the former Minister, Mary Coughlan, sold out, reopened.</P>

        <P Just="Left">In regard to the household charge and the endeavours of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, who has taken strong and robust initiatives in the area of local government and the funding of same, one cannot speak out of both sides of one&rsquo;s mouth and with forked tongues as in the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  The reality is that one cannot have strong local government and good local services such as playgrounds, parks, roads, lighting and fire stations, and then tell people not to pay the household charge.  It is immoral and wrong.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I have three points and will try to be as quick and succinct as I can.  First, I draw the attention of Members to the achievements of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  We delivered the peace process.  Nobody can deny that.  In addition, for many years there was very little unemployment.  It is no harm reminding people about that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am fascinated by the pride the Taoiseach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, take in talking about foreign direct investment as if they had achieved it all by themselves, all of a sudden.  The jobs that are being delivered for Ireland through foreign direct investment have been worked at and nurtured by IDA Ireland for many years.  For 14 years Fianna F&aacute;il sustained international credibility in Ireland with the result that foreign direct investment continued to come into the country.  That cannot be denied.  My colleague, the leader in the Seanad of my party, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, drew attention to the whole infrastructure we have, the magnificent roads throughout the country and the Luas which is relentlessly packed, day in, day out.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I draw attention to the impact of the 2012 budget.  Research done by the ESRI in analysing the budget under a sophisticated model states that it is clear that the greatest reduction in income will be for those people on the lowest income, with a fall of between 2% and 2.5% for the poorest 40% of households.  The Government parties should be ashamed of themselves.  If it had been up to me, I would have introduced increased taxation on income.  This is a most regressive budget, with indirect cuts.  I refer, for example, to cuts in welfare such as the reductions in child benefit payable to families with three or more children.  I spoke on this point on the day the budget was introduced and was shocked that everybody was able to sit so quietly.  There is also the restriction of the fuel allowance to 26 weeks.  Now, in March, it is still quite cold, yet the Government is cutting the allowance for older people.</P>

	<P>Stop defending the indefensible.  This is a regressive budget.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Do Senators not accept the ESRI&rsquo;s analysis which expects a 2.5% drop in the income of poorer households?  There are also the reductions in the amounts payable under the rent supplement scheme and the increases in VAT and carbon taxes.  If Senators want to say all this did not happen they are welcome.</P>
        <P>We all know, as does anybody who knows the most minimal amount of economics, that regressive taxes most affect the poorest people.  Income tax is far better.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, is back in the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>He is in for it now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My pet subject is the lack of liquidity in the economy for small businesses.  I pleaded this with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  Why does the Minister not listen to the Governor of the Central Bank who said it was twice as difficult for Irish companies to get cash to create and develop more business?  It is the small and medium businesses that are creating employment and which are, in fact, much more labour intensive than the multinationals which are capital intensive.  Money is not available for these businesses.  The Governor, Professor Honohan, stated that there are much tougher restrictions in this country, with more collateral required, higher interest rates, etc.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Earlier, just after the Minister of State had left the Chamber, I stated I did not understand why the Government was sticking its head in the ground.  It is in denial.  Does the Government understand business?  It is not an academic exercise.  Business people know there is no liquidity.  Taxpayers put &euro;63 billion into the banks we own but they are not passing the money on to the people who need it, in small and medium-sized businesses.  I could continue on that point for a week but I will not as I am trying to do it in a nutshell.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I draw attention also to the current low rate of inflation.  The reason is as nobody is spending any money, there is no demand in the retail area.  There is a myth that it was the Government which improved competitiveness in this economy.  Competitiveness was improved by private sector companies which cut their cloth to suit their measure and employees who were prepared to take a reduction in their wages.  What is the Government doing?  We are becoming uncompetitive again thanks to its charges &mdash; for waste and rent and the increased transport and energy costs.  It is not hifaluting economics.  The Government is adding to our uncompetitiveness.  It must address this.  I am mystified by the Government.  I am mystified as to why the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues, who are all very nice people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We heard comments from the Central Bank and the Department of Finance made at the height of the Celtic tiger period saying, in very low voices, that we must be careful, blah-de-blah.  They did not raise a red alert, however, nor did the then Opposition party, Fine Gael.  The media did not raise a red alert about the dangers.  However, Fianna F&aacute;il was in charge and must take responsibility.</P>
        <P>The Governor of the Central Bank knows the small and medium-sized companies which create employment are not getting cash.  He must assert his authority within the institution of the Central Bank and order the banks to give money to these companies.</P>

I have a speech which I do not intend to read but which I hope will arrive one day in my biography as a very important contribution to this House.</P>
        <P>One&rsquo;s time in politics is important, whether one is in government or opposition.  We all have a job to do, on both sides of this House and in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We were all given a mandate.  The people will make their minds up about us one way or the other.  It will not be the Government touting its successes.  Equally, it will not be the Opposition deriding the Government&rsquo;s programme.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the people to decide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One point made very forcefully by Senator Bradford was the importance of political stability.  We have stability in the country now which was not there 12 months ago.  This is not politics as usual.  The two biggest parties in the State, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, have come together as a national government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us see.  The reason those parties came together was not for the interests of either the Fine Gael party or the Labour Party but for the interest of the country.  We put together a national Government because of the crisis the country faces.  This is a national Government and I sometimes get frustrated by my colleagues or Labour Party colleagues spinning that the Labour Party has achieved this or Fine Gael has achieved that.  It is all irrelevant in circumstances where the country cannot fund itself and the difference between what we take in and what we spend is &euro;15 billion annually.  The key objective of the Government is to get the current budget deficit down and to get Ireland back to the market.  When that happens, politics as normal will be re-established and the points of choice between the parties will be clear.  The country does not have those choices at the moment and for any politician, Government or Opposition, to pretend otherwise is delusional.</P>
        <P>Senator Thomas Byrne asked how to quantify an improvement in reputation.  One way is to ask the question posed by a Labour Party Senator during the debate on the Finance Bill.  The cost of Irish money in July last year, in terms of borrowing, was over 14% on the real market and the cost today is less than 7%.  That is a good indication of the way in which the reputational damage done to the country has been restored somewhat as a result of the actions of the Government over the past number of months.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It shows the scale of difficulty we faced in coming into office and the way in which we dealt with it.  That is one example.  If we are serious about the challenges faced by the country, the Government will need five years to deliver a programme to get the country to a better place.  When one compares what Greece, a similar programme country, went through with what Ireland has gone through, the comparison ends there.  It is a matter of considerable pride to the Government that since coming into office, we were told by all Members of the previous Government that we would not renegotiate the minimum wage.  We were also told by all commentators that we would not renegotiate the minimum wage.  I am very proud that one of the first decisions taken by the Government was to improve the situation whereby the previous Government shamelessly reduced the minimum wage.  That is significant in circumstances where Greece has gone in the opposite direction.  I am proud of the fact that, as highlighted in the debate on the Finance Bill, over 300,000 of the poorest of the poor workers in Ireland have been taken out of the universal social charge.  Over 300,000 people on temporary, part-time and seasonal work have been given additional help as a result of measures introduced in the budget.  That is something of which the Government can be proud.  I am proud of savings we negotiated with the EU authorities on the bailout money, which will save between &euro;9 billion and &euro;10 billion over the course of the loans, which will make an enormous difference.  More important, in the course of negotiations we did not have to concede on the issue of corporate taxation, which everyone predicted at the time.</P>
        <P>I am proud of the fact that we were told if we sold State assets, the proceeds would have to be used in totality for paying back Government debt.  That has not happened and we have been given an agreement that one third of the proceeds can go towards reinvestment, jobs and infrastructure in the economy.  The whole point of this entire exercise was, step-by-step, to negotiate the programme Ireland was entered into by the previous Administration.  The degree of flexibility is always difficult but we have managed to show significant tangible benefits to which Members can point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As modestly as I can say it, the most significant thing that has happened is bank recapitalisation.  The savings, as a result of decisions taken in March 2011, amount to over &euro;5 billion from start to end.  Last March, we were told 100% of Bank of Ireland would be State-owned by December of last year but it now stands at 15%.  The best news about the Irish economy over the course of eight or nine months is that 85% of Bank of Ireland is in private ownership.  A significant section of the bank was sold to US investors.  The only way forward for the country is not just to get back to the markets and sell the State debt in order that we can turn it over in the years to come, but also that investors start to put real deposits into the Irish banking system.  I accept the criticism about our capacity to lend to the real economy.  The Government is working day in and day out to achieve that.  We set up a special banking unit within the Department.  The Central Bank has demanded clear timeline reports from the banks, particularly the pillar banks, and we are seeing some small signs of success.  It will not happen overnight.</P>
        <P>The biggest problem we faced in coming into office was that deposits were still leaving Irish banks and the trend was still in a downward direction.  That trend is now going in the other direction and money is coming back into the Irish banking sector.  The cost of debt is reducing and, as a consequence, we have the potential of getting back to the markets in a substantive way sometime in 2013.  We have already shown that we have managed to move some debt due in 2014, to 2015.  It was only a partial re-entry to the markets but it is a significant dipping of our toes into the debt market and it sent a message of stability.</P>
        <P>In the election campaign, we said we would do something different with mortgage interest relief for the people who purchased houses between 2004 and 2008.  We delivered that in circumstances where everyone said it would not happen.  We have also managed to produce a budget where there were no reductions in baseline primary social welfare rates at a time when there is a budget deficit of &euro;15 billion.  We managed not to increase income tax.  We have increased indirect taxation.  The plan to which the previous Government signed up to included moving indirect taxation from 21% to 23% over two years.  The suggestion that the previous Government would not have done this is untrue because the previous Government signed up to it in the memorandum of understanding with the troika in 2010.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been some achievement.  In coming to office, we were told we would not have a jobs budget but we have had one that made significant progress in reducing employers&rsquo; PRSI and VAT for the hospitality and tourism sectors.  We have an ambitious action plan on jobs, which is trying to tie together the agencies in achieving the objectives of 100,000 jobs between now and 2015.  Pathways to Work, which was announced by the Minister for Social Protection, includes an ambitious target of moving 75,000 people into strong activation measures in the labour market.  The JobBridge programme, which was attacked by the left although not by Fianna F&aacute;il, has worked and 5,000 internships have been given to people in the private or public sectors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true, it is good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This made a real difference to people in getting expertise and skill.  Under the Springboard proposals, 6,000 placements have been made across the education sector.  An enormous job of work continues over the course of the lifetime of this Government but it is a matter for the people to come to a judgment on the Government or an alternative.  It is a matter for the people to see the state of the economy now by comparison with 12 months ago.  If one asks most fair-minded people whether we are in a better position now than 12 months ago, they would be in agreement.  That is because of the steady success of the Government, for which we look for support.</P>
        <P>I compliment Ray MacSharry for the tough decisions taken in 1987, after Fine Gael had been in government with the Labour Party.  These were the key decisions in turning around the Irish economy and getting our public finances to a better balanced position.  Over three years, he did more than Fine Gael and the Labour Party did in the previous seven years and I concede that point.  However, he had the support of Alan Dukes and the Fine Gael Party in doing what was in the country&rsquo;s interest.  I ask the Opposition Members to follow in that vein.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfair to say, either way, whether people think the Government is doing a good job.  We must wait until the next election.</P>
        <P>We can take some pointers from opinion polls, which have been consistent and show a flowing away of some support from the Government, especially the Labour Party.  There is a drop in support for the Government parties because of some of the policies which have been put in place.  It must be said that some people are not happy with the current performance of the Government.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have to smile when I hear Government representatives say we should set aside party politics because invariably it is always somebody who is in government.  We can all rewind the clock and go back to the time when the Government parties were in opposition, and they were a robust Opposition.  In fairness, they were vocal.  The then Deputy Eamon Gilmore was on his feet every day of the week.  The then Deputy Enda Kenny was vocal against what the Government was doing.  That is what Opposition parties do.  The notion that we can simply put aside party politics is not living in the real world.  We must have a robust Opposition, and that is what we do in this House.  We put down motions such as this one to hold the Government to account.  That is what our amendment is about because it also deals with the failures of the previous Government as well as what we see are the failings of this Government.</P>
        <P>Senator Whelan made a number of comments which I want to address.  A number of Senators in this House have repeated the claim that Sinn F&eacute;in Oireachtas Members have advocated that people should not pay the household charge.  I have stated our position on that umpteen times.  We have not on any occasion advocated that people should not pay the charge.  Not one of our members has done that because we made a collective decision, as a party, not to ask people not to pay.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>What we have said is that some of our public representatives have decided not to pay.  It is not the job of any political party to tell the electorate what to do but it is clear that the electorate, the people of this country, have made up their minds that they will not pay the charge.  We have not advocated that people should not pay it, and we will not call on people to pay the charge because it is a matter for them to make up their own minds.  They are adults.  When they turn 18 and they can vote they can make up their own minds on what they should and should not do.</P>

	<P>We are opposed to it politically.  What we are doing is what any party should do.  We are taking the arguments directly to the Government parties in the D&aacute;il and in the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People talk about leadership.  Senator Whelan talked about the footpaths and the lighting in playgrounds having to be paid for yet he has the brass neck to sit in this House, along with members of his party, Fine Gael, and shortly sign off on a cheque for &euro;3.1 billion.  In January this year they signed off on a cheque for &euro;1.2 billion.  In November last year they signed off on a cheque for several hundred million euro.</P>
        <P>I do not judge the Government on what I would want it to do.  I judge the Government on what it said it would do.  Why were the Government parties elected?  They were elected on the basis of promises they made and on their pre-election manifestos.  We should examine some of the clear pledges made by the parties.  They said that not one cent more of taxpayers&rsquo; money would go into the banks.  They said that aggressive burden sharing would have to be imposed before&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That has happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That was in the Fine Gael manifesto.  I am talking about the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  Fine Gael in its manifesto said that burden sharing would have to be imposed and unilateral action would be taken, if necessary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  That is untrue.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That was in Fine Gael&rsquo;s election manifesto.  There was also a good deal of public commentary by Fine Gael's public representatives during the course of the election campaign.  We then had "It's Frankfurt's way or Labour's way" and all that nonsense, and that the money would not go into the banks.  As I said numerous times, Deputy Eamon Gilmore at the time made a name for himself as the tough man taking on the Government and the banks and now he is signing off on the Anglo promissory note.  That is the reality.  People see that and they feel let down when they remember all those promises made.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Blank"><NameTxt></NameTxt>
	
        <P>I can give two clear examples of pre-election promises that were made by Senator Whelan&rsquo;s party, one of which was that child benefit would not be touched in any way and that there would not be any increases in college fees but what did we see in its very first budget?  Child benefit was touched, so to speak, and college fees will increase this year, next year and the year after that.  That is the reality.</P>
        <P>People are tired of hearing the Government defend the indefensible when it comes to the banks.  We are calling for a different approach because we recognise that the deficit must be reduced.  We put forward our pre-budget proposals in that regard.  For example, we want a 1% income link wealth tax.  We want to standardise all tax reliefs.  We want a third rate of tax of 48% on all income over &euro;100,000, and much more.  I cannot go through all of our proposals but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not add up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>What does not add up and what is not right socially, economically or morally is that we should be paying back private banking debt.  That is what we are doing at a time when we are asking people to shoulder huge amounts of pain.  Low to middle income families are being asked to pay every time.  The Minister of State can sit in his chair, nod his head and do whatever he likes but the reality is that people on the ground see it differently.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not saying that the Government has not done any good.  It has done some good.  I am fully conscious of the fact that the two parties in government have taken over an enormous mess created by the previous Government, hence our amendment, but it should be big enough to be able to accept constructive criticism when it is pointed out what it promised to do.  The fact that the red line issues which the Labour Party in particular signed up to could be simply broken in its first year in office is not good enough for many voters.  The people of Ireland deserve better.</P>
        <P>An issue I hope we can all agree on is that we cannot have austerity and cuts alone.  Adjustments must be made in terms of reducing the deficit.  It then comes down to what those adjustments should be, and we can differ on those, but one thing we need is an investment and growth strategy.  There is still over &euro;5 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  That money should be used to build infrastructure including schools, roads and all the issues Senator Whelan mentioned.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State who gave a frank and honest assessment of the Government&rsquo;s performance and the start we have made.  I do not believe people feel let down.  The recent opinion polls published indicated that the support for both Fine Gael and Labour Party is holding strong because people voted for change and for a Government to come in and resolve the awful mess it inherited.  I will not be a bit embarrassed if the Government has to back-track on some of the promises made during the course of an election campaign because we cannot afford to honour some of those commitments.  If we must postpone some of them, so be it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should never again face a situation such as the one the Government has had to face.  We had 14 years of serious mismanagement of the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am getting worried that the Senator's memory is not as good as it should be because she is being very selective in what she remembers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all remember that the Government inherited a country on the brink of bankruptcy.  The IMF had arrived in the country a few short weeks earlier.  Senior Ministers in the previous Government were saying that the IMF was not coming here when its representatives were arriving at Dublin Airport.  Over a period of two elections the previous Government bought the electorate by making unsustainable promises.  It wasted valuable resources that, unfortunately, brought politics into disrepute.  We had tribunals established and the legal profession benefiting to the tune of hundreds of millions of euro as a result of those tribunals.  Senior Cabinet decisions appear to have been made in the Galway tent where the only people who were important to the previous Government were the cronies who were hanging around and who would literally walk on one.  I attended the Galway races on a number of occasions and saw them operating.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We all heard about the boom getting boomier.  We had no cohesion whatsoever in government and had divided factions.  The best talent in government was left on the backbenches.  Some former Deputies are now in the Seanad.  One can contrast that with what has happened in the past 12 months.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste put in place a strong team of Ministers and Ministers of State.  We have seen them perform in this House admirably.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>We had very little unemployment when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Mullins to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When did the building bust happen?  There are 435,000 people unemployed.  We need investment and every Department in government functioning and working towards the jobs initiative that was recently rolled out by the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  All 15 Departments need to work in a coherent fashion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has set about renegotiating the bailout programme and has succeeded in saving &euro;10 billion so far by getting an interest rate reduction on the bailout funds.  It made a good start and led by example from the front by cutting the salaries of the Taoiseach and Ministers and reducing the cost of ministerial transport and the benefits enjoyed by former taoisigh.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is only a start, but confidence is beginning to return.  We have seen significant job announcements in recent weeks and I hope the recent visits by many Ministers to countries throughout the world will bring about badly needed investment in the coming years.  There is a huge job of work to be done.  Fianna F&aacute;il did some good things when it was in office but also did some terrible things.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge the efforts of the peace process, on which one cannot put a price.  It should contribute significantly to investment on this island.  I will not knock everything Fianna F&aacute;il did but, from an economic point of view, we were very badly mismanaged in recent years in particular.</P>

	<P>The Government was rudderless, a situation I hope we will not see again.  </P>
        <P>We now have an extremely strong Government which, as somebody said, is almost a national Government.  I hope, collectively, all Members of the Oireachtas will work towards the betterment of the country.  We have a long way to go but we have made a good start.  T&uacute;s maith, leath na hoibre.  I commend the start the Government has made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like some on the other side of the House, I am impatient and want to see things happen more quickly.  I want to see some decisions made on matters we all seem to be able to identify as needing to be addressed.  We are frustrated that sometimes the decision making process takes too long.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, and all his Cabinet colleagues to keep the pressure on and maintain the good start that was made by the Government, led by the Taoiseach and  the T&aacute;naiste.  I wish them continued success but they should not rest on their laurels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As we saw recently, the gains and achievements after the first year in government are modest.  I hope by the time we celebrate the second anniversary we will have made it significantly more progress and more people will be at work, and we will gradually get to a situation where many of the people who have emigrated over the past couple of years or so will start to return to the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a few points on this issue.  I have enjoyed the debate immensely so far.  Debates are always filled with colour when we get into some of the political crossfire.  </P>
        <P>Members of these Houses are not yet ready to consider some of the facts calmly without getting high on certain aspects.  It will probably be several years before an assessment of the global financial crisis is accurately done and we will be able to calmly say that X action happened and caused a reaction which brought us to where we are.</P>
        <P>When I was on the government side of the House as a finance spokesperson I presided over the defence of budgets, and when I was hammered by the Opposition at the time I was never overly political.  In finishing a speech on a tough budget, I quoted a closing statement nobody knew I was quoting until I announced it at the end of my speech.  I was condemned by the Opposition at the time.  Ironically, I referred to the closing paragraphs of the 1987 budget which the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, praised so glowingly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Government for a number of the things it has done in the past year.  One, which is mentioned in the amendment to the motion, is the internship scheme which should be expanded and create a great number of jobs.  I congratulate and commend the Government for the positive things it is doing in what, as Senator O&rsquo;Brien, said are extremely difficult times.  The options open to the Government are extremely difficult which is where responsibility comes in.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, has said this is not politics as usual, which I accept.  When I was on the other side of the House defending tough decisions I also said this was not politics as usual.  Nobody would set out in normal circumstances to have to introduce policy A or B if it amounted to a cutback or giveaway issues in particular areas.</P>
        <P>The sports capital programme was great over the years and every parish benefited.  Senator O&rsquo;Brien mentioned there were surpluses in previous budgets and money to give away but it was never enough.  There was always more to be paid to garda&iacute;, more teachers to be taken on, more schools to be built or more money for GAA parks and so on.  The job of the Opposition at the time was to criticise budgets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am the first to acknowledge many of the mistakes of the past.  At the recent Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis, which received some criticism from the Opposition, our leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, apologised for the fact that mistakes were made.  It is very difficult for this season&rsquo;s team to replay matches.  It is important that we acknowledge and learn from the mistakes made, and I have no difficulty doing that.  When I was on the other side of the House I had no difficulty saying as much.  It is not difficult to be political at this point on certain issues because it is justified.</P>
        <P>When the programme for Government was being drawn up, we did not tell Fine Gael and the Labour Party to use the books for the surpluses of 2002.  Anybody on the other side of the House during the two and a half years I was finance spokesperson, presiding over the cuts the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, outlined, would know the situation we were in was crystal clear.  The heckle was that the coffers are empty.  The other side knew that as well as we did in the preparation for the last general election.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a recent press release I described some of the promises made as, frankly, delinquent and an act of political thuggery.  Nobody said we should use the books of the surpluses of 2003, 2004 and late 1990s to determine budgets and expenditure.  Nobody said we had to guarantee Roscommon hospital but it happened.  Nobody used the cancer patients of the north west as a political pawn in the context of winning votes.  However, it is precisely what the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Education and Skills and local representatives were doing.  Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe promised the construction of a centre of excellence in the north west.  At the same time as the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, was telling people on air a few weeks ago that the door was not closed on the provision of cancer services in the north west, the head of the national cancer control programme was in an interview for a medical publication saying that would definitely not be happening.</P>
        <P>I have with me a four page list of commitments made in the context of the programme for Government.  Senators opposite were aware, if not through the books provided, then from what I was saying when on that side, in respect of which I was heckled by Senators, that the coffers were empty.  I dealt with the context of this earlier.  For members of the Government and Members opposite to have used the people, from an education, health and wide variety of other perspectives just to gain votes when they knew the coffers were empty, was an act of delinquency and political thuggery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">No one told the current Government to base its programme for Government on the fiscal situation of 2002.  It chose to do that and to tell porky pies to the electorate in the interest of winning votes.  I will always praise the Government when it does good things but I will not let it go when it knowingly and openly misleads the public.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to the House.  This motion appears to me to be an attempt at political cleansing by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is attempting to wipe clean the slate in terms of the ills it brought on this country, which were handed over to the current Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il is asking us to forget what happened during the 14 years when it was in government, in particular the past four or five years, and telling us to get on with sorting out the mess.  The Government has every intention of doing that.  As stated by other speakers, it has done a fine job in the first 12 months of its term in office.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il is, in tabling this motion, attempting to cleanse its political soul.  I suggest it should take a long dip in the River Liffey.  It will take a long time to cleanse the sins on the soul of this country as a result of its activities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Government has brought forward an action plan for jobs, the Pathways to Work initiative and an internship scheme.  There has been massive direct investment in this country during the past couple of months despite that the Government has been only in office for one year.  The Government intends to reform local government and to divide the national legislature from local practitioners, an issue much talked about by Fianna F&aacute;il for almost 25 years but about which it did nothing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, has been criticised about the lack of new schools.  The many communities which are to get new schools are grateful for them, including Carrick-on-Suir, the pleas of which in regard to the provision of a new VEC school were ignored by Fianna F&aacute;il for 20 years.  Students in the current VEC school are spread across three buildings in the town.  They are glad that the Labour Party and Fine Gael are in government and that they are going to provide this new school.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, Senator Cullinane from Waterford, who unfortunately is not here, made great play of the Labour Party losing support.  He obviously only took note of the poll which showed Sinn F&eacute;in at 25%.  The Labour Party is holding strong at 16%, which is where it stood in the run up to the election.  We must be doing something right.  Senator Cullinane stated that Sinn F&eacute;in is not telling people to resist paying the household charge.  The Senator took part in a march in my town three weeks ago, at which time he spoke against payment of the household charge.  The Senator is now asking us to believe that Sinn F&eacute;in is not against payment of the household charge.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in members are speaking out of both sides of their mouths.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Sinn F&eacute;in wants to be a 32-county party.  It is asking the ordinary people of Ireland to believe that while its supports implementation of the household charge of approximately &euro;1,400 for a standard three bedroom house in the Six Counties it is against the introduction of this charge in the South.  Most people can decipher for themselves what is and is not true.  Sinn F&eacute;in has set out in its amendment to this motion its political manifesto for the next election.  As usual, while much of what it proposes is laudable none of it has been costed.  Much of what is contained in the amendment is headline seeking.  Sinn F&eacute;in needs to embrace politics across the 32.  It policies must stand across all 32 counties rather some in the North and others in the South.</P>
        
        <P>Senator White&rsquo;s contribution, which referred to Fianna F&aacute;il bringing forth and implementing policies for the elderly in to the future, was interesting.  What did Fianna F&aacute;il do on behalf of the elderly during its 14 years in office?  Having spent only 12 months in opposition, it now appears to have solutions to all problems.  It is amazing what opposition can do for people.  It crystalises their thoughts and brings great vision for the future of the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Wilson has heckled me once or twice during my contribution.  I am not proud of everything the Government has done, including the closure of Clonmel barracks next week.  I will be at the barracks next Monday, 26 March, when it closes.  I served in Clonmel barracks, which takes great pride of place in south Tipperary.  Senator Wilson knows well that the barracks is being closed for economic reasons.  We have discussed this matter on many occasions.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Government, which has been in office now for only 12 months, is steering the ship in the right direction.  It has reinstated our reputation at international level and is bringing foreign investment into the country, thus creating jobs.  More important, it is giving the people faith and vision in the country.  I commend the Government amendment to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to the House.  Nothing focuses the mind like having served on both sides of the House and what one had to say at any given time.  I will not concentrate on what Government Members said when on this side of the House, rather I will concentrate on what I said when on the opposite side.  Each Member of the House makes an effort to be reasoned, in particular when in the national good.  This was evident in a number of the contributions made already today.  While the cut and thrust of politics is necessary to energise us, we are all in learning mode, in particular when it comes to the economy.  When the recession hit, it hit so quickly it stunned everyone.  In the initial stages there was huge denial, not alone on the part of public figures but by people, about what was happening.  Gradually we are coming to an area of reality and from that reality I hope we will come forward with pragmatic policies out of which, particularly from those which work and are visible, will come confidence.</P>
        <P>Looking at the television and seeing the Taoiseach in the United States if one is Irish one must feel good about it.  One wonders how a small country such as Ireland enjoys such a reputation.  The reason I make these points is because sometimes when we count our assets we think only of euro whereas the other assets we have are the very ones which may increase confidence and investment and give people a sense there is much to be done at present and that everybody must put their shoulder to the wheel.</P>
        <P>In my case I paid the household charge last week.  As I stated in the House already, I could not help but think about those who cannot pay it.  I had a cheque-book and I thought of those who do not.  I thought of those who cannot find &euro;10 and yet have dignity.  I also thought about genuine people who lost so much in buying shares which became worthless.  I am not speaking about the big people; I am talking about those who received a redundancy package at a certain age who wanted to top up their pensions.  Most of them are bearing this quietly.  There is definitely anger, but this anger is gradually changing to questioning, which is precisely what we are doing today.  We are looking at the policies we have and whether they are succeeding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The household charge issue has been badly handled.  I will not argue for or against it, that debate is for another day, but it has been badly handled.  There is much confusion which there need not be.  There was a methodology with regard to those who could not afford the &euro;100 but this message is not going out.  As a result we are refuelling an anger that need never have been refuelled at a time when things were going the right way.  If I were to make any appeal on this issue it would be, in the interests of the country, for the Minister not to make threats.  A few days remain before the end of March and it does not work like that with the Irish, being who they are and with their tenacity of character and history.  Ban something or make a threat and one will find the Irish will go the other way.  I will not lecture a good Minister but he would be wise to back off a little from the type of threat he is making.</P>
        <P>I do not know how many people will be involved but let us say it will be 50%.  If penalties are added on to the &euro;100 does anybody believe even the penalties will be paid?  We are trying to convince a huge body of people that the country is getting back on its feet, which I believe it is and we have a new sense of confidence.  I remember the time of the tax on shoes with Jim Kemmy, God be good to him.  It was a small issue but it brought down a Government.  I do not want to revisit this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must get the environment right and provide positive leadership.  What are the yardsticks for progress?  The first is jobs as if one does not have a job one has a problem.  The second is one&rsquo;s home if one cannot pay one&rsquo;s mortgage and one&rsquo;s roof is being threatened.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We had great announcements at the beginning of the year from the IDA which were probably exceptional for the first two months of the year.  We have hidden assets, and I am not speaking about oil or gas.  I am speaking about tourism.  It might not seem as tangible as the wonderful exports we have, but anything that feeds into the tourism industry should become a priority because tourism spreads throughout the entire country.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to get it right on the household tax, not because of the &euro;100 but because of morale.  It is also important to focus on the main issues of jobs and houses.  While we may need to have the cut and thrust of debate and criticise policy, 70% of our commitment should be partnership and working together.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>In dealing with this debate we need to examine one or two issues with regard to the economy.  This morning I referred to the cost of health care and that we spent &euro;13.4 billion on it last year and brought in &euro;13.317 billion in income tax.  We need to communicate what services cost because there is a total disconnect between what people feel they pay for and what they get.  In real terms it costs &euro;257 million per week to run our health service.  This is a lot of money to run any service and it is extremely expensive to run the health service.  The household charge will bring in &euro;126 million so it will not pay for health care for one week.  These are the figures.</P>
        <P>We must look at what we have in health care.  I could criticise Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling this motion but it is a valuable opportunity to consider what is constructive in the country.  Many aspects of our best health care service are the best in Europe and we are very critical of it.  Our prenatal mortality rate is the lowest in Europe at 4.5 per 1,000 whereas France&rsquo;s rate is approximately 12 per 1,000.  We provide many good health services but we do not give credit for this.</P>
        <P>Despite the cutbacks, and we must create economies of scale and efficiencies, we have come from 1.2 million people having medical cards in 2002 to more than 1.7 million having medical cards on 1 March 2012 and this figure is rising.  This sends a message in itself and it is why we need to be constructive about how we run the country.  To get a medical card one needs to be below a certain income level.  It is frightening to think 1.7 million people fall within the criteria for a medical card.  It sends a clear message on the task we face in dealing with this economic crisis.  The income levels of people have decreased and they qualify for a medical card.  We need to understand that by the end of the year more than 2 million people may have a GP-only card or a medical card and this is what we must deal with.  This is why we need to be constructive about forward planning for the next five years.  The Government is doing a very good job of maintaining services while creating efficiencies.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and I hope it has four more years to go to do the rest.  Therefore, the first part of the argument is very weak indeed.  With regard to education in particular, the commitment as part of the bailout was to reduce education spending over the five years by &euro;750 million.  The Minister has to address himself to that brief.  Any Minister would have to do the same.</P>
        <P>I am surprised that third level fees are mentioned in the motion before the House.  Senators are aware that the original proposal came from the Labour Party.  I say that as a Fine Gael man.  If the Labour Party had not intervened some years ago, fees could be &euro;6,000 by now.  As it is, they are too high.  I have two children at college.  It is a bit rough that fees of &euro;2,250 will have to be paid in each case.  However, the equivalent sum is &euro;6,000 in the North and &euro;10,000 in England.  I am anxious to ensure such levels are not reached here.  We need to resource our universities because they have slipped out of the top 100.  That money has to come from somewhere.  A difficulty arises in that context.  The modest increase in the registration fee is tough but reasonable in the current context.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am sorry for speaking so briefly.  In general terms, the provision of front-line services for disadvantaged people has been maintained.  I refer, for example, to the services provided through DEIS schools, the general allocation model and resource and learning support teaching.  I am sorry to say that the Fianna F&aacute;il motion fails with regard to education.</P>

	<P>If it is doing well, we will applaud it.  I will admit to anybody that progress is being made in certain areas of government, particularly the agriculture industry.  I have no major fault to find with the way the Government is approaching budgetary reform and trying to get us out of our economic difficulty.  Having said that, its agriculture policy is based completely on the Food Harvest 2020 programme that was developed by the former Minister, Deputy Smith.  Equally, its fiscal policies are very much based on the policies it lambasted when we tried to pursue them under the former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen.</P>
        <P>I am amazed by how quickly the Government has become disconnected as arrogance has crept in.  People said we were arrogant when we had been there for a long time.  This Government has only been in office for a year, but the same thing is being said.  Last week, it was unable to produce a Minister to enable this debate to take place.  It was shameful.  The fiasco at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform took place in the same week.  Despite its huge majority in both Houses, the Government was unable to secure a majority at that forum.  The members of the Government need to get real.  They should look into themselves as well.  We will help them as much as we can.</P>
        <P>One or two areas that are of interest to me have not been mentioned yet.  When the Government was elected, it made a huge issue of electoral reform.  It said it would reform the D&aacute;il, abolish the Seanad and reorganise local government.  We are still waiting for all of that.  D&aacute;il reform seems to be melting down to a reduction of six in the number of Deputies.  Talk about labouring to produce a mouse.</P>

        <P>If the Cathaoirleach will indulge me, I will conclude by mentioning a local issue.  I have raised the Shannon LNG project on several occasions in this House.  The project will create 500 jobs and guarantee energy security for years to come.  It seems that the two Ministers involved cannot agree how much progress has been made.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, knows all about the red tape that is involved.  If we were in government at the moment, the howling would be heard from here to Timbuctoo.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about the project before it goes to some other country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to the House.  A debate like this is a useful opportunity.  It allows the Government to look at its record and mark itself.  It gives us a chance to correct the Government&rsquo;s papers.  Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy said that the Government honoured 60% of its election promises in its first year.  Does that mean the other 40% will be reneged on, or will they be honoured?  We had not set the untruths at that higher percentage.  We will see how the next year goes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s colleague from the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, has been very active since the Government took office.  With the exception of the Minister for Finance, he is probably the best-known Minister throughout the country.  He is not well-known because he is handling things well; he is handling things very badly.  The household charge has been a debacle.  It is not going to work.  The Government is expecting to get &euro;100 from 1.6 million people.  Less than one fifth of them have paid the charge to date.  I am hearing on the ground that people are confused about how they can pay.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a politician, I will pay the charge because that is the law of the land.  As a Cavan man, I will wait until the day before the deadline before I do so.  It is better for me to have &euro;100 in my account than for it to be in the Minister&rsquo;s account.  The administration of the charge has been handled very badly by the Minister and the Department.  People who are anxious to pay the charge do not know how they can do so.  The Minister has also reneged on the Fine Gael promise to provide grant aid for people who need to upgrade their septic tanks.  Such a provision was not included in the legislation and has not been included in the guidelines.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator Landy alluded to the closure of Clonmel barracks, which is a disgrace.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, and his Government colleagues are closing the Defence Forces&rsquo; facilities in Clonmel, Mullingar, Castlebar and D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill in Cavan town.  They claim that savings will result from those closures.  I am most familiar with D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, which is the most modern barracks in Europe.  It is a purpose-built facility that costs little more than &euro;250,000 to run, including the fuel for the Army vehicles.  When it closes next week, 140 personnel will transfer to Athlone, Dundalk and Dublin.  It will cost the State some &euro;30 million to provide additional accommodation for them.  What does the Government propose to do with the barracks that are being closed?  I have it on good authority that it intends to sell the excellent and modern purpose-built facility in Cavan town to another State agency.  Where is the saving if that happens?  Some &euro;3 million will be lost to the economy of Cavan town.  If one State agency sells a building to another, it will be a farcical exercise and no saving will be made.  The cost to the State of providing accommodation for the troops that are being moved from the four barracks that are being closed will be &euro;30 million.  It is a disgrace and a shame.  I wish I had more time to point out some other difficulties.</P>

In regard to the student registration fees at third level, it is worth noting that under the Fianna F&aacute;il Administration the student registration fee increased by 950% between 1996 and 2011.  The era of free fees ended under the last Government many years ago.  In contrast, regrettably, the increase in the last budget amounted to 12%.  It goes without saying that the last thing the Government wanted was to introduce change or take from education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a parent of three children in university next year I will feel the pinch, as will everybody.  The Government has rightly concentrated on the top priority which was to protect the pupil teacher ratio, resource teachers and the SNA allocations.</P>
        <P>The motion proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il calls on the Government to protect front-line services in education in particular to the most disadvantaged.  I remind Senators that the DEIS scheme was fully protected by the Labour Party in the budget.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>If one looks at the &euro;13 million enhanced capitation we have got &euro;2 million worth of schoolbooks funding for DEIS schools and the &euro;26 million investment in the home-school community liaison will be continued for 2012.  The five existing scholarship schemes for higher education are being replaced with a single bursary style merit based scheme with awards set at &euro;2,000 per student.  The bursary will be an additional support to incentive and reward high achievement for students from DEIS schools.  All DEIS second level schools will be given targeted support by a more favourable staffing ratio of 18.25:1.  This is a 0.75% reduction compared to the 19:1 ratio in non-fee paying schools.</P>
        <P>I refer to small schools and the constant bombardment from the Opposition.  When Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats were in government in 1992, Fianna F&aacute;il published a Green Paper which sought to close all schools with fewer than four teachers.  That seems to be forgotten.</P>

	<P>It is as if Fianna F&aacute;il was not in government or that it is not facing up to its responsibilities when it was in government.  I cannot sit here and take a lecture from Sinn F&eacute;in either.  A classical example of that party trying to have it both ways, is that it opposed the changes to small schools south of the Border while north of the Border it is seeking to close the small schools.  One has got to be honest about it and give credit where it is due for what the Government has achieved in its first year.</P>

	<P>It is important to point out that what we on this side are doing is affording an opportunity for both sides to mark their card.  Rightly, the Government side should defend what it has done in the past year while we point out the flaws. The Government should be reminded that it is not so much about what it has been doing in the past 12 months that is critical but the long list of pre-election promises made to the electorate, which now feels let down.  It was a bit like Roman emperors of yore arriving back from some far flung part of the Roman empire to the Eternal City to claim their birthright.  That was how many of them felt when they came back last year.  We all applauded the fact that there would be a fresh change.  However, as politicians we also knew there was an underlying obligation on the part of the Government to ensure it tried to get back what was lost.  That is a main focus of the Government but the people were asked to cast their vote for it on the basis of a whole range of statements made during the election campaign, most of which have not only not been adhered to.  It appears likely the reason they were made was that the Labour Party would get a majority in order to have Deputy Eamon Gilmore as Taoiseach and on the part of Fine Gael to ensure it would have an overall majority and Deputy Enda Kenny would be Taoiseach.  Both sides are guilty of over-egging the political pudding.  In fact, the lads and lassies did not have to do it at all, except to turn up, such was the unpopularity of the last Government.  It has made a bags of it and this has come back to haunt it.</P>

	<P>I have many quotes.  In the middle of the election campaign on 11 February 2011, Deputy Eamon Gilmore said the agreement had to be renegotiated.  I am sorry this will emphasise the Labour Party because I have some from Fine Gael also.  On 11 February Deputy Eamon Gilmore said there was a pile of stealth taxes contained in the Fine Gael Party document &mdash; &euro;21 per month for a family with two children and child benefit, an increase in car tax, water charges, and a 2% increase in VAT and a social welfare cut.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The Fine Gael press conference took place on 18 February.  Fine Gael in its pre-Christmas budget submission set out the areas it would not cut back: the disabled, pensions, carers and the blind.  On 19 February, RTE news stated that child benefit would not be cut and Deputy Eamon Gilmore and the Labour Party would not agree to have child benefit cut any further  On 21 February, he said third level fees was a red line issue.  In regard to child benefit cuts Deputy Eamon Gilmore said families had suffered enough as it was and had seen their pay packets plundered.  On 22 February, under the heading, &ldquo;Protecting Families&rdquo;, he said the budget that really mattered in the election was the family budget, the household budget.  The economics that really mattered in the election were the home economics.  The things that really matter to families is whether the next government will work for children and do the right thing for the next generation.  Now the Government wonders why it is so unpopular.  It is because it fooled the people and is so doing the people voted for the Government.</P>

	<P>I will deal with one issue.  On 8 February 2011, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, was in Roscommon town and gave a commitment to maintain the service at Roscommon County Hospital.  He said he did not come to the town lightly and that those in accident and emergency, knew Fine Gael would maintain the service.  The T&aacute;naiste gave a similar commitment.  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, gave a strong commitment and said he would reopen the hospital if it was closed.  That is all very fine but the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has allocated &euro;20 million to the accident and emergency unit in Wexford General Hospital, and he is supposed to be the Minister for cutbacks.  It is okay to take the accident and emergency unit in Roscommon County Hospital because it has no Labour Party seat, nor will it have.  The Fine Gael Party won two seats but it will not win them again.  It will be lucky to get one seat on the occasion of the next election because the one it had is gone. The Deputy concerned jumped ship and had to do so because he gave so many commitments to Roscommon County Hospital following which he was elected.  Fine Gael won two seats by false pretences in the constituency of Roscommon-Leitrim but it will not happen again.  The people can be fooled once but not twice.</P>

In this he implied to hell with Roscommon and everything else.  He secured his seat and he did not care.  That is what bought it for the people.  They are being treated like second-class citizens and the Minister who is supposed to be in charge of reform, does not want to come to the House.  At least the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, has come to the House.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, was appointed by the late Garret FitzGerald as a Member of this House and he does not have the good manners to come to the House and try to justify his actions.

	<P Just="Left">The Government had committed to producing a report card on ministerial performance and the performance of various Departments.  The Taoiseach, good publicist that he is, made this firm commitment on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  I acknowledge that some progress has undoubtedly been made by the Government and that there are difficult economic times.  This year is not as difficult as the preceding three years.  Bearing in mind that it may be difficult for some on the Government side to stomach some criticism after only a year in government, Fianna F&aacute;il, as a responsible Opposition party, is trying validly to remind them of what they promised before the election and in the programme for Government.  I doubt many Members would speak to the public as they have spoken to some colleagues in the House today.</P>
        <P>The Government outlined what it would do.  It spoke about education.  I have considerable regard for a number of Senators present who speak on education.  Determining the means by which we educate young children is most important.  Anyone who looks back at the recent budget will say it has been a disaster in regard to education and bringing young people through these difficult times.  That is a fact.</P>
        <P>My colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il have outlined, through their various portfolios, where they see the Government going wrong.  I told the Minister of State I am still seeking action on mortgages.  What is the most serious consideration for people today?</P>

        <P>I agreed with Senator Whelan this morning that it is an outrage that the chief executive of Bank of Ireland is paid &euro;850,000.  Although Senators have talked about cutting salaries and reducing the salary of the Taoiseach to &euro;200,000, a decision I fully applaud, Ministers, when they appoint their friends to help them out, breach the salary cap time and again.  People are sick and tired of this.</P>
        <P>I wish the Government well.  As Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan said, we want this country to improve.  I believe that, as a group, we can work together to achieve that, but not without protecting the family home and ensuring there is liquidity for businesses, as desired by Senator White.  Butchering the capital programme will not create jobs.  Unemployment has increased the Government&rsquo;s much-vaunted jobs initiative.  The budget was to be a jobs budget.  Unemployment among the workers who are still here has increased from 13.7% last July to 14.3%.   This is a fact.</P>
        <P>Ireland has many challenges to face.  I advise the Government to set aside the politics of spin and PR.   It should tell the people what it cannot do.  It should not tell the people it has not cut basic social welfare rates.  That does not wash with them.  It should not tell people it has not touched income tax.  While it may not have done so, it has introduced indirect taxation.  It should consider the problems it is having because of the household charge.  With regard to that charge, local taxes need to be paid.  We will be paying the charge and we support it, but the manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Clotting Factor Concentrates and" RHead="Other Biological Products Bill 2012"> 
    <Title>Clotting Factor Concentrates and Other Biological Products Bill 2012: Second and Subsequent Stages</Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The purpose of the Clotting Factor Concentrates and Other Biological Products Bill is to transfer responsibility for the procurement of the national stock of clotting factor concentrate products and other biological medicinal products from the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital which is the national centre for hereditary coagulation disorders and also the national haemophilia centre.  These products cost the health system approximately &euro;37.6 million in 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are approximately 2,000 people with haemophilia and related disorders in Ireland.  Approximately 600 people have haemophilia while 900 have von Willebrand disease and another 500 have other rare bleeding disorders.  In anticipation of this transfer, administrative arrangements have been put in place to ensure the change in contractor happens as smoothly as possible with no disruption to the supply of products for those patients who require them.</P>
        <P>The clotting factor concentrates and other biological medicinal products covered by this legislation are almost all non-blood or blood product based and are classed as medicines.  Accordingly, it is no longer necessary that the IBTS should have a role in their procurement.  All stakeholders agree it is now more appropriate that St. James&rsquo;s Hospital be responsible for the procurement of these products as it has, in most cases, the primary role in the clinical management of patients to whom these products are administered.  The National Haemophilia Centre and the National Centre for Hereditary Coagulation Disorders are based at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
        <P>It is of paramount importance the products purchased are as safe and efficacious as possible.  In this regard, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, as the new contract holder for these products, must take the advice of a product selection and monitoring advisory board on the safety and efficacy of all products prior to selecting the successful tender bid.  Membership of this advisory board includes the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre, clinical consultants and nurses, the National Virus Reference Laboratory, the Irish Medicines Board, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health.  This system has been working effectively since the establishment of the advisory board in 2001.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The advisory board also monitors developments in clotting factor concentrates and other biological medicinal products, both nationally and internationally.  It consults the World Federation of Haemophilia on specific issues, where necessary.</P>
        <P>By enabling St. James&rsquo;s Hospital to become the contract holder for the procurement of these clotting factor concentrates and other biological medicinal products, it will result in a more streamlined system of procurement for the products.  It will also result in much better value for money for the health budget in their purchase.  Even though usage of the products has increased between 2009 and 2011, savings have been made on overall purchase costs.  For example, purchase of factor VIII increased by approximately 5 million units and usage of factor IX by 3 million units between 2009 and 2011.  However, even taking this increased usage into account, the cost of these products to the health system has decreased from almost &euro;40.8 million to &euro;37.6 million in the same period &mdash; a decrease of &euro;3.2 million.  The removal of the IBTS&rsquo;s commission on these products, which was agreed in anticipation of the procurement function being transferred to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, has resulted in overall savings to the health system.</P>
        <P>Section 1 gives St. James&rsquo;s Hospital board the authority to procure and make available clotting factor concentrates and other biological medicinal products used for the treatment of coagulation disorders such as haemophilia.  Up until now, while it could procure products for its own use, it could not procure and supply to other hospitals.</P>
        <P>Section 2 reassigns the legal responsibility for every contract entered into by the IBTS or its agents for these products to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital board.  Section 3 revokes paragraph (1) of Regulation 4 of the Blood Transfusion Service Board (Establishment) Order 1965, as amended, which assigned the function of procuring clotting factor concentrate products to the IBTS.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is straightforward legislation which will give St. James&rsquo;s Hospital the authority to purchase and supply the national stock of clotting factor concentrates and other biological medicinal products.  The procurement process, which includes an assessment of all products by relevant clinical and scientific experts, provides assurance to the consumers of the products, mainly members of the haemophilia community, that they are getting the safest products possible.  As a result of the implementation of this legislation, the State will get much better value for money without any impact on the service it provides for patients with haemophilia and other coagulation disorders.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this Bill which is technical in nature and makes some improvements by giving all the responsibility for the procurement of clotting factor products to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  It is a good opportunity to remember the system&rsquo;s failings for people with blood disorders in the past.  When we consider legislation such as this it is a reminder of the many people and families affected by past procurement system failures.</P>
        <P>Will there be any resource implications at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital as a result of this transfer of function?  I have been told the chief executive officers of all the Dublin hospitals met recently over a collective &euro;110 million shortfall in their budgets.  Will the Minister of State refer to this point?  If the amount in Dublin is &euro;110 million, what will be the total figure for the country?  Will this issue lead to additional budgetary demands on the Department of Health and, in particular, the HSE?</P>
        <P>It is good that full responsibility will clearly lie with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  I also welcome the requirement that the monitoring committee, which was established on an<i> ad hoc</i> basis in 2001 and to which the Minister of State referred, be consulted.  My next question was raised in the Lower House, but does any measure in the legislation oblige St. James&rsquo;s Hospital to act on or accept the advice or does it have plenipotentiary independence to refuse the committee&rsquo;s advice?</P>
        <P>I do not want to delay the House.  I thank the Minister of State for her attendance and we welcome the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill to the House.  It is administrative legislation, in that it tidies up a situation.  The Government and the Department received legal advice to the effect that the Bill was required to transfer this aspect of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service&rsquo;s work to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  It is a short Bill of just three sections and the Minister of State outlined its purpose.</P>
        <P>The Bill covers a small number of people, but it is important that proper and correct structures and procedures be put in place.  This is what the Bill achieves in respect of the approximately 2,000 people who are directly or indirectly affected.  It is a question of learning from mistakes and tidying up the existing legislation to ensure there are no loopholes.  The Bill addresses these issues where the management of this important process is concerned.  All of the parties involved &mdash; the Department of Health, the HSE, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and the Irish Haemophilia Society &mdash; agree with the proposals and the administrative arrangements being made to prepare for the change envisioned in the Bill.  Although the amount of work being done will increase, the cost will not.  This is welcome.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is important that its provisions be put in place at an early date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  She is actively engaged in a series of areas and is already achieving results.  She will have my full support and that of many other Senators in her views on alcohol sponsorship in sports.  This matter needs to be tackled by someone of her mettle.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am a surviving Member of the Seanad from the time of the lamentable situation of hepatitis C infections owing to impure blood products.  It was a great tragedy.  People were compensated, but there is no compensation for the serious diminution of health, sometimes to the point of death.  A number of women with families received transfusions of infected blood and their families were left behind.  It was a most tragic and avoidable episode.  For this reason, the Bill is good legislation, as it seeks to avoid a repetition of that situation.  I hope it succeeds.  Since one can never plan everything out of existence, let us not pretend that something might not happen.  However, the Government is doing everything it can through this Bill to ensure there is no repetition.</P>
        <P>According to the Minister of State, there are approximately 2,000 people with haemophilia and related disorders.  I am familiar with haemophilia, but not with von Willebrand disease.  Perhaps I should know more about it.  I am surprised that, whereas 600 people have haemophilia, 900 people, representing one third or 50% more &mdash; I am not good at arithmetic &mdash; have von Willebrand disease.  I am curious about whether it is closely related to haemophilia.  Should we know more about it?</P>
        <P>It seems a perfectly logical concentration of resources to make St. James&rsquo;s Hospital the procuring and dispensing agent.  It will lead to economies in terms of time management, efficiency and so on.  I am parochial, in that I am a Trinity College graduate and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital is a Trinity College teaching hospital.  In this light, I am pleased that the hospital should receive this accolade.  I do not mean to diminish any other hospital, as they all have their specialties.</P>
        <P>As the Minster of State mentioned, it is of paramount importance that these products be safe and efficacious.  This goes almost without saying.  The membership of the product selection and monitoring advisory board seems to fulfil all of the criteria.  I hate the word &ldquo;stakeholders&rdquo;.  It is an ugly word that has intruded into the language and is thrown around all over the place, but the board&rsquo;s members are what one could describe as the stakeholders.  They have an interest in the matter and seem to be reasonably representative.</P>
        <P>According to the Minister of State, the Bill will result in better value for money for the health budget in terms of purchasing and so on, but her later comment was interesting, in that the economies to be achieved will be of great significance.  She stated: &ldquo;For example, purchase of factor VIII increased by approximately 5 million units and usage of factor IX by 3 million units between 2009 and 2011.&rdquo;  Despite these increases, the cost decreased by &euro;3.2 million.  Can this be explained?  When the Minister of State claimed there would be efficiencies, I believed they would owe to the economies of scale derived from concentrating the sourcing of a considerable amount of blood products and doing a bargain with suppliers.  However, it now appears that there have been inefficiencies.  Perhaps I am unfairly maligning people, but a substantial increase in the number of units leading to a decrease in cost is an unusual phenomenon, even in the eyes of someone as financially illiterate as myself.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I may have had a momentary aphasia, but I believe the Minister of State omitted the next two paragraphs in her speech.  If I am correct, what was the reason?  I do not wish to embarrass her, although she is indicating that she omitted them.  The paragraphs refer to an alert card, which is a good idea.  Will this measure go ahead?  The second paragraph addresses the triaging of people with severe haemophilia and so on without delay.  The alert cards would be significant in such situations.  Were the paragraphs omitted because this measure is still under negotiation?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Minister of State for her actions.  With this and other sensible legislation, she can be assured of my success.  What am I talking about?  She can be assured of my support.  It has been a long day.  I apologise for my little errors, which I am sure will be obliterated from the record.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for her detailed statement on the Bill.  I commend Senator Norris for his eagle-eyed sharpness in noting that she omitted two paragraphs from her script.  She pointed out the Bill does not give rise to cost or resource implications for St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  The legislation provides for the transfer of responsibility for the procurement of clotting factor concentrates to the hospital, which is sensible given that it is the primary service provider in this area.  While the transfer will also offer cost savings, the most important outcome will be improved efficiency and safety.  I support the Bill and urge the House to do likewise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  This is a short and technical Bill but I take this opportunity to thank all those who give blood in this country.</P>
        <P>I welcome any legislation that allows for streamlining of services and improved efficiencies in the health sector.  I support the Government&rsquo;s efforts in this regard.  The Bill shifts responsibility for procurement of clotting factor concentrate products used in the treatment of haemophilia and other disorders from the Irish Blood Transfusion Service to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, which is the location of the National Haemophilia Centre.  This follows from an agreement reached last year on facilitating the transfer arrangements agreed between the IBTS, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, the HSE and the Department of Health.  The change is accepted and supported by the Haemophilia Society and I understand from my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, that it will offer significant savings of approximately &euro;3 million.  These savings show that if we go through expenditure line by line we can achieve efficiencies without impacting on front line services.  In the general scheme of things, &euro;3 million is a relatively small sum but if we can achieve similar savings across all Departments we will have done a good day&rsquo;s work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question arises as to why this was allowed to continue for so long when it could have been resolved a long time ago.  That is not the Minister of State&rsquo;s responsibility, however.  We support her efforts to save money and achieve greater efficiencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is not often that we debate a Bill that is short and efficient.  Given that the products concerned are now being classified as medicines, will the legislation allow St. James&rsquo;s Hospital to procure new blood clotting factor products or does it solely cover named products?  Clotting products were originally completely blood based but that is no longer the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for facilitating the passage of this legislation.  It may be late in the day but Senator Norris was wide awake in spotting that I had left out a couple of paragraphs.  I did so purely because our time was cut short by two votes and, in order to facilitate Members in making their contributions, I thought it best to keep my own comments short.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps they can go into the Official Report as being read.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Several Members asked about the resource implications of the Bill.  There are no resource implications for St. James&rsquo;s Hospital because it already produces a range of other products and is incorporating this function into its existing large volume of work.</P>
        <P>As Senator Cullinane noted, projected savings are &euro;3.2 million.  That is to be welcomed and I agree with the Senator on the considerable potential for achieving efficiencies across the health service&rsquo;s &euro;13 billion budget without impacting on front line staff.  That was the thinking behind the comprehensive review of expenditure and work in this regard is ongoing between the Department of Health and the HSE.  The &euro;3.2 million in savings will be achieved despite an increased volume of work because the 19% commission charged by the IBTS is being removed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is huge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is a considerable sum.  Senator MacSharry asked about the product selection, monitoring and advisory board.  This board has been working effectively since it was established in 2001 and there are no plans to change that arrangement.  Heretofore IBTS has taken its advice as required and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital will be similarly required to heed its advice under the new arrangement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris asked about the number of people affected by haemophilia.  While only males contract haemophilia, it is passed through female family members.  Females can also suffer from a range of other clotting factor conditions, including von Willebrand disease.  This explains the numbers, although they are surprisingly high.  We do not hear as much about von Willebrand disease as we do about haemophilia.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe asked about the reclassification of these products as medicines.  The legislation enables St. James&rsquo;s Hospital to purchase new products as they become available.  The Irish Medicines Board licences any new medicines that come onto the market in this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill will enable the procurement of these products to be undertaken in the most cost-efficient and effective way without compromising quality and safety.  People with haemophilia and other coagulation disorders can be reassured that the contractor for these products must take the advice of national experts on products available before it enters into contracts.  Clinicians at St James&rsquo;s Hospital and other haemophilia centres are kept up to date on international developments in haemophilia through the National Haemophilia Council and the product selection and monitoring advisory board.  I am very pleased to support this legislation and conclude its Second Stage in the Seanad.</P>

This issue concerns once again the continued asset stripping of community resources, particularly from rural areas.  I have raised a number of these issues in the past with various Governments, including the issue of the Bethany homes in Carlow &mdash; also the location of the issue I am raising now &mdash; Abbeyleix in my home county of Laois and Valentia hospital.  Many of the cutbacks are mean-minded, hamfisted and inefficient because, in the long term, they lead to greater Exchequer expense.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have visited St. Dympna&rsquo;s Hospital in Carlow the resource that is the subject of this matter and have been immensely impressed.  St. Dympna&rsquo;s Hospital deals with people with intellectual difficulties of one kind or another and emotional problems and is very much a community-based service.  I was very impressed by the environment, the staff and by one of the patients who remembered me.  It took me some time to recall him, but I had a long conversation with him and he was extremely flattering about the impact the services have had on him personally.  I believe he is a person who will suffer if the services are cut back or abolished.  It would be wrong to do that.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">It has been suggested that staff levels at St. Dympna&rsquo;s Hospital, and in the STEER system in particular, are above the average.  This fails to take into account that many of the staff complement work in a remarkable intellectual disability unit in the grounds of the hospital.  If this was taken into account, the situation would be clearer.  This is matter that is not just parochial and of importance to Carlow.  It is symptomatic and for that reason it is being taken up actively by the Psychiatric Nurses Association.  Mr. Des Kavanagh, the general secretary of the PNA made the point that people in the Carlow region are extremely annoyed to see model services that have been built up in this area over a long period being slowly dismantled.  He said that clients have had services cut, outreach services have been halved and in the case of a very effective service, the supported training education employment referral, STEER project, it was being dismantled completely.  He went on to say that the result of this scale of cutbacks on services would be to outwardly put more demands and costs on other areas of psychiatric services in the long run.  All of those concerned in the mental health services are united in demanding these cuts are reversed.  In the long run, these cuts are not cost savings.</P>
        <P>The assertive outreach service, which provided much needed support to service users will be effectively halved.  This move, as well as being unfair to service users and staff, is short-sighted and will cause an even greater spend in the long run.  These clients now face even greater risk of relapse.  STEER supported and reassured patients and gave them opportunities that ensured they were integrated in society and given possibilities that made them less likely to relapse.  It also improved their quality of life and gave them access to choices and helped them return to education.  Its work was very impressive.  It may seem to those who might be intellectual snobs, with university degrees and so on, that the level of attainment is quite small &mdash; FETAC and so on &mdash; but that level is a huge achievement for somebody with an emotional or intellectual disability, difficulty in adjusting and who has never had the benefit of systematic or proper education.  For them to achieve this is remarkable.</P>
        <P>There is also a service entitled Clann Nua a name that tells us it provides a &ldquo;new family&rdquo;.   Clann Nua provides a familial environment for vulnerable people.  It is a day service for clients living in hostels and sheltered accommodation.  The service users in question whom I know personally are completely dismayed at the possibility of the loss of this service as it is vital to them.  They find assistance from it with everything, from managing their budgets to medication management.  It is significant for them to get this assistance from people they have come to know and trust.  The alternative management centre is a considerable distance away and puts unbearable difficulty on them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The STEER approach is to move clients away from the industrial unit sheltered workshop base back to mainstream work or education, rather than keep people within the mental health services area.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree this is important.  This system motivates patients.  The figures are impressive.  In one year, there were 176 job referrals.  The results of the intervention are that people are happier as noted in the shifts of mood recorded &mdash; STEER keeps detailed records &mdash; even after just the third session.  For people who experience this kind of difficulty, it is important this service should be available.  There is significant contact with groups that can provide jobs, such as F&Aacute;S, FETAC and so on.  These organisations maintain personal contact with the management and tutors and like to get referrals from STEER because of its reputation.  Prior to the STEER programme, people would have remained unemployed for years.</P>
        <P>The impact of the proposed reconfiguration will be that the assertive outreach programme will be damaged.  It provides a service for 26 active clients who are among the most vulnerable users.  Crisis intervention will also be inhibited.  With a single nurse on duty, it will not be possible to have crisis intervention and this will hamper the capacity for relapse prevention and early detection.  The day services will also be affected.</P>
        <P>I remind the Minister of State that this is a situation where there are vulnerable people and where it is possible there will be cutbacks to the services.  I have raised the matter of cutbacks in other areas where it has been shown that there was mean-minded application of HIQA criteria, like closing a facility because of peeling paint.   Does the Minister of State seriously believe that bothers people?  Perfectly adequate facilities are being closed down, with a destructive impact on the community and an ultimate cost on the Exchequer although it may appear there is an immediate saving.  I appeal to the Minister of State to look again at this situation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am replying to this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has responsibility for disability, equality, mental health and older people&rsquo;s issues.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In line with A Vision for Change, a comprehensive change programme which will deliver a modern patient-centred quality and responsive community-based model of mental health services for the people of Carlow, Kilkenny and south Tipperary is currently under way.  Central to this is also the closure of old long stay institutional-type facilities.  To this end, the HSE has developed a very detailed plan for the further development of mental health services in the Carlow-Kilkenny and south Tipperary areas in line with A Vision for Change<i>.  </i>This plan will see the majority of patients and clients being treated in the community by enhanced community mental health teams, newly formed home-based treatment teams and the expansion of the acute day services and day hospitals in both Carlow and Kilkenny.  These comprehensive community services will mean that far fewer people will require care in an acute inpatient hospital setting.</P>
        <P>The budgetary situation in 2012 will challenge all areas of the health service to provide continuity of services that are both appropriate and safe for patients.  Like other care areas, savings are being required from the mental health service.  Due to staff retirements from Carlow mental health services, there is a requirement for the HSE to reorganise services and to match staffing resources with service and activity priorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">STEER, the supported training education employment referral programme, to which the Senator referred, is a community-based vocational rehabilitation service which provides assistance for mental health service users to gain access to mainstream education and employment.  It is currently staffed by one whole-time nurse.  It is proposed to redeploy this staffing resource to Carlow day hospital.  The provision of the STEER service will continue; however, it will now be provided by members of the community mental health team.</P>
        <P>In addition, it is proposed to redeploy allied health professionals to assist with the provision of this important aspect of a person&rsquo;s recovery and integration into mainstream activities.  I very much welcome the general approach which the Senator outlined that STEER has taken in regard to bringing people closer to mainstream services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am also glad to say that it was possible in budget 2012 to announce a special allocation of &euro;35 million for mental health services.  This funding will be used primarily to strengthen community mental health teams in both adult and children&rsquo;s mental health services.  I think we all agree it is important that we get best value for our available resources.  We need to co-ordinate our efforts and work together to develop mental health services in line with the recommendations in A Vision for Change.  In essence we need to provide more with less and, in effect, this has already been successfully achieved in mental health service provision in other areas.</P>
        <P>This House can be absolutely assured of the Government&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to our mental health services.  The provision of an additional &euro;35 million in the current very difficult economic circumstances is evidence of our commitment in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is a very good stand in for the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, whose speech she read.  I know all about A Vision for Change and remember when it was produced.   I read it and discussed it with some of the people who were looking for it.  However, it has not been fully implemented.  It has been partially implemented in order to save money.  The Minister of State spoke about the closure of old long stay institutional-type facilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">These are the ones the people want.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the needs of the community and to ask the community.  The Minister of State said the plan would see the majority of patients being treated in the community by enhanced community mental health teams and newly formed this, that and the other.  I simply do not believe that will happen because the resources are not available.  Will the Minister of State suggest to her colleague that she ask those people who are actively employed and working extremely hard in this area what their view is?  If one wants to know the truth, one should ask the people who are at the receiving end of, and who are delivering, the service?  They are the people who know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am not for one moment trying to defend what has happened up to this current year.  We all know the problem is that A Vision for Change was not implemented.  However, there is a very strong commitment on the part of the Government to ensure it is implemented and that is why an additional &euro;35 million has been provided this year and will be provided for the next three years at least in this regard.  Anybody who has heard the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, speak about this issue and witnessed the actions she has taken in the past year will not be in any doubt about her commitment in this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and thank him for coming to the House to take this matter.  I did not think in the last D&aacute;il that I would be in the Seanad speaking to him about a model railway but I will explain why it is very important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fortunately, Malahide has seen substantial investment in Malahide Demesne and Malahide Castle for a number of years.  In January 2009, a &euro;10 million investment in Malahide Castle was announced to develop the craft courtyard, open up the castle and to do what the Minister of State and his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, have been speaking about in regard to improving our tourism product and accessibility.  Malahide Castle and Demesne is a fantastic facility.  I met the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, on 3 February when he was turning the sod which did not grate with me, even though we announced the investment back in January 2009.  I was glad to see him there as it will create 80 jobs with the anchor tenant being Avoca Handweavers.</P>
        <P>Leaving that aside, I will outline for the Minister of State the geography of the area.  He will visit Malahide Cricket Club, of which I am a member, the week after next.  It was glad to secure &euro;500,000 to create an international one day ground in Malahide.  Right opposite where the Minister of State will visit the week after next is the Casino House which is a very important architectural building at the entrance to Malahide.  It is a thatched building which, unfortunately, has fallen into some disrepair.  It is managed by NAMA.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A very generous individual, the late Miche&aacute;l Gaffney, bequeathed &euro;1.5 million in a trust to secure the Casino House on the basis that the Fry Model Railway, the largest model railway in Ireland, was returned to its rightful place in Malahide.  That would do two things.  First, it would return the model railway to what was its home for years and, second and most important, it would protect a very important building in Malahide which is currently vacant, on which I think the Minister of State would agree with me, given his portfolio.  We saw what happened in Belcamp College.  It was stripped bare, thus destroying a &euro;250,000 building.  We have agreed contracts with NAMA of &euro;600,000 and have ample money &mdash; &euro;1.5 million &mdash; to purchase the building and restore the 1.9 acres around it, as well as the walled gardens, to their former glory.  We have full planning permission to add on a coffee shop which I reckon would create six to eight jobs adjacent to Malahide train station.</P>
        <P>What is crazy about all of this?  One would think that if one was offered &euro;1.5 million, we could do all of this without requiring any money from the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department and that everything would be great.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Bus &Eacute;ireann plans to spend &euro;1 million doing up the Eblana Theatre in Bus&aacute;ras and to locate the largest model railway in the country in a bus station in the middle of Dublin.  The irony of that is not lost in that Bus &Eacute;ireann is there to run buses and certainly not to run model railways.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I served with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in Fingal County Council and we know each other very well.  I advised him of this on 3 February.  I do not want to see this opportunity being lost.  It would be a terrible waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money for Bus &Eacute;ireann to spend any money locating this exhibition in Bus&aacute;ras.  If that happens, we will lose the &euro;1.5 million bequeathed, we will not be able to purchase the Casino House and we will not be able to bring the Fry Model Railway back to Malahide and create six or eight jobs.  There is unbelievable community support for this, both in Malahide and the surrounding areas, and within Fingal County Council.  Two of colleagues from the council, Councillors Darragh Butler and Eoghan O&rsquo;Brien, have raised this matter in the council which is fully supportive.  We want this to happen and I hope the Minister of State can help us achieve it.  If he has a spare two minutes when he is visiting Malahide cricket club the week after next I will bring him across the road and show him how fantastic this facility could be.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to respond to the Senator on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who is on his way to Brussels to attend a meeting of EU transport Ministers.  He apologises for his absence.</P>
        <P>I understand that in 2009, Fingal County Council applied to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for tourism capital investment support to renovate Malahide Castle.  The project includes works to provide improved visitor services along with interpretation and presentation improvements to the gardens.  Grant aid of &euro;3.5 million from F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been approved for the project which is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.  Overall, this is a &euro;10 million investment for the purpose of enhancing the existing tourism facilities in Malahide Castle and gardens.  It is expected the renewed castle and gardens will cater for 250,000 visitors per year.  This is good news for Malahide and for Dublin.</P>
        <P>Part of the renovation at Malahide Castle necessitated the demolition of buildings within the grounds including the building that housed the Fry Model Railway.  The deed of covenant attached originally to the sale of the model railway bestowed it to Dublin Tourism.  When notice was received of the renovations Dublin Tourism approached the four Dublin local authorities and the Office of Public Works to try to find a suitable home for the Fry Model Railway.  These efforts were unsuccessful.  Subsequently, Dublin Tourism received unsolicited submissions from a number of interested parties to house the railway.</P>
        <P>The board of Dublin Tourism considered it vital that a suitable home be identified for the collection as soon as possible and approved a process which set the following criteria: the collection and the rolling stock must be kept together; it should be kept in the Dublin region as a visitor attraction; it must be on exhibit to the public during certain opening hours; the deed of covenant must be adhered to; and it would be preferable if it could be kept in public ownership.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given these criteria Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Bus&aacute;ras building was the only suitable party identified as a potential home for the model railway.  Some months later a group from Malahide approached Dublin Tourism with information concerning a related private bequest and the potential to house the railway in another building in Malahide.  From the outset this group was informed that Dublin Tourism had already entered into negotiations with another party and that the process was well advanced.  On the 16 January 2012, Dublin Tourism amalgamated with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is now in advanced negotiations regarding the best possible future use and promotion of the Fry Model Railway and expects the matter to be concluded in the coming weeks.  Any final agreement reached will be in keeping with the terms of the original covenant which bestowed it to the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will bring to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland the points made by the Senator in order that they can be taken into account by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in reaching a final agreement which I know will be in the best interests of Irish tourism and the use of this important and unique asset.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">For the clarification of the Minister of State, his reply states that Dublin Tourism received unsolicited submissions from a number of interested parties to house the railway.  Last week the organisation stated it had had a public competition to this end which was not correct.  I contradicted it at the time and I am glad to see Dublin Tourism has changed the statement.  Its efforts to find a suitable home were intended simply to store the railway not to provide a permanent home.  The answer that was provided for the Minister of State is therefore not correct.</P>
        <P>Can I take it from the answer, which states that any final agreement reached will be in keeping with the terms of the original covenant of bestowal to the State, that no final decision has been taken?  When he sees the Malahide Casino I am sure the Minister of State will agree that within his portfolio there is an opportunity to secure a very important building that would locate this fantastic collection adjacent to a train station.  Any person in his or right mind would not believe Bus&aacute;ras could be used as a tourism hub for such a unique collection.  All the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, need to do between them is knock a few heads together and ensure this.  No agreement has been entered into as per this answer.  Let us not waste &euro;1 million.  I am sure we can find some very good projects in Kerry to spend it on, or anywhere else around the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I raise this issue because I have been in contact with the board of management and the principal of Gaelscoil Philib Bar&uacute;n in Tramore, County Waterford, for many years and have supported them in their battle for a school and capital funding.  A meeting was organised with Oireachtas Members last week, with representatives present from the Minister of State&rsquo;s party and the Labour Party, along with an Independent Deputy and myself.  We spoke to a large number of very angry parents.  I told them the anger needed to be turned into action and that we should meet the Minister for Education and Skills as soon as possible.  I also gave a commitment to table this Adjournment motion in order to put the record straight on the history of this school.  I will give a brief outline of that history.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In September 1985, Gaelscoil Philib Bar&uacute;n opened, with 29 pupils.  It was a one-teacher school located in Pond Road, in Tramore.  In 1989 the school moved its three teachers and 65 pupils to Stella Maris House in Pond Road, Tramore.  In 1992 a site was identified in Tramore but in 1993 planning permission was refused for it.  In 1994 a second site was identified but in 1995 planning permission was again refused.  In 1996 a series of meetings began with council officials in regard to identifying a new site.  That was the case until 1999 when further consultations took place with the county manager.  In May 2000 the Department of Education and Science instigated a study of the school&rsquo;s demographics and projected growth and an eight-classroom building was recommended for a 2.5 acre site.  In 2002 the purchase of a site was finally agreed but because of the urgency of the gaelscoil&rsquo;s accommodation needs temporary prefabs were offered by the Department and the board of management reluctantly agreed to this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In January 2003 Gaelscoil Philib Bar&uacute;n moved to an incomplete site following prolonged delays and difficulties with some of the contractors working on the site.  The school&rsquo;s pupil population doubled in that year.  In 2004 an application was made for additional temporary accommodation, which was granted.  In 2005, the Department sought a new study of the school&rsquo;s projected demographics which was completed in May of that year and sent to the Department.  The school heard nothing back.</P>
        <P>In 2007 the board of management awaited the appointment of a design team.  That happened and a priority rating of band 2.2 was given to the school.  In 2009 a series of public meetings was held.  A big meeting in Tramore was attended by parents, pupils and politicians who heard about the long plight and struggle the board of management, teachers and headmaster fought to get the necessary funding.  In 2011 they finally received very good and long overdue news when it was announced the school was moving to architectural design stage.  Earlier this year a design team was put in place.</P>
        <P>The situation is that since 2000 children have been taught in prefabs.  Every time I drive into Tramore I look to my right at one of the major roundabouts and I see all the prefabs which have been there for so long.  I have given the Minister of State a brief history of what the school has had to do.  It has jumped through all the hoops and over all the hurdles.  An architectural study was carried out and a design team put in place.  There are pupils who have never experienced a communal school with a proper hall &mdash; that is what they told us at the meetings.  Given the history of the school&rsquo;s long struggle for proper school buildings the pupils were flabbergasted to be left out of the five-year programme.   It is unacceptable that those pupils must wait until the five-year programme is over before they can resubmit an application.  An Oireachtas Member from the same party as the Minister of State stood up at the meeting and said that he cannot and will not make any excuses.  Why is that?  It is because there is no excuse or justification of the exclusion of the school.  In all of these matters, there are winners and losers but in this situation, given the history of the school, the fact that pupils have been taught in prefabs for so long and the fact that it was at the architectural stage, it is crazy that there are provisions in the capital programme for schools without a board of management.  I hope the Minister of State has good news because there are angry parents at the school and they will not give up on this issue.  We must put pressure on the Minister for Education and Skills to ensure he makes the right decision and grants the school the appropriate level of funding.  It costs &euro;65,000 a year to rent these prefabs.  It is not good enough and something must be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ring</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects in the next five years and to clarify the current position of the application for major capital funding from Gaelscoil Philib Barun, Tramore, County Waterford, whose roll number is 19885B.  The Senator may find it helpful if I set out the context within which decisions relating to meeting the accommodation needs of schools must be considered in the coming years.  Total enrolment is expected to grow by some 70,000 students between now and 2018 &mdash; by over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary.  Second- evel enrolment is expected to continue to rise until at least 2024.  In order to meet the needs of our growing population of schoolgoing children, the Department must establish new schools as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department&rsquo;s budget for the coming years.</P>
        <P>The five year programme announced on 12 March will provide more than 100,000 permanent school places, of which more than 80,000 will be new school places.  The remainder will be the replacement of temporary or unsatisfactory accommodation.  The project for Gaelscoil Philib Barun is intended to provide a new eight-classroom replacement school plus teaching accommodation for three full-time special education teachers and appropriate ancillary accommodation including a general purpose room.  The new building is to be provided on the 2.5 acre site where the school is currently located in temporary accommodation.  The eventual removal of the prefabs will form part of the project.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The project is at an early stage of architectural planning.  A tender exercise to appoint a design team was recently completed and the design team will shortly be authorised to proceed to develop the detailed design.  The project will continue to progress through the design stages up to and including securing planning permission and the preparation of tender documents.  In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  The five-year programme is focused on meeting those demographic needs.  In that context, it was not possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.</P>
        <P>All school building projects, including the project for the gaelscoil, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible at this time to give an indicative timeframe for the progression to tender and construction of the project.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s response says that the project is at an early stage of architectural planning and acknowledges the need for a new building on a 2.5 acre site owned by the Department.  However, it reads as if this is an impediment.  The school is more advanced than most schools in the capital programme.  This school is at the architectural design stage and the design team has been appointed.  Schools that do not even exist, with no boards of management, are being provided with funding, yet this school, which has been fighting for 26 years and whose pupils have been taught in prefabs since the early 2000, is not included in the capital programme.  It is simply not good enough and the Minister of State should pass on a message to the Minister for Education and Skills that we cannot have schools that exist only on paper being provided with funding while a school that has jumped through all the hoops and over all the hurdles is badly let down.  The decision needs to be reversed and I impress upon the Minister of State the need to bring this back to the Minister for Education and Skills as a matter of urgency.</P>
