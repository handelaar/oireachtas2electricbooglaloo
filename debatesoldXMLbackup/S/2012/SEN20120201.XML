    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il</i>] &mdash; Report Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 1.15 p.m.; No. 2, motion for earlier signature of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 1; No. 3, statements, questions and answers on local government reform, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2 and not to exceed one and a half hours, with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed five minutes and the contribution of the spokesperson for Sinn F&eacute;in not to exceed 2 minutes &mdash; Senators are asked to confine themselves to one minute when asking the Minister questions; and No. 21, motion No. 6, Private Members&rsquo; business, to commence at 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m.</P>
        <P>For the information of the House, I have secured a commitment from the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs to discuss the EU fiscal treaty next week.  At this stage I anticipate it will be the first item, after the Order of Business, on Tuesday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for securing a commitment from the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, on the holding of an important debate.</P>
        <P>On the proposal concerning Report Stage of the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011, will the Leader allow additional time should it be required?  The debate is due to conclude at 1.15 p.m.  If Members are still offering, will the Leader give a commitment that he will extend the time allowed?  I await his response before agreeing to support the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>As I said, I am pleased the Leader has secured a commitment from the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, to come to the House next week.  I am concerned about a report in the newspapers this morning in which a senior European official is quoted as saying, &ldquo;We drafted the text for the treaty so that he [the Taoiseach] has a chance to avoid a referendum.&rdquo;  That is extremely serious.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the official&rsquo;s name?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As part of its negotiating position, did the Government request EU partners to water down the treaty in such a fashion that the people would not have a say in what is probably the most important fiscal treaty to be passed since we joined the European Union?  What is the Government&rsquo;s position and does the Taoiseach deny that this is the case?  Does the Government deny this report from Europe that &ldquo;we drafted the text of the treaty so that he has a chance to avoid a referendum&rdquo;?  If that is not a subversion of democracy, I do not know what is.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My party is pro-European and on its behalf I call on the Government to give a commitment that the people will get a say on this new fiscal treaty, which will tie the hands of this country for the next ten or 15 years, in good and bad times.  This is one of the most serious departures we have seen.  Is it the Government&rsquo;s negotiating position to say to draftsmen and EU colleagues that it does not want the people to have a say on the treaty and it should be drafted in such a way?  Does the Government accept that the treaty was drafted to suit it?  Did the <Col N="3"/>Government, specifically the Taoiseach and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, request specifically that the text be drafted to subvert Irish democracy, in effect?  I will ask her next week.  This is one of the most serious actions a Government can take.  The Government has a mandate from the people but is afraid to seek another.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated we will provide time next week in Private Members&rsquo; business for a proper debate on smaller rural and minority faith schools.</P>

	<P>Good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It was very interesting to hear the responses of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, yesterday.  I put Government Members on notice that the Minister has stated he will facilitate a cost review of these schools, taking in 600 schools across the country with 50 or fewer pupils.  He will examine where schools can be amalgamated.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Bureaucracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Education is not just about cost but about our children and the future of the country.  Will the Minister and his officials on Marlborough Street simply examine schools on the basis of cost, efficiency and proximity to other schools?  Some 25% of the schools to be affected by the changes brought in by the Government and cuts in education are minority faith schools.  Any true republic that does not respect its minorities does not deserve the title of republic.  As the Government has not afforded time in this Chamber to discuss education cuts, the Fianna F&aacute;il group will next week move to have a detailed discussion on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am reminded of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> when I hear Senator O&rsquo;Brien suggest that this treaty, an international agreement among 25 member states in the EU aimed at trying to save the economic system within the EU, has been drafted to subvert Irish democracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No, the Government&rsquo;s position was to do everything in its power to ensure there would be no referendum.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>What does that mean?</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate in this House with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on waste management, following the excellent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; report last night on the fiasco concerning the incinerator at Poolbeg and the decision making by the executive of Dublin City Council against the wishes of the elected representatives on a number of matters to do with waste management.  This takes in not just the incinerator but also privatisation of waste collection and the transfer of the service to Greyhound, which has led to enormous problems in waste collection across Dublin city.  There is a real issue for us to debate at a broader level about where responsibility for waste management policy should lie.  Should it be with the employees of the council or should it be referred back to elected representatives?  I would like to see a debate here whenever the Minister can facilitate it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The whole thing should not have been privatised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on blasphemy law.  There was an excellent briefing yesterday from Professor David Nash of Oxford Brookes University, a leading expert on blasphemy, who spoke about the international impact of the passage of the 2009 Defamation Act in Ireland, particularly section 36, which created a new statutory offence of blasphemy.  There was an excellent debate on it in this House, and many colleagues participated in it.  There is an issue as there was an adverse international impact, with certain countries adopting Irish arguments on blasphemy and using this to bolster prejudice against different religions, even Christian religions in Islamic countries.  We have also seen that Ireland has gone against the EU norm in adopting a new statutory definition of blasphemy based on a definition of offence.  It is outdated and I am glad it is up for review in the programme for Government.  We must move forward by having a debate in the House on how we can ensure incitement to religious hatred laws are strengthened in the Statute Book.  We no longer need an offence of blasphemy.</P>
        <P>I will refrain from mentioning a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> that too much testosterone makes for bad decisions, with a study from University College London suggesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that if there is too much testosterone in a meeting, co-operation goes out the window.  As it happens, tomorrow we will debate the Electoral (Amendment) Bill with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, which will for the first time introduce enforceable targets for political parties to adopt in selecting more women candidates.  I hope that will lead to better decision making in Ireland and less testosterone in meetings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for promising to bring the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs to the House next week to discuss the treaty on stab<Col N="5"/>ility, co-ordination and governance.  Like most of us I am in the process of studying it and will form my own view.  I look forward to the upcoming discussion.</P>
        <P>I will address two matters, the first of which is the universal periodic review.  Members are aware that Ireland&rsquo;s human rights record was subject to its first universal periodic review hearing last October, and the report of the working group on Ireland&rsquo;s review, also known as the outcome document, will be adopted by the Human Rights Council during its 19th session on 16 March this year.  Of the 126 recommendations contained in the outcome document, the Government has examined and accepted 62, and 49 recommendations are currently under consideration by the Government, with responses to be provided before the Human Rights Council session in March.  Some 15 recommendations, the majority of which pertain to reproductive rights and combating racism, have been rejected.</P>
        <P>The commitments made by the Government during this process and the potential for further commitments to be made before the adoption of the outcome document should yield significant improvements in the area of prison conditions, children&rsquo;s rights, gender equality, mental health, freedom of expression and combating racism and discrimination.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to the Chamber to advise and debate with Senators as to the status of the 49 recommendations under consideration, and to outline how the relevant Departments plan to build on the exemplary consultation process with non-governmental organisations and civil society in the lead-up to Ireland&rsquo;s review and the next review of 2016.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a second issue, although I will not repeat my requests in detail.  On 18 and 25 January I asked that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs be invited to the Seanad to address questions on the proposed children&rsquo;s rights referendum, the interim measures for children currently detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, the new children and family support agency and the potential to use the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance report card as the basis for this debate.  I know there is much talk of referendums in the air but I advise Senators that the children&rsquo;s referendum needs to take place.</P>
        <P>I will give a reason for this.  There are 2,000 children in long-term foster care and the referendum would make them eligible for adoption.  Once these children turn 18, that right is extinguished, so as the days and months roll on, let us be conscious that as we deliberate, we are potentially denying these children what everybody agrees should be allowed, namely, the security of being part of a family.  I repeat my call that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs update this House on the status of the children&rsquo;s rights referendum.  The issue cannot be debated any longer and we must change it.  There are 2,000 very good reasons to have that referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I call for a full debate on the economy.  I am not entirely critical of the Government.  It has been responsible for some good management.  I did not have the opportunity to contribute yesterday but I am sure the question of Davos was raised.  I wish to raise it again because it seems to me that we did not go mad. I strongly resist that statement.  I remember saying in this House &mdash; and being joined by people on all sides of the House when the situation occurred first &mdash; that it was not the Irish people who went mad.  One has to look at the audience to which the Taoiseach was addressing himself.  We have been told that we have to pay out money to gangster banks and hedge funds to prevent reputational damage.  What reputational damage was done by the Taoiseach speaking to this international audience of bankers and people who were partly responsible and saying we had all gone mad?  There were those among the audience who were at previous meetings in Davos where they had awarded  a special accolade to Anglo Irish Bank for its practices.  They were the ones who went <Col N="6"/>mad and this was an opportunity that was lost to tell the international audience that the Irish people were suffering to pay for the stupidity and foolishness of the German and French banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The other thing that concerns me is the statement of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  He is a highly intelligent man and said the referenda were undemocratic.  That is an extraordinary statement, but we see this all across Europe.  It is a general trend.  In the heart of democracy in Greece a Prime Minister was removed because he dared to suggest questioning the people.  A referendum is democratic.  I understand some of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s reasons.  He mentioned that, for example, issues such as bin charges, the household charge and other extraneous matters could be brought into the debate.  However, he referred to two other issues, namely, the bailout of the banks and the bondholders.  Those are relevant issues that it would be proper and correct for citizens to consider during a referendum.</P>
        <P>My third concern is the exit from the public service because it is uncontrolled.  That is highly dangerous.  It seems to me that we are in danger of cutting out the lean and allowing the fat to remain.  How many redundant management jobs are going?  People in front-line services are going.  They are going because of the economic situation in the same way that a number of our colleagues after the previous election saw the opportunity to take the pot and the good pension.  I heard the man who was involved in the reform of the National Health Service in Britain say that the way it was being done was absolute chaos.  It is like the decentralisation process in reverse.  It is uncontrolled, not targeted and it is damaging.  For those reasons I call for a major debate on the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate the call I made yesterday for the Attorney General to make an early opinion available as to whether a referendum is necessary.  While the Government does an excellent job and punches way beyond its weight in Europe I do not believe we are so influential that we can dictate the text of a European treaty to suit ourselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what negotiations are for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on cool heads to prevail and to await an early opinion from the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>I also have a slight concern about the management of the mass redundancies within the public sector.  I wish well in their retirement to the 7,000 to 8,000 people who have decided to go.  I ask the Leader to facilitate the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to come to the House for a question and answer session on what crisis management systems are in place.  I have no doubt there is a rapid response team in place to ensure that the flexibility we are told is available and that is part of the Croke Park agreement will kick into force.  This will be a defining moment on the Croke Park agreement as to whether it does what it is supposed to do and creates the flexibility.</P>
        <P>It is also important to remember that for every 100 public servants only three are retiring &mdash; there are still 97 left.  We are a country of 4 million people.  Surely to God, 97 out of every 100 can be flexible enough to ensure that people will not be affected on the front line.  I call on the Leader to facilitate an early question and answer session with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left"><i>The Irish Times</i> today exposes the situation on the proposed treaty.  The people should be given an opportunity.  With respect to the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s town, the Taoiseach did not bring home the bacon.  He did not bring anything home.  The treaty is only endorsing the austerity measures in place.</P>

        <P Just="Left">We are having a second re-run of the discussion on the treaty this morning based on the comments of some unnamed official.  The position should be quite clear, as it has been since 1973.  If anything arising in the financial compact arrangement impinges on the Constitution there will be a referendum and the people will be consulted.  We did not have a referendum to discuss the bank bailout.  We did not have a referendum to discuss any of the recent harsh budgets which have impinged greatly on the public, so let us be a little mature and cop ourselves on.  If a referendum is required it will be held.  It is rather pathetic, as my colleague Deputy Phelan said last night on another show, to see a once great party such as Fianna F&aacute;il now trying to out-Sinn F&eacute;in in order to try to find a political purpose.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The question I had intended to ask if Senator Leyden had not made such a silly intervention is whether the Leader would consider inviting the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, to the House in the coming weeks to discuss the Government&rsquo;s concept of a decade of commemoration.  This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Ulster Covenant and there was the 1913 lockout, the First World War, the 1916 Rising, the Anglo-Irish War, the treaty and the civil war.  All of these need to be debated and commemorated with sensitivity.  I would like that debate to be instigated.</P>
        
        <P>I did not agree with Martin McGuinness&rsquo;s interesting contribution last weekend to the effect that the next few years could see a referendum in Northern Ireland on the future of the Six Counties.

	<P Just="Left">One question is whether the provisions of the Constitution require a referendum to permit participation in such a treaty.  There is another argument for holding a referendum, namely, democratic legitimacy.  This morning, the Technical Group in the Lower House indicated its intention to avail of Article 27 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann if the Government did not seek to proceed via referendum.  Under that Article, the support of a third of Deputies and more than half of Senators is required to petition Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann to put the matter to the people.  It will be for Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann to take counsel from the Council of State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Referendums and decisions of this kind can be viewed in two ways.  I disagree with my good friend, Senator Bradford, in this respect.  We can take the view that we should have government <Col N="10"/>by elites and that the important factor is to get the result.  If that means admitting the people to the decision as little as possible, so be it.  This is a dangerous road to take at a time when something of that nature seems to have occurred in Greece and Italy, given the change in governments there.  The other route is to involve people, to have a definite opinion ourselves and to seek to educate public opinion as we go.  The people would understand that accepting and rejecting the treaty would each have difficult consequences and that this decision cannot be subjected to a populist anti-Government impulse concerning unrelated issues.  Too much is at stake.</P>

	<P>Yes.  The Technical Group is to be commended for claiming it will seek to the have issue put to the people regardless.  I can support the idea.  I will reserve my position on the treaty until I have had a chance to consider it, but it should be possible for people to favour a referendum and a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  I will support the Technical Group&rsquo;s petition should it come to this House and I encourage colleagues on all sides of the House to take a similarly positive view.  At this time, we need to promote the idea of democratic legitimacy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>The article gives the impression of a lifestyle that is like an &ldquo;Hawaiian massage&rdquo;, but this could not be further from the truth.  For the many people living on social welfare alone, it is not a life of luxury.  The individual in question obviously does not have many overheads, for example, children attending school or college or a car on which she needs to pay insurance or tax.  It is not a fair or balanced article.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Social Protection to refute some of the statements made in the article and let the people of Ireland know that it is not a life of luxury?  Working people will be annoyed by the suggestion that, while they are working and paying their way, people living on social welfare are having such wonderful lives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join Senator Conway in calling for a debate on public sector reform.  The Government intends to reduce public sector numbers to 282,500 by the end of 2015, which means that 37,500 people will have left the system since 2008.  Under the current scheme, 7,764 workers have applied.  Of these, 3,500 come from the health sector, some 3,000 of whom are employed by the HSE, 2,000 come from the education sector, including 1,500 teachers, 1,000 are civil servants from many Departments, 730 are local authority workers, 293 are garda&iacute; and 241 are from the Defence Forces.  According to Senator Conway, the 7,764 account for three out of every 100 or so public sector workers and the rest of the staff can be flexible enough to take up the slack, but this flies in the face of what many public servants are facing.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the House debated problems and delays with medical cards.  Any Senator who has contacted social welfare or community welfare offices knows how stretched they are.  I am in favour of public sector reform, but I would rather see pay being cut and capped at the top than I would a dilution of public services.  Number reductions will mean reduced services for people across the key Departments of Health, Education and Skills, Justice and Equality and the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P><Col N="11"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform should discuss his plans with the House, as I would like to hear more about the rapid response team and how it will play out.  I would also like to hear from the Minister for Health about how having 3,500 fewer workers in his sector will impact on health services.  I would like to hear from the Minister for Education and Skills about how the loss of teachers will impact on young children.  I would like to hear from the Minister for Justice and Equality about the loss of garda&iacute; and from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government about the impact that losing local authority workers will have on services.  We need a comprehensive debate on the impact that a reduction in the numbers working in these areas will have on the State's services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the undertaking by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to review the allowances that are paid across the public service.  I recall being invited to a meeting of representatives of one of the teachers&rsquo; unions in Wexford at the time the crisis first emerged.  When I queried the attendees on aspects of the issues they were discussing, I discovered that they were in receipt of some &euro;2,000 per year for <Col N="12"/>school yard supervision duties.  These are the types of mindless allowances which showed up a dearth of management within the public service.  I am pleased the Minister is taking action in this regard.  It is the first indication of action I have seen from him which might lead to savings.  I hope he will follow through on it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the statement yesterday by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, that the savings we must make will have to extend beyond merely a reduction in the numbers within the public sector to encompass re-examination of pay.  Most sensible people would agree with this.  The reality is that the reductions in numbers we have seen will yield savings of less than 25% of the gross pay of the staff concerned.  Some 50% will go on pensions into the future and of the other 50%, which is a gross saving, half will be lost in tax and universal social charges forgone.  When one adds in the lump sum, which is 150% of salary, there is very little return.  In fact, a rate of return valuation shows it will take approximately eight years, until 2020, before we begin to effect savings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who is well qualified in this area, has spoken about his meeting, as part of a D&aacute;il Technical Group delegation, with representatives of the troika.  He encountered little empathy from the troika in regard to the austerity being imposed on the populace, which he attributed to the fact that it is well aware of the very high salaries being paid at senior level within the public service.  The troika&rsquo;s lack of sympathy should be seen against the background of much lower salaries in other member states.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Finance to the House for a debate on this issue?  It is coming to the stage where we may have to call on the Taoiseach to attend for a debate on whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should be brought back within the Department of Finance if it is not delivering on the functions it was set up to carry out.</P>

        <P Just="Left">It is interesting that we find ourselves in a situation where the very notion of a referendum, which I had understood as a vehicle by which people could be given the opportunity to vote on proposed changes to the Constitution, has turned into an incendiary device.

	<P>Last week I raised the issue of Article 27 and the facility it provides for a majority of Members of this House to sign a petition requesting that the President not sign a Bill but instead put it to the people by way of referendum.  Even where a Bill is found by the Attorney General to be constitutional, it can and should be put to the people if the President deems it to be of such national importance that the will of the people ought to be ascertained.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party will ask Members of the Seanad, on this and the other side of the Chamber, to sign such a petition in respect of the Bill dealing with the new EU treaty.  I ask Members to support the petition even if they are in favour of the treaty.  Opinion polls show that some 75% of the people want a say on this treaty.  We should give it to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mark Daly suggested that 75% of people want a referendum.  I agree they should have a say, but the first consideration must be that they understand the proposals on which they are adjudicating.  All of the opinion polls to date were undertaken before the wording of the treaty was published.  I call for a sensible debate on the proposals, not on the question of whether or not they require an amendment to the Constitution.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on referenda in general, what they are for and how much they cost.  None of us should be afraid of a referendum.  Articles 27 and 47 of the Constitution provide for an ordinary referendum, known as a reference of Bills to the people.  These provisions have never been invoked, on the basis that there has never heretofore been good reason to invoke them.  The debate we should have is not on whether there should be a referendum but on the provisions of the proposed treaty.  Unfortunately, the entire debate thus far has centred on whether there will be a referendum rather than what is contained in the treaty.</P>
        <P>Regardless of how these proposals are handled, they will almost inevitably be challenged in the courts.  While I would not presume to advise the Attorney General or the President to do A or B, I am free to give my own estimation, which is that the President should refer the Bill to the courts to determine whether it is constitutional.</P>

The potential referendum on the new EU treaty is not the only referendum that has been discussed in the broader public domain recently.  Senator Paul Bradford referred to the possibility of a plebiscite on the future status of Northern Ireland, an issue which should form part of the debate we have called for on Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>We have seen several significant developments in recent times, with the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, recently attending a GAA match and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, undertaking to attend a Northern Ireland match and support the players in green jerseys.  In addition, the announcement that Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann will be held for the first time in the Six Counties, in Derry, is very welcome.  The presentations to this House by Ms Mary Robinson and Mr. Maurice Manning were fantastic occasions.  It was mentioned in the early days of this Seanad that we might invite the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to the Chamber.  Such an invitation would be an ideal context for the debate on the future of Northern Ireland.  It would give us an opportunity to discuss all of the useful co-operation that is taking place.  There is some fantastic co-operation taking place in respect of waterways, agriculture, sport, culture, language and so on.  It would be fitting to convey this to the First Minister and to do so in the context of a debate with him in this House on Northern Ireland and the future of this island.  We could also during such debate discuss the possibility of a united Ireland and a referendum in that regard.  Ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar&iacute;s ar an gCeannaire soil&eacute;iri&uacute; a thabhairt d&uacute;inn an bhfuil an cuireadh sin tugtha cheana don Ch&eacute;ad Aire agus don Leas-Ch&eacute;ad Aire, agus muna bhfuil, an bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist aige sin a dh&eacute;anamh agus c&eacute;n s&oacute;rt sc&aacute;la ama at&aacute; i gceist?</P>

	<P>I am mesmerised by the enthusiasm of the other side for a referendum, given, in particular, the lack of public meetings held by Senator Daly&rsquo;s party in south Kerry during the previous two referendums.  By way of information, when I met a sitting Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy at a referendum count and said to him that I had not seen him campaigning on the referendum his response was that his colleague in the constituency had not phoned him to tell him what to do.  I do not wish to put the Member&rsquo;s name on the record but that is what he said to me.</P>

	<P>There appears to be a great deal of misunderstanding about what is done with money collected through taxation here.  I attended a meeting last night which provided information on health care, which cost &euro;13.4 billion last year despite that only &euro;13.317 billion in income tax was collected.  Every cent taken in through income tax was spent on health care.  While there is much information available on departmental websites, there is a need for greater information to be put into the public domain.  This would allow the general public to identify areas wherein we are not obtaining value for money.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators referred yesterday to the need to get more information out on the new European treaty.  We need to start at home in terms of getting out information in regard to how the country is run and how money collected through taxation is used.  We should perhaps debate in this House the issue of how we can get more information out to the general public.</P>

     <Col N="15"/> <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I endorse Senator Mark Daly&rsquo;s proposal of last week in regard to Article 27 of the Constitution.  I note the Technical Group has jumped on that band wagon today.  However, it is important to credit the Senator with that proposal.</P>
        <P>I speak as someone who, contrary to what Senator Colm Burke said, actively canvassed for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in every European referendum, including before I became involved in politics.  I believe in a European Union that looks to the European and national interest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My principal difficulty with the current treaty is that it will be other countries rather than the European Commission who will tell us whether we did right or wrong.  Under this treaty Ireland could be sued by Germany, Slovenia and so on if we do wrong.  As such, we have moved away from the European Union which I have always supported, the European Union which Fianna F&aacute;il led the way in supporting.  Contrary to what Senator Burke had to say, Fianna F&aacute;il put vast resources into supporting European referenda.  Fianna F&aacute;il has a proud record of supporting the European Union.</P>
        <P>I am totally opposed to intergovernmentalism and to the idea of Germany, Slovenia or any other European country bringing us to court in respect of breaches of European law in terms of our deficit and telling us we should spend less and tax our people more.  That is completely wrong.  While this treaty deals with finances, who is to say that this different model of Europe will not continue into other areas.  This treaty proves that the veto is meaningless.  It is not about the right to remain outside something rather it is about stopping its introduction on a European basis.  The British and Czechs have vetoed this treaty.  If we value the European Union we should oppose this and go back to the drawing board to try to bring in Britain and the Czech Republic.  Not enough was done to bring those countries on board.  They should be on board.  This is a European community not a community of countries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am disappointed that Senator Colm Burke and a number of others are being somewhat selective in terms of past referenda.  While the Fine Gael leadership was commendable in terms of the manner in which it actively supported the second referendum on Lisbon, the same is not true of the Fine Gael membership on the ground.  I set up public meetings in my home town but local Fine Gael members would not join me on the platform.  This was repeated throughout the country.  Let us not be too selective in terms of what happened in respect of the second referendum on Lisbon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On whether there should be a referendum on this treaty, the will of the people must be reflected.  The storm clouds are gathering around this Government in this regard.  I remind the House that the view when the first referendum on the Nice treaty was put before the people was that no constitutional changes would be required.  The term widely used in this regard was that it was essentially &ldquo;a housekeeping exercise&rdquo;.  The Government of the day, to judge and reflect the mood of the people, put the matter before them.  The same argument is being put forward here today.  This is not about whether there should be a referendum on this treaty: it is about what the people want.  During the past 48 hours, every economic and political commentator, including the head of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, has questioned whether this <Col N="17"/>fiscal compact is in the interests of Ireland.  The real debate should be about whether this is in the interests of Ireland.  The best way of determining this is to put it before the people, following reasoned debate on the issue.</P>
      
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, to come before the House to explain what is going on in relation to hydraulic fracturing here.

	<P>I wish to raise again the issue of bank repossession of property, which issue arose last night on &ldquo;Ear to the Ground&rdquo;.  I saw most but not all of that programme and I was disappointed that the information provided was not complete.  The position is that a bank can repossess property, mainly machinery, following the completion of the legal process if one third of the payments have been made to purchase the property in question.  When a court judgment is handed down, a bank can apply for it to be enforced by the only individual, the county sheriff, empowered to enforce it.  The impression given on the programme to which I refer was that a bank can just tell anyone to repossess equipment on its behalf.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raised this issue on a previous occasion and wrote directly to the Governor of the Central Bank and the Ministers for justice and finance in respect of it.  I am not satisfied with the practice whereby the banks are continuing to interpret the law to their own ends.  What they are doing is not right.  Would it be possible at the earliest opportunity to try to bring more pressure to bear upon those institutions of the State which have an input in respect of this illegal practice on the part of the banks?  It is most disappointing that a programme aired on RTE last night did not provide full and accurate information.</P>

	<P>I apologise to Senator Cummins.  I take this opportunity to again congratulate the Leader on the tremendous innovations he has introduced in respect of the workings of the House.  The Leader has organised fantastic opportunities for Senators to speak in the House and for Ministers to be in attendance for debates.

I am in complete agreement with what he has done in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not wish to hurt the feelings of the Leader, who is doing his utmost, but there is an elephant in the room in the form of the fact that the Taoiseach &mdash; the leader of the country &mdash; has not come before the House.  I want the Taoiseach to come to the Seanad.  I have difficulty with the Taoiseach in the context of unfavourable comments he made regarding this House &mdash; the future viability of which he also questioned &mdash; when in certain salubrious surroundings, namely, at a dinner organised by Fine Gael.  He found himself in other salubrious surroundings at Davos last week and it appears that being there, in the presence of various world leaders, went to his head.  The Taoiseach forgot himself and began backbiting in respect of the people and stating that they had gone mad in borrowing money.</P>

	<P>Senator Moloney referred to an article in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> regarding a Polish national living in Donegal.  I wish to place on record my belief that the words attributed to this individual in the article in question do a disservice to Polish people who live in Donegal.  It was indicated that she referred to the town in which she resides as a &ldquo;s***hole&rdquo;.  That attitude is disgusting.  In an interview on Highland Radio earlier this morning, the Polish ambassador to Ireland stated that the article was distasteful and that he did not have much time for the person who made the remarks it contained.  Anyone who refers to a town in Donegal in the way outlined does not deserve to live there.  As everyone is aware, Donegal is the most beautiful county in the country.  It is important to clarify that the person who was the subject of the newspaper article in question was not speaking on behalf of the Polish community but rather on her own behalf.  I would welcome her exit from this country because of her attitude and not because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The issue of the fiscal pact is being debated by groups of people throughout the country.  The one question being asked is whether we will have the opportunity to hear a constructive debate as part of a referendum process.  I agree with Senator Harte that the court case relating to the by-election in Donegal was handled in a very poor manner by the then Government.  I certainly paid a political price for what happened. However, the advice given to the Government at the time by the then Attorney General was that the court case would not be successful.  We are now depending on advice from the current Attorney General.  I am not stating that her advice will not be valid or proper.  Regardless of whether the Attorney General recommends the holding of a referendum, the Government will take a political decision with regard to whether it should be held.  Is the Government going to afford the <Col N="20"/>various political parties and others the opportunity to engage in a debate on the fiscal pact?  We have not as yet seen the detail relating to the pact.  When that detail emerges, Members of both Houses should at least be given the opportunity to debate what is involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appeal to the Leader to encourage the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come before the House to engage in a question and answer session on the fiscal pact and on whether we are getting a good deal.  Why is there no mention of debt forgiveness at European level in the pact, which the people of this country are going to be expected to accept?  If a referendum is not held, this will attest to the scant regard for the views of the people.</P>

I raised this matter during our debate on job creation last week.  As many of the events relating to these centenary celebrations will be held in Dublin, we must examine innovative ways in which we might encourage the large numbers of tourists that will be attracted to the capital city to visit other parts of the country. As stated during the debate on job creation, we should consider the possibility of providing subsidised transport for tourists who come to the country and who can produce airline or ferry tickets.  As a result of the distances and the costs involved, we must consider the introduction of incentives designed to attract people to visit the regions and maximise the benefits the country will enjoy as a result of the many historic events we will celebrate in the next number of years.</P>

The Government is clear that if the Constitution needs to be amended, a referendum will e held.  This should be clear enough for everyone.</P>

        <P>With regard to the matter raised by Senators Moloney and Harte, I am not aware of the article in the newspaper on a person living in Donegal.  My experience of Donegal is that it is a wonderful county.  People who speak about the excesses of those living on social welfare should try to live on the basic social welfare rate themselves for a few weeks and see how they fare.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 118, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. <Col N="23"/> On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration,&rdquo; the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of those amendments.  There is also one amendment proposed by Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and Fianna F&aacute;il Senators to amendment No. 4 made by the D&aacute;il.  It was circulated yesterday on an additional list of amendments and it will be debated with amendment No. 4.  I have also circulated the proposed grouping of amendments in the House.  The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  A Senator may contribute once on each grouping.  I remind Senators that the only matter that may be discussed is the amendments made by the D&aacute;il and any proposed amendments thereto.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Government amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are being discussed together.  In amendment No. 1, in page 6, I am deleting lines 28 to 30.  In response to requests made during the debate in both Houses, and initially in this House, I have accepted that it would not be appropriate to retain on a record to be made available to the public, details of prosecutions brought for non-compliance with the provisions of the Bill.  I am therefore proposing that the original requirement in the Bill for water services authorities to enter details of prosecutions on the register is to be deleted.  Amendment No. 2&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire ar ais go dt&iacute; an Teach.  I welcome the Minister back to the House.  The specific amendments being proposed by the Minister relate to details of any prosecutions for an offence by the water services authority concerned.  The deletion of those lines does not mean that the offences and penalties contained in section 70M of the principal Act are deleted from the legislation.  The Minister is criminalising&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="24"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fudge to suggest that what we were seeking is being agreed to by the deletion of those lines.</P>

	<P>It was Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh who was seeking it rather than the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Prosecutions will still issue irrespective.  That will apply if a householder does not meet the required standard and we still do not know what that standard will be.  There has been no clarification of the golden standard that the Minister will introduce.  No one knows what it will be but we all presume it will be today&rsquo;s standard.  According to legislation, it is the standard of today&rsquo;s water we need to keep clean.  The Environmental Protection Agency is of the view that if it is the standard of today&rsquo;s water we need to keep clean that we will have to go with the most up-to-date standards, which have been accepted by the European Commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the deletion of the lines proposed because the word &ldquo;prosecution&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;offence&rdquo; should not be contained in this legislation.  Section 70M of the principal Act sets out all the offences and penalties contained in the legislation for non-compliance with whatever the new standard will be.  The Minister might explain what the deletion of these lines will mean for a person who does not have the resources to bring his or her septic tank up to the required standard, or for a person who believes his or her  tank meets the required standard on foot of having obtained planning permission and having adhered to the conditions that pertained to the planning approval for the house, or if any difficulty would arise for the person with a house built pre-1964, for which planning permission would not have been sought.  The Minister might clarify the detail of what is being proposed before we proceed further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; c&eacute;ad failte roimh an Aire leis an gceist t&aacute;bhachtach seo a phl&eacute;.  Mar at&aacute; a fhios aige, t&aacute; an cheist seo ag tarraingt cainte ar fud na t&iacute;re, go h&aacute;irithe na ciontaithe a bheadh ag baint leis an mBille.</P>
        <P>As the Minister is well aware, this issue has been the subject of a heated debate across the country.  People are concerned about this Bill and are keeping a close eye on every change being made to it.  I seek clarification in respect of the amendment proposed by the Government regarding the details of any prosecutions for an offence under this part brought by the water services authority concerned.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s stance on this is that prosecutions should not apply under this Bill.  Does the amendment proposed mean that prosecutions will be brought against people who do not comply with the Act?  If so, does it mean that such prosecutions will not be taken by the water services authority, or will they simply not be noted on the register?  Is that what this amendment is about?  If it is that they are not to be noted on the register, that is one issue, but if the water services authority concerned will not be taking any prosecutions or they will be taken by another party, the Minister might clarify that.  There is a great degree of unease <Col N="25"/>about potential sanctions under this Bill.  People in rural Ireland are up in arms over the potential costs this Bill will impose on them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another major issue is that a person will have the right under the Bill to refuse an inspector admission on to his or her land, but if the person does that, a prosecution could be brought against the person for that refusal.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of all these fears.  It does not appear that those issues have been addressed in any of the other amendments.  The Minister might clarify what exactly is meant by this proposed amendment.  Is what is proposed a deletion from the register or is it that the water services authority concerned will not be the body that will bring prosecutions, in which case it is not necessary for it to have that noted on the register?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a pointless amendment.  In one sense it is good because it means the local authority is not doubling on information in that it is already on the public record.  If one fails to comply with the legislation, if one commits the crime of adversely affecting the countryside or places of special interest, which is a crime under the legislation, in operating one&rsquo;s domestic waste water treatment plants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Should it not be a crime?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a crime.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is polluting water.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Should we have legislation without any sanction?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is polluting one&rsquo;s neighbour&rsquo;s water.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill provides that the owner of a premises connected to a domestic waste water treatment system shall ensure the system does not constitute a risk to public health or the environment and, in particular, does not adversely affect the countryside.  If one adversely affects the countryside in the operation of one&rsquo;s system, one is guilty of a crime.  One&rsquo;s prosecution will be recorded as part of the soft information of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any conviction will be recorded on a criminal record.  In fact, this section does absolutely nothing.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (<i>h</i>), which will become (<i>g</i>), allows the EPA to put any other information as it might determine on the record.  Presumably, it cannot put any prosecutions on the record but there is nothing to stop it from putting convictions on the record, if it wishes.  This is pointless.  It is a sop to rural Ireland to give the impression that the criminality under this legislation associated with ordinary people operating their ordinary systems is eliminated when, in fact, it is not.  The Minister is not giving them any help to upgrade their systems so that they can comply with the law.  All the Minister is doing is not requiring a local authority to do something that authorities will do anyway.</P>
        <P>This information will be on the public record.  It will be in newspapers because any prosecutions that are brought to court will be conducted in public.  There was no need to do this.  The legislation will still criminalise people.  They will be expected to maintain standards under threat of criminal liability and those standards are very unclear and, in the case I outlined, very broad.  There is no point in the Minister thinking that people are happy about this or that the anger has died down.  I could not believe it the other day when I knocked on doors about a road project &mdash; people are still up in arms about this.</P>

        <P Just="Left">That is one of the key problems with this.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service is independent of all of us and the Government, and thank God for it.  It has stated that this legislation could cost householders thousands, but the Minister and his party continue to ignore that.  There must be some way of assuaging that concern in rural Ireland.  My suggestion would remove the criminality aspect as well.</P>

However, the legal requirement to keep water safe is not a new requirement.  It is not being introduced in this Bill for the first time.  For anybody who pollutes the ground water in their area there is already a law in place.  That law is being implemented in this Bill.  It is a fallacy to say it is a new law.  The legal position, and it was the position when the Senator&rsquo;s party was in government, is that if anybody pollutes groundwater, they can, will and should be prosecuted.</P>

Senator Crown told us last week that if one drew a line from the German Embassy to the American Embassy, the line would run through his house.  I do not live in the embassy belt but in Cremorgan, Timahoe.  I am the proud owner of a septic tank and have been for 30 years.  The reason half the country is covered in septic tanks is the failure of promises made over decades by Fianna F&aacute;il Governments to put small schemes in place to address this issue.  Nonetheless, where I come from every family has a septic tank, and I am more concerned with what happens in the countryside and in places such as Rathdowney and Timahoe than with what happens at climate change conferences in Rio de Janeiro and Kyoto.</P>
        <P>It is a criminal act, and is morally wrong, to pollute a neighbour&rsquo;s water.</P>

	<P>It is interesting that Members opposite are making the point that they have to pay for the maintenance of their septic tanks.  In urban Ireland the council does all that.  That is why people should be given grants by the Government.  The Minister is talking about grants, but not about 100% grants.  He has said that in 2013 the Government will see how many septic tanks are not in compliance and then review matters.</P>

	<P Just="Left">That is why Fianna F&aacute;il is making the point that there should be a 100% grant.  Householders received planning permission and installed septic tanks in accordance with the laws and regulations at the time, and now we are changing the laws and regulations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not disagree with the need to upgrade septic tanks because we are polluting our own water supply.  The Senator made that point very well.  We need to have a good water supply.  We all know of the cases in Galway and elsewhere in the country where there are boil water notices.  The Fianna F&aacute;il position is that if someone has to take out a wastewater treatment unit in their own back garden, they should get a 100% grant for that.  That person complied with the law of the land at the time and did nothing wrong.  Now we are going to tell people in rural Ireland that they must spend &euro;1,700, &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000 to put in a new treatment unit because the existing one is not compliant.  We all know of planning authorities who are refusing planning permission because the ground will not take even the best wastewater treatment plant available.</P>

His officials know but we do not.  That is why we are asking for them to be published.  I know the Minister is conducting a review, but the matter should be brought back to the House in order that we can debate it.</P>
        <P>Let us suppose a householder is told to install the best standard available.  I return to the example of the two fields in Kerry where one neighbour is refused planning permission but the other has had a septic tank for the past 30 years and is told to install a new one.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish on this point.  It would be very interesting for the people of rural Ireland to know how much money we gave towards waste water treatment units throughout the country.  Could a percentage of the hundreds of millions of euro spent on that not be spent on upgrading septic tanks?  Those systems were funded from income tax, development levies and other taxes.  People who are now being asked to replace their septic tanks should get a 100% grant.  That is fairness.  The Revenue Commissioners say any tax law will be followed so long as there is fairness.  The problem with this measure is that there is not fairness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister back to the House.  I would like to clarify a particular point.  A reference was made which, although it is not relevant to this section, should be clarified.  The Minister referred to the Cavan model.  It has been mentioned in the D&aacute;il and by the Minister on radio and television programmes and throughout the country.  The Cavan model is an excellent one.  It has worked well in Cavan and is still doing so.  I was a member of Cavan County Council when the regulations were brought in.  Cavan was exempt from the recent European Court of Justice ruling because we had taken the initiative and brought in our own guidelines.  They have worked and are working.  As a result, Cavan County Council has been able to grant planning permission where otherwise we would not have been able to do so.</P>
        <P>When the Bill comes into effect, the so-called Cavan model will go out the window, so to speak.  We understand the new departmental guidelines will be totally different from the current Cavan guidelines.  If that is the case, and I await the Minister&rsquo;s reply on this, the Cavan model will cease to exist and planning permissions will cease to be granted in Cavan and other counties.  We ask the Minister for clarification on this point.  What guidelines will the Minister use and why is it necessary to introduce new fines relating to the pollution Act when the existing fines are adequate?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Inspections will visit upon people who are already in difficult economic circumstances the need to carry out necessary work.  I say &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; because if the work is necessary, it should be carried out.  However, if the work is necessary and householders cannot afford to carry it out, a grant should be available to assist them.  We are not saying that if a septic tank is found to be polluting, it should not be rectified.  Of course it should.  Anyone who suggests otherwise should be locked up.  However, a grant should be provided to allow those who could not otherwise afford to do so to rectify the situation.</P><Col N="32"/>
        <P>Further clarification is required on the matter of the legislation if grants are not to be provided.  If an inspection is carried out which finds that work needs to be done and the owner of the septic tank cannot afford to have it done, is the local authority compelled to carry out the work and then seek to be refunded?  Where will the local authority be refunded from?  People in rural Ireland are finding it difficult enough and very few could afford to pay &euro;18,000 or &euro;20,000 to rectify a septic tank.  In the absence of grant aid I see no alternative to local authorities having to carry out the work and seeking the money from the Department.  I ask for clarification of some of these points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Once again, I advise Members that we are dealing with a specific amendment.  On reading all the amendments which have been grouped together, it is the Chair&rsquo;s opinion that many of the contributions made so far could be made on other amendments.  The amendment under discussion has to do with prosecutions, fines and criminal offences as against civil offences.  I mention this in the interests of seeking brevity and also to allow the Minister to respond to the legitimate questions raised.  The Chair is of the opinion that much of what has been asked so far does not necessarily come under the amendment under discussion.  I am only advising Members that they need to look at the amendments and to be specific in their contributions in the interests of seeking clarification for which everyone is calling and which the Minister is very happy to provide.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about the contributions we made in this House.  The Minister might recall the very lengthy debates on the issue of prosecutions and the criminalising of people living in rural Ireland.  With respect, it is impossible to deal with the content of the amendment and the issue of prosecutions and fines without dealing with two substantive issues &mdash; standards which have not been set and grant aid in terms of what financial supports will be provided.  Therefore, we should be given some latitude because there are many&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  I also accept that we should only speak to the amendment before the House.  However, my point is that a number of Government representatives have spoken about scaremongering.  I have been consistent at any public meeting I have attended in that I have stuck to the facts.  The &euro;50 charge is a one-off charge and there is no re-registration fee.

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>In fact, the real issue is not necessarily what the Opposition parties are doing but rather that the Government has not been clear on what the standards will be.  It has also not been clear on what grant supports will be available.  What goes to the heart of the issue &mdash; this is the reason I have opposed prosecutions and fines &mdash; is equality.  My house is hooked up to a mains system.  I will give credit to the previous Government for spending &euro;300 million on a new waste water treatment service for the south east&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>It was well able to spend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which provides an excellent service for Waterford city, parts of south Kilkenny and Wexford.  It was a significant investment in upgrading the system at a cost of &euro;300 million.  All taxpayers, including those who live in rural Ireland, paid for the system as well as that in other urban areas to be upgraded, yet if the Minister introduces new guidelines and as a consequence, septic tanks have to be remediated, we are saying to people living in rural Ireland that if there is something wrong with their systems, they will have to pay for the work themselves.  This amounts to inequality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I fully accept that the Minister has an obligation under the European directive and as a result of the European Court judgment &mdash; we have indicated our support for registration and inspection &mdash; I reiterate that groundwater must be protected.  My party has asked the Minister to examine the issue of standards and we await his proposals.  We have also asked him to consider adopting a risk-based approach to inspections in order that septic tanks located close to public water supplies and lakes and rivers would be the primary focus for inspections.</P>

People living in rural Ireland have a fear that while this might be the case now, there is a real danger that at some point the European Union may force the Government to change the standards again.  The Minister will then come back, wash his hands of the matter and say it is not his fault but that of the European Union that the standards have to be changed again.  In that event, people will be required to upgrade their systems at huge personal cost.</P>
        <P>I will finish on this point because I want to confine my remarks to the subject of the amendment.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the fact that the Minister has come some of the way, but we are very concerned that some people who may be asked to upgrade and remediate their systems and who will not be financially able to do so could end up being prosecuted in court and having a criminal record.  This would be unfair.  As such, the provision should be re-examined by the Minister.  This will be his last opportunity to do so.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the absence of public meetings in Kilkenny.  I am sure he is getting it in the neck from people living in rural areas.  If he says this is not the case, he must not be out in his constituency because a lot of the people I have met in Kilkenny and elsewhere are very concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with that issue.  Fianna F&aacute;il Senators should be aware of the penalties provided for in the 2007 Act which was brought forward by their party.  The penalties are five years in prison and fines of up to &euro;15 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>For major offences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation does not provide for imprisonment.  The Senator is confusing it with the legislation brought forward by his party.  </P>
        <P>Senator Byrne is operating on the basis that we should not comply with a court judgment.  Ireland has lost a court case owing to the negligence of the previous Government to make a good case, with the exception of the Cavan model.  Even with the best legal advice and the alleged great negotiators in the then Government, the case was defeated in October 2009 in the European Court of Justice.  Now the Senator wants us to operate on the basis that this judgment has not been made and states we should neither comply with the ruling of the European Court of Justice nor the law.  He wants Ireland to break the law and face a fine of &euro;26,000 a day, to be clocked up from October 2009, when the previous Government lost the case.  The fines to the present day would amount to about &euro;20 million which he wants all taxpayers to pay, but I am not prepared to agree with this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what we want.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il is also against the introduction of provisions to protect groundwater, public health and the environment.  That is the implication of what the Senators propose.  They have a brass neck to even raise the issue.  To be fair to Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, he accepted on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il that it was necessary to provide for offences.  I, <Col N="35"/>therefore, suggest the Senators speak to him in order that they will be consistent about Fianna F&aacute;il party policy in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In response to Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh, while the legislation will introduce offences where a person fails to meet its requirements, a request to provide a valid certificate of registration or contravenes the requirements of an advisory notice, I am satisfied that the proposed penalties are proportionate and fair.  There has been scaremongering in recent months about the legislation, including in the Senator&rsquo;s own area.  It has been suggested armies of inspectors will descend on the countryside, even though I have already stated local authority staff will be the inspectors.  The Bill and the new inspection system will not alleviate or deal with any of the scenarios trotted out.  I know it makes a good political story, but I ask what system is in place in Northern Ireland, in which Sinn F&eacute;in is involved.  What system has been introduced and what is it costing each householder?  The cost is &euro;150 and one gets one free desludge.  Fianna F&aacute;il says we should not bother to do this.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The House will be satisfied to hear the information I have available to me on what the previous Government intended to do.  I came across a brief regarding septic tanks and other onsite waste water systems on the file dated October 2010.  A Renewed Programme for Government agreed on 10 October 2009 includes a commitment to introduce a scheme for the licensing and inspection of septic tanks and waste water treatment systems.  On 29 October 2009 the European Court of Justice ruled against Ireland in relation to the disposal of wastewater from septic tanks and the ECJ ruling highlights deficiencies in the existing Irish legislation.  Therefore, we need the legislation.  There is a legal obligation on Ireland to address the ruling which will require new legislation to be brought forward to provide for the setting of standards for the performance and operation of septic tanks and other onsite wastewater treatment systems, and the monitoring and inspection of the performance of such treatment systems.</P><Col N="36"/>
        <P>That is what Fianna F&aacute;il intended to do.  It wanted to introduce a universal inspection of all septic tanks.  It wanted an annual inspection charge of &euro;300 and to implement the 2009 EPA code of practice in respect of septic tanks.</P>

	<P>The development fees charged by planning authorities to developers include charges for connection to drinking water supply, the public sewers and municipal waste water treatment plants.  These fees are part of the purchase price in urban areas or in areas where the public supply is paid for by the purchaser.  Where connection to a public water supply or a public sewer is not possible the appropriate deductions are made in respect of those individuals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, I commend the previous Government for the fact that from 2006 to 2011, inclusive, &euro;500,000 was spent in rural areas to help people deal with connections to public supplies but also group water schemes and group sewerage schemes.  They will continue under the rural water programme.  If one had a problem in regard to a well, a grant is available to replace the pump or get another well up to &euro;2,000 or 75% of the cost.  That recognises there are difficulties in rural areas that do not exist in urban areas.  I have made it clear in urban areas that where there is a public supply in 2014, people will be charged by meter.  That relates to public supply only and will not apply to people in rural areas who have a private supply.  That is unlike what Sinn F&eacute;in has said at some meeting, particularly Deputy Martin Ferris, to the effect that a charge would apply to private wells.  That is not the case and will not be the case.  People who are providing their own water, at their own expense, will not be have a charge imposed on them by the State.  However, if they wish to connect to a public supply, obviously there is a connection charge which is applicable in all local authority areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad to have had the opportunity to draw attention to some of the hypocrisy on the issue.  It is not well founded given the information I have just given to the House.  I am taking an unprecedented step of publishing the regulations for a four-week consultation period and will not commence the Bill until such time as they are approved by the Oireachtas.  That has never happened before under any previous Minister.  In order to allay public concerns and the fears that have been expressed arising from the misinformation, I am glad to say the public meetings will be well attended and the people will get the truth.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Fair enough.  With this amendment, on page 6, line 47, &ldquo;within ten days&rdquo; has been deleted and we are substituting &ldquo;within 20 working days.&rdquo;  There will be ample time for owners to register their systems with the water services authority.  I envisage that will be within 12 months of enactment of this legislation.  Having listened to the debate regarding the time to be allowed for production of a valid registration certificate, I am prepared to change ten working days to 20 working days to allay people&rsquo;s fears.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned people in holiday homes in the west, which is a valid point.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned that as well.  I consider this to be a reasonable and fair period.</P>
        <P>People want to have some certainty with regard to what is wrong with their septic tank, and they want a reply from the local authority fairly quickly if there is a problem.  They do not want to worry for a long period, and 20 working days is a reasonable period to alert people to the fact that an inspector is to arrive.  Equally, people wish to be told fairly quickly if there is a problem so they can address it.</P>

With regard to the Connemara people and others who will be subject to the implications of the Bill, we have said from day one that they want to comply with legislation and they want clean water, contrary to what has been said by the Minister.  He spoke a complete untruth.  I speak for Sinn F&eacute;in, which is totally in favour of clean water and a fair system.  I will correct the record if the Minister is not clear on it.  We had the debates in the Seanad over 18 hours when it was said repeatedly that we are in favour of clean water.  I appreciate that the Minister has gone a little way on this measure but it is a shame he did not take on board some of the other very practical and constructive arguments put forward in the debate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I acknowledge that the Minister has extended the time from ten to 20 days.  During the course of the debate we sought to have the time extended as well.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh that it was disingenuous of the Minister to single-handedly accuse both Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il of not wanting to protect the public watercourses.  Considering the record of this House and the D&aacute;il, the Minister would clearly see that the amendments  &mdash; certainly from my own party &mdash; were geared to protecting the watercourses, although we would achieve it a different way, ensuring that standards would be published before legislation is enacted.  We are approving legislation affecting septic tank owners but the Minister will have consultations and bring in his own standards.</P><Col N="41"/>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Minister may use the 2009 standards, although he has indicated on numerous occasions that he will use the Phil Hogan standard.  I can assure the Minister of what will happen if that occurs, and he knows exactly what will happen.  An Taisce and environmental groups will go straight to the European Commission in Brussels, and Ireland will be brought to court again because we would not be in compliance with the current standards, as set down by the European Commission in 2007 and accepted by the Environmental Protection Agency guidelines in 2009.  People from An Taisce will be listening to every word being said in both Houses.  They may have accused me of going too far but I will not apologise to An Taisce because it has tried to close down rural Ireland on many occasions by objecting to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It does some excellent work but its efforts in objecting to planning permissions for young local couples goes beyond the call of duty.</P>
         
<P>There is talk of this being unprecedented.  The wetlands regulations were introduced on 8 September last year and then public consultation was initiated for four weeks; that was after the signing of the regulations.  How can we stand here and accept that a Minister will bring in a regulation when the consultation in that case came after signing the regulation into effect?</P>
        <P>With regard to the specific amendment, I welcome that the provision for a ten-day period will be changed to 20 days.  Accusations were made from the Government side of the House that Fianna F&aacute;il brought in certain offences and penalties in the 2007 Act.  It was geared towards massive and widespread industrial pollution, dealing with a specific case in County Wicklow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the principal Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Those fines were imposed in 2007.  That principal Act did not introduce the penalties referred to in this section.  The Minister is changing the provision where a person fails to comply with a request under subsection (11) within ten days.  That is being increased to 20 days but if people do not comply, they face a class A fine under section 70B(12) for not being able to provide a valid registration certificate for a septic tank.  That was not introduced by the previous Government but is being introduced by this Minister.  This means, in effect, that people can be fined up to &euro;5,000 for not being able to produce a valid certification within the 20 days.  That is wrong.  I appreciate that people must be penalised for polluting the environment but we are in very straitened times.</P>

They categorically outline how this process could cost householders up to &euro;17,000 to bring a septic tank up to standard.  Those figures do not come from me but from the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  That is the crux of the issue.  That is all I have to say.

We submitted that we were not in compliance with the directive on groundwater and contamination and now we have legislation, which is our defence, which must be filed by next Friday.  Hence, the urgency of the legislation, in order to ensure that we do not have fines clocking up.  Fines may still be imposed upon us by the court.  We do not know, but we have no chance of mitigating those fines with the attitude taken by some Senators that we should not bother rushing the legislation.  We must file a defence by 3 February.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, lines 5 to 8 deleted and the following substituted:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;70H.&mdash;(1) (<i>a</i>) An inspector shall inspect such domestic waste water treatment systems as he or she is directed by the Agency, or a water services authority, to inspect.</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) The Agency or a water services authority shall notify in writing the owner of a premises connected to a domestic waste water treatment system of a proposed inspection at least 10 working days before such inspection.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">We have dealt with amendment No. 3 which means that we must deal with No. 4 in this fashion, which has a consequence arising from amendment No. 3.  I propose the amendment in order to ensure that householders receive adequate notice of the inspection of their on-site wastewater treatment systems.  Section 70H(1)(b) was not previously included in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 4:</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;70H.&mdash;(1) An Inspector shall inspect such domestic waste water treatments but not without the authority of a warrant issued by a judge of the District Court or without the prior written consent of the individual.&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for tabling the amendment as it is something which we sought.  I support the Minister&rsquo;s change in that ten days notice will be given.  We called for that on Second Stage and we tabled a number of amendments on the issue.  It is important to acknowledge that the Minister has changed his position and taken on board a number of the practical suggestions made by the Opposition parties.  It brings me back to the start of the debate when we called for such measures as a proper registration system and a fair inspection system with notice given.  The Minister has moved on that.  We called for a risk-based approach.  The Minister has said he is in favour of that.  We called for grant aid.  We do not know the detail but the Minister has indicated he will look at it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is outrageous for the Minister to suggest, that when one looks at the track record of my party on the issue and what we have sought in this House and in the D&aacute;il, that we are not in favour of protecting groundwater.  That must be said because we have stated over and over again that we have no difficulty with inspections.</P>

We have been absolutely crystal clear on this issue right from the start.  Rewind to the start of the debate and listen to our comments.  It is great that the Minister is finally getting closer to the Sinn F&eacute;in position.  We are getting there.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">According to the legislation, the inspectors will be appointed by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which would make it a case of private inspectors calling out to inspect wastewater treatment systems.  Until such time as the maintenance standards are published, we cannot allow an army of inspectors to inspect registered septic tanks.  It is ludicrous, given the inspectors&rsquo; powers to examine systems and carry out soil tests, surveys and excavations.</P>

    <Title>Local Government Reform: Statements, Questions and Answers</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to discuss local government reform and I thank Senators for finding time for this matter on today&rsquo;s schedule of business.  I make clear at the outset that I will not announce details of a reform programme today for two very good reasons, namely, proposals, other than those already announced, have not yet been decided and it would be pointless, and disrespectful, if I were to march in here and simply inform the House that various decisions had been made.  I suggest that we use the time available to allow Senators to put forward well informed, practical proposals to improve the local government system.  Since most of them are <Col N="52"/>elected by local authority members, there could hardly be a more suitable opportunity for the Seanad to show that it can make a substantial contribution to policy formulation.</P>
        <P>I may not be in a position to announce details today but I can help to set the context of the debate by addressing some fundamental issues on local government and local government reform, the rationale for it and what we hope to achieve.  I have heard questions recently in the context of proposals for local government funding along the lines of &ldquo;What are local authorities for?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why do we need a local government tier?&rdquo;  I would expect robust, realistic and insightful answers on this from the Members of a House that is partly a product of local government.  I wish to share some thoughts on these fundamental questions &mdash; our vision for local government, the direction it should take, the principles we are following in considering changes, the reforms needed to achieve the objectives of local government and the main components I envisage in respect of the reform programme.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that some functions are better performed through central or regional organisations for reasons of scale, resources, expertise or those of a strategic nature.  This is why certain environmental and infrastructural responsibilities have moved to national agencies over the years.  Such a move is now proposed in the area of water.  In theory, the services that local authorities currently provide could perhaps be delivered by staff employed by central organisations.  However, the bulk of local authority services are genuinely local in character and there is nothing to suggest that they could be delivered more effectively by centralised agencies.  On the contrary, locally-based decision making is good for local and central government.  It enables better consideration to be given to local needs and priorities and can lead to improved performance and initiative by virtue of fostering a greater sense of local ownership, commitment, responsibility and accountability.  Moreover, delegation to local level relieves central government of unnecessary involvement in local affairs.  This enables it to focus on national issues, as well as avoiding the sort of duplication that can arise where centralised management is obliged to supervise local delivery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Local authorities are not just service providers.  They have a mandate to promote the welfare of communities and support national objectives.  A local tier of public representation is considered an essential feature of most, if not all, democracies and in Ireland it has specific constitutional status.  It is logical that this elective representational element of local government should be combined with, and exercise oversight of, the service delivery aspect.  To achieve the objectives of good local government &mdash; as distinct from local administration &mdash; two key characteristics must be present: effective and accountable democratic representation; and operational efficiency and value for money in the local authority functions of service provision, regulation and development.  The overall strategic aim of local government reform must be to enhance both of these elements.  They are not incompatible; in fact, both are essential.  To achieve the objectives of good local government, the system must promote effectiveness, accountability and efficiency through its structures, organisation, functions, operations and financial arrangements.  These key elements will be addressed.  The policy proposals I intend to bring to Government shortly will, in particular, feature two main strands of reform, namely, strengthening local government structures &mdash; generally at regional, county and sub-county levels &mdash; and expansion of the role of local government.</P>
        <P>The core element of the local government system is the county or the city and we have already taken decisions to strengthen this key component by way of unification of local government structures in Limerick and Tipperary and consideration of the position in Waterford.  The forthcoming submission to Government will build on these developments and outline proposals for the other levels in order to achieve a stronger, more cohesive and efficient overall system that will be well equipped to address future challenges and take on new roles.  Without devalu<Col N="53"/>ing the work of the members and staff of town councils, we must honestly acknowledge that the sub-county level has become an increasingly marginalised element of the local government system, with problems of weakness, duplication and inconsistency.  Some previous proposals for sub-county reform have been somewhat crude and lacking in imagination.  Equally, defenders of the <i>status quo</i> have tended to keep their heads in the sand.  I intend to propose changes which, if accepted by Government, can produce a modern, comprehensive and meaningful system of municipal governance within each county that will be based on principles of subsidiarity, democratic accountability and operational cohesiveness.</P>
        <P>Compared with town authorities, regional structures are relatively new to the Irish local government landscape but they have not, to date, made a significant impact.  There are many reasons for this including the lack of regional identity, difficulty in determining areas that make sense for different purposes, vagueness of role and a lack of clarity and rigour surrounding concepts such as regional policy.  In recent times the regional planning guidelines process has become increasingly effective.  The evidence of success in this context encourages me to try to build on this and make a further effort to develop a meaningful and effective regional component in the Irish local government system.  The reform proposals to Government will, therefore, incorporate what will, in effect, be a relaunch of the regional dimension.  This will involve rationalisation of structures, updating and clarification of functions and a focus on robust strategic planning in which all relevant agencies and authorities will be required to participate fully in the development of strategies and in ensuring that these are carried through and implemented in all sectors and areas.</P>
        <P>An effective funding system, related to a local funding base and incorporating local decision making and accountability, is regarded worldwide as a crucial element of good local government.  With less than half of local government funding for current services in Ireland coming from local funding sources and most capital funding coming from central funds, there is a democratic deficit in the relationship between responsibility for local service planning and delivery and the provision of the associated funds.  All major reviews and assessment of local government reform over many years have pointed to the need to widen the local funding base through mechanisms which would provide discretion to locally elected representatives while making them more responsible and accountable for overall funding provision.</P>
        <P>I will bring forward proposals later this year for a more comprehensive and equitable valuation-based property tax to replace the household charge which is aimed at providing a stable and sustainable source of funding, with increased local financial responsibility.  Given the local nature of property, the link between community location and service demand and provision and the potential to provide for local discretion and accountability, a property tax is uniquely appropriate as the principal source of sustainable funding for local government.  The introduction of a property tax will deal conclusively with this essential element of local government reform.  It is clear that greater financial independence and responsibility are essential to the development of a stronger, more efficient, mature, accountable and self-reliant system of local government whose relationship with national Government will no longer be characterised primarily by dependency, lobbying and centralised control.</P>
        <P>The operational element of local government is being addressed, particularly through the implementation of the local government efficiency review recommendations.  This is proceeding under the aegis of an implementation group, with the focus initially on prioritised implementation by the local government sector in areas which offer significant potential for early savings such as procurement, ICT, HR and shared services.  The implementation group&rsquo;s interim report will be completed shortly, with the incorporation of specific information on savings and delivery times.  Significant efficiencies are also being achieved through implementation of the Croke <Col N="54"/>Park agreement in the local government sector which has, for example, seen a reduction of more than 7,500 staff since 2008.</P>
        <P>A further major determinant of an effective system of local government is the nature and extent of its powers and functions.  Local government in Ireland has a much narrower focus of functions than in most states.  This statement has been repeated so often that it is in danger of being taken for granted as something naturally Irish &mdash; like damp weather or good hurling.  I do not think it makes any sense to have a system of 124 local and regional authorities, almost 1,700 elected councillors and more than 29,000 staff performing a relatively limited range of functions and excluded from many decisions affecting their areas and the delivery of various public services locally which in most countries are core functions of the local government system.  If we are to retain a system of local government &mdash; I think I have demonstrated that there is a compelling rationale for this &mdash; it cannot possibly be sensible to continue under-utilising its potential to the degree that successive Governments have allowed for decades.  What is more, we simply cannot afford to do so in the economic circumstances visited on us.</P>
        <P>The failure to capitalise fully on the potential of local government is something I am determined to begin to address, but I recognise  it will take time to turn things around.  Previous devolution programmes were unrealistically ambitious and did not start from the right place.  I acknowledge that local government in Ireland has a credibility problem and inherent weaknesses.  For example, how could a structural framework set down in the 19th century be expected to support efficient operations in the 21st century?  How could a funding base that has been undermined significantly since the late 1970s promote mature, self-reliant local government?  This is why we are front-loading structural and financial reform and operational efficiency measures.</P>
        <P>I also want to begin the process of strengthening and widening the functions of local government by bringing forward specific proposals for additional local authority responsibilities.  In the short term I see scope for widening the role of local authorities from three sources, in particular: an enhanced and more explicit role in economic development and enterprise support; involvement in community and local development, particularly in the context of the alignment of local and community development with the local government system; and the identification of specific functions capable of devolution from central level to local government in the short term.</P>
        <P>While a more far-reaching extension of the local government role into the type of areas within its remit in many other countries such as transport, education and the police is likely to be a relatively long-term project, the programme for Government contains a clear commitment to the devolution of much greater decision-making powers to local level.  In this context, I have asked all Government colleagues to undertake a serious examination of the functions and services of Departments and related agencies to identify matters responsibility for which could potentially be devolved to local government.  Proposals emerging from this initiative will be reflected in the forthcoming submission to the Government.  Responsibility for the delivery of most services within the Department&rsquo;s remit already rests with local authorities and various requirements for specific approval have been dispensed with or relaxed during the years.  However, an examination is being carried out to identify any possible remaining potential for further delegation of responsibility to local level.</P>
        <P>Economic issues must be at the top of the agenda not only because of the scale of the economic challenges that face us but also because progress on all objectives across our society depends critically on economic success.  I believe the capacity for local government to promote economic development is significant and this is also reflected in the programme for Government.  Most local authorities already play a substantial role, alongside national and regional <Col N="55"/>agencies, in economic development and promoting or marketing their areas as locations for tourism, investment and enterprise.  Their planning and infrastructure functions have a significant influence on economic development and every business in an area inevitably has dealings with its local authority.  There is a need to define a clearer, more explicit and consistent role for local government in economic development and enterprise promotion.  An important element of the reform policies I will bring to the Government shortly will be proposals for all local authorities to perform an enhanced economic role building on current best practice, working with relevant national agencies, linked with other relevant local authority functions, and taking account of other current developments, particularly the process to align local government and local development.</P>
        <P>I am very keen to build on the role played by local government in local and community development, which incorporates economic and social elements.  I recognise the value to communities of the work of local development bodies; they bring important qualities to the development of urban and rural areas.  I am convinced these qualities can be combined more effectively with the resources and the democratic mandate of local government to ensure the greatest possible level of efficiency and effectiveness in the various publicly funded local development programmes.  A steering group is examining the alignment between local government and the various local development programmes and I will have its final report soon.  The aim will be to achieve the best possible customer service and value for money in local development programmes, with a focus on ensuring effective front-line services for those who need them most.</P>
        <P>The policy proposals I hope to bring to the Government will, in tandem with other work that is proceeding, add up to a wide-ranging programme of reform dealing with the core issues of local government structures, functions, funding and operations.  As implementation of these proposals proceeds, further aspects of the system will be looked at such as governance, ethics, local and central government relationships, civic leadership and public participation in local government.  The overall outcome should be a local government system that is more responsible and self-reliant and performs a central role in the economic and social affairs of the nation, just as local government does in most European states.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his visionary speech which offers optimism in terms of the future role of local authorities.  I agree with him that an opportunistic policy decision was made in 1977 to abolish rates.  As he stated, this has made local authorities increasingly dependent on central government in pleading for funding.  It has seriously weakened the role of local authority members.</P>
        <P>The reason the Minister is in the House today is that last week we met Councillor Hugh McElvaney, chairman of the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA; Councillor Noel Bourke, its general secretary, and other members.  Councillor Enda McGloin from County Leitrim made a superb presentation on what he believed the role of local authority members should be and what they were seeking.  Many Senators attended the meeting and there is cross-party agreement today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Not on every issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>No, but we want to see the role of local authority members being enhanced.</P>
        <P>When I sought election to the Seanad in 2002, I was not a member of a local authority, but I had been on the national executive of Fianna F&aacute;il.  During that election campaign I saw what local authority members did, and their role in communities is seriously underestimated.  Having travelled throughout the country and been elected to the Seanad three times, I am aware of <Col N="56"/>how local authority members keep communities together, particularly in rural areas.  Those who write off their contribution to society or the political system do not know what they are talking about.  The same is being said about the Seanad, that it does nothing.  In my experience, anyone elected or re-elected to a local authority is working hard.  One may be elected once, but one will not be re-elected without doing the work.  I am very impressed by local authority members.</P>
        <P>Local authority members are experts on issues to do with sewerage, housing and recycling.  In economic times such as these, to which the Minister referred, their importance is evident.  We cannot underestimate their impact in communities.  They are the gateway to and backbone of our democracy and severely under-appreciated.  They are the backbone of the local government system.</P>
        <P>Local elections take place every five years and every resident over the age of 18 is entitled to be registered as a local government elector.  It is tremendous also that people who are not citizens of Ireland are allowed vote in the local elections, which means that nationals and non-nationals have a voice.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Speaking on behalf of Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, members last week I stated that this has to be properly funded.  I support a property tax and over the years I have supported the call that people should be charged for water.  It is a scarce resource in the world.  This money should be given to the local authorities.  The local authority members should have control over it and power over what they do in their areas.  We read regularly in the newspapers about what people in local authorities are doing in Europe.  It is sad to see what has happened in our local authorities in that they do not have the control and the input into what is happening in their immediate local areas.</P>
        <P>There is talk of reducing the number of councils but there is an increased number of people in many communities.  According to the Central Statistics Office, County Laois recorded the strongest population growth in 2011 with an increase of 20% in just five years.</P>
        <P>There should be better public relations in terms of the role of county councillors.  Their voice must be heard and they need to be revered.  I know from travelling throughout the country non-stop keeping in touch with my electorate the fantastic work county councillors do in their communities.  They should be properly funded and have back-up research and resources to do a good job.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for coming to the House and his visionary speech.  Senator Maurice Cummins is an outstanding Leader of this Chamber.  He is excellent and we very much appreciate the innovations he has made in his efforts to retain the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and particularly his statement which will go down in history as setting the context for the reform of local government.  The Minister has not yet made the announcement but in the context he has set I look forward to hearing it when it is made.</P>
        <P>I welcome Councillor Enda McGloin to the Chamber who is a member of the executive of LAMA and who was in the AV room last week putting forward some valuable suggestions.  I hope we will be able to facilitate the LAMA delegation in the environment committee as requested.</P>
        <P>I have been listening to discussions on local government reform for more than 20 years since being elected to local government, and even longer than that.  In the lifetime of the previous Government we had a Green Paper, discussions mostly on directly elected mayors, an OECD report, the McCarthy report, a Commission on Taxation review and the Local Government <Col N="57"/>Efficiency Review Group.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but I understand the Minister intends bringing forward a White Paper.  If that is the case, when does he intend to publish that?  The local elections will be in the not too distant future and it is important that we have certainty as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>At the outset we must ask what we want from our system of local government.  I want to see a system based on strong local democracy, community spirit and citizen empowerment allied to an effective and cost efficient service delivery.  We must ensure that in creating an efficient system of local administration we do not wipe out local democracy and good local government.</P>
        <P>What we have seen to date on any type of reform or pursuit of an agenda over the years has been an agenda of reductionism as opposed to real reform.  We have had tinkering with local government and no real attempt to reform it.  We have seen powers and functions removed from local authorities.  Certain functions are best administered centrally but central Government is not best equipped to grasp the inimitable conditions of each locality.  It is preferable for local government to carry out that job because locally elected institutions employing their own specialist staff are better placed to understand and interpret the conditions and the needs of local communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The over-centralisation of government here is inefficient and fundamentally incompatible with a healthy republic.  I did not make up that statement.  It is from the new politics document issued by our party.  The Minister probably had a part in composing it and from what he said earlier he is living up to that statement of empowering the citizen.  I commend our party for that statement.  We believe there must be a shift of power from the centre to the citizen to create a strong, vibrant civil society and from what the Minister has said to date that is what he intends to do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have listened to the Minister speak on numerous occasions since he took up office.  The last time I heard him speak on reform was at the LAMA seminar where his statement was very welcome.  The previous Minister for local government, Mr. John Gormley, stated that we need to ensure greater connection between local government and local people.  That was a fine sentiment but he failed to follow it up with any action.  He published a Green Paper but nothing happened after that.  This Minister intends to do business and I look forward to him delivering.</P>
        <P>In general, national politicians have not taken any lead on local government reform.  Speaking at the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, conference three years ago, Dr. Aodh Quinlivan from UCC stated that national politicians have shown a lack of respect for local government and local democracy.  He said that national government&rsquo;s main concern is preserving power at the central level and continuing with an intensely centralised model which is suffocating local government.  That must change and from what the Minister stated in this document, I know he is of like mind.</P>
        <P>As I stated when I spoke on the issue of local government reform in the House on 18 January, having spent 20 years working at local government level I feel an onus, in serving the people who elected me, to enunciate again that reform of local government should be used, in the first instance, for the devolution of functions to local level.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned town councils.  That area needs review but I do not agree with the McCarthy report from 2009 which recommended that all town councils be abolished.  That has been supported by the AMAI, LAMA and ACC.  I am aware that the Minister intends to make some changes.  Changes must be made but functions must be streamlined.  We must acknowledge the strength and benefits of municipal governments and local democracy representation but we must also ensure value for money and efficiency in administration and operational procedures.  I mentioned the devolution and expansion of the role of local government.  I have seen the part local government can play in local democracy.</P><Col N="58"/>
        <P>The Minister made three points on 18 January in reply to a question from me on clarifying and enhancing the role of local government in economic development and enterprise support.  I welcome that statement.  We met representatives of the Irish Local Development Network yesterday evening and I look forward to the report of the steering group.  Does the Minister have any idea when the report of the steering group will be published?</P>
        <P>We must keep in mind the principle of subsidiarity.  The European charter of local self-government, to which we are a signatory, states that local self-government denotes the right and ability of local authority to regulate and manage a substantial share of the authorities.  We must keep in mind subsidiarity, democracy, accountability and responsibility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I say to all councillors &mdash; I was once a councillor &mdash; that with powers come responsibility.  The Minister spoke about the disconnect between fund-raising and the way local government was denuded from the late 1970s on but councillors are to blame also.  All councillors must keep in mind that with powers come responsibilities and every councillor must be prepared to take powers if they are given them and use them appropriately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>F&aacute;ilte isteach, Minister, go dt&iacute; an Seanad.  Unlike previous speakers I have no mandate in that I was nominated by the Taoiseach but this debate offers me an opportunity to learn about and understand the idea of local government reform.  I have some experience in that I am a political scientist by training and have spent some time on a series of citizens&rsquo; projects.</P>
        <P>The Minister made a very good speech.  This debate gives all of us with our different backgrounds an opportunity to contribute and inform and to be briefed by the Minister but also to put some ideas to him.  The Minister suggested that he has an enormous task.  He must take his time with it.  There are many elements to it and I might highlight some those tensions and, hopefully, support him in the forthcoming terms.</P>
        <P>It has been a busy week for the Minister.  Tomorrow is an historic day for him also in that he will introduce the Second Stage of the Electoral (Amendment)(Political Funding) Bill.  I acknowledge that it is all happening in the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last year I spent two months travelling the country and attending meetings on participatory democracy.  I was chair of We the Citizens, a non-political party group which set out to prove that citizens who participate in a deliberative way can effect change and contribute in a greater and more profound way to the political system.  We proved that a citizen&rsquo;s voice, through a citizens assembly model, can make a difference and contribute to a shift in our political culture and participation.  I know through the programme for Government that there are strong policy areas on how to enhance the way citizens should participate in society and politics.  I look forward to the debate today and tomorrow in which the Seanad can come up with strong and important ideas to support this aspect of the programme for Government.  What I have learned from We the Citizens and what I heard at every public meeting throughout Ireland is the hunger and willingness of citizens to get more involved in local democracy.  Voting is not enough.  What happens in between elections is what we are trying to resolve and discuss today, namely, how to increase participation and trust between the institutions and our citizens in this republic.  Irish citizens have started to expect more from democracy and want to take part.  Deliberative democracy at a local level can work and the more citizens who are involved in local decision making, the healthier our political culture will be.</P><Col N="59"/>
        <P>We the Citizens proved conclusively that citizens can understand and take tough decisions if they have all the information and facts at their disposal and that this strengthens the political system and enhances our democracy at both a local and national level.  That is what I would like to see as a result of local government reform.  Profound reform at local level will liberate reform at Oireachtas level.  If we devolve more power and decision making to local level, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad will enhance their role as the policy making and legislative forums that they set out to be.</P>
        <P>I will not go into detail today on the various bodies and histories of recommendations on local government reform over the years but I would like acknowledge the excellent work and convey my thanks to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service in briefing me well on this.  Regarding the programme for Government, the following three sources have had some influence on Government thinking: the Green Paper on Local Government Reform in 2008, the McCarthy report in 2009 and the Local Government Efficiency Review Group of 2010.  I understand, and the Minister indicated in his speech, that he has set up an implementation group and is awaiting its recommendations.  In what timeframe might that happen?  Will that process result in a White Paper and, if so, how would it be disseminated?</P>
        <P>The great challenge facing the Minister and all legislators in the Oireachtas is how measures to enhance democracy and decentralise power can best be implemented in the context of cost-saving steps which will undoubtedly be implemented.  How can we reconcile the following three objectives of the Minister&rsquo;s local reform agenda, namely, cost savings, to increase the efficiency of services and to devolve power to the citizens?  They are not mutually exclusive of each other but cost savings could make local government more remote from the people and amalgamations could be more expensive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are four areas of reform, the first of which is to rebalance power within local government in favour of elected representatives.  We could and probably should discuss this at length in this House and we could have a full day discussion on that area alone in terms of directly elected mayors, the proposal to replace managers with CEOs and how this would relate to increased powers of councillors.  A second area of reform is to devolve power from central government to local government. How many tiers should there be, how should it work and should it be across county council boundaries or county boundaries?  The third area of reform is to create greater efficiencies and save costs, and the fourth area of reform is to enhance ways for citizens to participate.  The deliberate budgeting process in Recife in Brazil is a great example of this where nearly 20% of the adult population was involved in some way in the 2009 budgeting process.  Its impact in that region of Brazil has been significant in terms of influencing the direction of public expenditure, some &euro;220 million over ten years, as well as broadening and deepening democratic processes every day.  These four categories of reform are all linked.  We need to achieve them in tandem and to have a debate that would include the citizens whom ultimately it will serve and protect.</P>
        <P>There can be tensions between these goals.  A critical question when considering the Government&rsquo;s policy is how well the policies increasing efficiencies fit with the Government&rsquo;s policy to reorganise local governance structures fundamentally to allow for devolution of much greater decision making.  Can we save money by sharing costs &mdash; the Minister touched on this &mdash; such as ICT, audit committees and human resource services but devolve increased power and responsibility to the local areas in the categories of budgeting, raising taxes, housing and roads?</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to an excellent research paper, Is big really so efficient? Investigating assumptions concerning local government reform and amalgamation, by Mark Callanan, Ronan Murphy and Aodh Quinlivan, a wonderful paper that I urge all Members to read, we in Ireland are deeply wedded to the view that bigger is better, or a more specific variant is that bigger is <Col N="60"/>cheaper, means improved services and is more efficient.  These have been assumptions underpinning recent proposals for public sector reorganisation and reform with the suggestion that a larger organisational structure will cost less, lead to better services for citizens and ultimately be more efficient.  Rather than being expressed openly, these assumptions frequently are used as an implicit rationale behind changes that are usually labelled as rationalisations of structures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another myth or issue that has been raised is that Ireland has too many local authorities, particularly too many city and county councils &mdash; we have 34.  Research undertaken and mentioned in the paper to which I referred shows that we are way down the league table when it comes to our having a close relationship with citizens.  France, Switzerland, Austria, the United States, Germany, Canada, Finland, Poland, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and Portugal all have much closer links to citizens that we do.  We should investigate how we could improve them.  We are more remote from our citizens than we think.  Therefore, the notion that amalgamations might be the answer to greater connections and more efficiencies might not be true.  One of the glaring facts I discovered in my research and interest in this area is the lack of evidence and data in support of proposals that a smaller number of larger local authorities would yield improvements savings and efficiencies.  That is not to say I am in favour of not amalgamating them but we should investigate it further.</P>
      
	<P>According to the research paper I cited, bigger is not necessarily better and it is often sometimes worse.  There is a weak relationship between population size and costs and service levels and efficiency.  We cannot take it for granted, therefore, that by becoming larger, local authorities in Ireland would yield improvements.</P>
        <P>One of the learnings we discovered at our regional meetings of We the Citizens was that citizens want local politics to be more local and for them to have a greater understanding and a stake in it.  Raising local taxes and spending them locally was mentioned and discussed.  Whatever reform the Oireachtas and Government come up with, this will be the crucial one.  How can central government let go and devolve its power and revenue raising powers to local level?  Participants in citizens assemblies were asked this question and were asked regarding the role of TDs, who they should be, what they should do and how they should represent citizens.  The citizens assembly in June was asked to comment on the statement, &ldquo;The ability of TDs to provide local service is strength&rdquo;, and the results of that were to place more weight after debate and the deliberative process on national legislative and policy and less on local service.  The results showed a further marked and statistically significantly decrease in support for the statement.  In other words, citizens understood that local politics, if more empowered and more enhanced, works better.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is clear that the opportunity to discuss local government reform is an opportunity to evaluate our whole political culture and democracy.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister in detail during this term of the Oireachtas.  I urge him to include the voices of citizens in any consultation on reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I have no doubt he intends to move this process forward and look forward to his deliberations.  We have had a number of conversations on this issue in recent months.</P>
        <P>Town local governments should be a fundamental tier of local democracy.  Reform should place town local government at the core of the system and bring local government closer to communities.  The intention should not be to abolish local government but to strengthen it.  Reform must be based on a bottom-up approach.  Local government needs to be less dependent budgetarily on central government, and a model of county and municipal government can advance the objective of operational efficiency and representational effectiveness.  All those <Col N="61"/>statements are ones the Minister made in a number of speeches he gave in recent months.  I commend him on that.  He has at heart a desire to reform local government.  The question is how we approach that.</P>
        <P>Currently, local government is being strangled to death by central government.  Unless the grip is removed and oxygen is supplied urgently, local government will die.  We have gone down a one way street in local government for the past ten to 15 years.  The challenge for the Minister is to turn the vehicle of local government around and drive it back up that street.  We have seen the powers of local government removed in the areas of health, education, waste management, roads, water, funding and so forth.  Are we going to reform by returning some of these powers along with giving new powers or will we reform by a reduction in powers?</P>
        <P>Reduction has been tried across Europe.  The previous speaker spoke about some instances.  I will give the Minister some statistics.  In the 1970s in Britain, for example, there were 1,300 local authority units and there are now 361; in Wales there were 45 but now there are 32; in Scotland there were 65 and there are now 32.  In Northern Ireland it was proposed on two occasions to reduce the number of local government units from 26 to 11.  Strangely, Sinn F&eacute;in did not support that.  It wanted the number reduced to seven.  No decision has yet been made there.  In all instances where the number of units has been reduced it has not been proved conclusively that they are more efficient.  The previous speaker referred to the document &ldquo;Is big really so efficient?  Investigating assumptions concerning local government reform and amalgamation.&rdquo;  It should be read by every Senator who has an interest in this subject.</P>
        <P>International experience shows that what is happening across Europe, excluding Great Britain, is the opposite to what is happening in Ireland.  In Norway, which has the same population as Ireland, there are 430 municipalities.  In Croatia, which has a similar population, there are 420.  The powers of local government across Europe are completely different from those of local government in this country.  Local government has more meaning.  I served for six and a half years on the Committee of the Regions, which is the local government arm of the European project, and I saw at first hand the power and autonomy of local government across European countries.  In fact, some of my colleagues in the Socialist group were gobsmacked when we discussed how little power Irish local representatives have.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot agree with the Minister&rsquo;s comment on town councils.  There is nothing to support it.  He said that town councils are inefficient.  His exact words were: &ldquo;we must honestly acknowledge that the sub-county level has become an increasingly marginalised element of the local government system, with problems of weakness, duplication and inconsistency&rdquo;.  I put it to the Minister that town local government is far more efficient than the current country structure.  I ask him to conduct a little research in his Department on figures that were produced on the provision of housing in County Kildare in recent years.  They show that Kildare County Council was six times less efficient than Athy Town Council in the provision of housing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Democracy carries out a business but it is not a business.  I urge the Minister to remember that.  I wish him well in his deliberations.  There is much work to be done but if we work together, we can find a better local government system for this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to be radical and bold in terms of genuine reform.  I welcome much of his speech but, as previous speakers have said, we have been talking about local government reform for up to 30 years, and there have been many fine speeches.  There was, for example, a White Paper on directly elected mayors from the previous Government.  Where will that fit in with the Minister&rsquo;s proposals?</P>
        <P>This should not be about cutting numbers or reducing the number of local elected representatives simply to save money.  The key issue is the power and functions of local government and the services it can provide to local communities.  In being radical the Minister should examine the areas of health, education and enterprise.  He mentioned an enhanced and more explicit role for local government in economic development and enterprise support.  That is important.  The Minister might have seen the recent IDA figures, broken down on a county basis, and unfortunately the Minister&rsquo;s county, Kilkenny, fared badly, as did Wexford and Waterford.  We must ensure there is balanced regional development.  I would support any changes in structures relating to regional development, but the enterprise agencies must be included in that and be part of whatever reforms are being considered.</P>
        <P>I must raise the potential merger of Waterford city and county councils.  There is genuine fear about how that will play out.  There is constructive criticism from many people.  Waterford city is the gateway city of the south east.  There is a real fear that in any potential merger, its gateway status could be diluted or lost.  Those authorities also have an extensive history.  Waterford Corporation and Waterford City Council have a deep association with Waterford city.  One option the Minister could consider is the expansion of Waterford city out to areas in, for example, Ferrybank.  There is a need to consider expanding the city in an efficient way to ensure it has proper services for the people in the area.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to be bold and brave with local government reform.  He should not play it safe nor put the sliotar wide of the bar.  The Minister should score the goal when he has the opportunity to do so.  If he does that, he will get the support of people throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I apologise for missing his presentation but I have read it.  I respect the fact that no significant announcements are due to be made today.  We have debated the structures of local government previously.  Is the Minister giving any consideration to the concept that was discussed and agreed by all the parties approximately 20 years ago, that is, the concept of a district council which would expand on the current town council and enhance the population base served by the council?  It was designed at the time to have powers devolved from the county council to the district council.  It is a concept of local government which I believe was recommended by the Barrington report.  My recollection is <Col N="63"/>that every political party supported the concept back in 1991 but the report still rests in the Oireachtas Library.  Is it back on the agenda for consideration?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his presentation.  It might be somewhat slack on detail but he sent many positive messages regarding the importance of local authorities.  There are a number of words the Minister should consider.  As identity is very important, perhaps the Minister might comment on it.  Community is also important, and the Minister referred to it a number of times in his contribution.  There is also accessibility where the members are concerned, value for money and accountability.</P>
        <P>I recall an article written for <i>The Irish Times</i> by the editor of the <i>Financial Times</i> some time ago in which he made a comparison between small and big, which is a factor in the issue before us.  He made a reference to Cashel and Dublin and said Cashel was a city when Dublin was a black pool.  That refers back to identity.  Cashel got its charter from King William on the bridge of Golden.  The idea of a town council being abolished and not keeping identity and closeness to the people in mind would be wrong in itself.  I hope, when it comes to town councils, that we will not put a brush across all of them, as that would undermine and send the wrong message to communities.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to comment on the issue of achieving value for money where there is a partnership between the local community and the local authority.  I have seen many projects which involved partnerships.  If there were no partnerships, we would not get value for money.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Will the quotas, in their current format, apply to local elections beyond 2016?  Parties, including Fine Gael, intend to apply their own mechanisms to local election quotas in 2014.  Will there be official quotas in 2019 and beyond?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for coming.  I also thank Senator Mary White for proposing that this debate be held and the Leader of the House for agreeing to it.  This is a helpful debate.  </P>
        <P>While I accept that the Minister cannot give the full details of the reform proposals, he has given a good account of the overall scheme of things.  He has enormous personal experience having been a member of Kilkenny County Council, a Senator, a Deputy and a Minister.  He brings considerable knowledge to the job.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The non-principal private residence, NPPR, tax is bringing in an enormous amount of money.  It brings in approximately &euro;800,000 to Roscommon County Council, for example.  The money does not come to local authorities directly but in the form of a grant.  With the introduction of the new household charge of &euro;100, people are starting to realise that they are also liable for the &euro;200 second home tax.  &ldquo;Amnesty&rdquo; may not be the proper word to use for what I suggest.  Could people who have not registered for the NPPR tax now make an arrangement with their local authority to pay the outstanding tax but not the punitive penalties?  As some are not in a position to pay, there should be a hardship clause in this regard.  The Minister makes a fair point on the NPPR tax.  I know local authorities have discretion in dealing with individual cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Terry Leyden&rsquo;s point on the NPPR tax.</P>
        <P>My family association with local government in Lifford and Strabane dates back more than 100 years.  There is a massive local government tradition in County Donegal which I would like to see maintained.  Does the Minister have a view as to how Donegal County Council and local councils will be following the review?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two issues, the first of which is the role of politicians on State boards and the vital role of democratically elected local authority members on new boards such as the new replacement for the VEC.  Councillors can contribute enormously to these boards by bringing forward policies and structures.  When I was elected to the Seanad, I was obliged to stand down as a member of Bord Bia.  I could not understand this because I had been able to make contributions on the needs of small business and deliver changes to what Bord Bia was doing.  Is it feared that a politician who is a member of a State board will do something scandalous?</P>
        <P>Second, there must be a pension safety net for councillors who lose their seats on local authorities after giving years of service to their local communities.  It is crazy that they are left without after all the work they have done in their communities.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House for this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan"><NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his presentation and recent visit to County Limerick.  I was not there to meet him, for which I hope he accepts my apology.</P>
        <P>The Minister has said there are two distinct elements to local government, the first being effective and accountable democratic representation.  From my colleagues I understand that in County Donegal there are 65 town and county councillors and that in County Wexford there are 61.  In Limerick, as a result of the amalgamation, there are only 17 in the city and 28 in the county, making a total of 45.  The Minister might take account of this when drafting legislation to deal with the amalgamation.  Does he have any idea when we will see that legislation?  I know of people who are wondering about changes to boundaries and such like.  I ask the Minister to clarify that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will be aware that last Sunday a prominent journalist in an equally prominent Sunday newspaper rubbished the proposals made in the submission of the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, and, to add insult to injury, went on to quote an unnamed source in the Minister&rsquo;s Department saying the Minister would give short shrift to any of the proposals.  I hope the Minister will have some comments to make on this insulting remark.  It may be an indication of the media perception of the role and functions of local government.  I am heartened, however, by the Minister&rsquo;s contribution to this debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>It was an unnamed source.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Senator and I agree that it was not in the best interests of local government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the principle of the thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Let us not be semantic.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Minister&rsquo;s contribution and his outline of a vision, he asked Senators for specific proposals or insights into local government, which is what we rely on to be elected.  I am heartened by the fact that he is not being specific about any reduction of local government, but I appreciate that in the current economic climate there will be some meaningful reforms.  In the proposals he will bring forward to expand the role of local authority members I ask him to take into account that we have, in the post-Soviet era, the most centralised form of govern<Col N="65"/>ment in the entire European Union and beyond.  I hope, as a reforming Minister and someone who served in this House with great distinction &mdash; I had the pleasure of serving with him &mdash; and who has been a member of a local authority he will be a crusading Minister when it comes to local government reform.  We are fortunate that he is in this position and I look forward to seeing his proposals.  I hope everything he does will enhance local government and give more functions and powers to it rather than, as has been the trend for decades, centralise government even further.  I appreciate the necessity for him to consider a regional structure, particularly when it comes to the provision of infrastructure, but I hope his proposals will enhance the role of local government rather than that of central government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am so enthused by this subject that I wish to speak again.  A review of the Constitution, in which local government is clearly mentioned, is proposed.  Will the Minister await its outcome before his final deliberations on his proposals for local government reform?  Does the Minister intend to drive on ahead of that review?  Will the Minister consider in any proposed legislation setting out a clear role for central and local government along the lines suggested by Senator Mooney?</P>
        <P>I met the Minister this time last year on my way to a point to point meeting in Bennettsbridge.  He was driving with Councillor Billy Ireland attending clinics.  We met on a country road and the Minister was driving too fast, as I recall, because he nearly hit me  Will the Minister consider setting out a clear role for practitioners at central government level to outline the duties of both local representatives and Members of Parliament?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a need for clarity on the position of county and city enterprise boards and LEADER programmes and so on.  They should be an integral part of the local government structure.  There seems to be a lack of clarity as to whether this will be introduced by the Minister&rsquo;s Department or the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  It should remain under the remit of local government.  Perhaps the Minister could throw some light on the position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Has any thought been given to the demographic considerations?  There is a significant disparity between some county councils.  I use the example of County Leitrim with a population of approximately 30,000 and which has 22 county councillors and County Wexford with a population of 145,000 with 21 members.  In the case of D&aacute;il representation, there can be a population discrepancy of 20,000 to 30,000 between seats.  Has this been considered or is it part of the process?</P>

	<P>I thank the Senators for their constructive contributions.  This is an opportunity for people to indicate to me their views on how local government should be reformed.  I realise full well the sentiments as expressed by Senators in that a considerable amount of paperwork has been produced over many years but very little action.  I hope they will see some change in that attitude and that the strength and purpose of local government and the delivery of local services will be centre stage in any particular policy announcement.  I believe fundamentally in local government as a vehicle to deliver local services.  I am engaging with my Government colleagues to establish which functions of Departments and agencies can be better and more usefully, efficiently and effectively deployed at local level.  I would welcome more support from some Departments in this regard as these are often reluctant to give way on issues and on some functions that are more clearly and effectively&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Would the Minister like to tell us?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not regard this particular policy proposal as a White Paper but rather an action plan.  We have enough documents in the Department.  I am anxious to make the announcement as soon as possible about whatever is ready and I will put those proposals to Government as soon as possible.  Equally, I wish to do so when I am ready and when I am of the view we have the appropriate co-operation, buy-in from Departments and some measure of agreement on what services can be more appropriately delivered at local level.</P>
        <P>I do not subscribe to the abolitionist mentality of the McCarthy report.  Reform is not a question of abolition but rather a case of putting new and more effective arrangements in place.  In reply to Senator Landy, I did not say that town councils were inefficient.  If he reads carefully he will see what I said.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The defensive attitude will not work with me.  Everything will have to be justified as to what is appropriate.  We cannot have structures in place on paper and in theory because they must also have a practical application and function.  That will be the ultimate situation.</P>
        <P>I established the local development alignment group to bring together many of the activities in communities which are outside the remit of local government.  The allocation of moneys by Departments to various groups and entities outside the democratic process is not right and is neither appropriate nor accountable.  There must be greater oversight and accountability, through the democratically elected representatives, for what goes on in every community.</P>

	<P>In the next few weeks I will have completed the work of the local development alignment group to see what measures can be put in place as part of the local government package to bring community and local government closer together.</P>
        <P>Senator Mac Conghail referred to citizens&rsquo; participation.  Proposals to allow greater active participation by the public and communities will be developed.  I do not expect I will be able to develop all aspects of what should be delivered for local government all at once.  We will move with whatever is ready.  Many of my predecessors wanted to have everything ready and decided upon in terms of all facets of local government reform, with the result that nothing was done because they ran out of time.  A phased approach is required.  If nine or ten items on the agenda are ready to go by March or April, we will go with them.  Any issues requiring further thought or work can be added at a later stage.  I see this as a phased approach between now and the local elections in 2014 and culminating by 1 July 2014, when the term of office of the next local authority membership begins.  I am looking at structures and at functions and also the manner in which as many functions as possible can be devolved from central to local government.  We must get the financing right as there is no point in having functions if there is not the wherewithal and the operational capacity to find the money to implement the policies and deliver the services.</P>
        
     
	<P Just="Left">I am looking at a rebalancing of power towards members away from management.  This will be examined in the context of the governance aspects of the reform programme.  This may take a little longer than the structural reform but between now and 2014, a fundamental rebalancing <Col N="67"/>will see county and city managers being chief executive officers of the members who are directly elected by the people.</P>
        <P>The question is asked whether big equals efficient.  Cost savings have to be made in the current climate but this is not the only reason for mergers.  The objective for mergers is to strengthen local government, of which Limerick is a good example.  Local government was dying in Limerick city and to a greater extent than in the county.  Limerick city centre was certainly undergoing a lot of economic difficulties and there was a lack of joined-up thinking and response from the local authority structures.  County Limerick was pulling away some business opportunities from Limerick city and the cohesive approach of having a strong regional growth centre like Limerick county was putting the city centre under pressure.  We all know that if a town centre is under pressure, this has a significant impact on the aesthetics of the place, the footfall, the business community and the dynamic of the city or the town in question.  I do not want to go down the road of having a local authority at every crossroads, such as they have in France with 37,000 local authorities.  It is a huge country but I do not believe that is an appropriate model.  I think we can develop a structure that will take account of the principles referred to by Senator Landy such as sub-county municipal units that will provide local representation as close as possible to the citizen without duplication and a multitude of local authorities.  Norway has been mentioned.  Oslo and other cities have been mentioned in terms of local government structures.  They have done many mergers in recent years and included the hinterland.  I am not opposed in principle to a directly elected mayor but, equally, it is not a priority.  It is an expensive process.</P>

        <P>I assure Senator David Cullinane that the gateway of Waterford will not be diluted with or without Ferrybank.  It will be protected and strengthened and its city status will be maintained.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on the issue of identify.  As a county colours person, like me, I am sure he appreciates that, in terms of identity and community, both of which are important concepts.  They enable people to gravitate towards a local identity and community.  Equally I want to ensure that community and local government structures work together.  Whether it is in the arts, or cultural field, local government has a responsibility and a role in developing and enhancing them and in securing some funds to ensure expansion.  Identity and community involvement is important.  I set up the alignment group to ascertain how we could get community and local government working closer together.  Many programmes could be delivered if they worked together.  EU funding, which is available, cannot be drawn down given that they are not working together.  I am trying to address that issue and get local authorities more involved in heritage and the conservation aspects of village renewal.  These projects could be developed by existing local government staff if the money was available.  Community groups and local government should work more closely together to achieve the objective of delivering on the rural development programme.</P>
        <P>Senator James Heffernan asked a couple of questions on the implementation programme in Limerick.  I will have a report from the Brosnan implementation group at the end of March <Col N="68"/>which will set out the process of implementation of a number of those proposals.  Legislation will be required, which I expect to be before the House by the end of June, to give effect to some of the proposals in Tipperary, Limerick and other areas, if appropriate.  On the issue of boundaries, local elected members are concerned about where they will stand.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give them plenty of time in order that they may have the appropriate locations from which to request a mandate from the people.  They will have 17 or 18 months notice of where they will stand in the forthcoming local elections.</P>
        <P>I expect to address local government reform in the next term rather than wait for constitutional conventions to report.  I will do my utmost to set out the distinctive role of local government and how it should deliver local services through its local elected members and how it differs from central government.  I will err on the side of maximum devolution of responsibility and function to local government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Maurice Cummins that clarity is needed in respect of enterprise function and microenterprise.  The Government will make a decision next week or the following week on where county and city enterprise boards fit in and their relationship with local government.  They are with Enterprise Ireland which has a role in terms of policy and funds county and city enterprise boards but has a client list.  Through the business support units across the range of agencies, Departments and local government, we are anxious to give local authorities an opportunity to assist an individual who has an idea to bring that idea to fruition.  We are anxious to assist with planning and identification of a site or a premises that may be appropriate to the scale of employment.   Two or three people with an idea at local level can often get lost in the maze of agencies.  The IDA and Enterprise Ireland deal with more advanced projects and endeavour to get opportunities for exports markets.  What is lacking is support for the person who has an idea and wishes to get going in a rural area and whose idea may develop into a bigger opportunity for that business.  Clarity on that issue is required and I hope it will be available in the next week or two.</P>
        <P>Senator D&rsquo;Arcy made a valid point on the number of councillors per population and how it varies in different parts of the country.  For example, Carlow which has a significantly lower population than Wexford has more councillors than Wexford.  Those issues will be addressed in the context of the boundary commission to be established for the local elections.  A base level of representation is needed in the smaller counties and there is the geography dimension.  Wexford is probably entitled to more representation given that it has a significant population to represent.  Meath is another large county.</P>
        <P>Senator Paul Bradford mentioned devolution from county council to sub-county.  I agree with that.  The new arrangements, on which we are working, will concentrate on giving the town and the area more autonomy and support in terms of function than at present.  The municipal government structures, on which we are working, will have dedicated responsibilities and autonomy at local level.  With regard to the local development plan, what would anybody in the northern part of a county understand about a local area plan in the southern part of the county? These decisions have to be made as close as possible to the citizen and elected members.  That is only one example of what functions could be applied around a municipal government system that would make sense.</P><Col N="69"/>
        <P>Cork is a large county.  I am sure many have been asked in Mitchelstown to make decisions about Bantry and Skibbereen in the past.  That is not fair because of the pressures it imposes but it is equally unfair to the local knowledge and nuances that would be required to implement an appropriate plan in an area that is a distance away from elected representatives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Paschal Mooney that we have a soviet system at national and local level, perhaps, where the level of centralisation is far too unhealthy for democracy and where citizens' participation has contributed to providing some balance, rather than the membership of the local government or the membership of the Oireachtas.  This issue needs to be addressed.  Equally the power vested in officialdom in local government is not healthy in terms of local democracy.  This has contributed to many people not participating at election time, and not standing for election across the spectrum of socio-economic and business groups to give a more holistic representation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>If people see that they have power to implement decisions at local authority level, more people will be interested in participation.  At present, that is not the case.</P>
        <P>I hope that by the 2014 local elections people will see I am serious about giving more power, and with power comes responsibility.  Equally they may have to make tough decisions.  However, that is the essence of what we all do every day.  That is not the case at local level because they do not have sufficient powers to make those tough decisions.</P>

	<P>Start with the county managers Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The process will start at the 2014 local elections with a rebalancing of power to councillors, more accountability, more alignment between local elected members in community groups and a better system of local government that will attract more people to participate either by being elected to the local authority or participating, through the community sector, in enhancing the economic and social community projects that are badly needed.  This would have the effect of creating employment opportunities locally and delivering local services as close as possible to the citizen, with the maximum financial autonomy.  That is my objective.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister.  As this is a very long motion, I hope Members will bear with me.  Senator Maurice Cummins told us yesterday that it was to be the longest ever moved in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator does not have to read through it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleagues will deal with some elements of it.  </P>
        <P>The population of the nine counties along the western seaboard and the Shannon Estuary, from County Donegal to County Cork, is approximately 1.6 million.  They cover an area of 38,450 sq. km., or over 50% of the country, and there are not enough people to fill it, as for decades emigration was a fact of life for young people until the Celtic tiger arrived.  However, we are still losing people to emigration because there are not enough jobs available for them here and we are caught in a downward spiral of financial difficulties and media-driven doom and depression.  This has everything to do with the motion.</P>
        <P>We have the potential in that part of the country to reverse the scourge of emigration and bring back the brightest people this country has ever produced to live, work and pay taxes here and rebuild the country.  Renewable energy projects are part of the answer.  With some of the best natural resources in the world, namely, wind, wave, tidal, hydroelectric and biomass energy, we can reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels.  We import approximately &euro;6 billion worth of various fuels every year; therefore, by switching over more and more to renewables, we can save vast amounts in our balance of payments and create jobs in Ireland.</P>
        <P>We cannot afford to be held to ransom by political events outside Ireland.  The upheaval in the Middle East and north Africa as a result of the Arab Spring has resulted in higher prices for imported oil and gas which are having a major effect on our competitiveness as a country.  Industry is being hit with increased costs for electricity, transport or raw materials that are oil based.  Domestic consumers are also feeling these when they look at their electricity, heating, petrol or diesel bills.</P>
        <P>The share of electricity consumption from renewable energy sources jumped between 2000 and 2010 from 5.5% to 14.8%.  This is above the EU target for 2010 of 13.2% as per the renewable energy source directive, RES.  This is happening because Ireland has some of the best wind energy sources in Europe, with the wind blowing in from the Atlantic.  At the end of 2011 we had a connected energy supply of some 1,500 MW from wind farms and expect to have further capacity of 5,000 MW by 2020.  We have, therefore, much to do in the next eight years.</P>
        <P>In its 2011-50 wind energy road map report the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland estimates that we have &ldquo;the potential to create 20,000 jobs in the installation, operation and maintenance of onshore and offshore wind farms in Ireland by 2040&rdquo;.  Furthermore, the &ldquo;potential economic value of electricity generated from wind could reach &euro;15 billion by 2050&rdquo;.  We could, therefore, have between 11 GW and 16 GW from onshore wind farms and up to 30 GW from offshore wind farms by 2050.  These figures are significant and emphasize the massive potential of the sector, as well as the number of wind farms that need to be brought online.  The European Wind Energy Association has indicated that for every megawatt provided, 15.1 jobs are created in the European Union.  There were 154,000 employed in the wind energy sector in 2007 and this figure is forecast to rise to 325,000 by 2020.  As Ireland lies on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, tidal and wave energy must be harnessed.  In SEAI&rsquo;s, Ocean Energy Roadmap 2010 &mdash; 2050, it proposes that up to 29 GW of ocean energy capacity can be installed without significant environmental impact and up to 70,000 jobs with up to &euro;12 billion in cumulative economic benefit by 2030 and &euro;120 billion by 2050.  All of that will put huge strains on the national grid and thus EirGrid is in the process of upgrading and strengthening the grid <Col N="73"/>with its Grid 25 programme.  This involves the investment of up to &euro;4 billion.  We must ensure that this programme is rolled out with the utmost speed.  As we are in a downturn in our economic cycle this is the time projects should be fast-tracked as construction costs have fallen.  In addition, our demands from industry for energy are lower at the moment and that must be viewed as an opportunity.  The seeds of recovery planted today will bear fruit in the near future.</P>
        <P>I have spoken previously on the grid and the issues relating to the Gate 3 process.  We should be looking at a new Gate 4 process that will be directed at the export of excess energy to the UK and Europe.  As part of the programme for Government we stated, &ldquo;We will ensure that future wind farms are built in locations where wind regime is best and that they are built in large numbers or in clusters to reduce the cost of connection to the grid under new plan led Gate 4 process as opposed to the existing developer led system&rdquo;.  The developer-led system is the cause of the current problem.  If we implement this process we can let EirGrid target those projects that have the necessary permissions and finance in place to proceed much quicker.  There is no point in running a new line 50 to 80 miles to connect to a tiny wind farm just because the Gate 3 process allows for it, when one could have many projects far closer to the existing grid connected in a shorter time, that are ready to proceed now but have been told that it could be up to ten years before they get a connection.  In such a situation, there is a case for the Government to consider the construction of privately-owned grids serving specific customers or locations.  There is nothing like a bit of competition to get people focused and creative.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The east-west interconnector will be a huge boost to our ability to export energy.  When it goes live this 500 MW interconnector will enable trade from the single electricity market, SEM, on the island of Ireland to the British electricity trading and transmission arrangements market, BETTA.  Cost-benefit analysis studies should be carried out by EirGrid into the viability of connecting with France.  Both Britain and France have ageing nuclear power generating stations.  Britain has said that it is willing to invest up to &pound;5 billion to ensure that its energy requirements are achieved.  The British-Irish Council is the forum that may allow us to benefit from this.  The French Court of Audit stated in a report covered in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>New York Post</i> that 22 of France&rsquo;s nuclear power stations will reach their expected 40 year lifespan by 2022.  They will either have to extend their lifespan or else sharply increase investment in electricity production.  That would be equivalent to building 11 next generation nuclear power plants.  The French have already spent &euro;188 billion on their existing plants.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile, Germany has said all of its nuclear power plants will be shut by 2022.  It would be far cheaper for these countries to import electricity from locations such as Ireland.  If we can open up further interconnectors, vast markets for clean carbon-free energy are there for the taking.  If we do not, then some other country will fill those needs even though they do not have the wind or wave capacity we have.</P>
        <P>We could also use the new interconnector projects to lay high-speed fibre optic cables to enable fast data transfer between North America, Ireland and Europe.  Pumped hydro is another feature of the renewable mix that we should be investigating.  At present we have the Turlough Hill pumped hydro facility in County Wicklow which can store approximately 1.5 GW per hour of electricity.  EirGrid should look further at this option in locations that have been identified by such groups as Spirit of Ireland and others.  There are other potential add-on benefits of such facilities.  Electric Mountain in Snowdonia in Wales, which attracts more than 300,000 paying visitors per year, is such an example.  We have locations around the country that may be suitable for this, such as corrie lakes formed during the previous ice age in areas such as Kerry, Donegal, Galway and Mayo.  Local authorities could identify where such renewable projects could be feasible and county development plans are now taking a proactive approach in setting targets for renewable projects.</P><Col N="74"/>
        <P>Professor J. Owen, chief executive of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, in the foreword to the Energy in Ireland 1990-2010 report published in December 2011 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A particularly encouraging development is the significant greater involvement of local decision makers and opinion formers in supporting the drive towards sustainable energy.  The recent production of renewable energy strategies in counties Mayo and Clare is a clear example of this.  Both counties highlight the positive benefits associated with the exploitation of natural renewable resources in a sustainable manner, while critically identifying areas in their counties where such development would be seen in a more positive light.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Data storage is another add-on to the mix of renewable energy projects.  Many of the major Internet search companies such as Google and Adobe and social media companies such as Facebook are looking for locations to store vast amounts of data.  They use huge amounts of energy keeping their servers from over-heating.  It does not matter where they are situated and if the climatic conditions are cool then they will use less energy.  Ireland offers such a location.  With high speed fibre optic links such as the North-South Kelvin direct international connectivity project which was completed in late 2010, direct international connectivity between the north-west and Border regions with North America and Britain can now be provided.  Further links will now be achieved through the east-west interconnector &mdash; a 7,000 GB fibre optic link to Britain.</P>
        <P>With these strategic pieces of infrastructure we can tap into the data storage market.  Google has spent &euro;200 million on such a facility in Finland to serve the Nordic market.  It is based in a former paper mill which closed in January 2008 but has been given a new lease of life following a refit by the company that bought it in 2009.  The facility will be serviced by a 12 MW wind farm nearby.  If we could tap into the next fibre optic project from North America to Europe which will be laid off the south coast, we could open up the counties of Kerry, Cork and Waterford to this market.  Big international companies want to be associated with clean energy and clean technology.</P>
        <P>Large industrial bases such as Shannon Free Zone have the potential to brand themselves as carbon-free zones.  Situated between the airport and the town with a population in excess of 10,000, we could copy the Swedish model of building combined heat and power plants which would use carbon reducing biomass fuel sources such as locally grown willow, miscanthus and pine wood pulp which would support farmers and forestry growers along the western seaboard and the midlands.  The power generated could be used to power the industrial estate and the airport.  The heat generated could be used to heat the town by piping hot water to the houses, thus creating one giant central heating system.  This would off-set the importation of fossil fuels to produce electricity and oil to heat houses.  Such an approach could be replicated in many locations throughout the country.  These projects could be rolled out all over the country where there are population centres and industry in close proximity.  If the Minister so wishes I will forward him a briefing on the issue although I am sure he has it already.  For such projects to locate in this country we must examine how we allocate the REFIT tariff to such producers.</P>
        <P>We must also examine the reason it takes so long in this country for large projects to get off the ground.  We must look at the criteria used in how objections to large-scale projects in this country are lodged and dealt with.  It is a citizen&rsquo;s right to object but there have been situations where renewable projects have been objected to by individuals and entities that do not live in close proximity to the proposed project but dozens of miles away and in some cases more than 100 miles away.  There have been cases where the same individual objectors pop up, such as local government, the SEAI and the EPA.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Govern<Col N="75"/>ment must examine the issue and at the same time seek to protect the environment.  We can create jobs in this country with a little help in planning and a lot of common sense, which I am sure the Minister will bring to the Department.  The biggest issue is the EirGrid interconnector and how we bring to fruition the shovel-ready projects that are waiting to commence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is an important subject.  It is World Energy Day.  There is a display in Leinster House on what the Oireachtas has done for the heating system and the renewable energy used in the Houses.  I commend all involved in that regard.</P>
        <P>Awareness about renewable energy has grown significantly in recent years and it is now universally recognised as being paramount to future environmental conservation, economic growth and job creation.  The three fundamental pillars that our energy policy rests upon are competitiveness, security of supply and environmental sustainability.  Renewable energy is fundamental to our energy policy as it plays a key role in shaping this country&rsquo;s future and is critical to delivering the policy goals of clean, secure and affordable energy supplies.</P>
        <P>This country has more than three times its total energy requirements available from readily accessible renewable energy sources on its own doorstep which would enable us to move away from an over-reliance on imported fossil fuels, yet despite access to such vast and plentiful clean energy resources, this country is still heavily dependent on volatile foreign fossil fuel, importing almost 86% of its energy needs.  As Senator Mulcahy indicated, this country has the best wind resource, as it is the first landmass for several thousand miles to intercept the prevailing westerly winds.  Apart from a small area in the south of France, only Ireland, Denmark and a small part of Scotland have substantial areas of land where wind speeds at 50 m above ground level on open plains meet the 7.5 metres per second requirement.  In the whole of Europe we are the ones with that advantage.</P>
        <P>As conventional energy resources run out, Ireland has an extraordinary opportunity to use its natural resources in a cost competitive way to achieve energy independence and become a world leader in the use of clean energy.  This key message was delivered recently at NovaUCD by Mr. John Travers, author and CEO of Alternative Energy Resources, AER, at the launch of his new book, <i>Green &amp; Gold &mdash; Ireland a Clean Energy World Leader?</i>  It is claimed in the conclusions that 20% of total Irish energy needs can be met from renewable energy sources within the next ten years and 80% by 2050, while 20% of Irish GDP can be derived from clean energy exports.</P>
        <P>I will skip the figures for wind energy production, as Senator Mulcahy has already supplied them.  The wind energy resource in Ireland is four times that of the European average and we must exploit it.  The Minister is doing so and I commend his Department for the recent publication of the first progress report on the national renewable energy action plan, submitted under Article 22 of the EU directive.</P>
        <P>We must also look to our European counterparts, in particular, Denmark and Sweden, both of which are planning to meet 35% of their energy needs through wind energy productin by 2020, which is higher than the European target of 20%.  Given our capability, we should strive to do likewise and also aim for a figure of 35%.</P>
        <P>Biomass is another source within the renewables spectrum where there is good potential for growth in an Irish context.  The supply of energy crops such as pulpwood and wood industry residues is set to increase by more than 30% in the period to 2016 and the demand for these products could feasibly increase by more than 70% in the same period.  Wood fuel can gradually displace oil.  As such, policy measures to encourage the use of biomass energy sources are necessary.</P><Col N="76"/>
        <P>I have followed with interest the development of tidal energy projects, particularly on the west coast where I am from originally and Wavebob was developed.  That work has received some help, but the industry remains three years away from being commercial.  There is a lead-in time for putting in place the infrastructure needed for wave farms.  This involves the permit and planning processes, environmental impact assessments and regulatory issues, all of which are major considerations for many companies.  The Minister should keep this in mind.</P>
        <P>Wave-generated electricity projects offer consistency in power generation not found with wind-powered devices.  The combination of sustainability and consistency makes the generation of electricity by means of wave power such a vital cog in the wheel of renewable energy projects.</P>
        <P>Senator Mulcahy referred to the issue of planning, but I will remind the Minister about a related matter.  We do not get much sun, but solar panels that do not require light from the sun are being developed.  In the United Kingdom planning permission for the installation of solar panels is only required in the case of listed buildings.  Will the Minister consider adopting this approach?</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister might review the fuel subsidy systems?  In Pittsburgh in 2009 the G20 leaders committed to phasing out in the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encouraged wasteful consumption.  Eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy, the environment and energy security.  This is according to the International Energy Agency which was referring to the pledge made by G20 countries.</P>
        <P>To ensure security of supply, different methodologies of fuel supply are vital.  We must ensure the new interconnector does not disadvantage the funding of alternative sources of supply and that there is a competitive balance in the Irish gas and electricity markets.</P>
        <P>Only 18% of Iran&rsquo;s oil supplies go to the European Union.  Its principal customers are China and Russia which oppose sanctions.  How influential will the sanctions be?  Would the use of the diplomatic route instead of sanctions have been better?  EU decisions are not always right.</P>
        <P>The Minister must be commended for announcing the renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT 3, scheme in November which will pave the way for the connection of an additional amount of renewable energy, a matter Senator Mulcahy dealt with in detail.</P>
        <P>I welcome the planned publication of the Government&rsquo;s new energy policy framework this year and hope it will be ambitious enough to meet and exceed Ireland&rsquo;s needs in terms of job creation and energy supply.  The Government has committed to meeting 16% of our energy needs from renewable energy sources.  Are each sector&rsquo;s targets up to speed or is any sector falling behind?</P>
        <P>With the production of wind energy, ensuring storage capacity is a necessity.  Senator Mulcahy mentioned a few storage methods.  Without storage capacity we will not have a convenient and steady supply of energy. As such, a storage system needs to be invented to ensure a steady energy supply.  In the case of renewables, sometimes there is too much energy for the grid to handle.  Wind energy projects especially present a problem in this regard, in that it is usually windier at night.  Is research being conducted on various renewable energy storage methods?  An innovative way of storing renewable energy resources is being tested in the United Kingdom by a cryogenic company, Highview Power Storage.  It uses the excess capacity at times of low demand to power refrigeration units to cool air to approximately -190&deg; Celsius, to turn it into liquid nitrogen for cryogenic energy storage purposes.  We should consider using a similar system.  Last Sunday the Minister announced the provision of &euro;1 million for UCD or <Col N="77"/>every university.  Will any of this money be used to conduct research on storage methods?  It is a significant element.</P>
        <P>The potential for job creation has been mentioned.  Mr. Travers has stated there is a potential to create almost 100,000 jobs in harnessing energy from renewables and engaging in energy efficiency activities.  He has also stated clean energy projects could help to rescue Ireland from its current economic and energy challenges.  In achieving energy independence Ireland could become an outstanding world leader and a global beacon for the use of clean energy.  The Minister&rsquo;s stewardship will help this to come about.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  What is his opinion on the recent retirement of the chairman of the ESB and his sizable pension, an issue that is of concern to us all?  The wages paid within the ESB account for the significant increases in electricity bills.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the figures for energy costs, but one in four people claim they cannot cope with the increases, 15% have needed to dip into their savings to pay their energy bills and 8% have stated they are unable to cover household bills.  These figures show that people are unable to cope with price increases, some of which have been in the range of 21%.  For example, Airtricity which controls 17% of the domestic market and 15% of the electricity market has applied significant increases, thus increasing a household&rsquo;s annual bill of &euro;720 by &euro;160.  Bord G&aacute;is has done likewise, in that a household&rsquo;s annual bill has increased <Col N="78"/>from &euro;720 to &euro;900.  As we all know, wages represent the greatest cost in any company.  In the ESB&rsquo;s case, that cost is considerable.  The production of energy is not cheap and there is an oil supply issue, but even during our time in government, increments, pay increases and significant pensions were awarded time and again.  Does the Government plan to tackle this issue?</P>
        <P>We know about the better energy scheme because we introduced it.  Although the Government is discussing increasing its use, there has been a 35% reduction in the grants available.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, takes up to six months to process grant applications.  We have all dealt with constituents who have had work done, yet they are unable to have their grant applications processed.</P>
        <P>We take issue with the Government&rsquo;s motion because of the extraordinary position on privately run grids.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party is of the view that the grid system should remain in State ownership.  What is proposed in the Government motion, namely, privately run grids, would lead to protests on a monumental scale.  The ESB has the right to install grid infrastructure across private lands for the greater good of the community.  However, if private companies are given the right to go through people&rsquo;s land we will have Shell to Sea times 100.  Will the Minister clarify the reference to private grids?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said in the House on 8 October last that neither the EU nor the IMF is forcing the Government to dispose of State assets.  It is a Government initiative, we were told, with the revenues that are generated to be put into a jobs initiative.  We all know what happened when the levy was imposed on pension funds for the apparent purpose of creating jobs.  Nobody can say whether a single job was created as a result of that money being taken out of pensions.  The only clear result is that people are now afraid to put money into pensions for fear of being taxed.  Will the Minister clarify the job creation proposals?  The troika has indicated that it will consider the Government&rsquo;s proposal in this regard but that there can be no question of simply selling State assets and putting the revenues into a jobs fund without there being a proper plan and targets in place.</P>
        <P>Members opposite referred to wind farm subsidies.  A great deal of money is required to put that infrastructure in place.  Thus far there has been an unco-ordinated approach, with large tracts of land designated for wind farms at various locations throughout the State but little or no progress thereafter.  The hen harrier seems to be the most endangered and protected species on God&rsquo;s green earth.  It is certainly the most famous bird in Ireland and seems to have visited every place where a planning application for a wind farm has been submitted.  Another problem is that while we have zoning for wind farms, we do not have the facilities and infrastructure to get the electricity out of the farms.  In other words, they are essentially non-viable.  Will the Minister comment on this?</P>
        <P>The motion calls to mind some of the more striking &mdash; I will not use the word &ldquo;outrageous&rdquo; because nothing is outrageous when it comes to five-point plans and so on &mdash; commitments given by the Fine Gael Party before the election.  For example, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, made many promises about the rerouting of the North-South gas pipeline away from his own constituency.  That is now going full steam ahead.</P>
        <P>The wind farm and wave energy proposals are very welcome.  However, what is of greatest concern to people is the rising cost of energy.  As my colleague from County Clare has pointed out, there is great potential for wind and wave energy in this State, but it is too far down the line to be of any help to the person whose electricity or gas bill was &euro;720 last year and will be &euro;900 this year.  Many people are dipping into their savings in order to meet their bills, with one in four unable to afford to keep even a few rooms in their home warm.</P><Col N="79"/>

How does <Col N="80"/>that correspond with the view expressed by the Fine Gael Party before and after the election that the North-South pylon system should go underground?  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment does not deal with this part of the motion; it simply adds on something about Shell to Sea.  That party is obsessed with Shell to Sea.</P>

        <P>In regard to the east-west connector, it seems nobody spoke to the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, who promised to reroute it away from his constituency.  The motion could not have been written by a Fine Gael person, who would surely have known about the Minister&rsquo;s solemn pledge to the people of north Dublin.

The Fianna F&aacute;il Party does not support a private grid, as we were accused of doing in the early days of the pylon controversy.  A huge mistake was made in the case of Eircom and it is about time the lessons were learned from that.</P>
        <P>The motion calls for a review of the criteria for &ldquo;individuals and entities lodging objections or submissions to planning applications&rdquo;.  It also calls for a greater alignment of the &ldquo;range of permissions and authorisations required for renewable energy projects&rdquo;.  This could be interpreted in two ways, first, as an undertaking to make it easier for people to object, even though it is already relatively easy to do so, or, alternatively, as a statement of intent by the Government to make it more difficult.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party in government had a very successful policy on renewable energy and a very successful fuel poverty scheme in the form of the warmer homes scheme.  The Government is continuing the latter and, although I accept there is less money for it, it is the best way to tackle fuel poverty.  We heard a great deal about fuel poverty from the Labour Party in opposition, and I commended and supported it at the time.  The Minister of State, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, did a great deal of good work as an Opposition member of the Joint Committee on Social Protection.  The findings and research she brought forward were unanswerable.  Fuel poverty was an issue in respect of which I acknowledge we did not do enough in government, apart from the warmer homes scheme.  Very little has been heard from this Government on the matter since the election, other than its reduction in the fuel allowance while simultaneously claiming there were no reductions in social welfare rates.</P>
        <P>My party colleagues and I will reject the privatisation of the grid or any private grid solutions.  We will call on the Fine Gael Party to implement its pre-election promises and commitments in regard to the North-South infrastructure.  I acknowledge that the international commission <Col N="81"/>set up by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, did a good job of listening to people and produced a fairly comprehensible report &mdash; in so far as it is possible to do so &mdash; on the subject of interconnection.  However, this is the seventh or eighth such report by various parties.  It is probably the most clearly written but it is not a novel venture.</P>
        <P>We also intend to hold the Government accountable, although the horse has long bolted, on the issue of the east-west interconnector at Rush, which the Minister for Health promised would be rerouted in the interests of his electorate.  While like the Minister I, too, welcome that proposal, nothing has as yet happened in that regard.  There should be accountability in politics.  It is time motions put forward in the Seanad reflected the political position.  This is a political motion which does not, to say the least, reflect the policies and politics of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the debate on this considered motion on renewable energy.</P>
        <P>We all agree that energy is a basic component of modern society and that its availability and cost play a critical role in the quality of our lives and in facilitating our economic development.  Our energy policy is based on ensuring a secure, clean and affordable energy supply for Ireland.  Renewable energy will play a key role in shaping Ireland&rsquo;s energy future and will, in turn, contribute to each of our policy goals of secure, clean and affordable energy supplies.  As argued by Senator Mulcahy, as a society we need to develop our indigenous renewable energy sources if we are to move away from imported fuel sources.  In doing so, we not only improve our balance of payments position and reduce economic exposure to the volatile global fuel prices about which Senator Keane spoke but we reduce our overall level of carbon emissions.  Upwardly, spiralling global oil prices, driven by robust demand in the emerging economies and ongoing geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East and North African regions pose risks for our future cost of energy and, potentially, our security of energy supply.</P>
        <P>For Senator Daly to allege that the Government is somehow responsible for the geopolitical events that have led to the increase of imported fossil fuels is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste claimed credit for Senator Daly&rsquo;s actions last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter beyond which we have control.  Other key energy policy drivers include the fundamental changes in the global gas supply market, pressures on the availability and cost of capital for the capital intensive energy sector, whether State owned or private sector and changes in energy technology.  As a country that imports almost 90% of our energy requirements, we are acutely aware of these challenges and the real opportunity that developing our indigenous energy resources provides.  Given the dramatic change to our own and, Europe&rsquo;s, economic fortunes, now is a good time to evaluate our energy policy directions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Towards the end of 2011, the international energy agency carried out its four-yearly review of Irish energy policy.  The review includes a detailed assessment of the efficiency of the Irish electricity and gas sectors, taking full account of the EU regulatory context for these sectors.  I look forward to receiving its assessment of our energy policy in a few months.  This analysis will feed into a review of the existing 2007 energy White Paper that my Department will carry <Col N="82"/>out over the coming months in consultation with stakeholders and with a view to publishing during this year a new energy policy framework for 2012-30.</P>
        <P>As part of our energy and climate change 2020 European commitments, Ireland has been set a legally binding target of 16% of all energy consumed to be from renewable sources by 2020.  At national level, we achieved this target by delivering 40% in the electricity sector, 12% in the heat sector and 10% in the transport sector.  In response to Senator Keane&rsquo;s question, we are reasonably comfortable that we will achieve the target for the electricity sector but there will be difficulties achieving the targets for the heat and transport sectors.  The combined delivery across these three sectors is consistent with delivering our European target of 16% of all energy from renewable sources.</P>
        <P>In the electricity sector, while we have seen good progress in recent years, moving from 5% renewable electricity in 2005 to around 15% renewable electricity now, we still have a long way to go to ensure that we reach our 2020 target of 40% renewable electricity.  The achievements in this area to date are reflected in the significant reduction in emission levels from electricity between 1990 and 2009.  While earlier improvements in this area were primarily due to replacing older, less efficient generating plant on the system, it is clear that in later years the growing deployment of renewable energy has increasingly contributed to the overall emissions reduction.  I am confident that Ireland has the capability to achieve its domestic renewable electricity targets from the onshore wind projects already in the existing Gate processes, despite the many difficulties being encountered and the undoubted challenges which remain for a number of projects, including Senator Daly&rsquo;s harrier hen.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It is hen harrier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>This requires the ongoing roll out of the Grid 25 investment programme, together with delivery of the essential North-South transmission reinforcements and completion of the east-west interconnector.  Senator Byrne expressed concern about the North-South transmission.  I agree with him that it is an essential reinforcement of the all-Ireland electricity system.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to commission international experts to assess the case for undergrounding of whole or part has been completed.  No one questioned the credentials of the three international experts from Sweden, Norway and Belgium.  As stated by Senator Byrne, the report is accessible.  I published the report immediately on bringing it to Government.  A copy of it has also been sent to the Chairman of the Select sub-Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Andrew Doyle.  It is open to anyone, including the anti-pylon group, EirGrid, ESB networks and so on, to make submissions on the report to that committee.  We must get on with making the decision thereafter.  I have not heard anyone, even those most vehemently opposed to it, question the necessity for strengthening the grid in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government, together with the UK Government, Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh administrations, working under the auspices of the British-Irish Council, is firmly committed to developing the renewable energy resources of these islands with a view to developing cross border trade in renewable energy, where appropriate, across our jurisdictions.  This can create a major renewable energy export opportunity for Ireland.  Ireland has some of the best wind and wave resources by international standards.  We intend to develop our renewable energy export potential in a way that can provide a real return to the State and to do so in a way that does not expose the Irish business or domestic electricity consumer to additional costs.</P><Col N="83"/>
        <P Just="Left">We are also working with our neighbouring countries to see how best we can co-operate to better plan and build our future energy infrastructure.  In combining our efforts, we can find ways to reduce the overall amount of infrastructure required and to ensure the optimal use of the infrastructure that is built.  In this way, all electricity consumers will be better off in the long run.  Ireland is also working in Europe with the UK and eight other Governments, under the North Sea offshore grid initiative, to create a planning, market and regulatory framework to support offshore infrastructure development and facilitate cross border renewable energy trading in north-west Europe.</P>
        <P>In terms of infrastructure capacity, the delivery by EirGrid of new grid and grid upgrades is critical to ensuring that Ireland can meet its renewable energy target.  New grid and grid upgrades not only facilitate renewable energy but serve to enhance the economic opportunities available in rural parts of the country.  I fully support and underline the importance and urgency of Grid 25 implementation, including the North-South interconnector.</P>
        <P>During the past year, 150 km of new transmission lines were completed, along with upgrades to 300 km of existing lines.  This new build and upgrading is essential if we are to connect 200MW of new renewable generation annually, commensurate with delivery of our target.  The delivery of the east-west interconnector later in 2012 will be an important milestone, ending our electricity grid isolation and permitting trade with Britain, in line with the EU&rsquo;s goal of regional energy markets.  A great deal can be done at local level in meeting these challenges.  In that context, I welcome the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, initiative to develop a methodology that can be used by local authorities in compiling local and regional renewable energy strategies.  An increasing number of counties are developing renewable energy deployment plans.  These, combined with the development by the SEAI of geographic information systems for wind, bio-energy and geothermal resource assessment, can assist local authorities in developing their own comprehensive GIS maps of the renewable energy resources potentially available for development in their geographic areas.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, is finalising a foreshore and marine area development Bill, the purpose of which is to integrate &ldquo;the foreshore consent process under the Foreshore Acts 1933 with the existing on-land planning system&rdquo;.  Specifically, this Bill will seek to do the following: integrate the foreshore consent process for major strategic infrastructure projects within the strategic consent process operated by An Bord Plean&aacute;la &mdash; Senator Mulcahy made a point in respect of such infrastructure; integrate the foreshore consent process for non-strategic infrastructure projects within the wider planning system operated by the local authorities; and provide for a plan-led approach for future foreshore development.</P>
        <P>In the heat sector, last month the Government approved a new REFIT scheme for biomass technologies, including those involving combined heat and power and anaerobic digestion.  The scheme aims to incentivise the addition of 310MW of renewable electricity biomass capacity to the Irish grid and will have the benefit of diversifying the range of energy sources from which our electricity is generated.  As well as contributing to the targets for renewable electricity, the combined heat and power projects supported under the scheme will have the added benefit of contributing to our renewable heat targets, including the potential to be utilised for district heating programmes or as heat load for manufacturing processes.  By using materials such as farm wastes &mdash; materials from forestry or energy crops &mdash; electricity generated from biomass gives rise to high local economic benefits and also to positive environmental and social impacts.  The scheme will also underpin the energy crops grant programme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The scheme will also provide a stable market for <Col N="84"/>developing the domestic biomass sector and the co-firing project, in particular, will present a new market for private and public forests for their product.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s target for energy in the transport sector coming from renewable sources by 2020 is 10%.  This target will be achieved through the dual approach of deploying sustainably acceptable bio-fuels into our fossil fuel road transport fleet and by expanding the early electric vehicle market.  We will increase the amount of sustainable bio-fuels used in the transport fuel mix to 10% by 2020.  The bio-fuel obligation scheme introduced in 2010 currently obliges suppliers of road transport fuels to ensure that at least 4% of such fuels placed on the Irish market are biofuels.  This level will be incrementally increased in the coming years to 10% by 2020.  In addition, the Government has set a target to the effect that 10% of all vehicles should be powered or partially powered by electricity by 2020.  This equates to a market size of around 220,000 vehicles.  Senators may consider that this is an ambitious target.  In April 2011, I launched the electric vehicle grants scheme to assist people in the purchase of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.  The grants relating to this scheme, which are additional to the VRT reliefs that currently apply, are available towards the purchase of electric vehicles.</P>
        <P>At European level, my Department is working to ensure that new cross-border trading rules that will facilitate increased energy trading will be developed and that the new market arrangements that are being drawn up will facilitate the development of more renewable energy.  Late last year, the European Commission published an energy infrastructure package which highlighted the need for greater interconnectivity between markets and the need to build infrastructure to help harness more renewable energy technologies.  The European Union already has ambitious renewable energy, energy efficiency and climate change targets and the Commission is now setting longer-term ambitions in its roadmaps for low carbon economy and low carbon energy systems for 2050.  Ireland must be part of those ambitions.  Some contributors to the debate on this matter are of the view that the targets established by the European Union in respect of renewables are in some way optional, although no Senator has yet made this point.  Regardless of whether one agrees with the levels of use of renewables that have been set down, the targets to which I refer are, in effect, mandatory in nature.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to achieving its EU and international climate change targets.  The energy sector will play a key role in underpinning this by assisting in the achievement of our renewable energy and energy efficiency targets.  We are clearly moving from an island-based energy system into a more interconnected and joined-up European energy market.  As that market develops in the coming years, it will provide new and bigger market opportunities of which our renewable energy sector can avail.  With our proven natural resources in this area, we are well placed to become a key renewable energy trading country.</P>
        <P>I have, for some time, been committed to attend an important meeting in respect of this matter at another forum at 5 p.m.  I, therefore, apologise for the fact that I will not be present for the remainder of the Seanad&rsquo;s debate on it.  Before I leave, however, I wish to respond to some of the points raised by Senators.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I dealt with the issue of running cables underground and hope that we can conclude the process in this regard in six weeks.  I see no point in procrastinating.  We should allow the relevant committee of the Oireachtas to proceed with its deliberations in order that everyone who wants to put forward his or her point of view might do so.  It is necessary, however, to do the business.  I hope I will be able to return to Government in respect of this matter within six weeks.  After that, the planning process will take its course.</P><Col N="85"/>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Byrne in respect of one matter.  He stated that what happened with Eircom was a mistake; it was a disaster.  That matter is the source of some discussion in the financial pages of the newspapers.  Those who helped themselves, quite liberally, to the profits of Eircom rather than reinvesting them in broadband and other necessary infrastructure have a great deal for which to answer.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am merely highlighting the fact that what happened has left us at our current pass.  There is a lesson here which we must take on board.  The only decision the Government has taken in this regard is to the effect that it would agree to the disposal of a minority stake in a vertically integrated ESB Electric Ireland, subject to due diligence.  I have accepted possession of the relevant report and of a less forensic and separate report, namely, a survey of the assets in the State&rsquo;s cupboard, but this has not yet come to the Government.  Neither the Government nor I want to dispose of State assets but, under the terms of the memorandum of understanding with the troika, we are required to do so.</P>

	<P>The quantum is not fixed in this regard.  It was something of a welcome breakthrough that in the most recent engagement the troika agreed that a proportion of the proceeds may be used for investment purposes in the economy.  That is a significant development.  As stated, however, a quantum has not been agreed and we must still bring matters to a point where the position in that regard will be defined.  To some extent I get the impression that it is as a result of the agreements imposed on Greece and Portugal that Ireland will be made to comply.  That is not, perhaps, the best basis for forcing the sale of State assets.</P>

I commend the work in this regard of my predecessor, Mr. Eamon Ryan, and hope notwithstanding the strapped circumstances in which we find ourselves that we can build on it.</P><Col N="86"/>
        <P>I am glad to see this motion brought to the House on an issue which is not as tempting for the media as other areas in politics but is a very critical area for the consumer, business and economic development.  I look forward to reading the remainder of the House&rsquo;s consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always a pleasure to hear the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and his knowledge and wit are welcome in any debate.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, in the competitiveness challenge report for 2011, stated that renewed international competitiveness is central to any Irish economic recovery.  This is the problem I have with the Irish energy sector.  It is not competitive and it is not thoroughly enough regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  This is a sizeable obstacle in the economic development of the country.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The Forf&aacute;s report on energy competitiveness found that in the first half of 2011 Ireland was the sixth most expensive country in the EU for electricity prices for small and medium-sized enterprises.  The reason I feel the Commission for Energy Regulation has not been active enough is that we know the ESB in particular is a low productivity and extremely high wage company, witnessed only last Saturday.  This was pointed out in the McCarthy report on the disposal and performance of State assets published in April last year.  Regulation which does not go into the high cost base of the ESB and extract these monopoly rents and pass them on to consumers in the form of lower prices does not serve the Irish economic recovery.  A shoal of countries including Finland, France, Sweden and the United Kingdom have cheaper energy and electricity costs than we do for small and medium size enterprises.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To quote a phrase of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, this is an area where policy is captured by producers and the costs are borne by the rest of the economy.  If we go too far in the direction of very high cost renewable energy sources &mdash; some of them are extremely high cost  &mdash; we will damage the competitiveness of the overall economy because people must buy this electricity at inflated prices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In its review of the economy the OECD recommended that we phase out supports for offshore wave and tidal energy because they are not commercially viable.  They are financed through a public service obligation payment which costs &euro;118 million.  Of this the direct subsidy to peat is &euro;40 million, with &euro;36.5 million going to renewable energy generation and the remainder accounted for by administration and capacity related expenditure.  We are rigging the market in favour of some of the renewable sources which the OECD states are not competitive.</P>
        <P>There are also great doubts about electric cars, which were mentioned by the Minister.  If one takes what a normal car puts into the Exchequer one can put a minus sign with regard to the same car if it is electric.  It would require a subsidy equal to the tax payment so one loses on the double.  Looking through the report there are also great doubts about biomass, which is an activity completely dependent on subsidies, and with regard to combined heat and power schemes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Much of the debate has been dominated by things that are possible in engineering terms but not affordable in terms of what this economy is trying to achieve.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that the International Energy Agency would report on energy policy.  I look forward to reading the report soon.  There is a belief that wave energy in Ireland is free or low-cost but it is not.  It is more expensive than the alternatives and this is why we must subsidise it through the backdoor mechanism of the public service obligation which is borne by consumers.  Many of the other energy options which must be stood up by the Minister and the Department in <Col N="87"/>the face of economic analysis are likely to increase the cost base of the economy rather than reducing it.</P>
        <P>Moving the renewable energy sources target to 40% in electricity has been estimated by the National Competitiveness Council to add approximately 10% to electricity bills because the more expensive options are being chosen all the time.  A proposal was made, which is commented on by the McCarthy review, to raise this 40% to 42% but each time it is raised high cost options are brought into play and it damages the competitiveness of Irish industry.</P>
        <P>I welcome the prospect of the gas find in Leitrim and Fermanagh and the bringing on shore of the Corrib gas.  This could change our position with regard to being dependent on imports.  For each of these changes we must recalculate the numbers on whether these renewable projects are worthwhile.  There has been an almost religious zeal that these are meritorious projects which are so obviously better than importing lower cost fuels from world markets.  This must be stood up with better numbers than those with which we have been supplied.</P>
        <P>There is fear among economists that the Department is captured by the producers of energy and the promoters of various expensive schemes and that the consumer does not get sufficient attention.  In this case, the consumer is Irish industry, which must compete worldwide.  The cost base of the ESB, not only with regard to the chief executive being paid more than twice what the Taoiseach earns but the average cost base, includes numbers reported in 2006 of &euro;142,000 being the average wage in the Poolbeg power station.</P>
        <P>If we are to become competitive again on the international stage we must look at these burdens on Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness even if they have a certain trendy association, such as alternative energy, because they damage our international competitiveness.  I look forward to the upcoming review the Minister mentioned.  I am grateful to the Senators opposite for tabling the motion because we need to discuss why many of our competing countries have lower energy costs than ours.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>With his background and qualifications in this area I take seriously and am very interested in everything Senator Barrett says, and it is something we should take into account.  There are those who believe that while renewables are the way forward and are commendable, there is a fear that it could be the next bubble, so to speak, that might not be sustainable in the long term.  That is something we must examine.  This issue is not just about <Col N="88"/>economics but the need to strike a delicate balance in terms of economics, the environment, the carbon footprint issue and our high dependency on imported oil.  We must factor all those aspects into the equation when we come to make decisions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In terms of best practice, I return to my well rehearsed view &mdash; I am like an old record on this one &mdash; that the more renewables we have in terms of wind and wave energy the greater the burden on the national grid and the greater the pressure on the roll-out of GRID 25, which will come through the heart of the country because it must transfer from the west to the east coast where the demand is greatest and will leave us with a virtual spider&rsquo;s web of power lines, cables and pylons.  The reality, unfortunately, is that it will drive through the midlands and my constituency.  I call on the Minister to use his good sense and influence to call on EirGrid to change its tack in terms of its corporate culture and approach this issue with transparency and in a fashion of co-operation and consultation with rural communities.  Most of the people in those communities believe in and support the roll-out of the grid but they are being criminalised, a phrase used earlier, turned into protesters and Ch&eacute; Guevara types in that every time EirGrid encounters any sort of obstacle, its first recourse is to the courts.  That is unfortunate and unnecessary because it is the taxpayer who is picking up the tab for that.  If EirGrid does not change its tune and embrace a constructive and co-operative approach, I am fearful that the roll-out of the grid will grind to a halt, something none of us can afford because our economic recovery is contingent on this grid being expedited, but only if EirGrid changes its tune.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is welcome.  I support the motion but will make some brief comments on the issue of wind energy.  We are all supportive of the notion of wind energy and I have always promoted the offshore wind energy option as it is twice as productive, although it might be twice as expensive.  That said, I have a problem with the distance between wind farms and private residences.  There is no protection for people who must live beside wind farms.  If one asks people who are not forced to live beside wind farms what they think of them, they will say they are beautiful to see as they drive around the country.  That may be true but not for those who have to live beside them.</P>
        <P>The Wind Turbines (Minimum Distances from Residential Premises) Bill is currently before the House of Lords in the United Kingdom.  It has passed Second Stage and Committee Stage will be taken soon.  The Bill was mooted by Lord Reay who stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">There are many reasons to be opposed to the Government&rsquo;s policy towards wind farms and I agree with most of them.  But this Bill only concerns itself with one disadvantage of onshore wind turbines &mdash; their propensity for making life a misery for those unlucky enough to find themselves forced to live in their shadow.</P>
        <P LI="1">There is now a well-established body of evidence, collected worldwide, that demonstrates the harmful effect of turbines for at least some of those who live close to them.  Complaints are made continuously to the environmental health officers of local authorities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In her book on wind turbine syndrome, Dr. Nina Pierpont recorded and analysed the symptoms of a number of families in different parts of the world who were driven out of their homes by their sufferings from wind farms.  Dr. Pierpont concluded that a minimum setback distance of 2 km should be required and also that developers should be obliged to buy out affected families at the pre-turbine value of their homes, if that is feasible.</P><Col N="89"/>
        <P>I do not necessarily agree that we should publish a Bill that proposes turbines should be located 2 km away from homes but it should be done based on their scale.  The higher they are, the farther away they should be from homes.  I have mentioned that to the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and I propose to initiate a Bill in this House along those lines which I hope will be supported because there is no protection for local people when it comes to wind turbines.  They are lovely but when developers decide they want to put a wind farm in a particular area, the only protection for families is that they are supposed to involve the local community.  However, they do not do that.  The developer identifies the location, talks to the farmer and signs him or her up to a sweet deal in which he or she will get &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 a year for leasing the land, and once that deal is done, there is no going back on it.  The developer then tells the local community what he or she proposes to do, at which time it is too late for the community to do anything about it.  That is not protection for people given the health risks attached to these wind turbines.  I hope the Minister of State will be supportive of the Bill when we bring it before the House.</P>

T&aacute; go leor ruda&iacute; dearfacha faoin r&uacute;n seo a mbeadh muid ag tac&uacute; leo, ach t&aacute; s&eacute; cine&aacute;l aisteach go bhfuil an Rialtas ag glaoch air f&eacute;in le rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh.</P>
        <P>There are many positive elements to this motion but I note that, curiously, much of it relates to the Government calling on itself to act and that is the reason we brought forward our amendment.  Our amendment concerns the establishment of a full review of licensing terms governing oil and gas exploration promised by the Minister during a debate on a Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members&rsquo; motion in the D&aacute;il last April.  I raised it with the Minister in this House previously.  He undertook, in response to the motion and a specific proposal from Fianna F&aacute;il, to establish such a review through the committee.  So far he has done nothing to bring that about and our amendment is by way of reminding him of his promise.</P>
        <P>Not only is such a review important in terms of the Corrib gas field and other offshore deposits, but also yesterday we had a major announcement on the gas in the Lough Allen basin.  While most of the attention regarding that has been focused on the use of the controversial method of extraction, there is also the major issue of who will benefit from the gas brought on stream.  I remind Senator Byrne that it was Deputy Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, on his last day in office as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who signed the license for that extraction process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our argument regarding who should benefit is that unless there is a proper national stake in natural mineral resources and the State takes a much higher revenue share than at present, the people will not benefit as they ought to from the exploitation of our natural resources.  We are also opposed to any method of extraction that poses a threat to the health and safety of the local population or threatens serious environmental damage.</P><Col N="90"/>
        <P>I welcome the fact that a Sinn F&eacute;in motion blocking the use of fracking &mdash; hydraulic fracturing &mdash; pending an environmental impact assessment was recently passed by the Assembly in the North and that various county councils in Leitrim and Clare have voted to block fracking.  I understand the EPA is conducting a study of the method in question.  I would be anxious to see a comprehensive study being done that does not take in corporate spin and places the welfare, health and safety of the Irish people above corporate wealth.</P>
        <P>I wish to address some of the environmental concerns regarding the siting of the refinery at Bellanaboy, County Mayo.  An Taisce argued against the siting of the refinery at Bellanaboy because it locates a gas processing terminal within the catchment of a major water supply.  In many countries oil and gas reserves are not used to the benefit of the people.  Energy multinationals operate as if they are above the law.  Shell operates on that basis in Rossport, and the State actively facilitates it in doing so.  Ireland should take a different approach.  We should take ownership of our own natural resources and they should be used for the benefit of the Irish people as a whole.</P>
        <P>The great gas giveaway is an embarrassment to us and may well be spoken of in years to come, as is the loss of our fisheries now, as a huge missed opportunity.  The Government should do as we have proposed and seek a complete review of licensing and revenue terms and the immediate revoking of the consents given to the Corrib consortium and the licence for Lough Allen pending such a review.  The licensing regime should include elements regarding job creation in the Republic of Ireland, the recognition of unions on oil rigs and a clause which would ensure that the companies in question have to supply the Irish market.  Currently, there is potential for oil and gas to come onshore but no guarantee that the Irish market would be supplied.  Furthermore, the Government should seek the imposition of a 50% tax on oil and gas profits and a 7.5% royalty.</P>
        <P>The motion also refers to the pressing need to reduce our dependency on imported fossil fuels.  One of the means of doing that is to develop our own renewable sources.  We need to push ahead with the means of otherwise reducing the economic burden of energy costs, which are a significant and growing component of household and business costs.</P>
        <P>Many constituents have raised with me the SEAI programme of grants which have been discontinued.  They had been able to get grants for attic insulation and cavity wall insulation but SEAI policy has changed and now a home owner can only apply for a grant for one or the other.</P>
        <P>There are also issues regarding the capability of the grid to connect to wind farms.  A major consideration in this respect, which I have mentioned previously, is that we should examine a co-operative model of developing any of these renewable sources.  I was in Canada recently and there is a tidal wave project in Nova Scotia where the state provides a facility where one can test technology.  The Canadians have also developed turbine energy, which is beneath the waves, in a co-operative style whereby a local co-operative in a local community can buy a turbine for a reasonable sum of money and the electricity is bought back at a preferential rate.  The subsidy in that respect means that the money can be reinvested in the local community.  We should also examine that model.</P>

	<P>The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, said that we need to make a decision on the North-South interconnector and to proceed with doing the business.  We must do that with due regard to current best European practice and the emerging technologies.  We need to <Col N="91"/>take account of the expert commission report published only a few weeks ago by the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  It found that the undergrounding of the interconnector was a realistic solution, not that it was impossible or that it would cost 20 times the cost of overgrounding, as had been promoted by EirGrid for so long.  That finding is primarily driven by significant technical developments and a commercial breakthrough of the most recently developed VSC HVDC technology.  That needs to be taken into account when doing the business in that respect.</P>
        <P>I heard it said a number of times in this debate that the Government has committed, but that means nothing.  As was said, the larger Government party, Fine Gael, made substantial commitments, especially in respect of the North-South interconnector.  It said it would halt all activity in respect of the interconnector until a report was commissioned but while the report was being produced, EirGrid engaged in its first round of non-statutory consultation.  Fine Gael also said that it would instruct EirGrid to reimburse the groups and communities involved with the costs associated with participation in the oral hearing in 2010, but that has not happened.  That needs to be done and I encourage the Minister to take that on board.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This is an important debate.  We look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s production of his energy policy in 2012.  That will be important.  The International Energy Agency is carrying out an in-depth analysis of our energy policy in line with the IMF agreement.  We look forward to that and to what it will mean for us in terms of efficiencies in the electricity and gas markets, which the Minister mentioned.  It is important to review energy policy every so often in light of changing international circumstances and changes in engineering and technological advancements.</P>
        <P>We are heavily reliant on fossil fuels.  Imported fossil fuels accounts for 90% of our energy requirements.  In 2010 oil accounted for 55% of our energy needs and gas accounted for 33%, yet 61% of our electricity came from gas.  We are almost totally reliant on oil for transport bar a few exceptions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the Forf&aacute;s report, mentioned by Senator Barrett, which was produced at the end of last year.  The cost of energy for commercial enterprises is extremely important.  At the stage we are in our economic history, we have to support business and enterprise and reduce costs, where possible, for enterprises.  It was recommended that research and development in wave, tidal and offshore wind energy development should be funded from the private sector rather than from Government grants.  The OECD report, which was mentioned, recommended a complete discontinuation of support for offshore wave and tidal energy, although it did not mention wind energy.  Offshore wave energy development is very expensive.  From an engineering point of view, of which I would be very supportive, it is possible but it is expensive and the question arises as to whether we can afford it in our current economic circumstances.  It recommended that the full cost of grid connections from offshore wind projects should be charged directly to the project.  The public service obligation levy must be examined in terms of our overall energy policy.  The levy is being borne by enterprise and it is a major concern for that sector.  Nonetheless, the renewable energy sector is important to encourage from a security point of view.  Currently, only 6% of our energy comes from renewables.  All these questions should be up for discussion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recommend that the Minister reads a report from the Irish Academy of Engineering, produced this time last year, which examined the economic decline since 2007.  We do not need to produce as much energy as we did.  The rate of use of our energy is declining and it probably will remain relatively stagnant over the coming years.  A question raised in that report is whether it <Col N="92"/>is feasible to invest &euro;10 billion in the next ten years in wind energy when what we should be doing is looking after what we have, introducing efficiencies in our production.  That would include in the ESB, as was mentioned.  Wind farms were also mentioned  The best place to site wind farms is next to the grid, to reduce the connection costs.  We all know that will not be possible but that is the most efficient place to site them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Gas is extremely important.  There have been many changes internationally in technology which have made it cheaper to access gas and to find more gas reserves.  There is the controversy over fracking, over which I have great concerns.  Internationally, gas is more available.  We have invested in gas generating capacity on this island in recent years.  The use of natural gas should remain a major plank of our energy policy.  We should not go down the road of focusing entirely on renewables and neglecting investment in the infrastructure we have built up in recent years.  It is important that the Corrib gas would be brought onshore as soon as possible.  That is essential for our security of supply.  Technically, natural gas will be more available.  We need to ensure that we have adequate storage facility for natural gas on this island.  We need to develop LPG storage facilities.</P>
        <P>The North-South and east-west interconnectors are extremely important and we should also look to France.  The Minister spoke about working with other countries to develop energy policies.  We should have a broader approach.  We are committed under EU agreements to reducing our energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions but could we not examine working with a group of countries and tying in with them in terms of our interconnection?  There are many questions on energy policy.  The most important point to make is that in light of the current economic circumstances and the cost of energy to industry and to small and medium enterprises it is extremely important that our energy policy must be practical and pragmatic as we approach developing energy policy this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, to the House.  I refer to a couple of items in the motion, which is interesting for what it says and what it does not say.  I am surprised that the main Government party would table such a Private Members&rsquo; motion without any reference to climate change.  A climate change Bill was an important pre-election promise, by the Labour Party in particular, and it was very active in the stop climate chaos campaign.  That has now gone down the list of priorities.  It has pretty much gone from the Government&rsquo;s agenda.</P>
        <P>I welcome a number of things.  I watched the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, on the monitor.  We all agree that energy security is crucially important.  I note with interest a couple of references to the east-west interconnector, which comes into my area at Rush, and to EirGrid.  A general point on future developments for which the Minister of State will be responsible under NewERA relates to consultation.  Currently, when anything that comes under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act is introduced local authorities are supposed to act on behalf of their citizens.  I put it to the Minister of State that in many instances they do not do that as well as they should and sometimes they fail miserably.  I use the example of the east-west interconnector which caused great consternation in my area, in particular in the town of Rush, which has a population of more than 8,000 people.  The precautionary principle was not followed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but worse than that Fingal County Council did not even request re-routing underground, as it is around the populated areas, but Meath County Council did at Ratoath and it was granted there.</P>
        <P>Every citizen understands the importance of energy security and increasing the links between Ireland and Britain and mainland Europe.   However, the Minister of State will have a great <Col N="93"/>deal of influence on this with the local authorities and within the Department.  A high level of consistency is required in the context of interconnectors that will run through several counties.  It should not just be left to each local authority.  Some officials are good and others may not be as up to speed with various matters.  That drives people nuts.  In Rush in north Dublin the Fine Gael deputy leader and Minister for Health gave a commitment at a public meeting three weeks before the election that if he was elected and became a member of Cabinet he would ensure that the interconnector in Rush would be re-routed.  I knew that could not happen but, unfortunately, he said it.  That is similar to commitments that were given to the north east pylon pressure group.</P>
        <P>When we are talking about energy we must be honest.  I have heard many people talk about wind energy.  People said, &ldquo;This is fantastic and we need to do this, but&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Yes, we need to increase our gas output, but.&rdquo;.  Let us look at what happened off Mayo.  Why would a company in its right mind try to extract oil or gas anywhere off the Irish coast if it is going to take it 15 years to get it to land?  It is insane.  It is crazy.  Senator Clune is correct.  She said that more than 90% of our energy is imported fossil fuel.  We have a target set down that 40% of energy will be generated by wind power by 2020.  We will not reach that in a million years.  If someone tries to put up even a single wind turbine somewhere there will be objections to it.  We must have an honest debate on the issue.  Unfortunately, the honest debate will only take place when an event occurs such as Russia switching off the gas to western Europe.  When politicians are talking about the issue we should not make promises.  When my party was in opposition previously it made promises.  Energy, if Members will excuse the pun, is the oil that greases the wheels of this country.  Elected representatives must be able to tell their communities the truth about the noise of turbines in the context of wind energy.  In Denmark today a law has been passed to reduce the noise emissions.  People have valid criticisms.  We need a full policy on producing energy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is necessary for people to lead their communities.  In Dalkey there is concern about an exploration licence for six miles off the town.  I do not say that people are not genuinely concerned.  I am sure they are, but I have not heard a proper debate on the issue of a company seeking an exploration licence for six miles off the Irish coast, yet hundreds of people met in Dalkey on a Sunday afternoon to say they are against that type of thing.  I do not say they are not entitled to be concerned but the problem I have is that the second that happened the elected Members in that constituency, including the T&aacute;naiste, went to the meeting and said they understood the concerns and that perhaps they have to do this, that and the other.  One could ask where is our energy policy.  I blame the previous Government in this respect also.  I am serious about that aspect of the matter because it is an important issue for an island nation that is on the geographic periphery of Europe.  Every comment on renewable energy, gas or oil is always preceded by a &ldquo;but&rdquo;.  I have heard it in this Chamber all day.  That must stop.  We must be honest with ourselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister of State to urge the Cabinet to examine the warmer homes scheme.  It has been successful through the SEAI.  Between 3,800 and 6,000 jobs have been created through the scheme, in particular for the external insulation of homes.  As he is aware, the funding, which was enhanced by the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, by up to &euro;99 million has been reduced in the budget to &euro;64.6 million.  People have come to me who are most concerned.  Because the grants for external insulation in particular have been reduced to &euro;1,800 and it is on the basis of the type of house, people are not taking up the scheme.  Worse than that, what is happening is that we are seeing this area go into the black market where substandard materials are being brought in from continental Europe and jobs are being done for cash on houses that are <Col N="94"/>not properly certified.  I fully support the Minister of State&rsquo;s position on major infrastructural investment but given that up to 6,000 jobs have been created in the sector, which are badly needed because of the fall in construction work, it is a retrograde step to take a third off the budget.  We could lose up to 2,000 jobs in the sector in the course of the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am delighted to speak to the motion.  Colleagues on all sides will agree that the motion is comprehensive and allows for a wide-ranging debate on energy policy.</P>
        <P>Coming from a farming background I wish to speak on renewable energy and land use.  The primary purpose of land should be for food production.  I would welcome the comments and views of the Minister on the matter.  I will focus later on the number of mills, including disused mills, around the country.  Food security was an extremely urgent issue in Europe at the end of the Second World War.  People in this House are too young to remember rationing here.  I doubt if any of us experienced the starvation endured by fellow Europeans on the Continent.  At the end of two world wars European agriculture was in serious trouble.  That was a precursor to the introduction of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, under the Treaty of Rome of 1957.  The CAP&rsquo;s main objective was to increase agricultural production to help farmers attain a fair standard of living, stabilise markets and ensure a secure supply of affordable food.  The CAP has been so successful that food security almost seems redundant to today&rsquo;s western European citizens.  However, in recent years, as global events have shown, catastrophic crises can develop almost instantaneously.  We can never rest on our laurels.  We must prioritise food security in Europe and here.</P>
        <P>In that context I am concerned about the use of agricultural land for energy purposes.  I am a strong supporter of alternative energy and the importance of being able to produce our own energy.  That stems from the same root as the rationale of being able to produce our own food.  However, where possible we should look to our vast sea and ocean capacity as a primary means of delivering alternative energy. Previous speakers referred to wind farms and wave energy.  I would like to see more offshore wind and wave farms.  It is important that we rapidly get to a stage where such investments pay for themselves.  We need a serious public debate about alternative energy and, indeed, energy in general.  The public has serious concerns about attempts to extract fossil fuels from within the State and its territorial waters.  This has been made clear in recent debates about fracking and possible oil and gas exploration off the coast of Dublin and in the north east of the country.  There is an obvious need for an informed public debate on how we can ensure we are able to meet our energy needs in the most self-sufficient way possible.</P>
        <P>In south Leinster, where I live, there are three rivers.  If Senators remember their school geography, they will know them &mdash; the Nore, the Suir and the Barrow &mdash; as the three sisters.  There are approximately 60 mills, either used or disused, on those rivers.  Very few of those mills are in flour production but some have been put to alternative uses.  In my own village of Bennettsbridge, Nicholas Mosse has his famous pottery in the old mill and he generates his own electricity through the mill wheel.</P>
        <P>Our rivers have vast potential.  The people who built these mills got the best possible engineering results.  They built the mills in the locations of greatest potential.  At present, anyone who wants to generate electricity from an old disused mill must go through the planning process.  There is nothing wrong with the planning process, but each individual applicant must commission an environmental impact study, EIS, which costs approximately &euro;10,000.  These mills were put in place with great thought and I cannot see how they could now have an environmental impact.  A one-size-fits-all planning system should be put in place.</P><Col N="95"/>
        <P Just="Left">Microgeneration gives rise to another problem.  A producer who generates less than 3 kW will not get onto the grid.  If a producer generates less than 6 kW, it is supplied free of charge to the grid.  That is a big problem.  Some microgenerators could produce 2 kW or 3 kW of electricity, which would keep the generator&rsquo;s business running, with a surplus which is then given to the grid for free.  In the United Kingdom meters are used which go backwards.  Producers who over-produce for their own needs are credited on their electricity bill for the excess amount.  This cannot happen in Ireland.  The tariff in Ireland is 6 cent for a unit of electricity produced.  In the United Kingdom it is 16 pence and in Germany it is 20 cent.  In those countries people are rewarded for generating electricity through renewable sources.  The set-up costs of a microgenerator can be considerable.  A tariff of 6 cent per unit does not justify those costs.  Will the Minister ask purchasers of microgenerated electricity to front-load payments for a few years?  This would make microgeneration economically viable.  The tariff could then be reduced after five or six years when the set-up costs have been covered.  These mills can produce clean energy.  They were put in place by people who ran businesses.  Developments in flour production caused those businesses to collapse.  We should look at this alternative.  These mills have mill races and mill runs.  The infrastructure is already in place and could be used.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, is the right man to look at this situation and I commend him on his work to date.  I look forward to the publication of the Government&rsquo;s new energy policy framework.</P>

	<P>I will be as short as I can.  I think everything has been said.  I welcome the debate.  This topic needs to be debated and this is a good opportunity to do so.  We have not debated things in this way on all occasions in the past.  We have closed our minds on many occasions.  There has not been a debate about nuclear energy and we should have that debate before we make decisions.  There should be a debate about fracking before we make decisions.  There is enough evidence to be considered rather than close our minds to it.</P>
        <P>In the 1950s, when I was very young, I remember an objection being raised to fluorescent lights because they would make one go bald.  It seems funny now, but there was a huge outcry against fluorescent lights.  However, I think we are safe enough.  The same sort of thing is happening with genetically modified foods.  There is an automatic reaction to any change and sometimes we listen to it too easily and too readily.  In Germany, where nuclear stations were closed following a campaign by the green movement, the resulting cost has been huge.  No reason was found for the closures except for an inbuilt belief that nuclear generation was not the right thing to do.  The same thing applied in Britain.</P>
        <P>About six years ago, I was asked on a television programme what business would I go into if I was going into business now.  I said I would go into renewable energy.  It seemed the in-thing to do back in 2005 and 2006.  A number of people got in touch with me to say they had a wonderful idea for wave, tidal, solar or whatever energy.  Clearly, many people are thinking that way and believe in what they can do.</P>
        <P>That said, there are some things we jump into which are not right.  I will touch on one of these.  Biomass is mentioned in the Fine Gael motion and Senator Barrett has spoken about it.  When I was in Brazil a few years ago, I could not get over the amount of biomass being used <Col N="96"/>in place of petrol.  Now it turns out that biomass is doing considerable harm to the environment, but at that time we thought we should be growing biomass products instead of food.</P>
        <P>I accept entirely what has been said by Senator O&rsquo;Neill and others about the need for food.  The Minister spoke about the amount of food we waste.  Wearing my supermarket hat, I know that 30% of the food people buy is thrown out and not used.  That can be recycled and used to create energy.</P>
        <P>There are things we can do.  Let us make sure we have an open debate about them.  This debate is one that should take place regularly.  Let us make sure we do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Quinn, first for sharing his time with me, and second for making such a sensible, well informed, non-hysterical, non-headline seeking, non-populism tickling set of recommendations for what we need to do.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, when I say I regret that the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, has left.  I know the Minister of State will convey our opinions to him.  On a previous occasion, I told the Minister he occupied the most important Ministry in the Government.  He was flattered and surprised to hear that, but I believe he does.</P>
        <P>I oppose the motion and the amendments because none of them goes far enough.  We can forget all about political points scoring,  procedural matters and constituency boundaries.  There is no doubt in my mind that the three existential crises that will face our society and our civilisation in the years to come will be food, water and energy.  It is that simple.  The imperative to do something fundamental about energy policy is overawing on a global as well as a local basis.  Our world population recently hit 7 billion and there is every prospect that it will continue to rise, with an ever-increasing percentage of that population employed in industries that are intensely carbon fuel dependent.  There is no doubt, therefore, that we will see a massive and accelerated demand worldwide for carbon-based and other energy sources in the years to come.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to do something about this.  We need to decrease the amount of carbon we burn.  Even if one is sceptical about global warming &mdash; while I am not sceptical, I have some spurts of agnosticism about some aspects of it &mdash; the arguments for decreasing our dependence on carbon-based fuels are utterly overwhelming.  In the first case, the stuff is running out.  By definition, these are non-renewable fuel sources.  They are all located within a relatively superficial distance of the surface of the earth and we are running out of them all.  Even if we have a windfall of gas in Leitrim or oil in the Arctic or the Antarctic, they cannot last forever.  At some stage this bank account will run dry, these family jewels will have to be sold and we will have to have other energy sources.  It is critically important, if for no other reason, that we have a long-term policy to find those other sources.</P>
        <P>The second issue is geopolitical.  We are not blessed with the provenance of the oil and gas to which we have access.  Consider the levels of civic government that exist in many of the places that produce most of the oil and gas.  Most of our oil reserves are held by feudal theocrats, partially reconstructed Stalinist dictators and various unsavoury types.  It is a very vulnerable supply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The third issue is pure economics.  For us to continue importing the bulk of our energy makes no sense because we cannot afford it.  At this stage we do not have that many products to exchange for the energy we require.  The change in energy policy has to be seismic and therefore, I oppose all these motions because none of them go anywhere near such a change.  We need to be open-minded about all sources of energy and I am delighted that my colleague has broken the taboo of mentioning the N-word.  I ask the Minister to please bring this suggestion <Col N="97"/>to the Cabinet.  It must be recognised that after the Chernobyl disaster there was not a 1% increase in congenital malformations anywhere in the world, including Belarus.  A total of 2% of all pregnancies result in a congenital malformation world-wide and this statistic stayed at 2% in Belarus.  These are not crazy, right-wing, nuclear energy figures but rather these are WHO figures.  The incidence of all cancers stayed the same, with the exception of one rare kind of cancer called thyroid cancer which was substantially increased, but rare, in children in the immediate region because of an uptake in the thyroid of radioactive isotopes.</P>
        <P>A great deal of energy policy is being driven by scientifically ill-informed hysteria.  As Senator Quinn said, we need to have a serious debate about all energy sources, including renewable sources, on our dependence on carbon and on the N-word &mdash; nuclear energy.  The choice facing us is not between having a highly dangerous nuclear energy and an utterly safe alternative.  I ask the Members to think for a second about all the people who, every day in the world, are blown up, burned, boiled, run down by trucks that are either carting oil, in the process of refining oil and I ask them to think for a second about the potential loss of life which will occur if we find ourselves geopolitically vulnerable to countries where warfare may break out because of oil supplies.  We need to have a very serious, very mature, very rational, fact-based, non-emotional, scientific debate on all forms of energy, including nuclear energy.  I cannot recommend any of these motions or amendments because they all skip and dance around the issue which is the need to seismically change the way we deal with energy policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for attending the House for this debate.  I commend my colleagues for this important topic for debate.  As Senator Crown has rightly pointed out, this debate will continue in this House and in the other House for quite a long time because energy is at the core of everything.  One of the exciting aspects of renewable energy is that we might have finally found a way of doing something useful with all that wind and rain and waves.  In many ways, people in Ireland have engaged with renewable energy in a very popular way, in the pub, in the taxi, in the shop.  People want to talk about renewable energy and everybody wants to do something about it.  There was a great rush of enthusiasm when the expression first came into use.  However, this must be balanced with the need for energy security, the need to develop the industry and the concerns about the impact on the environment.  My colleague, Senator Kelly, has rightly pointed out the problem of the proximity of wind farms to ordinary houses and the issue of fracking, not least because it is in my constituency but it is a broader issue.  There is a point at which those things become very close, the need to have energy security and the need to acknowledge people&rsquo;s concerns and the need to create jobs.  Fracking encompasses these issues in a very formidable way and makes for a very interesting and difficult topic for debate.</P>
        <P>I commend two projects, the Tipperary Energy Agency, which is doing an excellent job in heightening public awareness of the need for renewable energy and the need for sources of sustainable energy.  Today the agency launched its green business network in an effort to engage with as many people as possible.  The agency is trying to join the dots, so to speak, and to work locally.  I also commend the Western Development Commission for its work on biomass and specifically its work on wood.  I acknowledge the earlier comments about the problems with biomass in South America in particular.  The Western Development Commission&rsquo;s projects are funded by the European Union and they aim to examine how the woodchip and boiler installation sectors can be used to stimulate job creation and to encourage forestry which would result in jobs in the haulage industry and would encourage the move from agricultural work into related areas associated with wood energy and woodchip.  The commission is doing very <Col N="98"/>good local work with community enterprise boards and with local authorities to achieve a concerted plan to create jobs in the west particularly in the areas of biomass and wood fuels.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">While I welcome this debate and the motion, I have concerns regarding the difficulties arising for those who are investing in wind farms and find themselves obstructed from making progress.  The Minister of State will be far more familiar with the expression, Gate 1, Gate 2 and Gate 3, than I am.  In simple terms, if a community comes together and is developing a wind turbine project for the local community, they are now falling foul of the energy regulator.  The regulator made his decision in December to curtail most of the Gate 3 projects because of the technical difficulties with the national grid.  Projects were commenced in 2003 and 2004 and it takes significant effort to put a wind project together.  The Western Development Commission did a project on the Killala wind farm to see where the snags arise when constructing a wind farm.  One of the snags discovered &mdash; not least the problems with community relations, as mentioned by Senator Kelly &mdash; was the length of time of the project and the need to sustain the interest and capacity of the local people to cope with a project that takes a long time to develop.  It is now the case that the regulator&rsquo;s office is pushing out these projects resulting in a significant problem with many projects which simply cannot get any commitment to go for an agreement to supply energy to the national grid.  This is the very option desired from community level and from bigger companies.  The projects are completely stymied by the regulator&rsquo;s decision.  I acknowledge that the regulator did not act in bad faith but there is a serious concern that a number of these projects may not get off the ground in the years to come.</P>
        <P>The notion of aspiring to use wind energy becomes somewhat ludicrous when one sees the detail of the reality.  We need to hear from the Minister and from the regulator as to how this issue of the curtailment will be addressed.  The other issue that goes with sustaining projects over a long period is the issue of funding.  The banks are now backing away, big time, because there is not a firm commitment from the grid to take the energy.  The projects cannot have a commitment from the grid because this cannot be given.  Therefore, instead of encouraging the banks to lend to a sector which could then go forward and build on that enthusiasm and create those jobs, there will be a log-jam that will last at a minimum five to eight years and in reality will probably be 20 years.  I do not have the answer to the problem, unfortunately, but we need to hear from the Minister and the regulator.  Building wind energy in a realistic way is vital for this country.</P>
        <P>The Western Development Commission also found in its research on the Killala Bay company that what was needed was what it describes as an impartial adviser to support communities to work with private developers or private wind operators so that they could speak to one another.  The commission fulfilled that role with the Killala Bay project but there is nobody to do this work as it stands now.  This is a point to be considered if we are to build sustainable energy.  This is a very exciting time but it is also a time for urgent action.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The opportunities for wind and wave energy in an island nation like ours are enormous.  We have to meet EU regulations on emissions and so on, but other Senators have mentioned that the job opportunities would be tremendous.  There will always be wind, tide and wave energy and costs should not fluctuate, as they will be free.  There are different types of generators, including those which work over or under the sea and on land.  Wind energy provides a clean and sustainable solution to energy problems and can be used as an alternative to fossil fuels in generating electricity, without the direct emission of greenhouse gases.  Wind will always be there, as it is inexhaustible, renewable and free.  It would not have to be imported.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that wind power will make the most significant contribution to the achievement of national and international targets for green electricity due to its environmental benefits, technological maturity and competitiveness.  Attitudes towards wind farms in Ireland have changed.  In 2008, F&aacute;ilte Ireland carried out a survey of visitor attitudes to wind energy and found that the vast majority of visitors saw it as a positive development for Ireland and the way forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are opportunities but we are awaiting a decision on the North-South and east-west interconnectors, as well as an underground supply linking Ireland, England and France on the Continent.  In that way we can join the European grid, which will create greater opportunities for sustainable energy and help competitiveness.  Since the first wind farm project was realised in 1992 at Bellacorick in County Mayo, 1,379 MW of wind capacity has been installed up to the end of June 2010.  To achieve national targets for renewable energy, by 2020, an estimated 5,500 to 6,000 MW of wind generated energy is required.  Wind energy contributions to Ireland&rsquo;s electricity supply continues to rise with additional capacity and by June 2010, a total of 110 wind farms were metered, bringing the total installed capacity for wind to 1,379 MW.  In 2009, wind power displaced approximately 1.28 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.</P>

I would welcome a debate on the fracking mining technology and nuclear energy.  I do not have any issue with such a debate.  We should research all the available options.  If such technology damages the environment we could not use it but there should be a proper informed debate on the issues before making a decision.  I do not know the figures for electric cars but I assume we can look to the future and see that the cost of diesel and petrol ten or 20 years from now will mean there must be an alternative.  Those fuels will run out at some stage, without doubt. </P><P Just="Left">I thank all my colleagues for contributing to a very well informed debate and thank the Minister and Minister of State for attending. </P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, my county colleague.  I am grateful to Senator Whelan for allowing me to go first, as the timing clashes with my motion at a parliamentary party meeting.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, will the Minister of State review the Government&rsquo;s position on small rural schools in light of the impact on education and communities?  The Government is seeking to find 100 teaching posts this year by increasing teacher retention numbers based on last September&rsquo;s enrolment figures.  This will pose a problem, as the proposed changes to rural schools will have far-reaching consequences for the economy &mdash; the children are our future &mdash; for the quality of education and for rural life.</P>
        <P>For example, last September scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta an Tuair&iacute;n in Beal an Daingin was required to have 76 pupils to hold its four teachers from next September.  It had 78.  In the budget, the requirement was increased to 81.  A few days ago, I was shown birth certificates to prove that there were three more children in the community &mdash; there used to be four &mdash; but they were advised by their teachers to stay at home so that they might mature.  Now the school is in line to lose a teacher and it is unfair that 80 pupils will have a pupil-teacher ratio of approximately 27:1, which is higher than the national average.</P>
        <P>Moving the goal posts in this way does not make allowance for the complexity of multi-class teaching, including the teaching of children with special educational needs and of foreign languages.  Even in Gaeltacht schools, Irish is a foreign language when it is not the language spoken in the home.  Gaeltacht schools are a special case.  No account is taken of the fact that they do three standardised tests in English, Irish and mathematics versus the two, English and mathematics, done in all other schools.</P>
        <P>I have great difficulty with the Minister&rsquo;s argument for low-end numbers.  While I agree with him that 12 children per two-teacher school is overly generous, he is moving the goal posts by requiring 20 children to retain two teachers by 2014.  Therefore, 19 children across eight years from ages four to 12 will have one teacher despite the evidence that parents pass one-teacher schools by.</P>
        <P>This change has angered communities, teachers and parents.  It is viewed as an erosion of the community as well as education and will have a greater effect on rural communities.  In a three-teacher school like Carna national school, 49 into 11 were required, but the goal posts are being moved by one or two pupils and the school will drop to a two-teacher school.  Changes like this are significant for small schools.  The Minister must change the date by which the new <Col N="102"/>retention numbers will apply.  Instead of being retrospective, they should be based on next September&rsquo;s figures or even later.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a special case for rural DEIS schools with legacy posts.  There are only 15 such schools, one of which is in Carraroe.  The community has an 80% unemployment rate and the school has been conducting early interventions and reading recovery, but when it loses a teacher, it will no longer be able to do so.  We are talking to the wall.  The pupils&rsquo; scores for reading and writing have been increasing.  The school is making a difference.  We will compromise the quality of education.  The Minister has stated strongly that he is for better literacy and numeracy standards, yet we are pulling away the very resource that improves them.</P>

	<P>My apologies.  I believed it was five.  I have made the education argument, but the community argument is even more important.  The Minister should not be seen to be forcing amalgamations.  He should ask schools to consider amalgamating and allow communities to plan their own futures.  Let us not have Government policy engineering a solution that will erode rural life.  The recession is already doing that.  The Government should not be offering assistance.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue as it affords me the opportunity to explain to the House the reasoning behind the changes to the staffing schedule.  The need to effect savings in my Department&rsquo;s budget has required very difficult decisions to be made, especially at a time when the school-going population is increasing.  We will need to find places for 70,000 additional students in the system over the next four to five years.  Our objective is to be as fair as possible in making the decisions that are necessary.</P>
        <P>One third of all public sector employees in the State work in the education sector.  As such, it is simply not possible to exempt staffing levels in education from the requirement to reduce expenditure.  There was no increase in the budget in the general average of 28:1 used to allocate teachers to primary schools, a safeguard which had been called for by many interested parties.  However, the budget included a phased increase in the pupil threshold for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools.  The only change this will mean for such schools is that their average class sizes will no longer be as advantageous as they were in the past due to the phased increases in the pupil thresholds in the staffing schedule.</P>
        <P>Where schools are claiming to have more pupils next September than they had last September, as referred to specifically by the Senator, they are asking that some allowance be made.  The existing staffing appeals process can be accessed by schools which are projecting increased enrolments sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts in the longer term.  The details on how this will operate will be made clear as part of my Department&rsquo;s forthcoming circular, which will issue shortly to all schools, on the staffing arrangements for the 2012-13 school year.</P><Col N="103"/>
        <P>Even when all of the phased increases are implemented, the threshold for a second teacher, at 20 pupils, will be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 that was required for the appointment of a second teacher in rural schools prior to the late 1990s.  Rural communities have no reason to fear a forced closure of their local school.  Such communities represent a cornerstone of Irish heritage, and their schools are in turn the cornerstone of the communities.  The Government remains committed to sustaining those communities.  This debate affords me an opportunity to state categorically that this measure is not about closing schools which play such an important part in our communities.</P>
        <P>For some schools, amalgamation with a neighbouring school may be a sound option for sustaining school provision in a locality where enrolments are falling.  It is for schools themselves to decide whether they want to go that route, however, and the Department will work with them in regard to any such move.  The Minister expects the report of the value for money review of small primary schools to be presented to him in the next eight weeks.  After he has considered its outcomes and proposals, it will be published and laid before the Oireachtas.  This will afford an opportunity to Deputies and Senators to have a wide-ranging debate on its proposals.</P>
        <P>I have trust and confidence in the capacity of school principals and teachers to play their part in making the best use of available resources to achieve the best possible educational outcomes for their pupils.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh st&aacute;das buan a fh&aacute;il do Ghaelscoil Ros Eo, a bhuna&iacute;odh ceithre bliana &oacute; shin.  Nuair a d&rsquo;oscail an scoil, n&iacute; raibh ach rang amh&aacute;in inti, ach t&aacute; 96 dalta sa scoil anois.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh st&aacute;das buan a bhaint amach don scoil faoi l&aacute;thair.  Is scoil iontach t&aacute;bhachtach &iacute; Gaelscoil Ros Eo.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil s&eacute; thar am go mbeadh an st&aacute;das tugtha di.</P>
        <P>I am asking that Gaelscoil Ros Eo be given the official status it deserves.  It is four years in operation in the heart of Rush, which has a population of 8,000.  The school started with only one classroom and its enrolment has since increased to 96 pupils, with a waiting list.  My constituency of Dublin North includes four gaelscoileanna, three of which, I am pleased to say, are in permanent accommodation which was built in the past two and a half years.  These are Gaelscoil Bhaile Brig&iacute;n, Gaelscoil An Duinninigh in Kinsealy agus Gaelscoil Bhrian Bhor&oacute;imhe in Swords.</P>
        <P>Gaelscoil Ros Eo cannot move any further until it receives official status.  We are not expecting miracles, but it is in the gift of the Minister to progress the matter.  I have been immensely impressed by all the gaelscoileanna in my area and throughout the country.  I see the Minister of State nodding in agreement.  It has been a blot on the record of successive Governments that gaelscoileanna such as this have been obliged to operate out of portakabins.  Thankfully, that is, in the main, a thing of the past and I wish the Government well in the work that remains to be done.</P><Col N="104"/>
        <P>Granting Gaelscoil Ros Eo official recognition will help it to grow further.  It is certainly the wish of people in my D&aacute;il cheantar that their children have the opportunity to be taught through the medium of the Irish language and to avail of all the benefits that go with it.  I hope the Department will ensure official status is granted to Gaelscoil Ros Eo without further delay.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline the current position on Gaelscoil Ros Eo, Rush, County Dublin.  In April 2008, under the patronage of An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta na Scoileanna L&aacute;n-Ghaeilge, the school was granted provisional recognition, with effect from September 2008, following on from the report and recommendations of the new schools advisory committee on the recognition of new primary schools for 2008.</P>
        <P>An application for permanent recognition was submitted by the school to the Department on 5 November 2010 but was refused on the basis that it did not satisfy the necessary requirement of having a minimum of 17 junior infants enrolled for three consecutive school years.  The gaelscoil was notified of the Department&rsquo;s decision and advised that its temporary recognition would be extended and the matter reviewed again when the pupil enrolment position for the current school year 2011-12 was available.  On the basis of the increase in school pupil enrolments that has been returned by the gaelscoil, the Department arranged for an inspector&rsquo;s visit to the school, which took place recently.  A decision on the matter of granting permanent recognition will be conveyed to the gaelscoil when the inspector&rsquo;s report is received.</P>
        <P>My Department has carried out a study to identify the areas of the State where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels in the coming years.  In that regard, it has been determined that the number of pupils at primary level is projected to increase nationally from a current enrolment of 510,000 pupils to approximately 540,000 by 2014, with a further increase to 553,000 pupils by 2018.  That is an increase in the primary sector of 43,000 pupils over the current levels.</P>
        <P>In determining where additional school accommodation is required, the Department has identified the greater Dublin region, including the Rush area, as one of the likely locations of such pupil enrolment increases.  In that context, the Department recently approved the rental of an additional temporary mainstream classroom to Gaelscoil Ros Eo to cater for increased enrolments at the school.  Given the projected increases in pupil enrolments in the Rush area, the Department will continue to work with the gaelscoil to address its accommodation requirements.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  Reading between the lines, it seems there are good grounds for hope that Gaelscoil Ros Eo will be granted official status.  I understand the departmental inspector visited the school some weeks ago.  Will the Minister of State see his way to expediting the publication of the resulting report?  I have no doubt that the cigire will recommend that official status be given to the school.  Rush is a growing area, as borne out by its population and the student numbers in this school.  I will follow up this matter in a few weeks time with the Minister of State&rsquo;s office.  Recognition of this school would be greatly appreciated by the dalta&iacute;, tuismitheoir&iacute; agus m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; Gaelscoil Ros Eo.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this matter.  While this matter comes within the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality, given the environmental dimension, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government may also have a responsibility in this regard.  I am sure the Minister of State will clarify the position for me.</P>
        <P>What does the Government propose to do to address what is now an epidemic throughout Ireland, namely, the thievery, sale and transfer of scrap and precious metals such as copper, lead and zinc?  Theft of these items is highly orchestrated and is posing serious economic, commercial and social problems throughout the country.  I know of a number of businesses which, if broken into and robbed one more time, will cease trading.  The loss of materials at these plants brings production to a halt, has serious security implications and poses a threat to jobs and the viability of these businesses.</P>
        <P>The illicit trade in scrap and precious metals has ballooned out of all proportion in recent months.  As in the case of any criminal activity, this would not be happening if there were not people willing to receive and launder stolen precious metals, thus providing an illegitimate outlet for these materials.  In some cases, this practice is posing a risk and a serious threat to public health and life, not alone to those stealing the items but to children, owing to exposure of cables and electric devices.  It is a most despicable act.  Nothing is sacred any more.</P>
        <P>A memorial to deceased members in my constituency of Castletown was stolen, resulting not alone in the loss of the memorial, which cost &euro;30,000, but also a great deal of hurt and distress in the community.  Many of the people commemorated by that memorial were young people who lost their lives in various tragedies in the locality.  Nothing is safe or sacred.  The Minister of State and Members will be aware that public sculptures, monuments and art installations throughout the country are being stolen.  This problem must be tackled.  Doing so will require new regulation, intervention by Government and a greater level of enforcement in the tracking of metals.  I urge the Government to ensure this practice is brought to a halt.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, who is unable to be present owing to other commitments.   The Minister shares the Senator&rsquo;s concern about incidence of this type of crime and the impact it has on local communities and businesses.  I share that concern.  My wife and I own a public house in east Galway and have had to undertake extra security measures to protect the barrels in which our beer is delivered.</P>
        <P>The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is acutely aware of the increase in the theft of metal and is targeting such crime, as well as burglaries and theft related crimes generally, through a number of initiatives.  These include Supporting Safer Communities, which lays particular emphasis on burglary prevention and reduction. The initiative involves a targeted response to burglary, taking into account locations, times, offenders and victims.  It also includes the development of advice on the prevention of theft of farm machinery and farm security generally.  In addition, Garda divisional officers have been advised of measures which can be put in place to prevent and reduce the opportunity for such crime, including measures involving relevant external stakeholders.</P><Col N="106"/>
        <P Just="Left">As stated by the Senator, tackling this type of crimes requires a collaborative effort and a targeted multi-agency response.  Following an analysis of crime trends, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established a metal theft forum, involving stakeholders particularly affected by this type of crime.  The forum includes the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, the Electricity Supply Board, telecoms, transport companies, brewing concerns and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  A metal theft crime prevention and reduction plan is being developed in discussion with the metal theft forum, which it is anticipated will be published in the near future.  It goes without saying that the implementation of any strategies in this area will not be solely dependent on the statutory authorities.  It will be essential that all stakeholders play their part in supporting the Garda and the local authorities in counteracting illegal activities.</P>
        <P>In terms of existing legal provisions, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enforces the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, which covers the handling, possession and withholding of information regarding stolen property.  Members of the force will investigate fully any breaches of this legislation.  The House will appreciate that issues arise in this area which go beyond the field of criminal justice legislation for which the Minister for Justice and Equality is responsible.  While there is no sector-specific regulation for the waste metal industry, I understand that there are relevant statutory provisions in relation to waste activities.  These include requirements for appropriate authorisations under the Waste Management Act 1996. The terms of such authorisations are primarily derived from requirements of EU directives on waste and specific waste streams such as end-of-life vehicles or electronic waste. Depending on the authorisation required, these activities are controlled either by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, or by local authorities as competent authorities nominated by the State to implement such legislation.  The purpose of these controls is to regulate the collection, recovery or disposal of waste in order to protect the environment.  Enforcement of waste legislation is a matter either for the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement, OEE, in relation to waste licences or for local authorities in relation to waste permits.  Provision is also made in the Waste Management Act 1996, as amended, for the appointment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as authorised officers under the Act who are granted powers, including the powers of stop, search and seizure, where there are suspected breaches of the Act.</P>
        <P>As indicated on behalf of the Minister, the recent increase in illegal activities in this area is being addressed by the metal theft forum led by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Publication of that forum&rsquo;s plan is anticipated.  In addition, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, has asked his Department to examine the waste licensing and permit legislation to ensure all necessary provisions, especially those relating to traceability, are in place to avoid situations that might be exploited by criminal elements.  This examination is ongoing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that there is a multi-agency and cross-departmental response on this issue.  I await publication of the forum&rsquo;s plan.  I welcome also that the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government continue to examine what additional measures or strengthening legislation might be necessary to curb what is not a casual matter but a highly organised and orchestrated offence.  I welcome that, as stated by the Minister of State, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is reviewing its traceability provisions in respect of the transaction and trade in scrap and precious metals, which will assist greatly in bringing this matter under control.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to respond to this important issue for people in Waterford and the south east, namely, the impact of health funding cuts on acute hospital services in Waterford and for patients throughout the south east.</P>
        <P>As I understand it, there is to be a cut of approximately &euro;6.5 million this year in the budget of Waterford Regional Hospital, which is to be recouped by way of cuts in services across all departments.  The Minister has been very defensive about all this.  However, there will be cuts to services across hospitals in particular acute services owing to health cutbacks.</P>
        <P>Information given to me by people who work at Waterford Regional Hospital indicates that the cuts to be imposed this year will be severe and will impact on patient care.  Some of the cuts under consideration are a 5% reduction in inpatient activity; a 10% reduction in the number of day cases; a 20% reduction in the number of new patients in the outpatient department; the closure of theatres and a surgical ward; the loss of paediatric inpatient beds, as well as beds in other units; and reduced expenditure on medication for the regional rheumatology day-service unit, for which a reduction of 50% will mean restricted access to treatment for patients with severe arthritic conditions.  It is obvious that there will be dramatic cuts across all services at the hospital.</P>
        <P>When I released the information to which I refer, one of the Minister of State&rsquo;s party colleagues accused me of misleading the public and acting reprehensibly.  I must inform Fine Gael, the Minister of State and the Government that what is reprehensible is cutting funding to hospitals and allowing a situation to develop where front-line services will be either curtailed or lost.  In opposition, the Minister of State&rsquo;s party made great play of the fact that, if elected to govern, it would deal with the real waste in the system, namely, bureaucracy and in the various management layers in the HSE, hospitals and the Department.  What we have been presented with, however, is a one-size-fits-all approach to cuts in services, etc., in all hospitals.  That is a far cry from the money following the patient approach &mdash; whatever that meant in the first instance &mdash; to which the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, referred when in opposition.  In many ways, that approach is penalising efficiency.</P>
        <P>I was present at a meeting attended by members of the Minister of State&rsquo;s party and clinical directors and leading clinicians at Waterford Regional Hospital.  Those who work in the hospital pleaded with us to appeal to the Minister for Health to have the cuts reversed.  They also impressed upon us the need to ensure there would be proper acute services in the region.  I accept that there is also a need for a reorientation of services across the region.  Waterford Regional Hospital must function as the region&rsquo;s acute hospital.  In addition, it must specialise in the provision of complex acute services in areas such as cancer care, neurology, cardiology, etc.  As a result of cuts to its funding, however, it is not being given the opportunity to provide such services.  There are real concerns about the retention of some of the services to which I refer.</P>
        <P>I am seeking clarity.  People have referred to the spreading of misinformation on this matter.  The HSE should publish its plans for the hospital.  Deputies in the Lower House should not act as public relations officers for the HSE.  As public representatives, it is our responsibility to ensure we defend hospital services.  All I am interested in is obtaining the facts from the HSE and discovering what the impact of the cuts in funding will be on patient care at the hospital in the area in which I live.  There is a need for honesty in this matter and clarity with regard to the cuts to be implemented at the hospital.</P><Col N="108"/>
        <P>Is the Minister of State in a position to confirm that there is going to be a cut of &euro;6.5 million to the budget of Waterford Regional Hospital?  Will he indicate whether there will be cuts across the various departments?  People should be told the truth.  In the context of the HSE&rsquo;s national service plan, the Minister for Health has acknowledged that there will be cuts to services.  However, local politicians throughout the country are stating there will not be any cuts at the hospitals in their areas.  There are going to be cuts to services as a result of the overall reduction in funding.  People should be honest about that fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  </P>
        <P>The health sector is facing significant funding challenges this year.  As a result of the current crisis, the absolute priority must be to place the economy and the public finances on a sustainable footing.  However, the Minister is determined to ensure the impact on services is minimised through relentless performance management, best practice and reform in how services are delivered.  This will apply in all settings and services and for those delivering such services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE&rsquo;s national service plan 2012 was approved by the Minister on 13 January and published by the HSE on 16 January.  It sets out the health and personal social services that will be delivered by the HSE within its current budget of &euro;13,317 billion and identifies a cost-reduction target in 2012 of &euro;750 million.  It reflects the commitments in the programme for Government in respect of health and the savings targets set out in the comprehensive expenditure report for the period 2012 to 2014.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The scale of the financial challenge facing the HSE means that there will be an inevitable and unavoidable reduction in services.  However, this will not be a straight line reduction.  Waterford Regional Hospital, in line with other acute hospitals, must face the challenge of reduced budgets and align its 2012 activity levels and services to the budget allocated.  As a direct result of budgetary and staff reductions nationally, activity levels in 2012 will be expected to fall by approximately 6%.  The Minister hopes this can be contained to 3% through increased efficiency, including the effective implementation of the clinical programmes.  In this regard, at Waterford Regional Hospital strategic integration is taking place of the acute medicine programme into hospital processes, with further realignment of beds with this model, including those in the medical assessment and acute medical admissions units.  Furthermore, the number of short-stay beds and rapid access outpatient clinics is increasing in order to improve admission avoidance.  In addition, the productive theatre initiative was introduced in December 2011 and work is advancing at pace in order to maximise patient access.  Surgical bed stock realignment will begin in early 2012 to underpin and retain the performance to date in day-case surgery.  The hospital is performing consistently well, including in the context of delivering on special delivery unit targets for scheduled and unscheduled care, in the emergency medicine programme.  The Minister is satisfied that elective activity targets, while challenging, will be enabled by the successful implementation of the elective surgery programme and the positive theatre initiative.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s national service plan commits it to minimising the impact on services by fast-tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways of using limited resources.  It reflects the need to move to new models of care across all service areas in order to treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide quality services at the lowest possible cost.  It also includes a commitment to addressing staffing levels, skill mix and staff attendance patterns-rosters within the framework of the public service agreement.  The plan will be implemented in the context <Col N="109"/>of the significant new governance structures for the health service recently announced by the Minister.</P>
        <P>The HSE is satisfied that Waterford Regional Hospital will deliver on its 2012 service plan without any impact on emergency or urgent care services.  The details of the plan are being worked through.  The final version of the plan will be available on publication of the regional service plan for HSE South on 9 February.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was written by a civil servant.  The information it contains was obviously obtained by the HSE.  On each occasion we ask questions about what is going to happen at Waterford Regional Hospital, all we get from the HSE is spin.  We are informed about new appointments which might happen at some point in the future.  However, we are not being given details in respect of how the &euro;6.5 million cut in the hospital&rsquo;s funding will impact on patient care.  The Minister of State has indicated that activity levels are expected to fall by 6%.  I presume this is an across-the-board figure for the health service nationally.  It is possible that the figure might be above 6% for certain hospitals.  As stated, the information given to me by people who work in Waterford Regional Hospital indicates that, in some instances, the figure will certainly be higher than 6%.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I look forward to publication of the regional service plan for HSE South next week.  When it emerges, we will see the real detail with regard to what is envisaged.  Unfortunately, many of the plans published by the HSE do not contain such detail and all we tend to get are vague commitments about things that may occur in the future.  Information on what is happening in individual hospitals tends to be absent from such plans.</P>
        <P>Many of the staff at Waterford Regional Hospital, including consultants, clinical directors, clinicians and front-line staff, are extremely concerned about the impact of the proposed cuts on service delivery.  I do not know whether the Minister for Health wants to accept this, but it is the reality for those who work in the hospital.</P>

	<P>I have the utmost respect for every Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas and 99.99% of us are here to try to create a better country for the people whom we serve; it is an incredible honour and privilege to sit in either House.  This includes Senator Cullinane, as my respect extends to everybody who operates in this environment.  However, in recent weeks my respect for Sinn F&eacute;in has begun to dwindle.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are operating in an incredibly difficult economic environment.  This is a fact and the Senator must admit this, as must I.  In Northern Ireland, 100 miles up the road, there is an equally difficult &mdash; some might argue an even more difficult &mdash; economic environment because of the cuts handed down to the Northern Ireland Government by the UK Government based in London.  This has required Sinn F&eacute;in in government in Northern Ireland to make very difficult decisions, which it is willing to stand over, 100 miles away.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to research I carried out earlier today the Northern Ireland Government proposes to cut &euro;2.3 billion from its health budget next year.  This will probably require redundancies in the order of 4,000 posts, including some enforced redundancies.  This action prompted 26,000 health care workers to go on a one-day strike in Northern Ireland last September.  If Sinn F&eacute;in is willing to acknowledge, and be honest in facing up to, these challenges 100 miles away &mdash; they are definitely difficult economic challenges &mdash; why can it not be equally honest in this environment?</P>
