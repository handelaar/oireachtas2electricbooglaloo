    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 &mdash; Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken at 3 p.m. and conclude not later than 4.30 p.m., if not previously concluded.

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>We welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision, following the advice of the Attorney General, to hold a referendum.  My party will strongly support a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum and I do not want there to be any doubt about that.  I have said it in this Chamber time and time again.  This is a serious matter for the country.  There are differences of opinion and there are provisions we would rather were in the treaty but which are not, such as addressing the ECB&rsquo;s role within the European Union.  The progressive pro-European parties in the Oireachtas have an opportunity in the coming weeks to work closely together on this in the interests of the country.</P>
        <P>I am worried that &ldquo;No&rdquo; posters were erected last night without a discussion having even started or the text of the referendum being published.  This is not the way politics should work.  The Taoiseach held a meeting with our party leader on this yesterday.  My party had a meeting about this more than four weeks ago and we made a decision to support a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in a referendum, if it was called.  We will examine the text and we will bring different elements to the debate.  In the next few weeks, the Seanad can play an important role in providing information.  We are ahead of the curve with regard to planning our own debate on the treaty.  There will be dissenting voices but they have to be honest in the debate and stick to what the referendum is about and not the other issues about which all of us are concerned and have policy differences.  That is what politics is about.  There are issues on which my party will not agree with the Government and there are issues with which Sinn F&eacute;in will not agree, and that happened the last time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must consider the common good.  The treaty does not go far enough but it is a step forward and, in the next few weeks, we have an opportunity to discuss further with our European partners how we can progress the role of the ECB and reduce the democratic deficit.  Will the Leader keep an eye on the publication of the text of the constitutional amendment?  The Government will get full support from this side of the House when it is introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not dream of it.</P>
        <P>I propose that when the text is ready we should have an early debate on it.  The Leader will get the support of the Fianna F&aacute;il Members to alter the business of the House at that time to ensure we deal with this speedily.  I believe we will also have a role in the coming weeks as it should not be just one debate.</P><Col N="3"/>
        <P Just="Left">I previously raised the matter of ComReg proposing to fine An Post &euro;11.9 million for apparently not meeting service level agreements on next day delivery.  It is absolute insanity that a State regulator will fine a State company almost &euro;12 million.  The Leader gave a commitment that he would bring this to the attention of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Has he received an update on it?  I believe the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has also raised concerns about it.</P>
        <P>I would welcome a very early debate on the European referendum.  There is no doubt whatsoever that my party will be actively campaigning for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in that referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that it is 29 February I wish to make a few proposals to the Leader.  He will be reassured and comforted to know that none of them contains an offer of marriage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Like Senator O&rsquo;Brien, I welcome the EU referendum.  It will clear the air on this issue once and for all.  I and the Labour Party will vigorously support a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  To think that one can be half in and half out of the euro is akin to the concept of being sort of pregnant.  It is just not possible.  This is not about the Nice or Lisbon treaties, but about Ireland, our communities and our children, many of whom have been forced to emigrate.  People might not like to hear this but I firmly believe that if Jack Lynch had not brought us into the then EEC in 1973, this country would still be a backwater.  No road in this country has been built without EU money.  It is about time we woke up and accepted that reality.  In addition, there would be no PayPal or Intel in this country, because Ireland is the bridgehead for Europe for many of these American multinationals.  People are sadly mistaken if they think they can have it both ways, with the bread buttered on both sides.  I am already aware that Sinn F&eacute;in opposes this referendum.  It is against everything.</P>

	<P>It is true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>It has all its printing done already.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The &ldquo;No&rdquo; posters are apparently already up.  It had to use the rest of the ink.  I suppose it had to be put to some use.  I am glad to hear Senator O&rsquo;Brien state that Fianna F&aacute;il is united in favour of this referendum.  To be fair, there was some equivocation and doubt about that because the party&rsquo;s deputy leader had created some anxiety in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that we will be supporting the referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Fianna F&aacute;il will campaign vigorously for the referendum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am also a staunch supporter of the household charge.  Again, one cannot have it both ways.  One cannot have strong local government, strong local authorities and strong local services and, on the other hand, say one opposes the household charge.  Those who oppose that charge are reckless and irresponsible.  One of the key issues in Laois-Offaly during the general election campaign was the local fire brigade service, properly so.  People were concerned about the closure of small rural fire stations.  The fact is, however, that the household charge will go towards the upkeep of such services.  I appeal to those who are opposing the household charge for selfish ends to think again.  It is ridiculous, and it is putting local government at risk.</P>
      
	<Col N="4"/><P>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is an eminently sensible and pragmatic man.  The household charge is not being embraced due to misinformation and confusion.  The leaflets are a fiasco.  We must involve people and make the method of payment easier for people who want to pay.  It must be more user friendly and accessible.  I ask the Leader to call on the Minister to involve An Post in this process.  There are 1,100 post offices throughout the country and they are well placed, and I understand well disposed, to facilitating people who wish to pay this charge but do not have the opportunity to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With regard to the campaign for the new fiscal treaty, the treaty will impose considerable austerity for generations to come.  We will undoubtedly be in a vice.  This is tying us in; it is bullying from Germany.  That country is at it again.  The entire system is rotten and should be pulled down.  This Government is collaborating.  It has appointed Goldman Sachs as advisers for floating some of the European bonds.  This is an organisation that was criminally complicit in cooking the books for Greece.  That is the mess we are in.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Taxes have caused every revolution.  Unfair taxes caused the French and American revolutions.  Believe me, they will cause a revolution in Europe, or they should.  Once again, the people are not being considered.  It is a system.  It is exactly what happened with the Famine.  Centralised authorities have imposed unjust economic theories and worked them out in practice on the living flesh of the people of Europe.  In the case of the Famine, it was the people of this country.  I am 100% against it.  At last, thank God, one little country is being allowed to have a referendum.  Look at what happened to Greece when it sought a referendum.  Its Government was kicked out by centralised Europe.  Thank God for Ireland.  It can speak for the people of the rest of Europe and demand democracy back from our masters in Berlin, who are at it again.  They are bullying.  As I pointed out yesterday in the foreign affairs committee to their Minister for propaganda, they are also rearming.  This time, however, they are not arming themselves but Israel, with a new submarine being built in Kiel.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We have an international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights.  This will protect the homeless, the people who are now wandering the streets looking for somewhere to live.  What about them in all this economic theory?  We signed this international covenant but as we have not signed the protocol that was agreed in 2008, there is no method of enforcement.  If we are serious about the welfare of our citizens, I ask the Leader to plead with the Government to sign this protocol.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be more subdued than other Members this morning.  The issue I wish to raise is the fuel costs with which businesses and families are being hit.  People have referred to the household charge, septic tank charge and other charges.  However, the charge that is affecting the daily lives of families and businesses throughout this country is the cost of fuel.  An inordinate percentage of the cost of fuel is due to Government taxes.  Every time the price of fuel is increased the price of milk and the price of a sliced pan also increase, due to the knock-on increased ancillary costs of production as a result of higher fuel costs.  There are also the costs for families for home heating oil and for travelling to work.  Families are being hit every day and they have no way out.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on the cost of fuel and the inordinate percentage of Government taxes on fuel in this country?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="5"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the referendum, although it might be for a different reason from the reasons others might have.  I welcome it because, if passed, it will enshrine a debt brake in the Constitution for this and future Governments.  For too long we have seen expenditure of public moneys, and indeed promised expenditure by both Government and Opposition parties, with the sole purpose in many instances of gaining political advantage rather than for the genuine benefit of this country.  Once we enshrine in the Constitution that borrowing must be kept to very strict and disciplined limits, it will be good for this country.</P>
        <P>We now have a flavour of how this debate might progress.  Anybody who claims that Ireland can speak for the rest of Europe is living in cloud cuckoo land.  We should conduct this debate, regardless of whether one is for or against the referendum proposal, on the basis of what is in the best interests of the Irish people, many of whom are currently in great difficulty and suffering socially, psychologically and financially.  That is our duty.  We should not use this referendum purely for what we perceive to be political gain.  I would be asking everyone to be responsible in this debate.  I would like to think that the Government will make every effort prior to the referendum to ensure that there is some amelioration of the sovereign debt levels, particularly the promissory notes, and also the interest rate levels.  That should be done to ensure that we get a positive result in this country.  People must see that the path we are taking will lead to some sort of resolution of their difficulties and that it will not be a continuous round of austerity for at least a decade.  There is an onus on all of us, working together in the interests of this country, to ensure that what is put to the people is done in an attractive way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should be wary of persons from outside this country who have a great deal of money to spend influencing policy making in this country.  There is a children&rsquo;s group which was told that &euro;1.5 million from external sources would be ploughed into a referendum here.  I do not want to see our referendum contaminated by anybody with his or her own personal external agenda.  This should be done on the basis of us debating it openly and honestly in the interests of the people and, hopefully, persuading that the correct decision will be made, particularly in the interests of the younger generation to whom we have a real responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the referendum as a moment which is good for Irish democracy.  This really is an iconic moment in our times which will define our future with Europe.  We need to be careful about how we debate and the language we use around this referendum.  Undoubtedly, in the period running up to the referendum there will be uncertainty in the markets, and internationally, about the state of Ireland and any hyperbole or misinformation put out, in this House or in the other Chamber, will feed into that and cause greater uncertainty.  I appeal to people to make their arguments for or against this treaty &mdash; I will be robustly making the argument in favour of it &mdash; but let us keep the debate factual and honest.  Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien referred to the &ldquo;No&rdquo; group already putting up their posters.  Last night on public radio prominent Sinn F&eacute;in spokespersons stated that there are no implications in the European stability mechanism for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, which is factually wrong.  I will not make the argument here for or against the treaty &mdash; I will do that when we have a debate here &mdash; but I appeal for proper, factual and responsible comment.</P>
        <P>On a lighter note, I took a look through some of the international comment in this morning&rsquo;s media.  I note a prominent photograph of our colleague, Senator Byrne, in the <i>Financial Times</i> which surely will go a long way towards steadying the nerves of even the flakiest investor.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Absolutely.  I commend Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s responsible and reasonable position on this.  Let us keep the debate honest, factual and reasonable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I find myself having to offer some support for Sinn F&eacute;in here this morning.  We ought to reject any suggestion that the party would endanger Ireland&rsquo;s commercial interests by opposing the referendum on the fiscal compact.  Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and Adams have already shown that their commitment to Ireland Inc. is sure and that they are acting in our best interests.</P>
        <P>I would defend the putting up of posters at this stage by Sinn F&eacute;in or any other group.  I must disagree with my friend, Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, on this.  There can be nothing wrong with people getting their arguments in early.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Informed arguments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision to hold a referendum on this issue.  This is one area where we know what is at stake and what is involved, and it is entirely legitimate for people to put up posters advocating a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is illegal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We must certainly comply with legalities but in terms of advocating a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, the people know what the issues are.  This is about strengthening, and tying us into, commitments that we have already made.  We will face stringent rules in the future around deficits and debt.  The decision that the people must make is whether this is in our best interests, whether, by being seen to tie ourselves into this agreement &mdash; one must remember our say so is not required for this treaty to go ahead &mdash; we will act to reassure markets in the future that we are a safe bet when it comes to lending, and whether it will strengthen our voice when we seek concessions on issues such as the promissory notes.  Senator Walsh is correct.  It is Ireland&rsquo;s best interests that must drive this debate, not persons on either side trying to gain political leverage for themselves on other issues, certainly not a protest of the Government nor, indeed, a tribal vote in support of the Government.  Ireland&rsquo;s best interests must be the test as persons decide how they will vote on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like most of the other Senators who have spoken, I welcome the referendum.  The debate should be on the referendum, not what we would like to see discussed about Europe.  Education, as Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Walsh called for, in telling the people exactly what is in the treaty, is most important.  There was a survey published today where a professor asked those surveyed what interest rate they were paying on their mortgage, what interest rate they were paying on their credit card and what was the rate of inflation, and I noted the percentage of people who needed education about that.  Putting something into the Constitution is a serious issue and we, as elected representatives, must ensure that we give it proper debate rather than score political points and give the facts rather than what we would like to debate, for which, I hope, we will have another day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In Europe, this is rare diseases day to give a voice to the voiceless.  According to the organisation GRDO, there are 250,000 people who suffer from different rare diseases.  It is difficult for them to get access to proper care and there is no access to a clear pathway for medical attention.  A survey by the organisation GRDO demonstrated that one in seven had waited more than ten years for a diagnosis of their condition and 37% had received a wrong diagnosis. <Col N="7"/> We must do something about that.  According to that survey, 60% stated that they got their information from the Internet.  All the organisation is looking for is, not a main national body or organisation, but a sub-office in the Department of Health where anybody suffering with a rare disease can have a clear pathway to acknowledge that he or she will be looked at early in their disease because preventive medicine saves the country money.  I ask the Minister for Health to look at establishing an office &mdash; or a person at whom the buck stops &mdash; which the organisation or the persons affected can ring up to ask the avenue they should go down.  It would reduce the time spent shunting patients between one doctor and the other and, most important, would lead to a better outcome for those suffering from the disease.  When one considers our population, 250,000 people is no small number.</P>

On the referendum, I must be one of the few people who is disappointed we are having a referendum on the fiscal stability pact for the reason that I do not believe the Constitution is the right place to be enshrining these types of measures.  The Constitution is primarily there to protect rights and liberties and I would much prefer if we were having a constitutional referendum on the rights of the child rather than fiscal stability.  I do not believe it is appropriate.  In the 1970s we were talking about John Maynard Keynes, in the 1980s it was Milton Friedman.  Times change, as do economic circumstances.  I do not believe these types of measures should be enshrined in a constitution.  However, the Attorney General has seen otherwise and of course I will be supporting it as I consider these measures are important for the future of the economy.</P>
        <P>On a note of caution, I am not happy to hear anti-German sentiment both in this House and outside of it.  It is inappropriate.  It is not the fault of the German people or some plot on their part that we, Europe, are in the financial position we are in.  I do not believe it is helpful to the debate on this issue for the Irish people to be personalising it around the German people.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to bring in the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and perhaps the Minister for Finance to have an emergency debate on the housing market and the construction sector.  Senators may have seen the CSO statistics published yesterday showing that house prices fell last year by almost 20% and in January this year we had one of the sharpest falls ever in house prices.  This is a very important issue.  For every fall in house prices, Irish people are in greater negative equity and the balance sheet of our banks is in even worse condition than it was before.  There is obviously a reason for the continuing fall in prices.  There is a lack of confidence in the market but there is also a lack of finance.  We are back to mortgage lending in the way we had it in the 1970s.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to ask the Minister for Health to come to the House to explain the situation with regard to the national cancer control programme and its relationship to pre-election promises and commentary which has followed since.  On 9 February, the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, visited the north west of the country and spoke about the issue concerning cancer services in that area, in particular the commitments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe, Deputy Tony McLoughlin, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the Taoiseach himself to assure, first, that cancer services would be restored; second, that they would be restored within 100 days, third, that the Labour Party would ensure a ninth centre of excellence would be located at that location and, fourth, to assure everybody in a live debate which is still available on the Internet that each of those individuals &mdash; Deputies Perry and McLoughlin and Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe &mdash; would resign their membership of the Oireachtas if that was not carried through.</P>
        <P>To follow on and give some context, on 9 February the Minister, Deputy Reilly, when talking about these issues in Sligo, assured the people of the north west, some 200,000 people, that the door was not closed on this issue.  At that specific moment in time, Dr. Susan O&rsquo;Reilly, the head of the national cancer control programme was giving an interview to <i>irishhealth.com</i> stating: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely not going to happen&rdquo;.  To use, neglect and mislead a section of the people of Ireland, some 250,000 people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>This is a day to think we are lucky people.

I believe we should vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; &mdash; vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for Ireland, our future and Europe, because what we decide will have an impact on the whole of Europe.  We should also use this moment to advance our negotiations on thepromissory notes, the bank debt and the terms of the bailout.  This referendum is giving us these opportunities.  This is a very good day for Ireland.</P>
        <P>This is also a very important day in the lives of almost 8,000 public servants who are retiring today.  Some 1,600 of those are teachers.  I ask the Leader for a debate with the Minister of <Col N="10"/>State, Deputy Joe Costello, on the contribution some of those public servants may make in volunteering overseas.  I was struck by a presentation from Voluntary Services Overseas, VSO, which told us of the impact that 1,363 teacher trainers from many countries had in Ethiopia last year.  The teachers trained will go on to educate some 800,000 children.  While it is a day on which our public servants will reflect on their futures, many of them are young and will continue to contribute in this country while some may consider an opportunity to contribute abroad in the developing world.</P>

	<P>I endorse Senator John Whelan&rsquo;s comments on the household charge.  There is a group encouraging people from the North, Britain, Germany, France, the United States and elsewhere to break the law in this country.  I have never heard anyone in another country advising people from other jurisdictions to break the law in that country.  It is probably symptomatic of the anti-everything campaign.  I see it in Donegal all the time, where even a priest whom I will not name has urged parishioners, from the pulpit, not to pay the household charge.  It is despicable that a member of the church would advise people who go to mass to receive religious guidance not to pay their taxes.  The country should have a good look at itself.</P>
        <P>In regard to the referendum on the European fiscal compact proposal, there is already misinformation by the No campaign.  Members of that group should note that anybody who puts up posters in advance of the official commencement of the campaign will be guilty of breaking the law.  We were all very conscious during the last general election that leaving a poster up seven days after it would leave us liable to a fine of &euro;200.  However, no action is being taken by local government to deal with this postering which was happening even before yesterday in respect of the household charge and so on.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite what has been said on the other side of the House, Senator Terry Leyden has raised a fundamental issue in regard to the forthcoming referendum.  As somebody who was actively involved in previous referendums, I advise the Government to tread very carefully in how it presents this issue to the people.  The first referendum on the Nice treaty which was essentially a housekeeping exercise was lost because people believed their sons and daughters would be carried off to serve in a European army.  That issue has since disappeared from the agenda of those who voted against the interests of the country on that occasion.  That referendum was rejected because of campaigning by sectional interests opposed to Government policy, including nurses, taxi drivers and various others.  I could read out a litany of such interests.</P>
        <P>If anyone assumes this referendum will be embraced by the people without detailed debate and a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the State, he or she is gravely mistaken.  It may sound like pork barrel politics, but there is a unique opportunity for the Government to tell the European Union that our bank debt is unsustainable in the medium to long term and that the country &mdash; I have said this repeatedly in the House &mdash; cannot continue to operate under the burden of that debt.  Those who have been quick to criticise Fianna F&aacute;il Administrations of the past must have been interested to hear a senior German MEP and former chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the European Parliament, Elmar Brok, point out on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night that the reason the European Union, including Ireland, was in its current state was the bank collapse of 2007 and 2008.  Whatever mistakes Fianna F&aacute;il might have made in government, the fundamental reason for our current difficulties is the activities of greedy banks, particularly the German banks.  It is important to note that they are separate from the German people.  I agree with Senator Aideen Hayden that we should not be seen to be expressing anti-German sentiments.  The activities of German banks which flooded this and other countries with cheap and easy money, together with a poor regulatory regime, are the main reasons we find ourselves in our current position.</P>
        <P>One can argue about the politics of the issue until the cows come home.  What it comes down to is that the Government must let its European counterparts know that if the referendum is to be carried, the people must be given some hope they will get out from under the unsustainable and unacceptable bank debt.  We could then operate within a fiscal treaty that would oblige us to adhere to the 3% deficit requirement.  We should bear in mind in that regard that this was one of the few countries which ran a budget surplus up to the time of the collapse of <Col N="13"/>the banking system which occurred as a consequence of the activities in the sub-prime market and of the toxic American banks.  The sooner that narrative is engaged with, rather than merely firing shots about what Fianna F&aacute;il did in government, the sooner we can move forward, as all of us wish to do, to remove this burden from the people and re-enter an era of prosperity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that we have a constructive debate on this matter.  During the referendum on the Lisbon treaty a leaflet was distributed to every household on the north side of Cork city claiming that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote would lead to legalised abortion and prostitution, the imposition of conscription and a European insistence on no more than one child per family.  The media have an important role to play in the upcoming referendum.  They must take on such claims and ensure the correct information is made available.  </P>
        <P>It is constructive to consider the positives.  While we had 1.2 million people working in this country in 1990, that number had increased to 2.1 million by 2008.  For the first time we made a serious impact in facilitating people to provide jobs.  We must return to that position.  The European Union has an important role to play in ensuring we can continue to create jobs.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris described the current debt position as &ldquo;diabolical&rdquo;.  However, it is not just about the payment of bank debts; it is also about getting our finances under control.  A single figure illustrates the enormity of the problem.  Last year we paid out &euro;13.4 billion for the provision of health care services, including elderly care services, medical cards, hospital care services and so on, and brought in &euro;13.317 billion in income tax.  In other words, every cent we received in income tax went on the provision of health care.  We have been able to maintain public services only because we have been able to access finance.  It is about being part of the European market and ensuring we can increase exports and thus create jobs.  The media have a vital role to play in the debate and must play that role constructively.  On previous occasions information, which was untrue, was put into the public domain.</P>

	<P>The House will be interested to know that yesterday the Cabinet approved the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 initiated in this House almost two years ago.  I mention this because of the importance of the legislation to the construction industry and the length of time it takes to get things done.  A number of amendments to the legislation have been proposed, following which this House will consider it.  I hope that happens quickly.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Leader ensure the Government is aware of the urgency of getting this legislation through the D&aacute;il and Seanad prior to the summer recess so that it can be enacted, thus benefiting society as a whole and in particular the construction industry.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the referendum on the fiscal compact treaty.  I am one of a few people on this side who advocated that we should have a referendum.  I have faith in the judgment of the Irish people.  I believe the result of the referendum will be positive, which will increase Ireland&rsquo;s standing in Europe.  I welcome the proposed debate on the treaty.  I propose to the Leader that the Seanad take the lead in the debate on the referendum and that this House meet one or two Fridays a month between now and polling day to discuss European matters, with no limit in terms of speaking time and at which time people can express their views for or against the treaty and Europe.  We could also consider inviting in outside experts, including the Minister, who have particular information in regard to Europe that could be useful.</P>
        <P>The relevance of the Seanad is an issue regularly discussed.  The Seanad is extremely relevant.  However, it could and should play a pivotal role in the distribution of information on the referendum to citizens of the country.  I ask that the Leader inquire as to the funding that will be made available to the referendum commission.  It is hoped that the referendum commission will play an equally pivotal role in this referendum, not alone in respect of citizens who have <Col N="14"/>a vote but to school children throughout the country.  Debate on this referendum provides Government with an opportunity to engage with young people.  I sincerely hope the referendum commission will distribute information that is relevant, useful, informative and set out in simple language which people can understand.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I ask that the Leader provide time for a debate on older Irish citizens.  In September last, the Leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Martin, asked me to prepare a policy document for Fianna F&aacute;il on the issue of older people in Irish society.  I spent the past six months meeting the different groups engaged in this area.  Yesterday, Deputy Martin and I launched this document, which has the full support of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party, as official Fianna F&aacute;il policy on older people in Irish society.  There are 500,000 people over the age of 65 years in this country.  In less than 20 years, there will be 1 million older people in this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My document addresses key issues such as human rights and choice in the workplace for older people.  Fianna F&aacute;il proposes to introduce a Bill on the abolition of mandatory retirement in the public and private sector.  There is no reason a person should have to retire on reaching 65 years of age.  This is age discrimination.  It is also unlawful.  Mandatory retirement in the UK has been repealed.  Fianna F&aacute;il intends to introduce legislation in this area.</P>

	<P>Recent courses organised by SafeTALK highlight the need for more help to encourage men to speak about depression and to seek help for their condition.  It is widely recognised that men are more reluctant to speak about being depressed.  This was highlighted at a course I recently attended through the use of video.</P>
        <P>A recent newspaper article revealed that a study undertaken by the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork found that 80% of suicide victims had been in touch with their GPs in the year prior to their suicide.  It is sad that these people sought help but did not get it when they needed it.  Our first port of call when anything is wrong is always the GP.  I agree with Senator Gilroy and others that more training and suicide awareness among GPs is urgently needed.  I would go further and ask that more training be provided to all health and community workers countrywide in an effort to reduce the incidence of suicide.</P>
        <P>In the six years between 2003 and 2009, 75,119 people presented at emergency departments throughout the country following deliberate self harm.  The National Registry of Deliberate Self Harm also reported that people who have deliberately self harmed are 30 to 50 times more <Col N="15"/>likely to commit suicide.  I ask that the Leader invite the Minister for Health to the House for a debate on suicide and, more important, on encouraging people to implement suicide awareness training for community and health workers.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I commend Senator Quinn for his work and achievement in respect of the Construction Contracts Bill.  It is rare for an Independent Senator to have legislation accepted by Cabinet.  The legislation concerned is important to sub-contractors and the private sector.</P>
        <P>Like everyone else, I welcome the proposed referendum.  One of the main concerns in respect of the treaty is the role of the European Central Bank and the democratic deficit with which we could be left.  Also, there is no reassurance in regard to our common consolidated tax base.  There will be a great deal of scaremongering in the run up to the referendum.  However, that is part of any debate.  Issues such as Ireland being thrown out of Europe, the euro and the EU will be up for debate.</P>
        <P>It was stated by a colleague opposite that in my comments I was castigating the Germans.  However, I was in that regard quoting German Ministers.  The German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, has proposed that Greece should delay its elections and that a technocrat cabinet should be put in place to run Greece.  It is little wonder people are saying the Germans are running Europe.  It is little wonder they are saying that when the Germans themselves are proposing that Europe will be run according to their wishes.</P>

This morning, however, I seriously compliment him on his steady, sure and responsible leadership with regard to the fiscal compact treaty and the referendum that now is to be held thereon.  As he stated, it is in the interests of the common good.  It will also build on the steady progress this country has been making and will support the growing international investor confidence in Ireland that has been so important.  It will assist the economy and Ireland&rsquo;s reputation and the jobs that are flowing therefrom.  It reaffirms our will and our commitment to the euro and membership thereof.  It will give us stronger fiscal rules, which are necessary never to have a recurrence of what happened in the past and which led us into the appalling abyss from which we are recovering at present and hopefully will continue to recover.  Moreover, it will confirm our commitment to responsible budgeting.  For all these reasons, many of which were alluded to by Senator O&rsquo;Brien, Government Members obviously equally agree.  Moreover, they look forward to a highly constructive campaign and to working in harmony and co-operation with the Fianna F&aacute;il grouping in this House.  I hope the Fianna F&aacute;il grouping in the other House will unite as much as its Seanad counterpart has done and I compliment them in that regard.</P>

All Members look forward to participating in the debate when the proposed legislation comes before the House and all sides of the House should support the aims contained within Senator White&rsquo;s document.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On another health-related issue, I support Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s call for the Minister for Health to come to the House because of the assurances and promises made in the north west both before and after the last general election in respect of two hospitals.  I refer to the promises regarding Sligo General Hospital, the retention of cancer services there and the creation of a centre of excellence for cancer treatment in Sligo, as well as the retention of Lifford Community Hospital.  These promises were made by Labour Party and Fine Gael candidates in Sligo-North Leitrim and Donegal South-West.  They also were made by the current Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, when he visited Lifford last February.  He stated categorically that were Fine Gael in government, the future of Lifford Community Hospital would be secure.  Last week, Health Service Executive West published its report which confirmed that Lifford Community Hospital is closing.  The only reason public consultation is now being entered into is because <Col N="17"/>three ferocious elderly patients at Abbeyleix community hospital took the HSE to court before Christmas and won their case.  The Minister for Health must come to this House because at a time when people&rsquo;s view of politics is challenging, Ministers have gone up and down the country making all sorts of promises simply to buy votes.  Thereafter, having been elected and the faith of the people having been bestowed upon them they turn around and throw it back in people's faces.</P>

	<P>It is generally agreed that a good decision has been made to hold a referendum, which had been requested by all sides in this House, as well as among the public.  As public representatives, three options are available to Members.  First, they can stay quiet, keep their heads down and let others take the flak.  Second, they can oppose it and feed on the anger which evidently exists.  However, the third and most positive option is to support the referendum for the good of all the people and the good of the country.  I do not wish to get into the area of scaremongering, which I am sure takes place on both sides.  However, if Members deal only with the negative aspect of the present position, if they always work towards scoring political points and do not, for once, put their heads above the parapet, freely and independently, for the general good of all the people on this referendum, I certainly believe they will find themselves isolated to a large degree, which is not the case at present.  I also believe this would do immense damage to Ireland&rsquo;s image internationally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome both the holding of the referendum and the responsible attitude being displayed by the Fianna F&aacute;il grouping this morning in supporting the referendum.  I wish to support Senator Conway&rsquo;s call to the Leader to facilitate some additional sittings of the Seanad to debate this treaty in an open and responsible fashion.  This would also fulfil the <Col N="18"/>wishes of Senator Colm Burke, who called for the media to report responsibly in this regard.  It would provide the latter with an opportunity to be present for those dates.  All Members complain the media pays very little attention to what goes on in the Seanad.  However, were Members to have a mature and open debate on all aspects of the treaty, the media may well see fit to concentrate on reporting the proceedings of this House in a much fuller fashion.</P>
        <P>This probably will be the most important treaty on which people must decide because of its impact.  The common good and the future of our country are very much at stake.  This would be a further step along the road towards rebuilding Ireland&rsquo;s economy and restoring our international reputation, as well as contributing to strengthening the euro.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s announcement to the effect that a referendum on the fiscal compact is both required and will be held.  There is only one reason to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the treaty, namely, that we will not have access to moneys from any new bailout fund if we do not do so.  This is probably the only good reason to vote in favour of the treaty.  I attended an interparliamentary meeting in Brussels in recent days at which considerably difficult issues regarding the contents of the fiscal compact were raised.  The British have severe doubts about the legality of the compact.  I expressed similar doubts a number of weeks ago.  Questions also arose at the meeting in the context of what constitutes a structural deficit.  One of the speakers informed us that there are at least 27 definitions in this regard.  These issues will have to be teased out.  On that basis, I request that the Leader meet his counterparts among the other groups in the House in order to establish the format that will apply in respect of the debate in which we will engage on this matter.  We must ensure that our debate reaches the widest possible audience and has the greatest possible impact on people.  We could do the public a good service by engaging in a Committee Stage-style debate.  I accept that this is agreed but we should be informed as to the details of the debate.</P>

That is absolutely despicable.  Two Members approached me when they had made their contributions and stated that they were obliged to attend committee meetings.  Others, however, merely swanned off as usual.  That is just not acceptable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are also certain Members who table matters to be raised on the Adjournment and are then not present to discuss them when the relevant Ministers come before the House.  That is also completely unacceptable.</P>

        <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the support of Fianna F&aacute;il, which Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien outlined, for the referendum on the fiscal compact, which will be of paramount importance in stabilising the economic situation in Europe.  It will also be another vital step on the road to rebuilding Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  As previous speakers indicated, the Seanad will play an important role in the debate on this matter.  Long before the decision to hold the referendum was taken, the House had already determined that it would debate the fiscal compact in detail.  We have already made arrangements for an information day for Members to be held in the audio-visual, AV, room on 8 March next.  In addition, we will have a very constructive and detailed debate on every aspect of the fiscal compact.  The Seanad will, therefore, play its part in the debate leading up to the referendum.</P>
        <P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien also referred to ComReg and An Post.  I will try to obtain an update for him in respect of that matter.</P>
        <P>I support the remarks made by Senator Whelan, particularly in respect of the household charge and the methods of payment relating thereto.  There is certainly a need for local authorities to take a more active role with regard to this issue.  The Senator stated that An Post should be involved in the payment process relating to the charge.  He should remember that there will be a need for An Post to be competitive in its activities.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to pulling down the European project.  I am obliged to ask where Ireland would be in the context of human rights and social policy if it was not a member of the European Union.</P>

	<P>Senator Sheahan referred to the cost of fuel.  That is a matter which can be discussed with the Minister for Finance when he comes before the House.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Walsh that the fiscal compact treaty will put in place a credible commitment to responsible budgeting.  I assure him that the Government is committed to securing a deal on the promissory notes.</P>
        <P>Senator Gilroy also referred to the referendum and is seeking proper, factual and informative comment during the debate relating to it.  I am sure we all agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senator in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Keane has referred to the fact that this is International Rare Diseases Day.  There are over 250,000 people in this country who have rare diseases.  It is important that when people are diagnosed with such diseases, the necessary drugs be made available to them.</P>
        <P>I assure Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh that the Government will consider the wording of the referendum carefully before it is put to the people.  There will certainly be ample time available to discuss the treaty in its entirety.</P>
        <P>Senator Hayden referred to the proposed referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  This will take place later in the year.  The Government is completely committed to holding such a referendum and it will take place before the end of 2012.  I agree with the Senator in respect of the anti-<Col N="20"/>German sentiment among certain Members.  It is regrettable that such sentiments were expressed.</P>
        <P>Senator Hayden also called for a debate on housing and the construction industry.  We are trying to arrange a debate with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, on that matter.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry spoke passionately about the national cancer strategy.  We engaged in a debate with the Minister for Health only a couple of weeks ago and the Senator posed questions to him at that point.  Numerous individuals had requested that such a debate take place but when the Minister came before the House, only ten Members were present to ask questions.</P>

        <P Just="Left">In the context of Senator Harte&rsquo;s comments, I am appalled that a member of a religious order is urging people not to pay a tax and to break the law.  If that is the case, it is despicable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn referred to the Construction Contracts Bill.  As he correctly pointed out, the Cabinet approved the Bill yesterday.  I will emphasise to the Government the sense of urgency relating to the Bill.  I compliment the Senator on bringing it before the House and ensuring that it reached this stage.  What has happened in this instance highlights the importance of introducing Private Members&rsquo; Bills in the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Conway and Mullins requested that time be made available for a debate on the fiscal compact treaty.  We will allow as much time as possible to be devoted to debating the treaty in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator White made a number of important points in respect of older people.  I hope that the report of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee will be published very soon.  It is a pity that it has not emerged as yet but it will be published in the near future.  I am sure many of the recommendations it will contain are already contemplated in the booklet to which the Senator referred.</P>
        <P>Senator Moran referred to men being encouraged to talk about depression.  This is an extremely important matter and reference was made to it in the debate on suicide in which the House engaged on 12 January.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Daly expressed certain sentiments in respect of Germany.  It is regrettable that the Senator did not clarify the position and apologise for the points he made yesterday, when he insisted that the Government would not hold a referendum.  Of course, he made his remarks approximately two minutes prior to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement that a referendum would be held.  The Senator spoke a little too soon on the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Brennan has referred to the teams that will be coming to Ireland to train prior to the Olympic Games.  That will certainly provide a boost for tourism.  We need all the boosts we can get at this point.</P>

	<P>The House will now pay tribute to our former colleague, the late Michael Doherty, who was affectionately known as &ldquo;Mickey&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am honoured to lead tributes to the late Michael or Mickey Doherty, a former Senator and councillor who sadly passed away late last year.  I express my sincere sympathy to his family who are present.  He was a man of great integrity who was committed to public service.  The widespread and heartfelt tributes paid to him after his death <Col N="22"/>demonstrated the high regard in which he had been held across the country, especially in his home county of Longford where he was affectionately known as &ldquo;The Popular&rdquo;.  He was a man with a great sense of humour and quick wit.</P>
        <P>An auctioneer by profession, the Ballinalee native entered local politics in 1967, serving as a county councillor for more than two decades.  Mickey then enjoyed a two year spell as a Senator from 1987 to 1989 after securing election to the 18th Seanad on the Administrative Panel.  Perhaps best known for his role as a special adviser to the former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, he stepped down from public life in 2000 following a long and distinguished career.</P>
        <P>A first rate public servant, Mickey was a man of great character who always made time to listen to the ideas of others.  He will be remembered in County Longford for his major work in improving conditions in St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital.  He was a hard working and dedicated member of the health board for many years.</P>
        <P>It is understood Mickey coined the phrase, &ldquo;Votes do not swim across the River Shannon&rdquo;, when describing the election transfers in the former Longford-Roscommon constituency.  While I did not have the pleasure of serving with him, I note the glowing tributes of his contemporaries, the most poignant of which came from his great friend, former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds.</P>
        <P>At this time we must remember those closest to Mickey, in particular, his niece, Maura Gettings, who is with us in the Chamber.  I also convey my sympathy to his friend and business partner, Councillor Victor Kiernan, who was unable to attend today, and all of his family and many friends in County Longford and throughout the country.  I express my deepest sympathy to his Fianna F&aacute;il Party colleagues in the Seanad, many of whom knew him personally.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for arranging for Senators to pay tribute to a late and much loved colleague, Mickey Doherty.  This House has a good record in acknowledging and saluting former Members who have gone to their eternal rest.  It is particularly important to do this, not only for us to pay tribute to them but also to indicate to their families and the wider community the respect we have for former Members.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mickey Doherty was a warm hearted individual who approached people with a smile and was always very positive.  He made a famous comment which showed that he was also calculated in helping his own people.  He would always say, &ldquo;Sure look, I am only a small farmer from a very deprived area.&rdquo;  For those who remember him, the late Monsignor Horan made a similar comment on &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo; when he stated he was only a humble parish priest trying to build an airport at Knock.  In many ways, Mickey and Monsignor Horan fell into the same category.</P>
        <P>It is worth examining Mickey&rsquo;s career.  Like many of his countrymen, he went to England to work for a while.  This suggests he was not the type of person who would lie down if things were not going well.  When he returned, he showed great spirit by establishing a small agricultural subcontracting business.  That led to a thriving auctioneering business with his colleague, Councillor Victor Kiernan.  He was the parliamentary assistant to Albert Reynolds but he was much more than an ordinary assistant because he had his ear to the ground and he had his finger on the pulse of everything that moved in Longford.  He was exceptionally compassionate.  He had a particular affection for those less fortunate than himself.  He wanted to help them and he looked after the sick.  He was closely associated with St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital and he looked out <Col N="23"/>for carers.  He was the type of public representative we would all like to be if we could.  He went into public life not just for what he might get himself out of it but with the intention of helping other people.</P>
        <P>The abolition of the health boards was not a good idea.  When people like Mickey Doherty was sitting on a health board and a health issue came up, he would not have been stonewalled by the HSE because he made sure those who did not have health insurance cover would be looked after.  He would make a case urgently and he had a reputation for that.  He was chairman of the health board for five years.</P>
        <P>Many stories have been told about his time as parliamentary assistant but he had a great understanding of how the system worked.  He was not a messenger boy, as he always looked out for opportunities and he tried to analyse the problems on the ground.  That says a great deal about the man.  He could have led an easy life as a parliamentary assistant but he decided not to do that.  He wanted to help other people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mickey Doherty was a very warm character and it is nice not only that he will be remembered by the House but also that he has gone into the folklore of the democratic system.  Any time one hears debates or discussions or people trying to make a point, whether it is about currency fluctuation or whatever, Mickey Doherty&rsquo;s name tends to come up.  That is not just because he was colourful but because he had a way of getting a message across.  He certainly knew how to handle the media.  I do not think there was ever a bad story about Mickey Doherty in the media.  When one considers that he spent several decades as a county councillor, as a member and chairman of the health board, as parliamentary assistant and as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, that he did not fall foul of the media shows he was a great public relations man.  However, he did not engage in public relations in an overbearing way.  He did it in a way which generated increasing affection towards him.  However, once he had the person listening to him, he was able to make a strong case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When Mickey Doherty ran in the Seanad elections, he contested on the administrative panel.  Members will know what it is like having had to bite their nails during election counts, and he was in a famous count in an election which was one of those after which people still talk about the anomalies in the system.  He had been nominated by the parliamentary party and he was the clear winner on that occasion.  While he was a Member of the Seanad, I understand from colleagues who knew him very well that he gave so much to the Seanad and he used every minute of the short time he had here not just to work the system but also trying to mould the system to the needs of the community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mickey Doherty was a great friend of Albert Reynolds, as we all know, and Albert depended on him.  There are two words that would describe him in that context.  One is &ldquo;trust&rdquo;: he was totally trustworthy.  The other, which we would all like to have in a colleague or friend, is &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo;.  He was loyal to the very end and would always stand up for the people with whom he worked.  At the same time, to the best of my knowledge from what I know of him, he was not the type of politician who was into point scoring, as stated earlier.  He got on with the work, he respected everyone and the fact that he went into partnership with a Fine Gael county councillor in the auctioneering business in some way helps to underline that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I extend my sympathy to Mickey Doherty's niece, Maura Gettings, who is in the House with S&eacute;amus.  I thank them and all the family for sharing him with us both in public life and in many other activities.  He will be remembered for a long time to come and he was the kind of person <Col N="24"/>who would have justified the existence of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to add my voice and those of my colleagues in the Labour Party to pay tribute and pay our respects to the legendary Mickey Doherty.  I had the privilege of knowing him when he was a member of the Midland Health Board.  I often covered its meetings in Tullamore and Mickey was a guy who would fill many columns in the <i>Longford Leader</i>.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; pointed out, he had a way with words and a great way with people.  While he was assertive, he did not cross swords or fall foul of people but, none the less, got the job done.  Perhaps I could learn from him and many of us could take a leaf out of his book in terms of how he performed his duties as a public representative.</P>
        <P>I agree that the likes of Mickey Doherty are a great loss to bodies such as regional health boards, which were accessible and accountable and held the system to account on a monthly basis.  The stories about Mickey Doherty are legion and some have gone into the folklore of the political class in the midlands.  He was a great man for the &ldquo;spakes&rdquo;.  He would come out with great lines and he will always be affectionately remembered for them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If Mickey was with us today, he would be looking forward to the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis because he was surely Albert Reynolds&rsquo;s right-hand man.  In a time before spin doctors and special advisers, Mickey Doherty filled all those roles for Fianna F&aacute;il and Albert Reynolds, even when he was elevated to the highest office of the land as Taoiseach.  His loyalty was to Fianna F&aacute;il and he was unapologetic about that.  He was also a fully committed community man.  I extend our sincere sympathy to his family and to his second family, Fianna F&aacute;il.  He loved Fianna F&aacute;il in the same fashion as his family.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I echo the remarks of my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, in thanking the Leader for facilitating these expressions of sympathy to the late Mickey Doherty.  I am one of the few current Members who had the pleasure of serving in the House with him, which is an admission of my own advancing years.  What I always remember about him, whether it was inside or outside the House, was the twinkle in his eye and his understated personality.  It was deceptive and people who did not know him &mdash; Senator Whelan summed it up well having observed him, as a journalist, at various meetings &mdash; underestimated Mickey&rsquo;s intelligence and awareness of politics at their peril.  That was a great quality of his.  He was the archetypal local politician who fitted easily into national politics during the time he was in the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Whelan was correct about him not engaging with the media in a negative way.  In fact, Mickey had a very positive relationship with the media.  There are few people who could have had Miriam Lord eating out of their hands &mdash; I mean that in a literal sense.  They enjoyed each other.  A story was told here on a previous occasion about a comment that Mickey made to Miriam &mdash; I think it was Miriam, but certainly she was present &mdash; while they were waiting for Albert to appear at a count in Longford.  The journalists were becoming very agitated because they needed to file their copy, but Albert, who was Taoiseach at the time, had not turned up.  Mickey had gone to his house and Albert had said he was not going to go to the count until later.  Therefore, Mickey had to create some sort of diversion to placate the journalists, and he said that Albert was dealing with serious financial matters.  I understand the fallout from those comments affected the value of the Irish pound, and Mickey enjoyed that.  He would not have seen it as being something horrendous or awful that he should hide away from.  He actually enjoyed it.</P><Col N="25"/>
        <P Just="Left">I remember Mickey as a happy, well balanced individual with a twinkle in his eye.  The best way of describing him is as a latter-day ward boss.  He had a political antenna that was unrivalled.  He and Albert worked extremely closely together, and it was a fitting tribute that Albert was chief mourner at the funeral.  I know he will miss him greatly.  We all miss Mickey greatly, and I echo the expressions of sympathy to Maura, his niece, and to S&eacute;amus, who are with us.  I am so pleased they are here.  I know the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy for Longford-Westmeath, Deputy Troy, was instrumental in arranging for these expressions of sympathy to be held.  He is also present in the Chamber.  Deputy Troy would have enjoyed Mickey &mdash; not that he needs any help in his political advancement &mdash; because he loved politics above everything else.

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Along with Senator Mooney, I feel a little old this morning, as I served in the Seanad from 1987 to 1989 with the late Senator Mickey Doherty.  It was certainly an enjoyable experience dealing with such a colourful character and profoundly popular politician.  It was an interesting Seanad in 1987 because, as Senator Mooney knows, we were not meeting in this Chamber, as it was being renovated, but in the anteroom next door.  The desks were small and space was limited, and every comment, quip and utterance was heard throughout the House.  I cannot give in graphic detail an account of the morning when Senator Doherty was stopped from speaking by the then Cathaoirleach Tras Honan, but it certainly was a memorable morning for all of us who were there.  The Official Record of the Seanad reads &ldquo;Interruptions&rdquo;, but it was a bit more lively than that.  I believe it was actually Mickey Doherty&rsquo;s first speech, or first attempted speech, in the Seanad.  Of course, as Senator Mooney and others will recall, as he was elected on the same panel as Tras Honan, there was a bit of natural tension between them.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>That is one way of putting it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">His first intervention was certainly a memorable occasion.  He was a fascinating, friendly and chatty man.  I suppose that in today&rsquo;s very politically correct politics, where it is more about soundbites and spin doctors than substance, he would be a little lost, but he was a colossus in the politics of Longford and the midlands, and in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, for all of his political career.</P>
        <P>During last year&rsquo;s Seanad election, as I was touring the highways and byways of County Longford, I was travelling on a road I did not know when I suddenly saw Mickey Doherty standing by the wall of his lovely house.  I stopped the car and reintroduced myself to him, as we had not met for a number of years and his health was failing.  Not surprisingly, he invited me in for tea, and we had a lovely chat and half an hour&rsquo;s conversation about life and times then and now.  I was pleased to have that opportunity to meet him after so many years.  As my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues have said, he was very close to the former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, and they enjoyed their times together.  Their style and approach to life and politics were very similar.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will conclude with something I read in the local newspapers.  I really regret that I was unaware of Mickey Doherty's death, as I certainly would have attended his funeral.  I apologise to his family, but I was unaware of it until I read about it in the media some days afterwards.  The former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, who gave the graveside oration, used a phrase that sums up Mickey.  He said that on one occasion when they were having a debate or clash about the disadvantaged areas scheme, Mickey described himself as being &ldquo;a slightly handicapped man from a severely handicapped area&rdquo;.  That is a perfect summary of Mickey &mdash; serious and humor<Col N="26"/>ous all rolled into one.  He had a great political career and a great business career with his Fine Gael colleague, Victor Kiernan.  He saw the bigger picture in life.  He knew that politics was important but it was not the most important thing.  Rather, friendship and community and helping one&rsquo;s neighbours formed the biggest piece of the jigsaw for him, and he was supreme at that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, Mickey Doherty is a colleague who will be long spoken of.  When I looked at the record I actually thought he had served here for five years, or two terms, and I was surprised to see he had served for only one term.  It is amazing that in that one short term he left such a legacy that even people who never met him have heard about him and are entertained by stories of what he got up to.  We will certainly remember him here in Leinster House, but I am sure he will be remembered by his family and the people of Longford as a decent politician who genuinely did the State some service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom aont&uacute; leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ar son Mickey Doherty.  Mickey was both an institution and a character.  As Senator Mooney said, one underestimated him at one&rsquo;s peril.  He portrayed a very understated ability, but his astuteness in politics was certainly noted in his local area.  Reference has been made to his close friendship over the years with the former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds.  It is probably fair to say that Albert Reynolds might never have entered politics, and certainly might never have graced these Houses, but for Mickey Doherty.  I think Albert Reynolds himself would concede that.  It was unheard of in 1977 to do as Mickey Doherty did when, as a prominent Fianna F&aacute;il member and councillor in the area, he decided to support Albert Reynolds as a candidate against a sitting Deputy.  If that happens, generally it is the person him or herself challenging a Deputy rather than promoting somebody else.  It showed a selflessness about the man.  He was interested in and totally committed to the party and to Longford, and he obviously saw the potential in Albert Reynolds.  That in itself would have created a tremendous bond between them and a great sense of gratitude, which I know the former Taoiseach always felt towards Mickey.  However, there was also a great personal bond between them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recall an evening some time after the general election in 1989 when Albert Reynolds pulled up in his car outside my house with Mickey Doherty sitting in the back seat.  He wanted to know whether I would mind accompanying them around Wexford in order that Mickey could canvass all the councillors.  It was coming up to teatime and he felt that with a bit of help they could get around that night, which he did.  I was regaled with stories throughout the night as we went for cups of tea in the various houses.  I would have known the former Taoiseach and although I did not know Mickey terribly well, I really got to know him that night.  He was a most unassuming, genuine and very witty and funny man, as the Leader said.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mickey Doherty certainly made his mark on Fianna F&aacute;il and the health boards, but also on the country.  I recall that after Albert Reynolds was elected Taoiseach he identified his two priorities as trying to achieve peace in Northern Ireland and tackling unemployment.  Many people thought he was setting himself up for a huge fall because these objectives did not seem achievable at the time.  He worked hard on it and Mickey worked closely with him in that period and it was interesting to hear Senator Mooney&rsquo;s story about the count where it caused a run on the punt.  It was a case of Mickey covering for Albert who, after a long election campaign, needed relaxation and perhaps a few extra hours in bed.  As Mickey felt that was not a good image for the Taoiseach to portray he came up with this great excuse but when it went on the airwaves, everyone thought the punt was under pressure and it led to a bit of a run on it.  As Senator Mooney said, Mickey would have seen that as normal in the course of <Col N="27"/>politics.  He treated national politics like local politics, and if we all reflect on it, there is very little difference.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mickey Doherty is a man who made his mark, a genuine man, and I was proud and pleased to get to know him after that excursion around the roads of Wexford in 1989.  Like Senator Bradford, I was unaware of his death until we resumed after Christmas and I extend mysympathy to Maura and S&eacute;amus and other members of his family.  Ar dheis D&eacute; agus i measc na n-aingeal agus na naomh go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have this accidental opportunity to pay tribute to the late Senator Mickey Doherty.  I say accidental because it is not on the Order Paper and I was taking a briefing about a completely different matter and I came back here thinking I might have missed an amendment I was interested in on the other Bill.  By pure accident, Senator Doherty has served me well.</P>
        <P>I am one of the few people here today &mdash; there are a sprinkling &mdash; who remembers Senator Mickey Doherty.  If I recall him correctly, he was a Member of the Seanad when it sat outside in the antechamber and I believe Tras Honan was the Cathaoirleach at that stage.  I am sure I will be corrected if I am wrong.  They were two very colourful characters who were on the same Seanad election panel.  The reason for meeting in the antechamber was because this magnificent chamber was in difficulty and the entire central panel in the ceiling was in a state of collapse.  I am sure Senator Doherty, who took an interest in craft and in the economy of this country, would not object to my saying that it is a tribute to the craftsmanship that survives among the Irish that while many people who come into this Chamber look at the panels and comment on how great the talent was back in the days and that such work could not be done these days, the fact is it could.  No one could tell the difference between those three panels.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty was a colourful character.  We in Dublin are inclined to talk about Dublin characters and bemoan the fact they have all died out and possibly feel the same about politics.  Senator Doherty was certainly a colourful character.  He was a product of the midlands and I savoured every meeting with him because my own roots on my mother&rsquo;s side are very much from the midlands and he was so much a midlands man.  He knew his background and people extraordinarily well.  That is a talent.  It would be foolish to say he was the greatest orator I ever heard in this House but he knew politics inside out and he knew his own people.  I recall the late Frank O&rsquo;Connor speaking during a class in Trinity College when he taught there for some time and saying that sometimes people dismiss others for being parochial but if one knows one&rsquo;s own parish, one knows the whole world.  The danger is being provincial and he made a distinction between the two.  Senator Doherty knew his parish so intimately, it gave him an insight into human nature.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I always felt there was something roguish about Mickey Doherty.  He would flit through the corridors of power with a half smile and a twinkle in his eye and we would know something was up.  He was a close adviser of Albert Reynolds who was, in my opinion, another decent man who also came from Longford, rose through the ranks and brought that kind of experience with him.  He will be missed.  He was a colourful character.  It is often said: &ldquo;N&iacute; fheicfimid a leith&eacute;id ar&iacute;s ann&rdquo;; we will not see his like again.  I rather doubt we will see another Mickey Joe Doherty and we are impoverished for that.  Some of the colour has gone out of Irish political life.  He was also, if I recall correctly, a remarkable tallyman.  I imagine he would agree with those of us here who felt there was a place for the p&iacute;osa p&aacute;ip&eacute;ir and the peann luaidhe at elections, with all the drama, excitement and human element.  I extend my condolences to his niece and nephew and say that wherever he is, I expect he is up to his ears in it.  I, certainly, am sorry he has left us.</P>

        <P Just="Left">On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I add to the sentiment of what has been said by previous speakers.  I did not know Mickey Doherty but I have heard about him and having heard some of the stories we have heard today, I would love to hear more of them and I would say we surely will in the next couple of years.  It is important that the Seanad takes time out to pay respect to those people who have served in this House and in the public sphere.  It is a great sacrifice to make on their own behalf and on behalf of their families and, on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I convey our condolences to Maura and S&eacute;amus who are here in the Visitors Gallery.  I am sure Mickey was central to a lot of the work done by the iar-Thaoiseach, Albert Reynolds, on behalf of the peace process, which was greatly welcome.  It is important we recognise those who went before us and learn and respect what they stood for and achieved.</P>
        <P>Thar ceann p&aacute;irt&iacute; s&rsquo;againne, ba mhaith liom suaimhneas faoi sh&iacute;ora&iacute; a ghu&iacute; air agus ar chuile duine a chuaigh romhainn.  Beannacht dh&iacute;lis D&eacute; lena anam agus go dtuga Dia sl&aacute;n &eacute;.</P>

	<P>I too wish to be associated with the tributes to the late Mickey Doherty, who was a Member of this House from 1987 to 1989.  I knew him well as a councillor and met him at several ard-fheiseanna.  I did not serve with him; he finished his service here in 1989 and I came into the Seanad later that year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As has been said, Mickey Doherty was quite a character with a great sense of humour and turn of wit.  He was a dedicated member of Fianna F&aacute;il for his whole life and he served the people of Longford well.  He was a close confidante and loyal supporter of Albert Reynolds at all times and was very proud when he was made Taoiseach.  He was also loyal to Fianna F&aacute;il and travelled to conferences throughout the country.  As a Member said earlier, he had a great twinkle in his eye; there was a bit of devilment in him.  At the same time, he was very able in contributing to various debates.  He also had a great grasp of what was happening in politics, particularly local politics.  A Member said earlier that the votes could not swim across the River Shannon in the old Longford-Roscommon constituency.  Earlier today I saw Deputy Troy and there was certainly a transfer of votes from Longford to Westmeath in the last election, which helped Deputy Troy to be elected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I extend my sympathy to Mickey Doherty's niece Maura and her husband S&eacute;amus.  The Cathaoirleach, Senator Paddy Burke, wishes to be associated with the tributes today.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 27</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 32 to 37, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together, by agreement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment No. 32 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 26, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) Once the number of women elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann reaches at least 40 per cent of the total number of TDs elected in one general election and remains at that level following the next two general elections, the gender-related criteria for State funding to political parties set out in this Act shall no longer apply to general elections to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment relates to the sunset clause.  As the Minister is aware, the amendment was recommended by the all-party committee chaired by Senator Ivana Bacik.  Every Member sees quotas as a short-term necessity in addressing a longer term cultural problem.  The success of the quotas for which we are legislating will become clear when they make themselves redundant.  The amendment provides that &ldquo;once the number of women elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann reaches at least 40 per cent of the total number of TDs elected in one general election and remains at that level following the next two general elections, the gender-related criteria for State funding to political parties set out in this Act shall no longer apply to general elections to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;.  We have proposed similar amendments in respect of local and Seanad elections to tie them in with the sunset clause.  This sensible approach is aimed at reassuring those who are concerned that we might end up with an inbuilt quota system forever.  That is not anybody&rsquo;s objective, rather the objective is that quotas should become unnecessary when the cultural problem has been addressed.  This means there would be more balanced political representation without a need to provide for it through a quota system.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage we raised the issue of local elections.  The reality is that the vast majority of candidates successful in general elections have gained experience at local level, a point acknowledged by the Minister in his remarks on the subject.  I understand he is of the view that parties will take the quotas applying to general elections into account when selecting local election candidates.  However, we should go further.  That is the reason we propose a quota system be introduced for the next local elections.  I note the Minister&rsquo;s comments on Second Stage about the way the political funding system works, that it is based on performance in a general election.  Amendment No. 34 would provide that the amount of funding allocated to a qualified political party would still be based, in the first instance, on electoral performance but would be reduced after the following local elections if the party did not meet the requirement that at least 30% of its candidates be male and female, rising to a figure of 40%.  While I have read the Bill, I do not see why there should be a legal block to continuing to base the provision primarily on performance in a general election, while providing that it would be subject to review downwards thereafter if the party did not meet its targets in respect of local election candidates.  The same would apply to Seanad elections.</P>
        <P>Given that provision is being made only for elections to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the Minister is pre-empting the outcome of a referendum on the future of the Seanad.  However, that is a matter for the people.  Given that there is no legal or practical block, the legislation should also apply to Seanad elections.  Candidates run without a party logo, but they are nominated by their <Col N="30"/>parties.  The position may be different for those nominated by groups, but certainly for candidates nominated by parties through their internal systems, this should not be an issue.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 36 is consequential on the other amendments and has been designed to ensure that if a quota system was in place for local, Seanad and general elections, the combined impact should not exceed a reduction of 50% in funding.  We have thought through those issues and have put forward an amendment to make sure that the overall loss would not be more than 50%.  I ask the Minister to consider these carefully, especially the issue in respect of the local elections.  This has been called for by a wide coalition of groups campaigning on the issue, including academics who have carried out research on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to examine the issue in respect of amendment No. 32 and the local elections.  I do not know if it can be done in the manner recommended by Senator Power.  When the Minister was here the last day and we spoke about parties doing this voluntarily, he stated that it would not be possible due to the funding issue.  Senator Power thinks she may have got around that by including the following local elections and the general election.  The amount of funding was allocated under section 4 of the 2001 Act, but I will leave that to the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a precedent for having a voluntary code in legislation.  A voluntary code was agreed in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2011 for the ESB and the power producing groups.  I ask the Minister to consider the voluntary side of it again.  If we write it into the Bill, we will try to shame the parties into it.  If it is possible to do it, I ask the Minister to look at it again.  Obviously we are not asking him to do it if it is not possible to do so.  I understand what he said the last day about current legislation, but I would like him to examine that 2011 Bill to see if there is anything in that which would allow for this to be included.</P>
        <P>I will wait to hear what the Minister has to say about deleting the quota after reaching a certain limit.  I am a reluctant convert to quotas and initially did not believe in them at all, but having looked at the statistics and at those countries which have managed to elect more women, it is the only way that it is being done.  Senator Power&rsquo;s amendment includes the reference &ldquo;following the next two general elections&rdquo; for the quota of elected women.  I do not think there is any woman who would agree with quotas for the sake of them.  A person gets elected because he or she is a good politician and wants to be there.  One swallow does not make a summer, and one election would not make a summer either for women.  Perhaps the Minister might consider that.</P>
        <P>Even though I would like to agree with the Seanad issue, I do not know how it would be possible to do it.  A court case was taken against Portmarnock Golf Club in respect of admitting women into private clubs.  Many of the nominations to the Seanad come from private bodies.  I do not know how the Minister would get around the legislation, given the way it is drafted at present.  If we have a methodology for nomination to the Oireachtas, we could do it for that, but that would not be fair on those who had to come through the nominating system from the private bodies.  There might be a difficulty with this.  However, it might give us an opportunity to examine the system of nominations to the Seanad in general.  The debate on the reorganisation of government must be examined, because it is not working properly in its current format.  The nominating bodies are too closed.   The institutes of technology are not included in the university section.</P>
        <P>This will lead to a wider debate and I thank the Senator for putting down the amendment.  However, I cannot support it in its current format.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution on it.  We should support anything that can be done to promote women in politics, especially at local level.  Only 17% of county councillors are women and we always recommend a bottom-<Col N="31"/>up approach.  If we do not start at local level, how will we have the required number of women at general elections?  We really have to take a bottom-up approach with this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate the Minister.  I was in local government for 20 years and heard this debate going on through the years, and it is only since the Minister took office that we have grabbed the bull by the horns and said we are going to do this.  I thank him for bringing it forward and look forward to his response.</P>

	<P>I am not sure about Senator Keane&rsquo;s bottom-up approach, but I certainly feel that this legislation is coming from the top down. Although they are welcome voices in the great national debate on policy and legislation, certain groups would have been agitating for this legislation.  Speaking for myself, I am not hearing much from the people of Ahascragh about it or from the people of the north side of Dublin, where I live.  This is not an issue about which people are terribly concerned.  That is because they value their democratic institutions as they have them, and they elect who they want to elect.  We have lost sight of that principle in this legislation.  The fact that there is no clamour for legislation of this kind, other than from vocal, influential voices who have access to the media, is something we should consider.  They are no less welcome to the debate than anybody else, but they should not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">What I cannot get over, when debating this legislation over several days, is how often people have said they look forward to the day when these quotas will not be necessary.  Not only that, they provide in legislation for the day when those quotas will not exist.  I cannot think of too many examples in politics where we introduce a measure to deal with a current problem, but we are so ashamed of that measure that we plan to make it obsolete at the earliest opportunity.  There is an acceptance in people&rsquo;s psyches that there is something intrinsically wrong with this approach.  Why would we not be happy to leave it on the Statute Book in case it should ever be needed again?  We get to the desired quota of 30% of candidates and 40% of candidates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">Let it just sit there, in case it is ever needed again.  That surely would be the more logical approach.  However, I think there is an embarrassment about what is being proposed here, because it is evidence of the nanny state and a kind of mentality about how politics should be controlled &mdash; this is why I use the phrase &ldquo;social engineering&rdquo; &mdash; to bring about a certain desired effect.  As I have said this is interposing between the people and the decision that only they have the right to make, namely, who they choose to put into politics.</P>
        <P>It would be much more appropriate for the parties to agree among themselves that they are going to operate certain gender quotas, but to link it with the issue of public funding is to <Col N="32"/>hijack the public purse and the public will in order to secure a particular political goal that does not reflect the aspiration of every single elector.  As it is related to the electoral process itself, there is something particularly invidious about that.  There is of course no problem with using public money to secure the objectives that are agreed by the political parties which constitute the governing majority at any one time.  However, that is a different thing.  That is using public money to pursue certain general policy objectives.  What is wrong with this is that it interferes with the electoral process itself.  That is the problem as I see it.</P>
        <P>A form of sunset clause has been provided for.  Perhaps at this point I should move my own amendment, which provides for a more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you for telling me that.  I will not say much about it, other than to say that I will not push it to a vote, but I will reserve the right to propose it on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>In response to the planned obsolescence that seems to be desired by the proponents of this legislation and by the Minister, and since there is such expressed embarrassment about the desirability and need for quotas <i>per se</i>, I propose a sunset clause whereby the relevant sections shall cease to be in operation after the polling day of the next general election held after the passing of this Act, unless we have a resolution by each House of the Oireachtas.  In other words, we should only permit the continuance of this arrangement if the Houses of the Oireachtas were willing to so decide.  I do not see why this should not find favour with the Minister because, as I stated, there is a reluctance, discomfort and a certain disquiet about this proposal.  Why else would Members propose that it be written out of legislation in the future?  At least, let us reflect this.  I am opposed to gender quotas <i>per se</i>.  If I am wrong on this or do not succeed in persuading the Minister, will he at least consider making the continuation of these arrangements subject to the need for ongoing resolutions by the Houses?  I hope we will be speaking about &ldquo;Houses&rdquo;, but sin sc&eacute;al eile go l&aacute; eile.</P>
        <P>On the last occasion it was pointed out to me helpfully by a colleague that there might have been an unintended element of racism in something I had said when I had spoken about why we should not focus our energies on securing a greater level of representation among the new Irish in Irish politics.  While the under-representation of women is regrettable and something I would like to see change, there is high quality representation by women of their views that might be considered distinctive but also in terms of their equal participation in politics.  Much has already been secured by those women involved in politics.  What is much more noticeable and what is not being addressed is how &ldquo;white&rdquo; and predominantly English-speaking these Houses are.  It is not their maleness that is the most obvious aspect for the person looking in from outside.  Of course, I accept there may be legal issues, where persons do not enjoy citizenship, in their not being in a position to run.  They might be able to vote in local elections but not in D&aacute;il elections.  This is a much more serious issue.</P>
        <P>The reason I mentioned taxi drivers was not in any way to suggest persons from certain strata of our society were exclusively in particular jobs.  I am quite aware that there are persons in every occupation and at every level from the category that we have designated as the new Irish, particularly from Africa and eastern Europe, but the point I am really trying to make is that in our society there are powerless ordinary persons who are very much in evidence on the streets and who do not seem to engage the minds of the great and the good in terms of the need to actively introduce them to politics and include them in political representation in these Houses.  I wanted to deal with any unintended implication of what I had said, that I was confin<Col N="33"/>ing members of certain national groups to particular roles or tasks within society.  I ask the Minister to consider the issue and state, if he is in a position to do so today, what the Government can offer on the issue of greater representation in politics of immigrant communities and the new Irish.  That is much more necessary than what is being proposed <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> gender quotas.</P><P Just="Left">Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to discuss a couple of important issues to do with the Bill covered in this group of amendments.  The two issues cover the idea of a sunset clause and extending the remit of the legislation to cover local and, potentially, Seanad elections.</P>
        <P>I will take up a couple of the points made by Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen who I am glad to hear supports the aim of ensuring greater participation by women in politics because for a while, I was not sure if he did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I made that clear on the last occasion also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Certainly, amendment No. 37 in his name is rather different from the sunset clause recommended by Senator Averil Power and in our 2009 report since it is his presumption that the legislation will not continue unless this is provided for by a resolution.</P>
        <P>Having listened carefully to Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen whom I did not interrupt, I want to make a couple of points.  All the legislation seeks to do &mdash; it is a moderate proposal &mdash; is to provide <Col N="34"/>targets for political parties when selecting election candidates.  It does not intervene between voters and candidates, rather it intervenes between political parties and the candidates they select.  The Senator speaks about the nanny state and restrictions on voter choice, but in the real world political parties are the gatekeepers in respect of voters&rsquo; choices.  As I documented in the 2009 report &mdash; it has been well documented also by Professor Galligan and others &mdash; under the current system there is quite a number of constituencies &mdash; five out of 43 in the 2007 elections &mdash; in which voters have not been able to vote for a woman.  There was no woman candidate on the slate in these five constituencies which, by the way, encompassed both rural and urban areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an obstruction which is presented largely by political parties in closing the gates to women candidates, not overtly or deliberately but because of the old boy culture and all those matters about which we have spoken which militate against women in either coming forward or being brought forward.  All the legislation seeks to do is ensure political parties will no longer hold the gates closed against women.  It does not impose any restriction on voters who may vote for whomsoever they wish.  It requires certain rules to be applied by political parties in the selection of candidates.</P>
        <P>The legislation is evidence based.  This is not a whimsical idea that we have plucked from the air.  It is based on solid evidence, comprehensive reports produced over many years.  It is based on the position in over 100 states that have adopted similar measures.  As Senator C&aacute;it Keane pointed out, unfortunately, it seems such measures are required to further women&rsquo;s participation in politics, either through voluntary adoption by political parties as has happened in some Scandinavian countries or by legislation.</P>
        <P>Moving to the issue of the sunset clause, certainly it is well established and there is nothing embarrassing about it.  One finds it in financial and medical authorisation legislation.  One also finds it in many areas of the law and it is not, in any way, an unusual idea.  It is also linked, when one speaks about gender laws, with temporary special measures to further participation of an under-represented group and it was in that spirit that we recommended a sunset clause in 2009.  As I mentioned on the last occasion, a recent report by the Inter-Parliamentary Union on gender sensitive parliaments refers to evidence, following the application of a sunset clause, of a falling back of levels in some countries, and this alarms me.  When we were carrying out research in 2009, the evidence was that when there was a critical mass, as had happened in Denmark, one could then move to operate a sunset clause and remove the quota rule.  Perhaps I am now a little more cautious.  While I agree in principle with the idea of a sunset clause, I can see there may be different evidence as more and more countries adopt legislation on quotas.  I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response.  Perhaps the issue of the sunset clause could be considered.</P>
        <P>Turning to the issue of the extension of the legislation to the local and Seanad elections, Senator Keane dealt very well with the Seanad issue.  In 2009 we did not recommend extension to the Seanad precisely because our focus was on political parties as gatekeepers and because the political parties are not the nominating bodies for the Seanad as this is for the vocational groups.  We did not have any sense that it would be practical to apply the legislation.  I know the political parties have a role but people have to be nominated by the vocational groups.</P>

	<P>As one who goes through the university panel, where people do not get nominated by anyone or rather they get nominated by ten graduates of the university, I <Col N="35"/>accept it is a very different system.

        <P>A further reason we did not consider this is that the IPU looks at the Lower House or the single House of Parliament, which was our focus.  This was also, frankly, because the Seanad has a much better record.  As we all know, 30% of our Members are now women and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nomination process effectively provides for a type of in-built voluntary target arrangement.  We did not see this as being as imperative here.</P>
        <P>In terms of the local elections, like Senator Keane, I would ask the Minister to reconsider this area.  I totally accept the point about funding and the difficulty of providing for a relevant and pertinent sanction.  It is not as clear-cut as with general elections.  However, it is very important that we would ensure greater numbers of women come forward in the local elections.  I was encouraged at the Dublin Castle conference on this issue in January that the general secretaries pointed out they would have to increase the numbers of women coming forward in the local elections in order to ensure they would reach the 30% quota for the general election.  We may find this will happen in practice but I would certainly like to find whether there was some way we could extend the principle to the local elections.</P>
        <P>In response to an earlier point, this is not top-down engineering of any kind.  A great deal of evidence has been gathered over many years by many groups nationally, not all in Dublin, such as the 50-50 group recently formed in Sligo and 50-50 by 2020 campaigns all over Ireland.  This is something women are pushing for.  I have been lobbied on this by many women, as I know have others.  It is not top-down.  There has been a great groundswell to which the political parties and the Minister have responded.  I pay him great credit for that.</P>

	<P>The reason I was waving was not to draw attention to my Standing Order 30 request but to get into the debate on this amendment.  While I completely respect the ruling of the Chair, I wonder what it would take to get a different ruling.  I remember proposing a matter in regard to an ESB strike where I was told from the Chair it was not a matter contemplated under that order or of national interest while, simultaneously, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, was declaring a national emergency in the other House.  In terms of transparency, we might look at the criteria by which these decisions are made.  We are all in favour of transparency with regard to female participation in the Oireachtas and all the rest but it should apply everywhere.</P>
        <P>I am all in favour of sunset clauses.  Senator Bacik has said quite a lot of what I would have said.  Senator Mullen was probably in the House when one or two of them were introduced.  I can certainly remember such legislation going through, including one Bill dealing with the architectural profession.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree it is social engineering, of which I am all in favour.  I look forward to the day when there are no such things as gay organisations or gay pubs because they should not be necessary.  All citizens should have equal access wherever they go.  I did not get into that particular game in order to be a gay activist for the rest of my life.  In fact, I am well out of it by now and I am only a kind of fringe participant.  It is a perfectly reasonable thing to want to engineer society in a progressive way and it is then a measure of success when it wastes away and withers on the vine.  I have no problem with that whatever.  If a sunset clause applied to that particular newspaper, I would look forward to the setting of that sun.</P>
        <P>I wonder if it was not perhaps a delicacy on the part of Senator Bacik when she said she did not include the Seanad.  Perhaps it was in deference to the local correspondent of <i>The Sun</i>, Mr. Enda Kenny, who has an <i>id&eacute;e fixe </i>about abolishing the Seanad.  It would have been a bit of an <Col N="36"/>embarrassment if the Government side supported amendments which indicated a desire for the continuation of Seanad &Eacute;ireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>He has muddied the waters quite a bit by talking about members of other communities and other languages.  My mother disdained politics but she was fluent in French, Swahili and Kikongo.  Had she been elected to this House or been nominated by the Taoiseach of the day, it would not have been very sensible for her to display her talents at Kikongo or Swahili.  English and Irish are perfectly good languages for the conduct of business.  I regret the fact so few of us are fluent in what is technically the first national language, which is hardly ever spoken here.  I remember a Senate in which the most qualified group in the first national tongue were on these benches &mdash; almost every single one of us had some Irish and some of my colleagues were native speakers.  It would be absurd to look for a plurality of languages, including Polish.  If people are citizens, they should know the language that is used by the people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My real reason for standing up is to indicate that because it deals with the allocation of funds to political parties, I want to raise an allied matter and signal that I may put down an amendment for Report Stage.  I declare an interest.  As Senator Bacik has indicated the position with regard to the university seats, I will deal with that matter first.  I am very proud of the fact the university seats, as long as I have been in this House, have exceeded any other section of either House of the Oireachtas in regularly providing 33.33% representation in that there has always been a woman representative.  They have been very fine and remarkable women, including Ms Carmencita Hederman, Senator Bacik and Dr. Mary Robinson.  I am proud of the record of the universities in that regard.  They have all tended to be Independents, although occasionally people take a vagary and disappear over to the other side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is more than a vagary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever it is, a specific situation arises in this regard.  Here, again, we have the parties looking after themselves with regard to the allocation of funds.  What about independence?  What about people who have to reach into their own pockets?  It is an abrogation of democracy that political parties get funding from the taxpayer as if we were not all taxpayers.   Why not give consideration to people who are so committed to a life of public service that they use their own resources?  I admit a personal interest but there are other people throughout the country with exactly the same personal interest.</P>
        <P>There is one way around this, which should perhaps be explored.  My full-time professional occupation, as is true of a number of others in the House, is politics.  I am a full-time Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and I devote sometimes 16 to 18 hours a day to the work in this House &mdash; that is the degree of my commitment to it.  However, I get no funding for election expenses while political parties get their funding, which they can distribute among their candidates, to say nothing of toners, ink and all the rest.  Why should I or other Independent candidates not be permitted to write off the election expenses, which are a necessary and vital part of the continuation of a political career, against income tax?  Will the Minister comment?  Would he say this is fair?</P>

	<P>I am just asking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I know that.  The Senator was interrupting because she is in a political party.  She would not have interrupted before she was in a political party.  I am drawing attention to the fact that the amount of State funding allocated to a qualified political party is specifically referenced.  I am using this provision as a device to introduce something that is of vital importance to the democratic character of our Parliament.  I make no apology to Senator Bacik or anybody else for so doing, unless the Cathaoirleach imposes a restriction on me in this regard.  There is that phrase and I am entitled to tease it out.  We are talking about the allocation of funds only to political parties and I am signalling that I propose to put down an amendment.  Again, this is about the party interest.  Senator Bacik may have the party interest at heart now, but there was a time when that was not the case.</P>
        <P>I retain and will always retain my independence.  The encouragement of independence is a very good thing.  I have to laugh at the proposals for protecting whistleblowers which are blowing about the place.  The Minister should take that legislation back to his friends in Cabinet and ask them how it will work in a newspaper&rsquo;s editorial office.  I can tell him it will not.  One reason he is trying to close this place down is that there are a few whistleblowers here.  We have always made life uncomfortable for the Government, regardless of the party or parties in power.  As the most outspoken of all, the university Senators were the first to be targeted.  When the Government could not get us, it went for the Senate in its entirety.  I will use every tactic I can to prevent that happening and to strengthen the independence of the House.  We need Independent voices in this Chamber.  I am giving notice of my intention to table an amendment in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik, who is a woman of outstanding intellect and clarity, made many of the points I would have made in response to Senator Mullen.  I will not bother going <i>in extenso</i> into those issues.  I do not consider this an intervention in terms of the electoral system.  Rather, it is an intervention regarding the selection of candidates.  I have put my cards on the table in indicating that I am in favour of social engineering.  For example, regrettable as it was that they were necessary, busing and racial quotas in universities and so on were important in the United States.  Uncomfortable and awkward as they were, they helped to achieve what was necessary in a pluralist society.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate.  I am not sure whether we are allowed to admit that we are enjoying ourselves in this Chamber, but I have found it a hugely enjoyable discussion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not allowed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I say that without irony.  It is an educational and historic debate and I have enjoyed hearing Members&rsquo; views.</P>
        <P>While my colleagues and I have not tabled an amendment to that effect, something should be done in regard to local elections.  I listened with interest to Senator Keane&rsquo;s observations in this regard.  The Bill does not require quotas to be applied at local level as political experience is one of the most important criterion in the selection of candidates by political parties.  Women make up only some 16% of councillors, which is a cause for concern.  The Bill does not make <Col N="38"/>provision for sanctions for political parties who do not reach a quota at local level, perhaps in order to encourage voluntary action.  There is a sense in which parties are being put on notice that if they do not increase their quota of female candidates over time, the issue may be reviewed.  The Bill should be about encouragement as much as anything else, and perhaps we can find some way to incorporate that.  In the case of State bodies and non-governmental organisations, there is an expectation that each gender should make up at least 40% of board members.  That might be the way to proceed in this Bill.  I reserve the right to introduce an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>While I am in agreement with both Senators Power and Mullen regarding the sunset clause, my sense is that we should not have such a clause in the Bill.  This is partly because I am hopeful that at a certain point a 40% participation rate by women will be achieved.  The Minister mentioned that percentage being attained seven years after the next general election.  We should consider reducing that timeframe on Report Stage.  Consideration should also be given to including a requirement that 40% of candidates be men.  A sunset clause would undermine the notion that there might be a time when men become less engaged in politics.  As such, I am not necessarily in favour of Senator Power&rsquo;s amendment in that regard.</P>
        <P>In terms of Seanad reform, I recognise the difficulties arising from the fact that political parties do not necessarily have the power, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin realised last summer, to dictate which members of a party will become the official candidates.  In other words, the control regarding quotas may not be within the gift of a political leader.  I suggest that any future bicameral model that might emerge out of the Seanad reform debate should include a provision regarding quotas.  If the parties do become gate keepers within a future bicameral model, that requirement should be established now rather than having to introduce another Bill at a later date.  In a scenario where the Seanad might not be abolished, there should be some model that encourages political parties to ensure that each gender makes up a certain percentage of candidates.  It may be the case that 30% is a more reasonable target than 40% in the case of the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate on this substantial legislation, although the Minister might feel he has heard it all before.  A political lesson from this discussion for us in the Seanad is that we might be better to revert to the former way of doing business whereby speakers had as much time as they wished on Second Stage rather than the new restrictions of five or ten minutes or whatever.  If we could revert to the old days where people had 20 or 30 minutes to contribute, it might avoid some of the interventions we have seen on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The amendments we are discussing are interesting.  I am sure the Minister recognises that all comments made here are made with good intent.  Senator Bacik made an interesting observation in response to a question as to why this rule will apply to political parties.  She said the parties function both as gate ways and as road blocks to women&rsquo;s participation in politics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Gatekeepers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is the case that the political parties are the road blocks and the measures being imposed on them in this legislation are the gate ways, it would imply that Independents do not need that gate way and never faced that road block.  However, this does not necessarily reflect reality.  In the Seanad elections last year, for example, 14 men and six women stood for election on the Trinity panel.  On the NUI panel, 22 of the candidates were male and five were female.  I am not sure what is the road block and what is the gate way.  Of the large numbers of Independent candidates who stand in every constituency in local elections, <Col N="39"/>general elections and European elections, the vast majority are male.  We must ask ourselves whether it is as simple as saying that political parties are somehow the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what I said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the question.  We are seeking to solve the problem of low female participation rates by placing an imposition on political parties.  I am asking whether we are seeking to solve the wrong problem.</P>
        <P>I go back to the question of culture.  Senator Power said that the quota regime which we are putting in place will hopefully lead to a change in culture.  I would like to see that process happening in reverse.  I mentioned some of the strong, powerful women who have played leading roles in politics internationally.  One of those I forgot to mention is a woman who served with me in both D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann and was, during my time in the Oireachtas, by far the strongest, most powerful and most effective voice for women.  I am referring to the late Nuala Fennell who was an outstanding representative and a kind, generous and warm lady.  One of the reasons hers was the strongest voice was it was not bitter or divisive, rather it was inclusive, which forced us to look at the difficult options and take the necessary steps to resolve issues.</P>
        <P>The question of culture is so important in this debate.  I was reading the late Nuala Fennell&rsquo;s biography recently.  She was forced to resign from the Irish Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement, a movement in which she had played such a significant role during its formative years.  Her letter of resignation stated, &ldquo;For one thing it has proved that Irish women, for all the discrimination and deprivation they suffer, are not the nation of blinkered female donkeys that the small policy-making central group of women&rsquo;s liberationists thought them to be.&rdquo;  That is very interesting and a challenge to look beyond simplistic, sloganeering solutions and recognise that this is a much more complex problem than we think it is and that can be resolved by minor legislation.  Her letter of resignation further stated, &ldquo;At a recent seminar it was clearly stated that if any member, whatever her previous views, was not against the aforementioned Bill, she was not in Women&rsquo;s Lib, and to this I can add that if you are not anti-American, anti-clergy, anti-government, anti-ICA, anti-police, anti-men, then, sisters, there is no place for you either.&rdquo;  That is a piece of writing on which we need to reflect.  We should not try to put people into simplistic, caged in categories.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a simplistic statement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Those of us who have questions, queries and concerns about the Bill are coming from a genuine perspective.  We also want to see many more women involved in the political process, but it is not as simple as introducing legislation.</P>
        <P>Wearing his previous hat as a Fine Gael organisational person of renown, the Minister successfully suggested during the last local elections that Fine Gael would run at least one female candidate in each urban council area.  That did not require legislation, penalties or awards.  It was simply decided and done by the political party and it worked very well.  I would like to see it happen in the next set of local elections also.  It was a practical, common-sense measure that worked.  No one was accused of being a token candidate.  Many of the additional female candidates won seats and many of them will seek higher office in time.</P>
        <P>We have to remain open-minded on the Bill.  I am certainly happy with the idea that there be a sunset clause in order that quotas would come to an end after a couple of elections, but it goes back to the question of culture.  That is the debate that needs to take place.  The mechanism would be in place for Seanad elections also, if we really believed in it.  If we can impose regulations and rules on political parties for who they can run in elections, the same regulations <Col N="40"/>and rules could apply to nominating bodies.  No one in the country is outside the law.  Between 30% and 40% of candidates in Seanad elections are selected by Oireachtas parties.  Therefore, such a provision could be put in place.  If we want to apply this provision to Seanad elections, we can.  We will certainly have to apply it to local elections, but in a voluntary fashion, as was done very successfully without huge fanfare by Fine Gael during the last town council elections.</P>
        <P>I know that Senator David Norris has raised the question of independence from the perspective of the allocation of funding.  That is a matter for another day, although we addressed part of it in considering an earlier part of the Bill.  It is certainly worth considering why so few women stand as independent candidates.  Every independent candidate faces much greater difficulty in being elected than a member of a political party, yet for every three or four females who face the electorate as independent candidates, there are ten or 20 males.  That shows it is not simply a question of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Working as I do in a world in which female colleagues predominate, in a specialty that will soon be female dominated in Ireland, judging by the welcome increase in the number of female medical students, I would also welcome an increase in the participation <Col N="41"/>of women in the political process.  It would make our political system a lot more mature and there would be much higher levels of emotional intelligence if more women were involved.</P>
        <P>When one looks for international precedents, one is reminded of the Northern Ireland Women&rsquo;s Coalition which, when the rest of that society was often blindly following testosterone soaked, gun toting goons around the country, was espousing a vision of the future that was more rational and mature.  One also thinks of the mothers of the disappeared in Argentina, one of the greater foci of opposition to authoritarian military dictatorship in what was then a very oppressed country.  One also thinks of the Peace Movement of Northern Ireland &mdash; the peace women &mdash; which, at a time when it was very unfashionable to do so, led the cause for a peaceful alternative to the internecine sectarian strife that was destroying the community.   Every one of the organisations mentioned would not be funded under the new legislation.  They would effectively be legislated out of existence because they are single gender organisations which would not meet the requirement to have a minimum number of men.  Therein lies the weakness with this attempt to impose by fiat something which is desirable but which should come about by other means.  Effectively, what we are doing is handing power to the Government or a majority in the D&aacute;il to determine the nominations process of minority political parties, which is wrong.  This is bad for democracy, smacks of tokenism and will not work.  Instead political parties should reform themselves and acknowledge that they would do better if they had a more representative spectrum with more female candidates emerging.</P>
      <TimeSt down="3" idown="3">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Until recently, the best health spokesperson with whom I had the occasion to interact during the years &mdash; as the House is aware, I am very supportive of the Minister &mdash; was a female who, sadly, was never appointed Minister, former Deputy Liz McManus, who would have made a fine Minister for Health.  Equally, the person I honestly reckon was the least satisfactory as Minister for Health and Children was also a woman, although I will not personalise the issue.  Ability cuts across the gender divide.  It is, therefore, incumbent on politicial parties to pick the best candidates.  This legislation will, however, impose by fiat something which, at its core, is anti-democratic.  Therefore, I oppose it.</P>

	<P>In response to Senator Paul Bradford, we all agree that there are other barriers to women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  The excellent document furnished to us by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service also set out the ways by which these barriers could be addressed.  However, what we are talking about is the funding of political parties, not the other barriers women face in terms of their participation in political life.</P>
        <P>Senator Ivana Bacik is correct.  Any student of Irish politics from 1922 onwards would be able to tell us categorically that political parties is where it is at.  I agree that Senators such as Senator David Norris are excellent and have made excellent contributions, but the fact of the matter is that most of the legislation placed before the Government, the Upper House and the Lower House is presented by political parties and that if one wants to influence what happens in the country, one has to do so through a political party.</P>
        <P>I want to address the issue of a sunset clause.  We cannot always assume society is on an upward trajectory.  I refer to a recent &ldquo;Newsnight&rdquo; programme on female genital mutilation in Egypt on which a number of those interviewed stated they were concerned that the change in party representation in Egypt was leading to a position where there would be a rowing back on the commitment to guard against female genital mutilation.  The reality is that having sunset clauses is all very fine, but I agree with Senator Fiach Mac Conghail and I would draw the attention of Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen&rsquo;s to this were he present in the House.  A sunset clause would protect the participation of both men and women, to which Senator John Crown alluded.  There are certain professions that one could describe has having been feminised; however, it is not in the interests of society to have one sex over-represented, whether it be male or female.  No more than I do want to see the political profession dominated by women, I do not want to see the teaching and medical professions dominated by women also.  I am not in favour, therefore, of having a sunset clause.  In an ideal world we would end up with 50:50 representation.  There is nothing to stop us revisiting legislation in the future, but we should not commit ourselves to introducing a sunset clause, as it would not be in our interests to do so.  Unfortunately, the evidence is all too clear that we are not on an upward trajectory.</P>

	<P>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen is no longer with us.  I concur with the response Senator Ivana Bacik gave at the time.  Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen stated voters elected whomever they wanted to elect.  Frankly, they do not.  I think it shows an extraordinary misunderstanding of the political process.  Voters select candidates from the list of persons they are given.  As Senator Ivana Bacik pointed out, in several constituencies in the last general election people were not given a choice to chose candidates on gender grounds.</P>
        <P>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen suggests Members are embarrassed by quotas.  I am not.  I am embarrassed that 15% is the highest level of female representation ever achieved in an election to the D&aacute;il.  I am also embarrassed that there are constituencies in which there have been no women on the ticket.  I am embarrassed that two general elections ago my party put up four candidates in one constituency all of whom were men, but I am certainly not embarrassed about bringing progressive legislation through the House.  As I stated on Second Stage, it is a necessary evil, although I wish we did not have to do so.  Everybody who has spoken in favour of it has made the same point.</P>
        <P>In respect of local elections, I have made the point that they are an important process in giving persons an opportunity to gain political experience prior to participating in general elections.  It is also important to look at local elections, not just as a pipeline for entry to national politics but also in their own right.  When local authorities are making decisions on <Col N="43"/>such issues as planning applications and the provision of local facilities such as a playground, it is important that there be balanced representation and a mix of views at the table.  Local authorities, apart from their role in giving persons opportunities to gain political experience, should be representative.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s reply, but I am confident that the way the amendment is worded meets the purpose and would amend the political funding Act in the appropriate way.</P>
        <P>In respect of Seanad elections, Members are elected through various routes.  I came through one of the vocational panels, but I was nominated by other Oireachtas Members on what they called the inside list.  For the benefit of Members who are elected through other routes such as the universities and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Paul Bradford pointed out, at least one third of Members are elected through the vocational panels and nominated directly by political parties because of the mechanism in place.  Within each of the five panels one third of those elected must be nominated by the nominating bodies and one third must be nominated through the Oireachtas.  There is a large number of persons elected to the House who are directly chosen by parties.  The legislation applies to decisions political parties make in choosing candidates for D&aacute;il elections.  There is no practical reason it should not apply to those selected by their parties through the inside list.  I appreciate, however, that there would be practical difficulties in the case of the nominating bodies, some of which only nominate one candidate.</P>
        <P>There are practical issues.  Senator C&aacute;it Keane raised the case of Portmarnock Golf Club.  I read about it and know it ultimately fell because the Equal Status Act provided a precise exemption of which the golf club was able to avail by stating it had been set up specifically for that purpose.  The case was also informed by case law that the guarantee of equality under the Constitution could not be asserted against a private institution.  While Senator Ivana Bacik&rsquo;s knowledge of these issues is far superior to mine, that is my understanding of the case.  Senator C&aacute;it Keane raised this issue in referring to what might present a difficulty in the case of Seanad elections.  For a start, one cannot assert equality rights against a private institution and, presumably, also a political party.  As to whether the State, by setting incentives for parties, is getting involved in the process, this is something the Minister has thought through.  If it is constitutional in respect of other aspects of the Bill, it should follow that it has to be so in respect of the amendments we are proposing in regard to Seanad elections.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take on board the good points made on the sunset clause.  I will reflect on them before Report Stage and will not push the matter to a vote today.  As Senator Ivana Bacik said, earlier research shows that what we need is a change in culture.  We hope other measures would not be necessary afterwards.  That is still my instinct, but I will reflect on what Senator Aideen Hayden and others said.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="44"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief as I am conscious of the time and also that others have been making Second Stage speeches, as Senator Aideen Hayden said.  This is not the time to do so.  </P>
        <P>On the specific points raised, I am grateful to Senator Averil Power for referring to the sunset clause.  I will reconsider the most recent evidence on whether it would be wise to include a sunset clause if there is a fear there has been be a falling back and that the culture has not been given enough time to change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In response to Senator Paul Bradford, we have rehearsed this debate many times.  Of course, legislation is not the only solution to the problem of increasing women&rsquo;s participation and I am sure people are fed up hearing about the obstructions facing women, be they Independents or party members.  Whatever about the five Cs, there are four Cs that affect all women in trying to enter politics &mdash; cash, culture, child care and confidence.  The candidate selection procedures apply specifically to political parties; that is the specific obstacle being tackled.  Political parties are not the obstacle.  I have said they are the gatekeepers, although that is not my phrase - it is the phrase used in the international research.  They are the gatekeepers who can open or close a gate to political participation by women.  That is why they are targeted in the legislation.</P>
        <P>On the Portmarnock Golf Club case, there is a question about how one sanctions a private organisation.  The Bill, as we recommended, clearly has State funding for political parties as the sanction or incentive to ensure targets are met.  That is the key point.  It would be very difficult to do this in the case of other organisations.  This is the difficulty in the case of Seanad elections.  Our report recommended the extension of the principle to European elections because, of course, political parties nominate in the same way as they do for general elections.  There is the same difficulty in the case of local elections in deciding on sanctions.  It is a matter worth mentioning.</P>
        <P>I am interested to hear Senator John Crown is in a female dominated world.  I was not aware women were in the majority among consultants in the medical profession.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I conducted research in 2003 and we published the first study in Ireland of gender discrimination in the legal profession.  We found that while well over two thirds of all law students nationally were women who have been in the majority since the mid-1980s, they were a tiny minority at the top levels of the profession.  I suspect the same is true of the medical profession.  What this legislation is trying to do is tackle what we call the pipeline factor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>On what Senator Aideen Hayden said about independence, it is lost when one joins a party.  The dogs in the street, perhaps the donkeys or jennets in the street and in this House, know perfectly well that Senator Ivana Bacik was the subject of a gerrymander in seeking to become a candidate in a constituency in Dublin in favour of a male candidate.  That is the reality of party life.  If Senator Aideen Hayden does not know this, she will soon find out.</P>

	<P>I knew Nuala Fennell well.  When I came into the House, I thought the Senator was talking about Nuala O&rsquo;Faolain and nearly dropped dead at the throught she might have said such a thing.  Then I thought Nuala was always such a wonderful contrarian.  I spoke at meetings of the Irish Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement and presume it had a vague notion that I was a man of some sort.  There was an idea that it was anti-man, anti-Irish Countrywomen&rsquo;s Association, anti-police and anti-America.  We are all familiar with the notion that if one criticises American foreign policy, one is anti-American.  It is a load of rubbish about a woman who, despite her sterling qualities, was essentially conservative.  It is important to make the point that she was making a highly coloured statement, but it is a wonderful quotation.  I gather it was on the forcible entry Bill, but I do not believe it applies in this instance.  I would be surprised, conservative though she was, if Nuala Fennell would have wished it to apply in these circumstances.  The Irish Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement, like all such movements, as I know to my cost, contains extremists who are not representative of the whole movement.  Without women&rsquo;s liberation, we would not have the degree of participation we have.</P>
        <P>I also spoke to the Women&rsquo;s Political Association.  I launched a book for Senator Ivana Bacik, although I was a man.  Does the Senator remember that I launched the book?</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> Notes the adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, on 13 December 2011, of the Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA. Among wide-ranging provisions in relation to criminal offences and sanctions in the area of sexual abuse and exploitation of children, the Directive requires all EU Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure the prompt removal of any webpages containing or disseminating child abuse material hosted on servers within their jurisdiction. The Directive also, with appropriate safeguards, permits Member States to take measures to block access to internet users within their territory of webpages containing or disseminating child abuse material hosted on servers outside their jurisdiction.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> Notes that while Ireland has arrangements in place to secure the removal of child abuse material on domestic servers, and reports material found outside the jurisdiction via the INHOPE network, Ireland has not sanctioned a system which would allow the same material hosted overseas to be blocked, where removal proves difficult or takes an unreasonable length of time.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> Recognises that &ldquo;[C]hild abuse images are not just images. Despite the fact that most of them can be found in a &ldquo;virtual world&rdquo;, one must never forget that behind every image, there is at least one child who has been sexually abused in real life. Child abuse images involve a series of crimes ranging from the solicitation, corruption or trafficking of children for sexual purposes and various forms of sexual abuse perpetrated on children, to the distribution, collection and consultation of images of the abuse committed.&rdquo; [Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, Report of the Social, Health and Family Affairs Committee, &ldquo;Combating &lsquo;child abuse images&rsquo; through committed, transversal and internationally co-ordinated action, Doc 12720, 19 September 2011].</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> Recalls with approval Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on 28 September 1992 and welcomes that Ireland promotes and supports activities aimed at the removal of webpages containing or disseminating child abuse material in Ireland and shares this information with other EU countries through the INHOPE network and through cooperation with Europol and Interpol.</P>
        <P LI="1">Calls on the Minister for Justice and Equality to:</P>
        <P LI="2">1. Commit to bring forward a proposal to Government to ratify the United Nations Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, signed by Ireland on 7 September 2000;</P><Col N="48"/>
        <P LI="2">2. Commit to bring forward a proposal to Government to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, signed by Ireland on 25 October 2007;</P>
        <P LI="2">3. Bring forward legislation, without delay, to implement the Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, which, legislation should:</P>
        <P LI="3"><i>a</i>) Underpin efforts to combat sexual abuse and the sexual exploitation of children and child abuse material in cyber space;</P>
        <P LI="3"><i>b</i>) Ensure a victim identification database and management system is in place which is directed at identifying child victims, prosecuting offenders and disrupting crime networks;</P>
        <P LI="3"><i>c</i>) Underpin measures already in place which seek to ensure the removal of webpages containing child abuse material hosted in Ireland;</P>
        <P LI="3"><i>d</i>) Direct that Irish internet service providers put in place a system whereby child abuse material, as defined by Section 2(1) of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, hosted overseas be blocked where removal proves difficult or is likely to take an unreasonable length of time; and</P>
        <P LI="3" Just="Left"><i>e</i>) Be guided by transparent procedures and provide adequate safeguards, in particular to ensure that the restriction is limited to what is necessary and proportionate, and that users are informed of the reason for the restriction.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to the House.  Having had the pleasure of working with the Minister when Opposition spokesperson on children, I am confident of his commitment to children&rsquo;s rights and child protection.  I am happy he is here to debate this important motion tabled by the Independent group.</P>
        <P>This motion is about child pornography as clearly defined under section 2 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  The definition in the Act includes any visual representation that shows a child engaged in or being witness to explicit sexual activity and where the dominant characteristic of visual representation is the depiction for a sexual purpose of the genital or anal region of a child.  Child abuse material on the Internet is child pornography, but it is also so much more than a single definition can encompass.  The image or depiction is a culmination of, at best one and more than likely a series, of the most serious criminal offences known to the Statute Book, including rape, incest, assault, sadism and bestiality.  For each child abuse image produced, it can be expected that numerous offences are committed, as the online distribution of child abuse images exponentially multiplies the number of offences against the integrity of the child.  A child abuse image is a crime scene.  It is a digital record of sexual abuse being perpetrated against a child.</P>
        <P>According to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, a staggering 69% of the victims depicted in child abuse images are under the age of ten.  The sheer depravity and calculation of the offenders is such that they are increasingly targeting children at pre-speaking age because they cannot articulate the abuse they are experiencing.  Shockingly, we were told by an Interpol officer at our briefing last week that some of the children depicted in these images are so young that the nub of their umbilical cord is still visible.</P>
        <P>Why are we proposing blocking?  One can say that is not where all child abuse is happening.  Statistics show how abuse is often by somebody trusted and known to the child.  It happens in <Col N="49"/>the home by a close relative or a trusted family friend.  The State should put its resources towards ensuring those children are protected.  I also acknowledge that much of the exchange of information of this child abuse material happens off the Internet via other web devices such as FTP protocols, and this is where Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na resources need to be targeted.  Our motion is to ensure that this crime can be blocked so that all our resources do not go towards this.</P>
        <P>The motion is intended to address a specific reality, that there is a significant volume of requests made to access child abuse material on the Internet, intentionally or accidentally, through standard web pages throughout the world.  In Norway, which has a slightly bigger population than Ireland and which has blocking in place, they get 12,000 requests a day for these pages, that is, approximately 4.5 million requests a year.  In New Zealand, which has it in place, from February 2010 to November 2011, they blocked 13.5 million requests.  In the UK, BT&rsquo;s network alone blocks 40,000 requests a day.</P>
        <P>Some say its prevalence is decreasing on the Internet.  To give the House an idea of figures of what we speak, in 1995, which often is considered year zero for the Internet as the boom had not fully erupted, Interpol calculated there were 4,000 child abuse images worldwide.  Recent figures suggest that the number has multiplied considerably.  Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre&rsquo;s database states that there are 850,000 distinct child abuse images stored in the UK alone.  It is not an issue of us trying to block a small number.</P>
        <P>I do not contend that blocking will sort it all out, but it sends a strong signal.  Removal at source is the best solution, and where we can do that, as Ireland is trying to do, I support it.  However, where material is hosted on sites outside the jurisdiction, it is not within our power to ensure removal at source.  We are forced to rely on other jurisdictions applying the same standard for removal at source as we apply in Ireland.  The difficulty can be in rogue states where co-operation is not forthcoming or where it is not done in a reasonable time.</P>
        <P>The blocking proposed in our motion would give us this control and ensure there is consistency in our policy on child abuse material on the Internet.  It would send out a clear message that child abuse material, whether its source is domestic or foreign, will not be tolerated in Ireland.  This deterrent value cannot be overstated.</P>
        <P>I do not believe we know the full extent of child abuse material available in Ireland given the lack of public awareness of <i>www.hotline.ie</i>, where the public can report suspected illegal content encountered on the Internet.</P>
        <P>From our research of this issue in preparation for today, it is very much a spiral of abuse that takes place which starts with curiosity, but it has been proven to be a progressive descent, from curiosity to becoming a trader.  If one was trying to equate it to something else, on the road here each day there is a new speed sign that tells me if I am going over the speed limit and it deters me, and I slow down.  Every time it works.  It is about having a deterrent.</P>
        <P>Those countries blocking are: Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy, Malta, the UK, Australia and New Zealand.  All the mobile phone operators in Ireland are blocking as part of an EU agreement.  The UK, as I stated, is blocking.  That means Northern Ireland is blocking all of this child abuse material.</P>
        <P>I want to share a case with the House.  It came to light 14 months ago.  It is a case where a child abuse image came to the attention of the US authorities as part of a domestic child pornography investigation.  The image depicted a two year old victim who was unknown to the US victim identification database.  A member of the investigation team recognised in the background of the image that a doll was not a traditional doll but a Dutch doll, and they contacted the Dutch authorities.  The Dutch authorities broadcast an image of the face of the child and the parents came forward.  On investigation, they found that a 27 year old male nursery worker was perpetrating the crime of abuse against that child.  On further investigation <Col N="50"/>&mdash; they had to call all the parents together to a hotel on a Sunday afternoon to tell them their children may have been at risk in this child care place &mdash; the accused man has admitted to abusing 87 children aged two and a half and younger.  His partner is accused of facilitating child abuse and distributing this material, and an additional 11 men are accused of having shared and distributed the images.  The case will go to trial this year.  This one image led to 87 child victims being identified, which is why a victim identification database is so important.</P>
        <P>We tabled the motion here today, not because we do not acknowledge that there are other child protection measures that the State needs to have in place.  We need to ensure we put a focus there.  We also need to focus on child abuse within the home or by trusted family members or friends of the family in the off-web services.  However, we need to ensure that child abuse material that continues to be traded and transmitted over the Internet is blocked.  The fact that a child knows or believes images of his or her abuse remains and continues to be spread on the Internet can lead to an increased feeling of helplessness.  We must say to children that we do not accept these images on the Internet and we do not accept what has happened to them.  We must send a clear signal that we want to prevent any further publication of these images.  That, for me, is the real reason behind this motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If child abuse images are on the Internet, Irish people are looking at them and we need to block them.  When we block them, what will come up is a simple page stating that this is illegal and one may e-mail an address that follows because one needs to ensure it is transparent and in line.  In Norway and New Zealand where they did this, the number of e-mails received was zero.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieLouiseODonnell"><NameTxt>Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Images of children on the web being abused or in the act of abuse are real, plentiful and profoundly evil.  They harm and destroy the children concerned for life.  According to Interpol, 4% of these children are under two years, 20% are between three and six years, 45% are between seven and ten, and 30% are between 11 and 15 years.  What is done to the child can never be erased, eradicated, washed away or made to vanish.  The images of abuse are, therefore, cemented in the souls, hearts and minds of the children for all time.  They will also be present on the Internet for all time.  The children are captured, abused and caught in the abuse through a camera moving, through a camera still or through an image superimposed.  Images of children are published and they are then defined for life by these.  That is probably the most important point I am going to make.  These child-abusive pornographic images never go away and can never disappear unless we take action.  They roam the world of the web like horrific evils.  Even when the child depicted has grown up and tried all his or her life to find a route to another world where these gruesome abuse images do not exist, these images continue to roam and route their way to other screens, other screeners, other abusive sinners and other casual, informed or syndicated watchers.</P>
        
        <P>Each time an image is viewed, a child is abused once again, with a new and defined force.  Those who may witness or watch such images, whether by chance or deliberation, are witnessing crime scenes.  They are also offenders and are aiding and abetting the repetition of the crime.  We must do everything possible to stop the distribution of these images.  The private, public and unconscionable abuse of children of three years of age and younger sometimes masquerades on the Internet as a kind of public entertainment.  In the absence of legislation to stop this, the web will alter &mdash; it is already beginning to do so &mdash; the structure of our interests and the things about which we think.  The web can also present awful images as being normal.  Such images suggest a reality about and around children which allows those who look at them <Col N="51"/>to believe that this is how children want to be perceived or viewed.  Children have no power to stop this.  I am reminded of a quote from Karl Marx, &ldquo;As individuals express their life, so they are.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The images to which I refer are without boundaries and without dimension.  What we are dealing with is what John Milton referred to as &ldquo;paradise lost&rdquo;.  Child pornography is the greatest evil and it generates more money than the oil industry.  That is what makes this debate relevant.  To be obliged to address such an issue in the Seanad takes my breath away.  Such is the seriousness of this motion, however, it must be expressed in the kind of language which can expose those who perpetrate crimes of this type against children.  We must legislate to introduce the kind of methods by which we can find a way into the realms of technopoly and technocracy and then stop, block and remove the material to which I refer.  Technology is now a kind of fulfilment: it is creativity, it is a purpose but, unfortunately, it is also pornographic.  For all our lives, there is now a technological alternative.  What happens with the images to which I refer is that ever-increasing numbers of them are subjected to generation storing and distribution in more convenient ways and at greater speeds than ever before.  In essence, what is happening is an elevation of this kind of information to some sort of acceptable, metaphysical level.</P>
        <P>The quest to access the information to which I refer is as horrifying as the images themselves.  What we are trying to do in the form of this motion is bring about the introduction of legislation to stop such horror running amok.  At present, we have reached a kind of dysfunctional level and there has been a breakdown in the control mechanisms.  Information without regulation is lethal.  To the perpetrators of horrific abuse crimes against children, the accommodation &mdash; in the absence of suitable controls or blocks &mdash; of web pages is something of a wayward licence or gift.  It should, of course, be the direct opposite.  Child pornography takes its authorisation from and finds its perverted satisfaction in technology.  It also takes its orders from technology and creates its own continued and uncontrolled perversion through technology.  It is these aspects of the problem to which Senator van Turnhout and I are trying to put a halt through encouraging the introduction of legislation.</P>
        <P>Sexuality is the new truth.  It is also a new form of truth-telling.  We are accepting its availability and its infusion into all we do without knowing we are doing so.  The world of pornography is only a small step away.  It would not be so relevant if that were not the case.  One&rsquo;s sexuality is now everybody&rsquo;s business, intimacy is now public and the computer is now a kind of meta-medium.  Child pornography not only directs our knowledge of the world but also our ways of knowing.  It is all show business and we are beginning not to be able to separate the awful from the unconscionable.</P>
        <P>Abuse of children on the Internet, presented to anybody and all in the guise of knowing, sexually-enticing adults entirely comfortable in the milieu of eroticism, is outrageous. Our tolerance for humiliation is becoming inexhaustible and the boundaries of our behaviour are becoming broader, whether it is in respect of clothes, food games or entertainment.  We are all moving towards a uniformity and sameness of style and our tolerance for pornographic language is following this.  There are no secrets left in the context of language and meaning.  The latter are both used by adults and children with the same ease and violence.  We live quite well in highly sexualised excitement.  Sex and sexuality are no longer adult mysteries.  They are available to everyone, like mouthwash or under-arm deodorant.</P>
        <P>The leap to child pornography, while humanly outrageous, does not seem that surprising.  If we have become used to and comfortable with such displays of soft pornography, the adult child becomes a kind of aspiration and childhood begins to disappear.  It is now merely a matter of how one wants to state the problem.  The fading distinction between childhood and adult<Col N="52"/>hood is nowhere more evident than in the abuse of children within pornography.  The onset of the world of technopoly and technocracy &mdash; the great and gifted world wide web &mdash; has opened the door for the very worst of human crimes, namely, those against the innocence of children.  The great and good world wide web has forged and honed crimes against child humanity which are difficult to detect, extremely difficult to police and even more difficult either to control or bring to an end.  Blocking solutions have matured and are well known to providers of Internet services.</P>
        <P>In order that we might begin to tackle this evil, I ask that the Oireachtas support the motion, which recommends that the type of abusive material in question be blocked on servers within the jurisdiction of all EU member states and beyond.  If this is done, it will allow us to afford protection to children and families in Ireland.  Blocking is the next best thing to deletion.</P>
        <P>Pornography and abuse of children are only a mouse click away.  Denying abusers access to images of the latter would at least be a start.  We cannot bargain with children&rsquo;s lives.  It is both our job and our duty to protect children.  If we cannot do that or put in place mechanisms which can facilitate it, then we should not be sitting in the Seanad.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P FLI="0">&ldquo;&bull;notes the adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, on 13 December 2011, of the Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> welcomes the new Directive, in which Ireland was actively engaged during the negotiations, and which seeks to enhance the protection of children from sexual abuse and exploitation;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> welcomes the requirement in the Directive that EU Member States take the necessary measures to ensure the prompt removal of any webpages containing or disseminating child abuse material hosted on servers within their jurisdiction;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> notes that the Directive, with appropriate safeguards, permits Member States to take measures to block access to internet users within their territory of webpages containing or disseminating child abuse material hosted on servers outside their jurisdiction.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> recognises that Ireland already has arrangements in place to secure the removal of webpages containing or disseminating child abuse material in Ireland and reports such material found outside the jurisdiction via the INHOPE network of internet hotlines and through cooperation with Europol and Interpol;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> notes that many of the provisions of the UN Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse and the EU Directive on Combating the Sexual Abuse and Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography have already been implemented in existing domestic legislation;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> notes that the Minister for Justice and Equality expects, in the coming months, to bring forward legislative provisions to Government for approval in the usual way, in order to strengthen the protection of children from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, and facilitate full compliance with relevant international legal instruments; and</P><Col N="53"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" /> further notes that, following enactment of the necessary legislation, arrangements will be made to ratify the UN Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister and sincerely thank the Independent Senators for once again doing the Seanad and the public a great good in bringing forward a matter of such substantial importance.  I listened with great interest to what the mover and the seconder of the motion said and I am looking forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.  Let us hope we can progress this very important matter together.</P>
        <P>The subject of child abuse has, tragically but very necessarily, been to the fore on the political and social agenda in recent years.  Many debates have taken place in this House and throughout wider society with regard to abuse in the church.  We are also engaging in a necessary debate on abuse in the home and among families.  Tragically, the rate relating to such abuse is extremely high.  The abuse which is the subject of this debate, however, is that which takes place in the shadows &mdash; in dark places where depraved people abuse children.  The lives of the children to whom I refer are literally being destroyed.  As Senator O&rsquo;Donnell stated, such abuse defines these children for life.  This abuse does not merely amount to images on computer screens, photographs or whatever, it involves an act which results in children being defined for life.  That is why the motion and the sentiments behind it must be taken very seriously by the Government.  Action in respect of this matter must be taken at the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donnell also referred to the &ldquo;fading distinction between childhood and adulthood&rdquo;.  That is a very important observation, which is worthy of much wider ventilation, and it sums up why this debate is taking place.  The fading distinction to which she refers and the sexualisation of children across all strata of society are causing profound difficulties for children.  This is an extremely serious matter about which we should be greatly concerned and in respect of which we should engage in a broad debate at a later date.  The amendment I propose on behalf of the Government is not to strike out the proposition or in any way reduce the strength of what is proposed by the Independent group.  It is simply to give a balanced overview of the current position and attempt to chart a route forward so that early progress can be made.</P>
        <P>The motion before us covers a broad spectrum but there is a strong focus on seeking the Minister to legislate and require the introduction of a system of blocking web pages containing child pornography content.  There is an ongoing debate, not just in Ireland but internationally, about the effectiveness of blocking systems.  We must hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on that.  In one sense, blocking systems are becoming almost obsolete and international experience now seems to show that most child abuse images or child pornography are now being transmitted and traded via other technologies on the Internet, such as peer-to-peer file sharing systems and online digital lockers, which would not be affected by the blocking of standard web pages.  Sadly, the people who trade in and profit from this appalling business are probably trying to move one step ahead from a technological perspective, which is why we need the strongest possible response.  It would be interesting to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the effectiveness or otherwise of blocking systems.</P>
        <P>It can be argued that blocking systems only hide the existence of illegal child abuse images instead of ensuring this criminal activity is tackled and removed at source.  I am advised there have been significant improvements in the speed in which such content has been deleted or taken down in recent years but there is a long way to go.  From international experience, it seems that blocking access to web pages and websites containing appalling and graphic child sexual abuse images at best prevents inadvertent or accidental access to such material.  In almost all cases, sadly, a determined or sophisticated Internet user can circumvent such blocking <Col N="54"/>systems with some degree of ease and continue to deprive children of respect through a depraved method of sexual enjoyment.</P>
        <P>I am advised by officials in the Department of Justice and Equality that the German and Dutch  governments, for example, decided not to introduce a process of blocking in respect of child abuse images on the Internet, and the Minister might comment on that.  Last year the German Government decided to annul a law to block Internet usage where there is a possibility of child abuse images appearing as it came to the conclusion that the deletion of illegal content should be the priority.  In effect, the material should be removed rather than having access blocked.  In addition, the success of Internet hotlines and police forces internationally ensured that illegal child abuse images on the Internet would be removed in a much more timely manner.  That is the updated position in Germany and the Netherlands.</P>
        <P>We often see the Dutch as being liberal in one sense but also advanced in child care and protection.  I am advised that a majority of the Dutch Parliament supported a Dutch Minister&rsquo;s decision not to require Dutch Internet service providers to block access to websites, etc.  Following receipt of certain information, the Minister advised the Dutch Parliament of his conclusion that alternative Internet services apart from websites were being used to distribute child abuse images and as a result, the blocking of websites containing images, or a blacklist, would no longer serve as a reliable and effective way of making progress.</P>
        <P>Like all great problems, this is complicated and complex so the answer may not be as clear as we would wish.  We must move on this grave issue as children at home and abroad &mdash; right across the world &mdash; are being abused and people are benefiting from this financially.  I look forward to the Minister taking the necessary action at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to the House.  His very presence indicates how he feels about the motion.  This has been a good debate on these vile crimes that are perpetrated on the Internet.  I commend the motion, proposed by Senator van Turnhout and seconded by Senators O&rsquo;Donnell, Mac Conghail, McAleese, Mary Ann O&rsquo;Brien and Zappone.  They put together an extremely good motion and Senator Paul Bradford has tabled an amendment.</P>
        <P>I very much support the motion and the amendment.  The amendment, through a technical process, outlines the Government&rsquo;s position on the points put forward in the motion.  I urge Senators not to divide on the motion as the issue does not warrant it.  I support the contents of the motion put together by the Independents and the technical information supplied by the Minister and his senior officials, whom I welcome to the House.  That shows how seriously the Department is taking this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The area is complex and I attended the meeting of experts last week.  I know Senator van Turnhout has been particularly involved in bringing in two experts in the field.  I expect that the information given at the seminar in the audiovisual room last week will be made available to the Minister and his Department, or that may have been done already.  These experts were very informed in the highly technical end of this business.  A startling view expressed by Senator O&rsquo;Donnell, which I presume is accurate, is that this pornography industry is bigger than the oil industry.  It is a stark statement about an illicit industry.</P>
        <P>Senator van Turnhout mentioned that once an image is put on the Internet, it is there for all time, and somehow or somewhere it can be used by others, exploited and families will have to live with it.  Abuse will continue and, as another Senator noted, each time the image is <Col N="55"/>shown, the abuse is committed again.  The information given last week was worthwhile, and it was indicated that the casual viewing of pornographic images can result in people who would never intentionally tune into a website doing so.  Curiosity can be dangerous and lead to inadvertent involvement.</P>
        <P>When sites are reported they can be pulled down but as this is a large worldwide industry, it can be very difficult to control.  I know the Department of Justice and Equality, together with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has been extremely active in detecting crimes and raiding premises where abuse has taken place.  There is follow-up on leads to the source of abuse, as outlined by Senators, with investigation of how this can be prevented.  This is crucial as such acts are almost unbelievable in a civilised world.  That a child of any age could be allowed to be abused is a First World rather than Third World issue.  The ages cited in the briefing document we received last week were extraordinary.  The New Testament, in the most extreme statement to be found in the Bible, refers to child abuse.  The reaction to the abuse of a child then was not different from the reaction today.  The biblical statement makes clear the sense of hurt and damage done by child abuse.</P>
        <P>The amendment offers a well worded response to each point in the motion.  It is interesting to note that Ireland will soon be in a position to ratify the UN Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.  Issues of this nature are regularly discussed in the 47 member Council of Europe.  Having listened to those who briefed us last week and the articulate views expressed by all the Senators who have spoken before me &mdash; I also look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution &mdash; I am confident that this debate will be of great assistance.  Airing these issues in the second House of Parliament is a great use of our time.  Many other issues of vital importance, for example, employment and education, are discussed regularly.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s nomination to the Seanad of a number of specialists in the area of children&rsquo;s rights has added to the variety of motions that have come before the House.  The expertise of Senators can serve an educational purpose for all of us.  It is also useful that information on this debate will be circulated to the media.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party does not want the House to divide on the motion or the amendment.  For this reason, I appeal to Senators to unanimously agree to the motion, as amended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is welcome.  I also welcome the motion tabled by the Independent Senators and congratulate, in particular, Senator Jillian van Turnhout on her work on it.  The amendment also has much to recommend it and I hope an agreement will be reached on the matter.  I also welcome the indication given by the Minister that the Government plans to introduce a sexual offences Bill in the coming months.  This legislation will facilitate the State&rsquo;s full compliance with the EU directive on combating the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and child pornography.  It is important to note that this directive permits member states to take measures to block access to Internet users in their territory of web pages containing or disseminating child abuse material hosted on servers outside their jurisdiction.  I hope this will go some way towards addressing some of the issues raised by Senator Jillian van Turnhout.</P>
        <P>The Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, has also called on the Government to ratify the UN Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.  It is envisaged that the protocol will be implemented in the sexual offences Bill.</P>
        <P>Child pornography is a complex and difficult problem to tackle.  As Professor Philip Jenkins of the University of Cambridge has concluded, the overwhelming evidence is that child pornography is all but impossible to obtain through non-electronic means.   The Internet is often used and, for the most part, unregulated.  I draw a clear distinction between the proposal in respect of blocking access to the Internet and recent controversies surrounding the Stop Online <Col N="56"/>Piracy Act, SOPA, and Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, ACTA.  As the only victims are children who must be protected, there is no debate about blocking access to the Internet in the circumstances I have described.</P>
        <P>Despite increased international co-operation on child pornography, the problem is increasing.  According to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in the United States, the number of child pornography images on the Internet increased by 1,500% between 1997 and 2003 and has probably increased exponentially since.  In 2007 the British based Internet Watch Foundation, IWT, reported that child pornography on the Internet was becoming more brutal and graphic and the number of images depicting violent abuse has risen fourfold since 2003.  The IWT also found that approximately 80% of the children in the abusive images were female and 91% appeared to be children under the age of 12 years.</P>
        <P>I fully support the intentions of my colleagues, as expressed in the motion.  While it is important to make strong efforts to tackle child pornography, it is also important to recognise the need to find new solutions and means of approaching the problem.  According to its 2010 report, the self-reporting system, <i>hotline.ie</i>, which has been operating for ten years, only recently succeeded for the first time in identifying and removing child pornography from the Internet.  The reason for this stark illustration of the need for new approaches is not a failure of the system but child pornography is not readily or easily found when trawling through the Internet.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the high stakes involved in child pornography, especially in financial terms, perpetrators of this crime have considerable technical knowledge and take advantage of sophisticated systems to manage the proliferation of child abuse material.  Some child pornographers circumvent detection by using viruses to illegally gain control of computers on which they remotely store child pornography.  In one case, a Massachusetts man was charged with possession of child pornography when hackers used his computer to access pornographic sites and store pornographic pictures without his knowledge.  Prosecution is difficult because multiple international servers are used, sometimes to transmit the images in fragments to evade the law.  Without international co-operation it is almost impossible to find those responsible.</P>
        <P>Another trend, one to which other speakers alluded, is the growing use of sophisticated security measures and peer-to-peer networking in which participants share files on their computers rather than downloading them from a website.  This means no fingerprints are left on the computers of those who view child pornography images.  The group uses encryption and data destruction software to protect the files and screening measures to ensure only authorised participants can enter the chatroom.  Hosting images on websites that could be accessed by members of the public is being consigned to the past.  For this reason, blocking websites is failing and we should be careful not to use valuable resources in pursuing this outdated approach.</P>
        <P>The clearest example of how child pornography rings work is the recent coup by the Internet vigilante group, Anonymous.  The Anonymous hackers infiltrated what is known as &ldquo;Darknet&rdquo;, essentially a network within the Internet.  This &ldquo;underground Internet&rdquo; is often used by criminals and sometimes dissidents in countries such as Iran and China to circumvent government censorship.  Anonymous members disrupted and hacked into systems of websites hosting child abuse material and obtained the log-in details of more than 1,500 users which they then published online.  This incident demonstrates that there is a level of expertise which could be made available to governments and concerned bodies.  We should ensure we are as technologically informed as is possible.  Simply blocking or removing material may only provide temporary solutions which will not guarantee success.  Suggested methods such as monitoring financial transactions and covert electronic surveillance are more likely to yield promising leads as they <Col N="57"/>lead back to the people involved.  Pursuing these approaches will require resources, however, and we must make available sufficient resources to ensure we have access to the most up-to-date technology and information to tackle child pornography on the Internet.  It is also crucial to continue to increase co-operation at European level and worldwide.  I support the methods used by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Icarus which is supported and co-ordinated by Europol.</P>
        <P>The Government must also embrace the good will shown by those involved with the Internet.  For example, in 2008 the Google search engine worked with the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children to help automate and streamline the way in which child protection workers sifted through millions of pornographic images to identify victims of abuse.  Google has developed video fingerprinting technology and software to automate the review of some 13 million pornographic images and videos which analysts at the centre previously had to review manually.  Although specialist technology is available to the Garda, it is important that Ireland is at the forefront of advances in order that we are able to tackle this developing disease with a suitable cure.  I commend the Senators who tabled the motion and I also commend the Government amendment.  I hope and believe a middle way can be found between the two.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is an important but also extremely sad evening for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  There is no doubt that the last shred of innocence or naivety that any of us might have claimed to possess is gone.  I do not know much about this subject.  I have never seen child pornography and I do not use the Internet.  I am horrified, frankly, by what I have heard.  I find the figures placed before the House astonishing.  Senator Hayden referred to 13 million images.  What concerns me about that is there appears to be demand for this material.  I find that utterly shocking and incomprehensible.</P>
        <P>Senator van Turnhout, who proposed the motion, said that many of the children were aged between zero and ten years, and I simply do not understand this.  She referred to some being aged two and the physical characteristics suggested that some of these children had recently been born.  They are not capable of consent, obviously.  It is not like the Romeo and Juliet case I raised, which is a reasonable subject for discussion.  That is a totally separate issue.  They are not capable of consent and they are obviously not capable of reproduction or mutuality of pleasure.  What is the point?  I do not understand human beings doing it or being interested in watching it.  Perhaps curiosity is a factor but I do not know.  Perhaps there are people who, when they hear about it, innocently look it up to see what it is all about.  I simply do not know.</P>
        <P>The Senator also mentioned rogue states and I would be interested in hearing more about that.  Which ones are they?  Is the phrase &ldquo;rogue state&rdquo; intended to mean that there are states which deliberately facilitate this?  If so, they need to be named and diplomatic representations need to be made to indicate to them that this is absolutely and utterly unacceptable.  A large part of this issue is technical.  I do not understand it and I do not know how images can be blocked.  These people are terribly devious having listened to what is being said.  Senator Hayden seemed to have a clear grasp on it.  I admit the technicalities of it are beyond me.</P>
        <P>The Minister is a lawyer and his amendment is more concise.  It may be that there is room for agreement.  I believe it would send out a bad message if there was a division on this because it might be portrayed as if there was division among Members on the subject of child pornography and I do not believe for one second that this is the case.  We stand united against it but it could be portrayed that Members were in favour of it or there was some kind of shading or nuance.  I recall in the late 1970s attending a conference on the continent and two groups applied for association with us.  One was called the Paedophile Information Exchange and the other was called the North American Man/Boy Love Association, both of which I opposed.  I called a vote on both and had both excluded but papers surfaced which showed that they had <Col N="58"/>been in contact with us.  This was used by the media to suggest that I was in favour of them.  I find that astonishing.  Let us be united.</P>
        <P>I have a suggestion for the Minister and the proposers of the motion.  I find nothing to disagree with in either the motion or the amendment.  The proposers in their detailed recommendations have, for example, called on the Minister to make a commitment and so on and to bring forward legislation and to spin that out.  Perhaps they would be satisfied with a commitment from him that the details they seek will be contained in the legislation he intends to bring forward.  I am concerned that a division on this would be problematic.  On balance, I believe that, because the motion was brought forward first by the Independent nominees of the Taoiseach, my inclination would be to vote with the motion.  I feel I would have to do that but I would regret having to do it.</P>
        <P>It is important that the original victims should have their fate addressed.  Where are they?  What has happened to them?  The crime has been committed and the commission of such crimes should be prosecuted as vigorously as possible if the perpetrators can be found.  I accept that it must be devastating for people who are perhaps too young to understand what happened to them.  I simply do not know what was going on.  I do not understand it but to have those images eternally available to be viewed by strangers or, worse, relatives and friends is shocking.  I recall hearing of snuff movies, which are equally as bad.  I could not believe it.  Perhaps other Members do not know what they are.  Let us include them as well.  Apparently, viewers get pleasure from watching other human beings being tortured and murdered.  That should be prosecuted and outlawed as well.</P>
        <P>I appeal to all sides to find a method of accommodation in order that the motion is not put to a vote.  If that happens, I will feel obliged to vote with the proposers of the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinMcAleese"><NameTxt>Senator Martin McAleese</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I intend to make a few brief comments because this is an issue on which it should be possible for all us to agree without difficulty, as Senator Leyden stated earlier.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland is attempting to lead in many fields, for example, information technology, digital services and the smart economy.  We should also be willing to lead in the prevention of abuse of children either through or on the Internet.  The motion, as originally drafted, was aimed at a simple goal, which is the protection of children.  It calls for two specific actions.  First, it calls on the Minister to bring proposals to Government to ratify two key international treaties on the protection of children from sexual abuse or exploitation.  This may require implementing legislation prior to ratification but the motion, as drafted, is broad enough to capture that.</P>
        <P>Second, the motion calls for the adoption of legislation to require Internet service providers in Ireland to block child abuse images or material hosted on servers outside the State.  Although the amendment tabled by the Leader and supported by Senator Bradford at first glance seems extensive, it only involves changes to drafting or emphasis.  When the texts are examined side by side, it becomes clear that there is only one difference of real substance, namely, the amendment tabled by the Leader does not include a call or a commitment to block child abuse images in Ireland or material hosted on servers outside the State.  As was stated earlier, this option is legally open to us under the European directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.</P>
        <P>I am morally certain that no one &mdash; the Leader, members of the Government or anyone else &mdash; is opposed to the idea of requiring Irish Internet service providers to block child abuse images or material hosted overseas.  In that case, therefore, was it necessary for an amendment to the motion to be tabled at all?  Surely the protection of children is an issue on which we can <Col N="59"/>agree the substance of a motion without unnecessary complicated procedural manoeuvrings.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I debated with myself a number of times today whether to say what I am going to say at the start of my contribution, but I think I should.  On two occasions, because I was in a leadership position in the organisations I was involved with at those times, I had to deal with allegations that were made about access to and viewing of child pornography on computers.  Thankfully, in one case, it turned out not to be child pornography, although it was still pornography and was dealt with accordingly.  However, in the other case, it was child pornography.  As a complaint was made directly to me, I had to access the computer, and some of the images I saw were absolutely sickening.  I immediately called the Garda.  Luckily, there were robust guidelines in place that helped me do the right thing and make sure the appropriate action was taken.  The perpetrator was subsequently dealt with by the Garda.  I say that because it is important that all organisations and public bodies &mdash; we have seen complaints about people accessing child pornography in public bodies, private companies, whatever it might be &mdash; have strong and robust guidelines and that people who come across such images know exactly what to do.  There must be proper mechanisms in place to ensure the relevant authorities are contacted and the matter is dealt with.</P>
      <TimeSt down="3" idown="3">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I welcome this motion, which provides an opportunity to discuss this important issue, and I will be fully supporting the amendment that was tabled by the Independent group.  Few subjects evoke such strong feelings as the exploitation and abuse of children.  It offends our basic sensibilities and morality.  I have two young children, one of five and one of nine months, and it would sicken me to the core if any of my children were abused in any way.  As Senator Norris said, nobody can say he or she is not aware of what is happening out there.  Young children in this country and outside it are being sexually abused and some people are using that as a form of enjoyment by accessing pornographic images of children on the Internet.  It is happening, and we know it is happening.  Every single public representative has a responsibility to ensure we do whatever we can to deal with the problem and deal with those who are involved in the abuse of children.  Few topics can excite as much outrage as cases involving abuse of children, but that means we should unite on this issue.  There should be no differences of opinion or amendments to motions such as this.  There should be agreement on what we need to do, and whatever needs to be done to protect children should be done.  It is that simple.  I will get to the specifics of the Independent group&rsquo;s amendment in a few minutes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We support the ratification of the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child that relates to child prostitution and pornography.  On many occasions we have questioned the current Minister and previous Ministers seeking its furtherance.  I hope the Minister will commit to this.  As the Government amendment appears to indicate that he might, I hope it happens.</P>
        <P>The Government has a responsibility under the Good Friday Agreement to introduce protections at least equivalent to those in the Six Counties.  Ultimately, we should be seeking to harmonise upwards and introduce on an all-island basis a child protection framework that is evidence-based, human-rights-compliant and reflective of international best practice.  We have for many years advocated constitutional reform, specialised training for garda&iacute;, prosecutors and the Judiciary, and an effective all-island sex offenders register with pre-release risk assessment and post-release supervision to help tackle the issues of exploitation and abuse of children.  However, this will require much more than legislation.  For the Children First guidelines to have a practical effect, they must be fully resourced.  Putting the guidelines on a statutory footing is welcome, but the social workers and others who deal with such situations are beyond <Col N="60"/>stretched as it is, so resources, as ever, are key.  I am cognisant of the economic climate and the difficulty in finding resources, but it would be remiss of me not to highlight the importance of such guidelines.  It is not merely the letter but the resourcing and implementation of guidelines that are important.</P>
        <P>I note that the special rapporteur on child protection has made numerous recommendations that the process of child grooming be criminalised.  What is the position regarding the joint work of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Health on the drafting of legislation to criminalise grooming?  Can we expect the publication of such legislation in the medium term?  This is an area in which we can work to tackle this issue.</P>
        <P>I note the importance of measures to block people&rsquo;s access to child pornography in the media.  As the motion notes, child abuse images are not just images; they are crime scenes.  We must take whatever measures are necessary to ensure those responsible are brought to justice and that such images are blocked from all media.  There are those who want to restrict the use of Internet technology to clamp down on free speech, and Sinn F&eacute;in shares some of the concerns in this regard.  However, this is a matter of protecting children, and we must take appropriate measures to ensure that this happens.  We endorse the measures outlined in the motion to this effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator van Turnhout and those who tabled this timely motion, and welcome the fact that we are having this debate on an issue that is of substantial concern to me and to the Government and which we are currently addressing.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to the previous speakers who outlined in great detail the need for ongoing strong measures to combat child abuse images, commonly referred to as child pornography, on the Internet.  The protection of children from sexual abuse and sexual exploitation, including measures to combat child abuse images on the Internet, is crucial.  We all abhor the evil trade in illegal images of children being sexually abused and exploited.  I can assure Senators that the Government is fully committed to fighting child sexual abuse, including child sexual abuse images on the Internet.  This commitment is demonstrated in the fact that Ireland has signed up to the various international instruments referred to in the motion.  The implications for policy and the Government in the whole area of the Internet are complex, since the situation is evolving quickly and is subject to frequent significant technological change.</P>
        <P>There are no easy solutions to these issues.  The Internet is a worldwide phenomenon, as everyone knows, with no borders and no single organisation controlling it.  International co-operation is therefore vital.  Every country is struggling to deal with these issues, as evidenced through the various international instruments that touch on this sphere.  Technological change is so rapid that policy is almost inevitably in a situation of continuous catch-up.</P>
        <P>My Department has been conducting a wide-ranging review of the law on sexual offences, and I expect to bring legislative proposals, in the form of a sexual offences Bill, to the Government in the coming months.  This will include measures to enhance the protection of children against sexual abuse and exploitation, including exploitation through prostitution and child pornography.  These will facilitate full compliance with the criminal law provisions of the UN and the Council of Europe, as well as the European Union instruments referred to in the motion.  I say &ldquo;full compliance&rdquo; because, in fact, much of the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography has already been implemented through the Child Trafficking and Pornography <Col N="61"/>Act 1998 and the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.  For example, our trafficking legislation criminalised the sale of persons, including children, for any purpose.  Also, my Department has been advised by the Department of Health that the Adoption Act 2010 meets other requirements of the optional protocol.  Similarly, many of the criminal law provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, also known as the Lanzarote Convention, are already covered by the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006.   The EU directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography was adopted only recently in December 2011.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the adoption and implementation of this measure had been approved by the Government and the Oireachtas.  The deadline for transposition of the directive by way of national measures is 18 December 2013.  As with the UN and Council of Europe instruments mentioned, many of the directive&rsquo;s provisions have been implemented in existing legislation.</P>
        <P>There is an existing self-regulatory framework for Internet service providers in Ireland which aims to combat illegal child pornography content online.  Members of the public who encounter such material may report it to the <i>hotline.ie</i> service of the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland.  If the material is hosted in Ireland and deemed to be illegal and in contravention of Irish law, ISPAI members are obliged to remove such material.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is automatically advised of any such instances in order that it can follow up, if appropriate.  If the material is hosted in another jurisdiction, it is notified to the Internet hotline in that jurisdiction and-or the relevant law enforcement agencies for follow-up action, with the aim of having illegal content taken down.  My predecessors and I have continually drawn the public&rsquo;s attention to the existence of the <i>hotline.ie</i> service.  The first and most important response to illegal child abuse images on the Internet is to track down the source and have the material removed.  This focus on so-called &ldquo;notice and take down&rdquo; is a key measure stressed in the new EU directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.  The <i>hotline.ie</i> service, with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, plays a vital role in this regard.</P>
        <P>There are some important facts to consider in contextualising the debate on child sexual abuse material on the Internet.  In only a handful of cases has illegal child sexual abuse material been found to be hosted in Ireland.  In the first case in 2009 illegal web content reported to <i>hotline.ie</i> was found to be hosted in Ireland in an incident in which a website owned by a small Irish business had been hacked into.  A Garda investigation discovered that because of weak log-on passwords, the site had been hacked into by criminals outside the jurisdiction.  In 2010 there were two cases of &ldquo;mirroring&rdquo; illegal content in Ireland.  They involved large website mirroring services with servers located in Ireland.  Although the USA was the actual source of these child sexual abuse images, this illegal content was replicated here.  The material was reported to the United States where it was removed.  As a result, it also disappeared from the mirrored websites hosted in Ireland.</P>
        <P>There has been a continuing downward trend of confirmed illegal content reported by the public to the <i>hotline.ie</i> service, with 186 such reports in 2010 compared with a peak of 284 in 2007.  This is despite the fact that the number of reports of suspected illegal content has continued to rise.  The total number of such reports was 2,646 in 2010, representing a 25% increase on the 2009 figure.  At the very least, this suggests illegal material is being encountered less often by the average Internet user in Ireland.  This correlates with international experience in recent times.</P>
        <P>The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 provides penalties for child pornography offences which I consider to be robust, subject to one comment.  The offence of knowingly <Col N="62"/>possessing child pornography attracts a maximum prison sentence of five years or a maximum fine of &euro;6,350, or both.  I do not regard this fine as adequate.  This is an issue that will be addressed in the sexual offences Bill.  The maximum penalty for knowingly producing, distributing, printing, publishing, importing, exporting, showing or selling child pornography is a maximum prison sentence of 14 years or an unlimited fine, or both.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit is responsible for the investigation of criminal offences involving child pornography.  Any suspected offence involving the abuse of children through the Internet or other technology, whether originating in this jurisdiction or coming to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through international agencies or by any other means, is subject to thorough investigation.  Specialist computer software is available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and utilised to gather information and intelligence on possible suspects operating in this jurisdiction.  The resources available for the investigation of this type of crime are continuously monitored by the Garda authorities to ensure they are sufficient.</P>
        <P>There is a vigorous and ongoing debate internationally about the merits of employing blocking mechanisms or filters to prevent access to either illegal or harmful content on the Internet.  It is important to note that blocking systems will only prevent inadvertent access by Internet users to illegal content and the use of such systems should not give a false sense of security to Internet users.</P>
        <P>Those who are against blocking systems fear that they may undermine freedom of expression online and lead to what is described as mission creep, where blocking initially relates only to web pages containing illegal child pornography content but potentially could be extended to any web pages which governments might find objectionable.  I do not regard this as a credible reason for inaction.  In the past decade blocking systems by Internet service providers in respect of child abuse images have been implemented in several jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Italy and Finland.  In the majority of these cases such blocking systems were set up on the basis of a voluntary opt-in approach by individual ISPs, rather than a legislative mandate on all ISPs.  In addition, many individual well known Internet companies implement their own filtering systems, for example, Google in respect of search results and Facebook in respect of uploaded images.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the other side of the argument, the German Government decided last year to repeal a law on Internet blocking of child sexual abuse images it had previously introduced because it considered that deletion of the images should be the priority and because of the success of Internet hotlines and police forces internationally in ensuring child abuse images were removed in a much more timely manner.  In 2011 a majority of the Dutch Parliament supported the Dutch Minister of Security and Justice in his decision not to require Dutch ISPs to block access to web pages containing child sexual abuse images.  This was on the grounds that other Internet services, rather than websites, were being used to distribute such images and that as a result, blocking websites containing child sexual abuse images on the basis of a blacklist could no longer serve as a reliable and efficient way to contribute to fighting child sexual abuse images on the Internet.</P>
        <P>Under a voluntary agreement brokered by the European Commission with GSM Alliance Europe, the association representing European mobile phone operators, all mobile phone operators in Ireland implement a form of blocking on their mobile Internet service which prevents access to websites identified as containing child pornography content.  This is important since <Col N="63"/>a key ongoing development in Internet technology is the shift to persons using mobile devices such as smart-phones to access the internet.</P>
        <P>Article 25 of the new directive specifically relates to measures against websites containing or disseminating child pornography.  First, it provides that member states shall take measures to ensure the prompt removal of web pages containing or disseminating child pornography hosted in their territory and will seek to ensure the removal of such pages hosted outside their territory.  This reflects the fact that the primary aim of all efforts in respect of child abuse imagery on the Internet should be to ensure it is removed at source.</P>
        <P>Second, Article 25 provides that member states may take measures to block access to web pages containing or disseminating child pornography content.  It further provides that any such measures should be set by transparent procedures and provide adequate safeguards, in particular to ensure such restrictions will be limited to what is necessary and proportionate and that users will be informed of the reason for the restriction.  The directive also specifies that these safeguards should include the possibility of judicial redress.  I am giving a commitment to this House that blocking will be fully considered in the development of the planned sexual offences Bill and in line with our obligations to implement properly the EU directive in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>While blocking is of assistance in preventing inadvertent access on the Internet to child abuse imagery, it is not enough.  It cannot adequately deal with the transfer of material of this nature via peer-to-peer file sharing systems, usenet and e-mail, rather than on standard web pages.  How best to implement Article 25 of the recently adopted EU directive is under consideration.  This debate is a valuable contribution to our deliberations on this very important issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is the Government&rsquo;s view that everything practical and effective that can be done should be done to address the evil of child pornography.  It has correctly been said by some speakers that every such image is evidence of a crime scene and records the sexual exploitation and abuse of children.  In an Internet world, with no territorial boundaries and an extraordinary evolving technological ecology, the children presented on such sites continue to be abused and their images viewed across the world.  The removal of such sites is crucial.  Because of the extraterritorial dimension, international co-operation is essential to counteract access to child pornography and end the continued exploitation of children.</P>
        <P>This is an important issue concerning the welfare of children on which there is no substantive disagreement among Members of the House.  As I said, a great deal has been done in our legislation to address this evil.  Further steps must now be taken pursuant to the recently adopted European directive.  I, therefore, ask Senators not to divide on this important issue and to unite to support the Government&rsquo;s amended motion as a clear and unambiguous signal of a united commitment to the protection not only of our children but also children across the world.</P>
        <P>The amendment tabled on behalf of the Government is not brought forward for any technical or pedantic reason, or in any way to disadvantage those who, in good faith, have tabled the motion which initiated the debate.  It is merely to provide the detail necessary with regard to the international instruments to which we are a party and to make express and important reference to the EU directive which provides architecture to be put in place across the European Union to address this evil.  It provides important guidance on the final measures that should be included in our legislation on sexual offences which is being developed.  That legislation will go a great deal further than addressing this issue.  It will also address a number of recommendations contained in Oireachtas reports, one of which dates back to 2006.  Another <Col N="64"/>report which contains recommendations is the that of the committee of which others and I were members in the previous D&aacute;il which dealt with the issue of children&rsquo;s constitutional rights.</P>
        <P>I will comment in response to the reference to an all-Ireland child protection framework.  This is something of which I am very conscious, particularly where there are differences between the legislative architecture in the State and that in Northern Ireland.  Issues relating to child abuse, child pornography and trafficking have been the subject of discussions between the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, Mr. David Ford, and me.  These discussions have been very valuable and I hope we will move to a position in which we will have similar laws on the island of Ireland in the area of child protection and in which we will work in harmony together to ensure the maximum protection possible to ensure the welfare of our children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I hope there will be agreement on the motion and the amendment which, as the Minister said, are not entirely in conflict.  As Senator Martin McAleese said, they are virtually identical, aside from a few sections.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Martin McAleese that although this country excels in high technology, we are not blocking images from abroad being accessed in Ireland.  I consider this to be a failure of will rather than a failure of technology.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement in the amendment that the Government will bring forward legislation in the coming months to strengthen the protection of children against sexual exploitation.  As the Minister is a man of his word, I know he will bring that legislation forward as soon as possible.  This is critical.  Unfortunately, we have been lacking and fallen behind in many ways in ensuring child protection.</P>
        <P>An issue not included in the motion but which, perhaps, the Minister might also consider is that of listing the names of people who have offended against children.  It is a very sensitive subject that is not easy to address.  However, in a case in Boston Cardinal O&rsquo;Malley, whom I commend, took the extraordinary step of listing the names of 132 priests who had been found guilty of sexually abusing children.  It included those who had left the priesthood but had been accused before or after they had left; it even included the names of dead priests.  In some cases &mdash; I am sure the Minister will take issue with this &mdash; they had not actually been convicted of anything.  However, the cardinal considered it important because the people and children involved came first in terms of protection.</P>
        <P>When the Minister is drafting the legislation in the coming months, will he contemplate making provision not only for the victims&rsquo; database proposed by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees to the House but also a list whereby convicted sex offenders would be made known to the public?  If they are considered, even after their term of incarceration, to be a risk to the community, the community is entitled to know this.  It is the likelihood of their reoffending that makes them so dangerous.  Some have refused treatment and, in some cases, the criminal justice system, unfortunately, does not provide them with the treatment or counselling that might prevent them from reoffending.  However, in cases where the authorities believe they will reoffend, they should be considered a threat on their release back into the community.  There is nothing more serious than the abuse of children and where somebody is likely to reoffend, people in the community, especially the Garda, should be made aware of this in a very clear manner.  The guidelines in this regard must be put on a statutory footing and obligations placed on the criminal justice system to ensure the Garda is made aware of such provisions.</P>
        <P>I had reason to be somewhat thoughtful about Cardinal O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s actions recently after I had asked a religious order in this jurisdiction to follow his course.  It stated it was not obliged <Col N="65"/>to do so.  If one element of a religious organisation in Boston can take the lead and, without compulsion or being forced to do so by the government, put children&rsquo;s safety first, it is a wonder that the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart will not follow suit.  I have had some very interesting correspondence with the head of the order in which it is stated the order is doing all that it is required to do and does not necessarily have to do any more.  I pointed out that it could do more, as Cardinal O&rsquo;Malley has done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is not that he was praised by anybody else.  Given that he did not receive much encouragement from others, I will take the extraordinary step of praising him.  Not many members of his organisation saw it as the correct move.  When people take such steps which are above and beyond the regulations and the law, because their primary concern is children&rsquo;s safety, they should be commended.  Perhaps the Minister might consider this issue.  I realise there are issues surrounding due process, but when the objective is child safety, we should, like Cardinal O&rsquo;Malley, go above and beyond the norm.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on both motions.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to consider fully the mechanism of blocking in the context of the sexual offences Bill, which he will bring to Government shortly and that on its enactment, the State will fully comply with the UN protocol on the Convention of the Rights of the Child, the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse and the EU directive on combating sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.  It is very important to be able to state that we are fully in compliance with these three provisions.  The sexual exploitation of children is a most serious violation of their rights as it impacts on their dignity and their mental integrity.  Child abuse on the Internet needs to be tackled.  We need to tackle sexual exploitation of children on a transnational basis and across many forms of activity.  We can play a part in harmonising legislation and practices with the EC directives and conventions.  There is evidence of a growing number of cases of child pornography, as well as the sale and trafficking of children for sexual purposes and sex tourism, involving children, on the Internet.  What are the reasons for this increase in the exploitation of children?  With the growing use of the Internet, increasing travel and social disparities, children are increasingly vulnerable in conflict areas.  Harmonisation of legislation and practices to combat exploitation is extremely important.  It is estimated that one in five children will be victims of sexual abuse or exploitation at least once in their lifetime.  Other Members have spoken of the circle of trust, parents, relatives, friends, teachers and carers, where a significant number of cases of sexual abuse takes place.  It is very difficult for children to report these cases or to assert themselves, to recognise that such behaviour by a member of this circle is wrong and should be reported.</P>
        <P>The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation, known as the Lanzarote Convention, was open for signature in 2007.  It will be a legally binding instrument and is based on more than 15 years of work in member states to tackle this <Col N="66"/>issue.  I am a member of the Council of Europe, as is Senator Leyden.  We have eight Members from the Houses of the Oireachtas on the Council of Europe.  It is very important that we can report that these issues are being dealt with and that legislation will be enacted in Ireland to ensure the Lanzarote Convention is implemented in full.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Images of child exploitation on the Internet is an international phenomenon and the figures are startling.  In 2006 the World Health Organization carried out a study which showed that 150 million girls and 73 million boys under 18 years have experienced forced sexual intercourse or other form of sexual violation.  UNICEF reckons that each year at least 2 million children across the world fall into the grips of the sex industry.  The UN estimates that the sex industry generates between &euro;3 billion and &euro;20 billion and is a lucrative industry.  We need to play our part in tackling this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week Interpol made a very interesting and informative presentation to Members in the audio-visual room.  The point was made that blocking images of children will not stop all exploitation, but nevertheless, to paraphrase what Interpol said, it is an important element because the material which Interpol is seeking to block is only that which falls into three of the most severe categories of images that are being distributed on the Internet, assault, gross assault and sadistic bestiality.  It wants to exclude the lesser categories.  A very important point is that Interpol wants to target simple viewers, or individuals who encounter the material by accident, because once their curiosity is tweaked by such images, there is a chance that one in three of these individuals reach a point where they commit a sexual offence against children.  Blocking is extremely important as a preventive measure.  Other offenders, who are more creative will not use the Internet but will find other ways of communicating.</P>
        <P>It is welcome that the Minister will consider blocking such images on the Internet.  By so doing we can play our role in tackling the gross crime of child sexual abuse.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I thank my fellow Member, Senator Jillian van Turnhout for raising this issue, as I knew nothing about this before the briefing from Interpol last week.</P>
        <P>It was upsetting to see the statistics on offenders that the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children provided to us.  The profile of an offender is a person like me, as 59% are married, 41% have children and 83% are in the age range from 21 to 50 years &mdash; I just about make the 50 years mark.  It is extraordinary that as a parent, a husband and a man, I fit the profile of the user.  We know it is insidious and that we probably know people in our community who access these images.</P>
        <P>The Minister must forgive us our suspicions and our comments, when the Government amendment was tabled, because the one word we were looking for, which Senator McAleese mentioned, that is &ldquo;blocking&rdquo;, was omitted.  I know it is no fault on the part of the Minister, but it has happened in previous Private Members&rsquo; motions that a Government amendment appeared to be a whitewash.  Being a new Member, we were looking for the magic word, which was not there, and I ask the Minister to forgive us.  I understand and accept this is not his intention.  I welcome his commitment to this House this evening that blocking will be fully considered in the context of the planned sexual offences Bill.  I invite him to consider introducing the Bill in the Seanad before it goes to the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Being a relative newcomer to the issue of child sexual abuse, I wonder if the hotline is as well known, as the Minister and others might expect.  I think we need to promote it more, as well as encourage more self regulation and more reporting.  I urge the Minister to look again <Col N="67"/>at ways to promote this hotline.  Senator Bradford raised the argument made in Germany, which the Minister also mentioned.  The difference in the German context is that when the government changed, it became an ideological issue.  The then German government agreed on the new law and the police developed it but with change of government, it was suspended.  The opposition is clear, that is the former government is clear, that if it returns to power it will reintroduce blocking.  I think it is more of a technical than a real point that Senator Bradford tried to score.  In the Dutch case, there was also an ideological argument around blocking.  It is not fair to say the government changed its view, it is that the government changed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The importance of blocking becomes apparent when one examines the available evidence and the scale of the attempts being made to reach known addresses containing child abuse images on the web.  In 2009, as mentioned by Senator Jillian van Turnhout, BT announced it had estimated that over its broadband network its blocking solution was preventing up to 40,000 attempts a day to access websites known to contain child abuse images.  Extrapolated across the broadband network in the United Kingdom, this suggests blocking was preventing up to 58 million attempts a year.  Five months after blocking was launched in Denmark in 2006 Danish police estimated that 238,000 users had attempted to reach known illegal child abuse images on the web.  BT has implemented its blocking solution in Newry, Belfast, Coleraine and Derry, yet 100 km from Newry that is not the case.  Because of our anxiety about the Government amendment, we sought a commitment from the Minister which he has given, for which I thank him.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I congratulate the Independent Senators, led by Senator Jillian van Turnout, for tabling what is an excellent motion.  I also thank them for organising the wonderful briefing session in the AV room last week.  Like some of my colleagues, I, too, was unaware of the scale of the problem.  As a mother of young children and one who has been involved in the education of young children, I was shocked.  I agree with the amendment and commend the Minister for his commitment to consider the blocking solution in the development of the planned sexual offences Bill.  As he said, everyone has the wellbeing and the rights of children at heart.  We all realise its importance and are united in our commitment to ensure the protection not only of our children but also children across the globe.</P>
        <P>Technology such as the Internet, although very valuable, can put children at risk of exploitation and harm.  The Internet gives those interested in abusing or exploiting children a new medium to network, share information and explore new identities.  Its use has national and international implications which makes the monitoring of exploitative practices all the more difficult.  However, it is encouraging to know, as the Minister pointed out, that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na thoroughly investigates suspected offences involving the sexual abuse of children through the Internet or other technologies.  We are speaking not only about the distribution of abusive images of children online but also the grooming of children through the use of teen chat rooms, bulletin boards and online communities in which the abuser befriends the child to gain his or her trust.  It can also involve prostituting a child.  For the children who have been subjected to online abuse, there is a sense of powerlessness, as the digital imagery can remain on the Internet indefinitely.  This can have an effect on recovery and treatment, as the child who has been abused in this way is defiled forever.</P>
        <P>There is an ongoing international debate about how effective blocking systems are, as new technologies are constantly coming on stream such as peer-to-peer file sharing which can bypass blocking systems.  However, blocking will prevent the accidental viewing of web pages containing abusive material by persons who do not intend to access such material.  Last year, when I was teaching, a pupil reported to me that she had inadvertently put the name of her favourite <Col N="68"/>pop star into a search engine on the Internet and that vile images had appeared.  She was shocked and reported the matter to me.  Out of curiosity, there is a temptation to view such images again, which can lead to a fascination for illicit material.</P>
        <P>Many European countries, including the United Kingdom, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Italy, have voluntarily blocked content.  It is hard to determine the number of children affected by exploitative practices through the Internet as they may not report the abuse out of fear or shame, something of which we are all aware.  Given the large-scale Internet usage among children and young people, their potential exposure to exploitation is heightened.  Parents can feel inadequate in monitoring their children&rsquo;s Internet usage, as they may have fewer computer skills than their children.  Many parents would most likely be shocked by the content on their children&rsquo;s friends&rsquo; Facebook or Twitter pages if they knew how to access them.  As a parent of five teenagers, I am acutely aware of these issues and the problem of monitoring children&rsquo;s Internet usage.  We need to ensure we have the best possible controls in protecting our children.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the debate that no one action will combat child abuse on the Internet.  This is all the more reason all stakeholders need to adopt a multifaceted approach, not only at national level but also at European level and worldwide.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Independent Senators for tabling this important and timely motion.  I have listened with interest to the various contributions made.  I also listened to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution.  I wondered initially if it was necessary to table an amendment to the motion.  I am starting from the point of view that far too often motions are amended and that there is not adequate tick-tacking beforehand to allow an agreed motion to be tabled.  However,  I was impressed by what the Minister had to say and I am aware that he takes the issue seriously.  I welcome, in particular, the commitment he has made in respect of the forthcoming legislation with which I wish him well, as it is important to be a reforming Minister.  The legislation should be supported by all sides of the House.  </P>
        <P>There is always a difficulty on an issue such as this in that people can, not as a result of insincere motives, try to outdo each other in their expressions of outrage and disgust at the sexual abuse of children and particularly child pornography.  There is no doubt that it is one of the horrors of our time.  The Internet and related technologies offer many positive opportunities, including advances in education.  There is also the importance of the democratisation issue attached to access to the Internet and the free availability of information.  In this regard, one has only to think of the challenges facing people in other parts of the world, including China, where there are restrictions on the information they can access and even basic democratic discourse is clamped down on by oppressive regimes.  However, with child pornography we see the other side of the coin.  The use of the Internet and related technologies takes people to a very dark place, reflecting something very dark in human nature and society.</P>
        <P>I have mentioned previously in the House the writer Stephen Rossetti who helped victims of sexual abuse and treated perpetrators.  In a book he referred to abuse as a slayer of the soul.  When speaking to Senator Jillian van Turnout last week she may have mentioned this; if not, it may have been mentioned by others.  There was a particularly sickening instance where a person having left an abusive past, one in which they were abused as a child and exploited for child pornography, tried to put their past behind them and make a new life.  They put something very innocent and relating to performance on YouTube and within a short time they were targeted by a former perpetrator or somebody that knew about their past as an exploited child.  It was a story that illustrated to me the psychological nature of this type of abuse and the <Col N="69"/>terrible ongoing torture inflicted on children.  It also brings home how difficult it can be for people to put their past abuse behind them.</P>
        <P>Child abuse is a form of evil in our society that is difficult to explain.  Many crimes can be understood as crimes of passion, revenge and so on.  This type of crime relates to a particular sickness in human nature.  Undoubtedly, in some cases it stems from an extraordinary degree of immaturity and confusion in some of the perpetrators but it arrives at a point where terrible evil is involved.  An evil that cannot be wished away by simply referring to it as a sickness or mental issue.  It behoves us as parliamentarians to leave no stone unturned.  Today I heard arguments about the issue and people said in the Chamber, and I have no doubt that it is true to some extent, that we face a technological challenge as it is not only on websites that some of this pornography exists but in the private exchange of files.  The belt and braces approach is always called for when dealing with an issue like this.  We should do what we can to ensure that sites are blocked by Internet service providers.  This is not an area for light touch regulation.  We are not in an era where it is thought best that people regulate themselves.  That is no longer the accepted norm in areas like medicine and law and it should not be the norm here.  While it is always welcome that Internet service providers show a willingness to regulate themselves, this is an area where we should not fear to legislate to ensure that they do so.</P>
        <P>On a positive note, we should pay tribute to people who work with victims of this terrible exploitation and prevent it from happening.  The debate ties in with the one we had on trafficking in recent times because women and children are also victims.  Children, particularly in the context of today&rsquo;s debate, are victims.  We need to do whatever we can, get various Departments of State that deal with various issues to work together, and make sure that this country is always a cold place for anybody that seeks to abuse children.  We should also pay tribute to Irish people, and I am thinking of somebody like Fr. Shay Cullen in the Philippines, who have done so much work to tackle those who would abuse children in the sex industry.  Their efforts deserve all of our support and we can do our bit as legislators.  I look forward to the legislation coming before the House in the autumn.</P>

	<P>That is nice to know, even if everybody might not agree with you.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the motion that was tabled by the Independent group, including Senator van Turnhout.  I know that the European Parliament and Council directive was adopted last December and that the Government is working on it as well.  We know from the history of the State how we have failed children in the past.  I know the Minister is proactive and such failure will not be repeated under his watch.  Legislation is one way to deal with the issue and he has shown, since he came to office, that he is serious about tackling such matters.  I also thank the Independent group for tabling its motion.</P>
        <P>The EU directive demonstrates the willingness of the European Union to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse and enhance international co-operation.  If we look at the stark reality of advanced technology, the Internet has given the sexual exploitation of children a cross-national element.  The UN estimates that 200 new child abuse images are placed on the Internet every day.  The Internet can be regarded as having transformed <Col N="70"/>global communication, but in many ways it is a dangerous tool that can facilitate some heinous crimes, including child sexual exploitation.  It needs careful policing in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Internet is a worldwide phenomena without borders or an organisation controlling it.  Earlier I listened to the Minister&rsquo;s speech when he spoke about the Internet&rsquo;s self-regulatory framework for the ISPs that operate in Ireland that actively encourages the adoption of best practice procedures aimed at limiting the proliferation of illegal child pornography content.  In a number of EU member states, Internet blocking systems are in use.  The list of blocked sites containing child pornography is made available by the police and other competent authorities and is utilised by individual ISPs to prevent access to such content.  Earlier Senator van Turnhout listed the countries that have a blocking system.  It is generally acknowledged that all Internet blocking or filtering systems are not foolproof and can be circumvented in certain circumstances.  Filtering systems do prevent Internet users from inadvertently encountering such illegal content. Of course the key objective from a law enforcement perspective is to achieve the removal of such material from the Internet at source.  I welcome the call from the Independent Senators&rsquo; group to sanction a system that would allow child abuse material hosted overseas to be blocked.</P>
        <P>I read the Minister&rsquo;s speech and listened to his presentation and understand that he is working on the issue in the sexual offences Bill that he will introduce.  Any such Bill must be seriously considered and thought out.  The motion was seriously thought out and thorough and I commend those who composed it, but I also support the Minister&rsquo;s legislation and his comments in that regard.</P>
        <P>Any suspected offences involving the sexual abuse of children through the Internet or other technologies, whether originating in Ireland or coming to the attention of garda&iacute; through international agencies or hotlines, is subject to thorough investigation.  I wanted to state that should anybody listening to the debate or reading it later think there is a free-for-all in the country.  Specialist computer software is available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is utilised to gather information and intelligence on possible suspects operating in this jurisdiction.  Law enforcement agencies from 26 European countries, including Ireland, supported and co-ordinated by Europol, carried out a major crackdown in 2011 against online child sexual abuse file sharing networks.  The operation targeted those sharing the most extreme forms of video material, which included babies and toddlers being sexually abused.  The operation has already uncovered previously unknown networks of child sexual offenders operating on different Internet channels.</P>
        <P>As I said, there is ongoing international debate about the effectiveness of blocking systems because they only work on standard web pages.  The systems have become almost obsolete since international experience has shown that most child abuse images or child pornography is now transmitted via other systems such as peer-to-peer file sharing systems, digital systems and online digital lockers that are unaffected by a blocking system.  I think Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen and other Senators have already referred to the various online technologies and I am not going to pretend to be <i>au fait</i>  with half of them.  The Minister also mentioned them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know the legislation is in good hands and the Minister is working on combating the issue.  Again, I thank the Independent Senators for tabling the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

        <P Just="Left">Everybody has said that we are mostly singing off the same hymn sheet.  Child sexual images are on the Internet in our living rooms and in children&rsquo;s bedrooms and that is the new crime scene, as Senator van Turnhout said.  It is vile, repulsive and profoundly evil.  We must work in unison to combat the problem.  It will not be easy to do because the problem is not just in Ireland or Europe but worldwide.  Unfortunately, the victims are getting younger and the images are becoming more aggressive and violent.  I have spoken to victims of child abuse who are now adults and they continue to have flashbacks, they cannot maintain relationships and they experience neediness because they are defiled forever.  We must continue to work together to combat this problem and condemn it in the strongest terms.  I know the Minister is bringing forward the sexual offences Bill and, as a leader on the issue, he will facilitate the State&rsquo;s full compliance with the most recent EU directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.</P>
        <P>There is a need for an international approach as well as a domestic approach to this issue because legislative provision, internationally and domestically, must be responsive.  The Internet is changing rapidly in the context of abusive behaviour and the environments available for abuse.  However, because the issue is international in nature does not mean we should fail to do anything.  We need both a local and a global approach, as this is not only an Irish or European problem but is a worldwide issue.</P>
      <TimeSt down="3" idown="3">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We must consider who are the victims; they are young children.  It is abhorrent to think of babies and toddlers in this context.  We must educate our young people about Internet usage and the dangers that exist.  We must empower them to know that being approached in a manner like this is not healthy and is wrong and that these images are wrong and unlawful.  It is stunning what children can find funny and what they think may not be wrong.  We should not think for a minute that because we think it is wrong that they know it is wrong, so education is critical.  It would be helpful to provide for blocking of access to such content by Internet service providers, ISPs, in the State.  I acknowledge this will be difficult because the Internet does not have boundaries but this would be the responsible approach to ending this crime and it may help prevent abusers from originating here.  There is a danger that if we do nothing and look on this as a global problem, we could be lax.  Every country should play its part.</P>
        <P Just="Left">How does the Government link with other countries, not just in Europe but across the globe, to provide the best protection and prevention possible?  Is there a way to detect centrally whether a person or group accesses a website with pornographic images of children, innocent or otherwise or if they download images?  That has to be nub of the problem.  I recall a few years ago a prominent individual was found to have downloaded images on his hard drive.  There was a Garda investigation.  A fear was expressed about people accidentally landing on a website with these images and whether they would be detected.  Approaches should be made by garda&iacute; if they are detected.  Is that possible?  This is the level of detection needed to prevent such heinous crimes and I am keen to know if there is any information on that available.</P>

	<P>I thank all my colleagues and, in particular, the Minister.  He has paid full attention throughout the debate and he has listened to what we have had to say.  He has given a commitment to fully consider blocking sites in the context of the development of the planned sexual offences Bill and I strongly urge him to do so.  Both the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Interpol wrote last year to Internet service providers in Ireland requesting them to introduce blocking.  That has not happened and that is why, as a group, we took the step to put forward the motion to introduce a legislative proposal.</P><Col N="72"/>
        <P>I thank the ISPCC, which has been strongly supportive of our work in this area.  While I thank all the Senators who made contributions, I would particularly like to thank colleagues in my group: Senators O&rsquo;Donnell, O&rsquo;Brien, McAleese, Mac Conghail and Zappone.</P>
        <P>I served seven years as chief executive officer of the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and I thought I had hardened to some of the hardcore child abuse issues and I had heard most of it.  As we have explored this issue and as my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Donnell, clearly illustrated, there is the issue of the effects of these images and how they can define one&rsquo;s life.  Every picture is a child scene.  I earlier described the profile of the main victims, with 69% being under the age of ten and 4% under the age of two.  They often receive counselling as part of their recovery but what about the knowledge they have that their names and pictures are on the Internet and that Ireland is not blocking them?  Can Members imagine walking down Grafton Street or around a shopping centre looking around and wondering whether people know who they are and what happened to them?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I trust the Minister&rsquo;s commitment and believe he is convinced but I want to share with him our group&rsquo;s commitment to follow this issue up to ensure blocking is put in place.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I tabled the matter because of a commitment in the HSE South service plan to remove 13 long-stay beds from Dungarvan Community Hospital.  The Minister of State will be aware that a number of short-stay beds were closed in the hospital last year and that was seen as a temporary measure.  At the time, I said that I feared this was a prerequisite to the closure of long-stay beds in the hospital.  The HSE issued a statement saying that would not be the case, that the hospital would not lose any long-stay beds, the closure of the short-stay beds was a temporary measure and that they would be reopened.  Here we are a few short months later and an announcement has been made to close 13 beds.</P>
        <P>A statement from HSE south says: &ldquo;As a result of staff retirements, it will be necessary to reduce the long-stay bed complement of the community hospital in Dungarvan by 13.&rdquo;  I have correspondence from Unite trade union and I spoke to some members of staff who have been informed by the hospital management that the intention is to close St. Michael&rsquo;s ward, which is a 16-bed ward.  Which is it?  We need to know and, in particular, the relatives of the patients need to know what is happening.  Is it what the HSE outlined in its service plan, that 13 beds will be closed?  Is it what HSE management is on the record as saying, that there will not be ward closures and that a number of beds across a number of wards will be closed?  Is it the case that the hospital management are right and it is going to be the closure of the ward and the loss of the 16 beds?</P><Col N="73"/>
        <P Just="Left">I received a telephone call yesterday from the son of a resident in St. Michael&rsquo;s ward.  The resident is 92 years of age, has been there for many years and is very comfortable in the ward.  The family is very concerned that if that individual is moved, it will have an impact on his quality of life.  HIQA has examined St. Michael&rsquo;s ward on three occasions and while it expressed some reservations about the size of the canteen, it had no concerns about safety.</P>
        <P Just="Left">HSE management says this must happen and the beds must go because of staff shortages and non-replacement of staff who are leaving.  Does this not demonstrate again that the embargo on public sector recruitment and voluntary redundancies in the health service are impacting on patient care and are resulting in beds being taken out of the system?  Would the Minister of State agree that in a place like west Waterford, where there is an ageing population, as we have throughout the State, removing beds from the public system in hospitals like Dungarvan Community Hospital, will have long-term and short-term consequences?  It does not make sense in a country with an ageing population to close long-term beds for the elderly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Which will happen?  Will we see the HSE&rsquo;s position reached  that 13 beds across a number of wards will close or will we see the hospital management view being adopted that St. Michael&rsquo;s ward will close with the loss of 16 beds?  Perhaps the Minister of State can offer some clarity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Recently the HSE confirmed its commitment to sustaining 101 elderly long-stay beds between Dungarvan Community Hospital and Dunabbey House.  Both units operate under the management of Dungarvan Community Hospital.  The hospital serves the catchment area of Dungarvan and west Waterford.  The old part of the hospital dates back to 1839 but has been refurbished over the years.  Services are provided in six different units and the centre provides long-term care, rehabilitation, respite, convalescence, palliative and dementia-specific services.  It also caters for the young chronic sick.  There are 84 long-term beds at the hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Located very close to the hospital is Dunabbey House.  This is a single storey, purpose-built unit and has operated as a designated centre for dependent persons since 1974.  Dunabbey has capacity to provide long-term care for 30 residents.  It operates as a stand-alone unit under the management structure of Dungarvan Community Hospital.</P>
        <P>The current capacity for long-term care beds at both units is 114 beds. It should be noted that there is not at present maximum long-term bed occupancy in either Dunabbey House or Dungarvan community hospital, and 15 bedsin total are unoccupied.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator will be aware that the moratorium on recruitment is impacting on the community hospital system in Waterford.  The HSE South service plan for 2012 refers to the closure of 13 long-stay beds at Dungarvan Community Hospital arising from the retirement of staff.  It proposes to reorganise beds by moving residents to other parts of the hospital more appropriate to their needs, and to avail of superior long-stay accommodation in Dunabbey House.  The HSE is involved in consultation with staff and patients on the proposal to reorganise beds at the hospital.  I also understand that local Oireachtas Members have been invited to attend the hospital this Friday, 2 March, to view the different facilities and have further discussions on this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator will be aware that towards the end of 2011, 16 short-stay beds were closed at Dungarvan Community Hospital as a cost containment measure.  These beds will be reopened on a phased basis in the next few weeks.</P><Col N="74"/>
        <P>All developments must be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures, and any decisions taken by the HSE must have regard to this and the current moratorium.  However, the care of all residents in the hospital is a priority and the HSE has given assurances that no resident currently in the hospital or Dunabbey House will be disadvantaged in any way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I trust the House will agree that we need to ensure the highest standard of care will continue to be provided for all residents in a safe and secure environment.  Providing quality and safe care will always remain at the heart of any considerations.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The HSE statement reads: &ldquo;As a result of staff retirements, it will be necessary to reduce the long-stay bed complement [at] the ... hospital ... by 13.&rdquo;  The Minister of State referred to the HSE service plan, which talks about the closure of 13 beds.  This may be difficult for the Minister of State but can she give a guarantee that it will be 13 beds?  I do not want to see any beds lost at the hospital, and I have made the point that we are talking about long-stay beds for older people at a time when we have an ageing population, but the HSE is saying 13 beds will be closed.  What I have been told by staff at the hospital and by Unite trade union that represents the staff is that it is intended to close St. Michael&rsquo;s ward, which has 16 beds.  Can the Minister of State confirm 13 beds will be closed, not 16?  I do not agree with any bed closures in the hospital because of the impact it will have on patient care, but people deserve to know exactly what will happen.  I will attend the meeting in the hospital on Friday, to which the Minister of State referred.  It is important, if the HSE is saying one thing and the hospital management is saying something else, that there is joined-up thinking and we are told by the HSE exactly what is happening in order that we can deal with it.  Is the Minister of State in a position to confirm that only 13 beds will close, not 16?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I can only repeat what I have in writing from the HSE, that the HSE South service plan for this year refers to the closure of 13 long-stay beds at Dungarvan Community Hospital.  That is the situation and, in addition to that in terms of numbers, there is a commitment that the 16 short-stay beds that were closed in the hospital are to reopen on a phased basis over the next few weeks.  It is there in black and white.  I do not know if the Senator attended the briefing on the service plan but presumably the situation was clarified at that.  I am told the service plan provides for the closure of 13 beds, that is my understanding of the situation and I have no reason to believe that is not the case.</P>

      <sTitle>Social Welfare Benefits</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to deal with this important issue, about which I have been very concerned for the past two years.  It concerns how medical referees in the Department of Social Protection seem to be dealing with applications for disability allowance, invalidity pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance, in particular.  There seems to be an unwritten rule that they refuse almost every application and send applicants along the appeals route which takes between nine and 12 months to complete for persons who are hard-pressed and want answers.  They are put on a merry-go-round, which is unfair.</P>
        <P>Let me give some examples.  A constituent of mine was looking after his wife who had Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  He took two years off work and received carer&rsquo;s benefit.  At the end of the two year benefit period he applied for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Even though his wife&rsquo;s condition was deteriorating, the medical profession deemed that she was not unfit for work and the application for carer&rsquo;s allowance was refused.  Another man who suffers from severe depression, has restricted mobility in his left leg, to a level of 5%, and is incontinent has been told he does not need a full-time carer, even though he actually has one.  In another case a man from the Czech Republic here on a special visa to work as a specialist butcher in a local factory, in which a crate of meat fell on top of him, seriously damaging his spinal cord and hip, which means he walks in a way that indicates he is severely disabled, has been told he might be fit to do light work and thus will not receive disability allowance, despite the fact he does not have three words of English.</P>
        <P>I am well aware that in the good times, when there was plenty of money available, disability allowance, invalidity pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance was paid to people who perhaps did not fully deserve it.  I have often cited the example of a man I know who receives blind pension, yet goes into town every day to buy the <i>Daily Star</i>.  That happened in the past and I certainly disagreed with it.  However, the wheel has now turned full circle and what is being done is totally unfair.  If Christy Brown was to apply for disability allowance now, he would be told he was not eligible because he would be able to type with his big toe.  It is becoming ridiculous and somebody has to take the issue by the scruff of the neck.  Somebody has to tell departmental officials to tell medical referees that what they are doing to people is unfair.  They have no idea how they are being affected.</P>
        <P>When appeals are heard, it turns out that 50% of decisions made are overturned.  If that is the case, it means the medical referees have made a mistake in 50% of cases.  Either they are <Col N="78"/>able to do their job, or they are not.  Otherwise, it must be the case that they are being told to do it in a particular way.  I want to know what has changed in the past two years and what the Minister will do to rectify the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  There is frustration among members of all parties.  I have no doubt, however, that the Minister will strive to improve the position, particularly as the number of decisions overturned on appeal does not make sense.  We must work hard to deal with the matter.</P>
        <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection.  With regard to the medical criteria used in qualifying for disability allowance, a person must be suffering from a medical condition which has continued or may reasonably be expected to continue for a period of at least one year and, as a result of the condition, the person must be substantially restricted in undertaking work which would otherwise be suitable, having regard to the person&rsquo;s age, experience and qualifications.  In the case of invalidity pension, a person must have been incapable of work for at least 12 months and be likely to be incapable of work for at least a further 12 months, or permanently incapable of work.  In the case of carer&rsquo;s allowance, the person receiving care must require full-time care and attention.  The person receiving care is regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where he or she is so incapacitated as to require continuous supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself or continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions, and is so incapacitated as to be likely to require full-time care and attention for a period of at least 12 months.</P>
        <P>The medical assessment of eligibility for illness and disability-related schemes is determined by the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors.  These are fully qualified medical practitioners who have experience and training in the field of disability and occupational medicine.  Medical assessments are made in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s evidence-based medical guidelines and protocols.</P>
        <P>Applicants for illness and disability-related schemes are afforded every opportunity and encouraged to furnish all medical evidence available to them in support of their claims at the time of claim.  In the case of disability allowance and carer&rsquo;s allowance, the applicant&rsquo;s or caree&rsquo;s GP or consultant is required to certify the nature of the illness as part of the application process.  In the case of invalidity pension, most claimants transfer from illness benefit where medical records will already be available to the Department.</P>
        <P>All medical evidence furnished by the applicant is considered during the assessment, but, in some cases, despite the Department&rsquo;s advice to claimants that they submit all medical evidence at claim stage, complete medical evidence is furnished only at appeal stage.  As an indication of the level of appeals, in 2011 in the case of disability allowance, there was an appeals rate of some 23%, while in the case of invalidity pension and carer&rsquo;s allowance, there were appeals rate of some 13%.</P>

	<P>Yet again I could have written the response myself, having been a community welfare officer for 28 years.  I do not need to be told by a civil servant who qualifies for what payment.  The issue is that despite the fact medical referees have sufficient experience and training in the field of disability and occupational medicine, 50% of their decisions have been reversed by somebody at a higher level.</P><Col N="79"/>
        <P>Another gripe of mine is that if somebody is unhappy about a decision made by a medical referee in regard to a caree, that is, somebody who needs full-time care and attention, that he or she does not need somebody to care for him or her, and the caree seeks an oral hearing, the only person from whom the Department will hear is the applicant.  It is not the applicant the Department should be dealing with but the caree.  Departmental officials should have the person who needs care and attention sitting in front of them to assess whether he or she actually needs care and attention.  Instead, it is the applicant who is hauled before them.  They cannot make a determination in that way.</P>
        <P>While there is a notion that the transition is smooth where a person moves from illness benefit to invalidity pension, it is not.  I am aware of any amount of cases in which people have been in receipt of disability benefit for a long period, but, of late, when they apply for invalidity pension, they are told they are fit for work.</P>
        <P>I would appreciate it if the Minister of State sent a strong message to the appropriate Minister in order that we can have these problems rectified.</P>

	<P>As someone who learned the hard way, I can see that the Senator seems to know what he is talking about.  Putting pen to paper is often a help.  A Minister sometimes needs guidance.  I, therefore, propose that the Senator put pen to paper and make, say, six points on how the criteria could be met.  This does work.  Lobbying in a constructive manner cannot be beaten.  The Senator should, therefore, put pen to paper and explain what is going wrong.  We are all dealing with the same problem, day in and day out.  Changes are slow in coming and appeals take a long time.  The Minister needs people like the Senator who knows the system inside out to explain what changes are needed.  The Senator should consider doing what I have suggested.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach.  Will he outline the specific steps the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is taking to prevent the spread of the Schmallenberg virus, which is currently affecting livestock in parts of England and elsewhere in Europe, to Ireland?  Since the 1990s the livestock industry has been affected by several diseases, including the bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, outbreak and the foot and mouth disease outbreak which followed quite soon thereafter.  What prompted me to raise this matter was my recollection of the effective measures taken by the then Minister, Joe Walsh, to protect livestock here from the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain.  It would have been devastating for us if there had been an outbreak of that disease on a wide scale.  In more recent years we have had scares in regard to swine flu and avian flu.  Some of these diseases, particularly BSE, pose significant risks to human health.</P>
        <P>The Schmallenberg virus is somewhat more complex because the contagion is from a different source than is the case in respect of foot and mouth disease, for example.  My objective in bringing this issue to the Minister&rsquo;s attention is to raise awareness of the outbreak of the virus, ascertain the steps being taken and, through raising awareness, encourage precautions to be taken against it.  The virus was apparently first detected in the small town of Schmallenberg in Westphalia and soon spread across Germany and into the Netherlands.  It is suspected that it was carried from there into southern England by wind-borne midges.  The disease is similar to bluetongue in that regard, an outbreak of which occurred here many years ago.  Unlike blue<Col N="80"/>tongue, however, there is no vaccine for the Schmallenberg virus and scientists are indicating that it could be several years before one is developed.</P>
        <P>The incidence of the virus is not as yet very extensive in England, but its effects have been seen on sheep, in particular, and cattle.  Lambs are especially affected, with 10% to 25% of those exposed to the virus born either deformed or stillborn.  I understand that in cattle the disease has an effect on milk yields.  This amounts to a significant adverse impact for the agricultural sector.  While the outbreak is not extensive in our neighbouring country, we should have people on notice and take whatever measures are considered necessary in order to prevent cattle and sheep in this country being affected.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.  Coming from a farming background, I am aware that there is no point in attempting to deal with these types of issues once they have already become a problem.  The greater people&rsquo;s awareness of this disease, the more precautions they will take.  It is an important issue at a time when agriculture is a lifeline for our economy.  We cannot afford to put that at risk.  As such, I compliment the Senator on raising the matter.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s animal health status is the bedrock of our food industry at all levels and crucial to our economic recovery.  We will not do anything to undermine or jeopardise this very valuable resource.  Proof of the value of our high animal health status is reflected in the fact that the value of Irish food and drink exports have reached an all-time high of &euro;8.85 billion.  As a result, the sector accounted for 25% of the rise in total export revenue.  In the past two years, the value of Irish food and drink exports has increased by &euro;1.8 billion, or 25%.</P>
        <P>The Schmallenberg virus, named after the town in Germany where the disease was first identified, was confirmed in December 2011 following the birth of deformed lambs in the Netherlands.  Its manifestation in adult cattle, as low grade fever and unexplained milk drop from which animals made a full recovery, had been under investigation in Germany and the Netherlands since the summer of 2011.  It has now been recorded in seven member states, namely, Germany, Belgium, France, Luxemburg, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Italy, on some 1,000 farms in total out of a total ruminant population of 85 million.  It is not a notifiable disease.</P>
        <P>Identified hosts so far are cattle, sheep, goats and bison, but the two main hosts are adult cattle and sheep where it manifests as a transient febrile illness with milk drop in adult cattle and in the form of congenital malformations in newborn and aborted animals, mainly sheep.  Based on current available information, experts conclude that the risk for human health is negligible.  This advice has been given by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  International experts have also determined that the time during which the virus circulates in the bloodstream of an infected animal, and is thus in a position to be a source of disease, is short.  It is part of the Simbu serogroup of viruses that are primarily transmitted by insect vectors, mainly midges and mosquitoes.  There is no evidence of direct transmission from animal to animal other than maternal transmission from mother to offspring <i>in utero</i>.  Exposure to a similar virus, the Akabane virus, which is widespread in Australia, induces strong immunity in the infected animal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are no trade implications for the movement of animals or products within the European Union arising from the outbreak of the disease.  In other words, animals may be moved <Col N="81"/>subject to normal health inspection and certification systems.  However, third countries have responded on the trade issue in different ways.  Some, including the Russian Federation and other customs union countries, have applied widespread trade restrictions pending further information and additional assurance in respect of animals and animal products from affected countries.  Certain countries have suspended trade in germinal products from the EU while seeking additional health guarantees.  Other third countries have sought additional information.</P>
        <P>There is no treatment or vaccine available for the Schmallenberg virus.  As it is a new disease, further work is needed to determine what control measures may be appropriate.  The European Commission, in co-operation with the member states, through the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, SCoFCAH, and the states&rsquo; chief veterinary officers, recognising that information on the Schmallenberg virus is fragmented, has concluded that further data are required on in four aspects.  These are: vector distribution; susceptible species; current stage of the epidemic &mdash; peak, decline and so on; and epidemiological data on herd incidence, prevalence, morbidity, etc.  Accordingly, the European Food Safety Authority, EPSA, has been tasked with collecting the required data and preparing an overall assessment of the impact of the infection on animal health, animal production and animal welfare, together with a characterisation of the pathogen, by 31 May 2012.</P>
        <P>In view of the action of certain third countries to which I alluded, the EU has stressed the need for a consistency in approach to third countries in line with World Organisation for Animal Health, OIE, recommendations that there is no justification for any ban on milk or meat.  No trade restrictions should be accepted on meat, milk and by-products as these commodities do not pose any risk for Schmallenberg virus transmission, it being a vector-borne disease.  In the case of a virus from the same family, the Akabane virus in Australia, no restriction is placed on international trade in animals or animal products.</P>
        <P>As I said, there is no evidence that the disease is present in Ireland.  Equally, there is no suitable routine test to enable us to prove it is not present as no blood test exists for appropriate surveillance.  However, a polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test &mdash; essentially a DNA test &mdash; to detect the virus is currently in use in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s central veterinary research laboratory.  Some 48 samples tested to date from animals presenting with clinical signs associated with infection have tested negative.</P>
        <P>We in the Department agree fully with the approach the EU has taken in addressing this situation and its conclusion, as endorsed by the OIE, that no additional risk is posed through intra-Community trade in animals.  In common with other member states, we are collating the required laboratory and epidemiological information to assist in risk evaluation and risk management.  We are in continuous contact with our counterparts in Northern Ireland, who are adopting a similar approach, and in all member states.  We have notified relevant persons, including veterinary staff and private veterinary practitioners, to report and submit samples of any animals showing unexplained clinical symptoms of the virus or of suspect birth defects.  We have also provided information on our website and have made information available in the printed media.</P>
        <P>As I explained, the information available on the Schmallenberg disease virus suggests that it is part of the Simbu serogroup of viruses that are primarily transmitted by insect vectors, including midges and mosquitoes.  We are in the vector dormant season when the level of vector activity is such that the risk of disease spread is minimised.  It is worth repeating that there is no evidence of direct transmission from animal to animal, other than maternal transmission from mother to offspring <i>in utero</i>.</P><Col N="82"/>
        <P>Applying additional controls at entry points, given the vector route of transmission, would not add anything by way of increased bio-security.  Such a move would also be contrary to current European animal health law, given, in particular, that Ireland is not in a position to prove freedom from the disease.  Single Market rules preclude member states from interfering with intra-Union trade in animals, except on legitimate animal health grounds.  Accordingly, animals are free to move in trade in the Union provided they are certified as being compliant with animal health rules.  My Department urges importers to ensure such imports are fully compliant with EU rules and that they operate to the highest standards of bio-security to ensure no diseases are introduced to Ireland via such imports or the vehicles transporting them.</P>
        <P>As stated, we treat any threat to our animal health status with the utmost seriousness.  We will continue to monitor this developing situation, maintain close contact with our colleagues in Northern Ireland and review and modify our response, as appropriate, in the light of any new information that becomes available or through the development of new testing capabilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response.  As the prevailing winds are in our favour, we will avoid the spread of the disease here.  When tabling the motion I expected to hear that there was a spray available which would act as a repellant to midges and thus protect animals.  However, as the Minister of State did not mention one, that may not be the case.  Perhaps he might inquire if such a spray is available.  The best approach at this stage might be to create awareness of this problem and ask people to be mindful of it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make inquiries on behalf of the Senator whom I again thank for raising the matter.  As agriculture is our biggest industry, we must take all precautions to protect it.  I will update the Senator if we receive further information on the matter.</P>
