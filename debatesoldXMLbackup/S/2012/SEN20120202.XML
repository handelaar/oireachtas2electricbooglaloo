	<P>I have received notice from Senator Jim Walsh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to outline if he has had any prior evaluation undertaken to assess the impact of the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Bill 2011, and if any estimation has been made as to the number of jobs that will be put at risk and may be lost following its introduction.</P>

	<P>It is proposed to take No. 18, an all-party motion re the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, to be taken without debate; No. 1, Electoral (Amendment)(Political Funding) Bill 2011 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 18 and adjourned at 1.45 p.m., if not previously concluded, with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed six minutes, and the debate to resume next Tuesday afternoon, if not concluded today; and No. 2, statements on foreign affairs, to be taken at 3.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 5 p.m.  Following the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s speech questions not exceeding two minutes will be taken from the group spokespersons and those of all other Senators shall not exceed one minute.  The T&aacute;naiste will take three questions at a time.  I have forwarded a list of the names of those who indicated they wished to speak to the Cathaoirleach.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business regarding the statements on foreign affairs, why are there not separate time slots for the Leaders?  That is not included in the timetable the Leader set out.</P>
        <P>It is remarkable that the issue of jobs is not higher up on the Government&rsquo;s agenda.  The European Council which the Taoiseach took part in during the week concluded that much more needed to be done, particularly in Ireland.  We have yet to see any jobs plan from the Government.  At the start of this Government&rsquo;s term we had the jobs initiative, previously called the jobs budget, which was a &ldquo;tax now, worry about the jobs later&rdquo; initiative.  Unfortunately, it has not worked.  I stated during the debate on the Bill which passed those taxes into law that I hoped it would work but that I also hoped I would not be in the House in a few months time saying that it has not worked.  It has not worked.  Unemployment continues to rise.  Youth unemployment is 29%.  Does the Government intend to set up some kind of national youth employment fund similar to those in the United Kingdom and other European Union countries?</P>
        <P>When will the Government publish its plans on unemployment, which is the most pressing issue?  Various plans were announced by the previous Government, including on agriculture.  This Government is following on from our plans.  I demand a debate on unemployment, which is the most crucial issue.  The numbers are very high.  We have a rate of 14.2% and a youth unemployment rate of 29%.  I heard a Senator talk yesterday about a village in the west in which she reckoned there was an unemployment rate of 80%.  If that is the case it is frightening.  Every effort on the part of the Oireachtas and the Government should be focused on that issue but that is not happening.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to call for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to come into the House for a debate on the issue of unemployment.</P>
        <P>I wish to move motion No. 6 on the Order Paper.  I do not want to divide the House on an issue such as this one but it is one on which the Government should provide time to debate.  The Government parties should consider adopting a united front in regard to that initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Has the Senator proposed two amendments to the Order of Business?  He can only propose one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No.  I have proposed one amendment to the Order of Business.  On motion No. 6, I am asking the Leader to provide Government time for a debate on it.  I will not call for a division on that issue.  It is too important a diplomatic issue for us to divide on it in the House.  Tabling of the motion follows on from a well publicised debate that the Fine Gael Party had the other day.  It seems that it would support this motion.  There seems to be no reason this motion could not be put by the Leader and taken on an all-party basis.  I encourage and urge him to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is probably a red letter day or a red dress day for women in Ireland who are delighted about the publication of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill, which will be introduced in this House later today.  It is fitting that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, has chosen to introduce it through the Seanad given the work that has been done here in the past in raising the issue of encouraging more women to enter political life.</P>
        <P>I also welcome a conference being held in DCU today on a subject of great interest to many Members of this House, the importance of ethical journalism.  Perhaps we can be grateful to Mr. Rupert Murdoch after all for showing us how low the bar went and how much work needs to be done.  The conference on ethical journalism at DCU is being sponsored by the Global Editors Network.  It represents 700 editors across 40 countries and it has launched a campaign for ethical journalism.  That is a good thing.  If we are to have a debate on this issue in the <Col N="3"/>House, we might bear in mind that campaign and invite the Global Editors Network to address the House at a later stage, given that this is an issue that is close to our hearts.  It would be good to see Ireland take a lead in encouraging and supporting ethical journalism.</P>
        <P>I would like to raise a touchy subject, that of the issue of a referendum, and suggest to the Leader that when we talk about the fiscal compact treaty next week we would concentrate our energies on the fact that we are seeking to bring stability to the eurozone.  Rather than having a row on whether we should vote on it at this point, we should concentrate on what fiscal compact treaty is, its weaknesses and merits and if it can bring stability to Europe.  That is what the Government is trying to achieve not only for Ireland but for Europe and for the world.</P>
        <P>I ask that the T&aacute;naiste reiterate his condemnation of the events in Syria.  The violence of last year, which has resulted in the death of at least 5,000 people, is continuing unabated.  The UN Security Council is discussing this with the Arab League.  I urge the Leader to ask the T&aacute;naiste to reiterate his condemnation of the violence in Syria and the repression of civil rights there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinMcAleese"><NameTxt>Senator Martin McAleese</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am happy to add my support to the motion mentioned by Senator Byrne in regard to a papal visit for the simple reason that it is a good opportunity for the Government to reassure the Irish people that our continuing diplomatic relations with the Holy See, the Vatican, are as close and as cordial as they were prior to the decision to close the Irish embassy to the Holy See.  On that point, I request the Leader to ask the T&aacute;naiste whether the decision not to maintain a resident ambassador to the Holy See was a political decision or was based on the recommendation of the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</P>
        <P>As we heard, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will be in this House this afternoon to make a statement and respond to questions from Members.  However, due to time constraints there will be limited opportunities for Members to make substantial interventions at that time.  As a result, I ask the Leader to put a number of questions to the T&aacute;naiste.  We all appreciate the important role the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has to play at this time to advance Ireland&rsquo;s interests regionally and globally.  I would like to raise a few strategic issues regarding the work of the Department.  The past year has been a significant year of change for the Department, probably the most important since its creation.  My first question relates to two  functions of the Department, first, the transfer of certain trade functions to the Department from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and, second, the possible transfer of responsibility for passports to the Department of Justice and Equality.  Regarding the transfer last summer of the trade function, it would be interesting to hear from the T&aacute;naiste how this is working in practice, what benefits it has brought in terms of marketing Ireland abroad through our embassies, how this additional responsibility is being managed, if there are resource implications or if staff were transferred from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding passports, the programme for Government envisaged the transfer of the passport service to the Department of Justice and Equality with a view to ultimately operating it as an independent agency under the aegis of that Department.  I understand the T&aacute;naiste is on record as saying that it is more appropriate for an identity document such as a passport to be issued by the Department of the Justice and Equality given that it has responsibility for citizenship law.  I would be concerned that the transfer of this service could have a negative impact on the ease of access to passport services, in particular to citizens abroad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinMcAleese"><NameTxt>Senator Martin McAleese</NameTxt>
	<P>I have.  I ask the Leader to ask the T&aacute;naiste if such a transfer of passport functions will occur and, if so, what safeguards will be built in to ensure appropriate <Col N="4"/>direct and speedy communication between the various offices and Departments, including our embassies, and to provide assurance that ease of access to passport services for our citizens is maintained.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to request the T&aacute;naiste to give his views on a strategic question, that of the need for a clear and up to date vision and public statement of the principles underlying Irish foreign policy.  The first and only White Paper on Foreign Policy was an initiative of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Dick Spring.  That document dates back to 1996 and is impressive in its scope and detail, but after 15 years the context has changed at home and abroad.  I suggest that a review of that White Paper could be a useful vehicle to consider policy priorities.  It could provide clarity within the Department and for the public on what principles and policies now guide Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and what issues we intend to focus on in light of current resource constraints.  Will the T&aacute;naiste review or consider a review of this White Paper?  I ask the Leader to put these questions to the T&aacute;naiste at the earliest opportunity.</P>

	<P>The following text is of interest:</P>
        <P LI="1">Do I feel bad about living on benefits?  Certainly!  I don&rsquo;t want to live at the Government&rsquo;s cost, which is why I treat this help as an opportunity to start my own business.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This is an accurate report of comments made by a lady called &ldquo;Magda&rdquo;, about whom we all heard yesterday.  It appears an article in a Polish newspaper was seriously misrepresented in one of our national newspapers yesterday.  I commend Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe for what she said about ethical journalism.  It is instructive for us to think for a moment about what happened.  One of our colleagues, Senator Harte, spoke eloquently on national radio yesterday criticising this person for her views and I am sure he did so in good faith.  If it had not been for that media misrepresentation, he would not have gone on the programme and said what he did.  That is how the media does a disservice at times to the public. Incidents like this one contribute to a lack of trust in the important institution that is our media.  There is a crisis in many of our institutions.  We should reflect on the need not to knock our institutions but to build them up through constructive criticism.  In light of this latest event, I would welcome that debate on media standards in this House.  It is useful to note also a very welcome initiative from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, which has launched a public consultation on a draft code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs in the broadcast media.  Many of us spoke about the Fr. Kevin Reynolds case several months ago.  The deadline for submitting responses to that is 14 March 2012.  I hope to make a submission.  Perhaps the Houses, or committees of the Houses, should consider making submissions.  Given the concerns about media standards often expressed by Members on different sides of this House, submissions should come from the world of politics to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland on this draft code.</P>
        <P>Speaking of inflammatory comments, I briefly refer to another recommendation made recently.  It was that all senior official appointments to State bodies that are likely to have to deal with the Catholic Church should be screened to ensure that they will not show inappropriate deference to the Catholic Church.  Those who feel they are Catholic first and Irish second should seek promotion in other organs of the State.  This recommendation, bizarrely, is on the cl&aacute;r of a forthcoming Labour Party conference, having been put down by the Clontarf branch in Dublin North Central.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am asking the Leader and the Deputy Leader whether they agree with me.  I have written to Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, who is Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, and have had a courteous response from him. He says he agrees with the report, which surprises me, although he disagrees with that statement.  He makes the excuse that the statement is ironic.  At one level it certainly is ironic.  Would the Leader and deputy leader agree that if such a recommendation were made about gay people &mdash; similar sentiments were expressed about Jews and communists in the past &mdash; or about members of the Anglican Communion, there would be outrage?  Would they agree with me that the motion should not have made it on to the cl&aacute;r of the Labour Party conference and now that it is there that it deserves to be condemned in the roundest terms by participants at the conference?</P>

	<P>I did not hear what Senator Keane said.  This is about attitudes to different groups and sectors in our society.  Political parties, like the media, need to show responsibility in their public utterances.  That is why this is a relevant issue which I bring before the House this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also mention the fact that this is an historic day for politics, with the introduction of the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill, which will provide for a 30% quota of women candidates.  I will speak on that Bill later today.  Sadly, quotas are necessary to increase the proportion of women candidates.  If we were to use any other method we would have to wait more than 200 years.  This has to be done.</P>
        <P>Good samaritan, or civil liability, legislation would protect members of the public who choose, out of the goodness of their hearts, to help people in trouble.  Such legislation is intended to stop people hesitating for fear of being sued.  We do not have legislation to protect such people, although other countries do.  Such legislation pertains in many civil law jurisdictions which encompass most EU states.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission examined this issue in 2009 and recommended that a legal duty of care be introduced in legislation.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to make a statement on good samaritan and civil liability legislation, and consider introducing such legislation.  We Irish are noted for being kind and good and helping people but it has been noticed that there is hesitancy in helping people.  An exercise was carried out yesterday on &ldquo;The John Murray Show&rdquo; when people helped people in cars.  It may not have been a fair exercise.  The balance of male and female in Donegal and Kerry was noted.</P><Col N="6"/>

	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business calling for a debate on unemployment.  The proposal to invite the Pope to visit Ireland is a separate matter, as far as I am aware.  I have signed a petition, at the invitation of Senator Jim Walsh, to send an invitation to the Pope.  I hope he will accept it and come.  It will be a marvellous boost to the country if he does.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader allow time for a debate on broadcasting?  I will not accept ridicule from any side of the House regarding the very important issue of information to the public from our broadcasters.  RTE is not providing for proper debate on the proposed EU treaty.  Whether a referendum is held, the treaty has been signed and will come, as a Bill, to the House and be debated.  Last night TV3, which does not receive a subsidy from our &euro;160 licence fee, broadcast a third discussion on the treaty.  Our excellent Senator Thomas Byrne, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, Deputy Stephen Donnelly and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, all spoke eloquently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I raise a serious issue, which I discussed with the Cathaoirleach yesterday.  A convicted murderer can come out of jail, having served a term, and share in or inherit the assets of the person he murdered.  A high profile case of this nature was heard in the High Court recently.  The judge overseeing the case made it clear that there was no legislation to enable him to prevent the murderer from sharing the assets of the deceased, the person he had murdered.  The people are outraged at this.  Many people have come to me about the issue.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to amend the legislation to ensure that a person convicted of murder pays, out of the assets he inherits from the person he murdered, the &euro;90,000 per year it costs the State to keep him in  prison.  Any remaining money should not be given to the convicted person by way of entitlement.</P>
        <P>It costs the State &euro;90,000 per year to incarcerate someone who has murdered a wife or husband.  The State then must watch these people coming out of jail, being handed a sum of money and laughing all the way to the bank.  I want something done about this and I ask the Leader to bring to matter to the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure that anyone who kills another person pays the price and does not benefit monetarily from it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Returning to the theme of employment, in <i>The Irish Times</i> of yesterday there is a headline that I found astonishing.  &ldquo;New rules to see serious exit from the taxi sector&rdquo;.  The Minister of State has said that numbers in the taxi industry should be reduced by between 13% and 22%.  The headline should instead read that the Minister of State wishes to see the abolition of 4,900 to 8,360 jobs.  The deregulation of the taxi sector happened in the teeth of the opposition from the Department which had done a deal to confine new entrants to those who already held licences and in the teeth of the opposition from the incumbents.  The other feature is that it increased employment in the sector by 30,000, from 2000 to date.  The Goodbody report found that the value of the time saved by not having to wait for a taxi was worth approximately &euro;790 million.  The taxi industry grew to be worth &euro;1.5 billion in 2008, compared with &euro;193 million consumer receipts on the railways and &euro;329 million on buses.  When divided by the number of drivers, the revenue per person employed is about &euro;39,000.  It is a viable business willed into existence because people started to acquire taxis whereas in the previous system they had been limited for more than 20 years.  The judgment in the court case <Col N="8"/>was that people have a right to enter a sector for which they have the skills and training and the public has the right to the services of such persons.  It is bizarre that a Minister of State should wish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am looking for the Leader to highlight our view that it is not the role of Government to reduce employment in any sector, nor is it the role of Government to create new sheltered sectors.  I ask why the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, in its Neanderthal economics wishes to announce that it would like to abolish up to 8,360 jobs in the taxi sector.  It is bizarre and it contradicts all of the economic policies that have been referred to and which are aimed at the need to reduce unemployment.  I ask the Leader to ensure that when this is debated, the good points of taxi deregulation and the Goodbody report will be used to good effect against what the Minister of State is trying to do.  It is not credible that he would wish to abolish between 13% and 22% of the jobs in a sector which is viable and is not subsidised.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Like Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe, I was aware of the conference in DCU on ethical journalism, the timing of which is appropriate.  We have seen in the past 12 months a deterioration of ethical journalism throughout the world, I would suggest, and in the British Isles, including in Ireland.  I make one point regarding Independent Newspapers.  At least when they realised they made a mistake, they corrected the record the following day.  There is nothing wrong with making a mistake although we would prefer if it did not happen particularly when translating from one language to another.  At least the following day, which is this morning, the record was corrected.  That did not happen in the situation down in Ballinasloe with regard to Father Reynolds.  This is an appropriate time for print and broadcast media outlets to reflect on their responsibility to communicate an accurate and true message as to what is happening throughout the world, to report ethically and fairly and to ensure that discourse is informed, as opposed to being led by the media.  The duty of the media is to scrutinise, analyse and examine but they certainly do not have a role in terms of setting an agenda.  It is their responsibility to report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I sincerely hope that the people who are at the conference in DCU have a fruitful discussion and suggest to the Leader that perhaps a debate on media standards here would be an appropriate topic for this House.  We have led the way in having debates on issues such as job creation and disability.  This House has a key role to play in setting the standards for ethical journalism here.</P>

	<P>I join Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe and a number of previous speakers who have called for a debate on ethical journalism.  The Leader has said he has scheduled time to discuss this important issue.  Such a debate is timely, in the wake of the article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> yesterday which has been raised by a number of other Senators.  This article was deliberate.  Its intention was to stoke up anti-social welfare and anti-immigrant sentiment.  It was shameful.  Even if they apologised, they should hang their heads in shame.  They knew exactly what they were seeking to do.  Let us be very clear, this was an attempt to stoke up tension.  One could go further and say it was an attempt to incite hatred.  Articles such as this should not appear in national newspapers.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We will hear the Leader&rsquo;s response.  Some of us have been in touch with the T&aacute;naiste, the Secretary General of the Department and the nunciature on this matter in recent months.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach made it abundantly clear that he had spoken with Cardinal Brady and Archbishop Martin and that everything listed in this motion had been attended to and done.  The Taoiseach equally has made it clear that he will extend the necessary proper official invitation once the Holy See indicates its wishes and this, apparently, is in accordance with standard proper protocol.  I say to the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il that he should check with his leader, Deputy Martin, who is a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, and he will be appraised that what I am saying is completely accurate in this respect.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste will be here today and no doubt this subject will be raised and we can then hear further on the matter.  It is a question of being patient.  Everybody&rsquo;s bona fides on this <Col N="10"/>matter are appreciated.  Matters are in hand and everything is being reviewed and is being attended to in a proper way.  I suggest that we hear what the T&aacute;naiste has to say today.  I am sure the Leader will indicate along those lines when he makes his response.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator propose that No. 6 be taken?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  When Pope John Paul II visited in 1979, there was a tremendous response from the people and it was a time of joy and hope.  In 2010, when Pope Benedict XVI came to the neighbouring island, despite advance criticism and certain elements of media hostility, he was very well received and there was a tremendous positive reaction in Britain.  I spoke to somebody in the House of Commons yesterday or the day before that who recalled the effect of that visit, not just on the Catholic community but on others of Christian faith as well.</P>
        <P>There are two types of visit and it is important not to confuse them.  There is a visitation at the behest of bishops, who would invite the Pope for a pastoral visit, but if the Pope was to attend on an official State visit, an invitation must be extended by the Government.  That is my specific suggestion.  I do not want a discordant note in this discussion as four groups have indicated a willingness to support this, and I hope there will be agreement.  We do not need a big debate and we could welcome an agreement.  At least the Seanad would have made its statement in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Relations between the Vatican and Ireland are not what they have been since 1929.  There is an opportunity to rebuild the close ties we had with the Vatican in 1929.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader accept the motion and intention on an all-party basis in the House?  That would send a clear signal that the Seanad would at least play its part in giving an indication to the Government.  I do not believe this would cause disquiet to the T&aacute;naiste, based on his comments, and some of the wording in the motion is a reflection of precisely what was said by the T&aacute;naiste to the committee.  I hope we can agree the motion as there would be <Col N="11"/>an enormous benefit.  We must consider the sense of hopelessness that many people in Ireland have, and it could have a very beneficial effect if the motion were adopted.  We do not know if it is possible for the Pontiff to visit but at least we would play our part in facilitating such a visit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">I compliment the Government on negotiating with Mr. Appleby, the Director of Corporate Enforcement, and ensuring he will stay in his post until the probe into the former Anglo Irish Bank is over.  This is a very wise decision.  It is cheap at any cost when we consider the carnage wrought on Irish families as a result of reckless banks and governance over a period.  Innocent Irish families and rural schools, for example, must take very hard cuts that would not be necessary if the awful decisions were not made by these banks, or if the previous Government had regulated the banks.</P>
        <P>On that note I raise a matter which should be of concern to everybody in the House this morning.  Overnight I learned that Bank of Ireland has seized &euro;1.1 million from the deposit accounts of Galway airport to offset loans despite repayments being fully up to date.  Members may have read this for themselves.  It is an unprecedented move.  Such action should ring alarm bells for every business in the country and I ask for an inquiry into it.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader check why and how this could happen?  Surely there must be some protection from banks moving on businesses or companies whose loans are up to date.  It is an outrage and an infringement of rights.  Where is the company law to protect us?  Will the Leader tell me which Minister has responsibility in this?  Is it the Minister for Finance?  Company law must be changed in response to this.  I want to know how Bank of Ireland can make this move without, at the very least, informing directors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Jim Walsh&rsquo;s plea, although I am not sure it needs much support as he has made a strong case and explained very well the difference between a pastoral visit from the Pope and an official State visit.  The point made was that the official state visit was so successful in Britain only last year, we should be able to achieve the same success here.  I am sure our parents told us of the success of the Eucharistic Congress in 1932 and the pride there was in Ireland on that occasion.  We are approaching another opportunity in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support Senator Barrett&rsquo;s case, although I had not quite understood the point he made.  I remember ten or 15 years ago the queues that existed trying to get taxis and how impossible it was to get one.  At one time there were 2,000 people coming for a convention in Dublin and it was almost cancelled because one person could not get over the fact that when he went out for a meal, he could not get a taxi back to his hotel.  At that time it could take three hours to get a taxi.  There is little doubt of the success of having an open market for taxis in Dublin.  It has provided employment, customer service and the wealth and success referred to by Senator Barrett.  I had not realised that steps were being taken to reduce the number of taxis in Dublin on purpose, and I assume that is being done at the behest of the taxi drivers&rsquo; association.  I <Col N="12"/>read yesterday that only those with criminal offences would have their activities limited but I gather from the Senator&rsquo;s comments that there is an ulterior motive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I urge the Leader to schedule a debate on this in order that the relevant Minister can explain the objective.  I hope Senator Barrett is not correct in what he is saying and that only people with criminal records are being barred from driving taxis.  We support that proposal but would not support a reduction of the service to the public and competitiveness of the market.</P>

	<P>A charity used to use the catchphrase, &ldquo;give a little, it will help a lot&rdquo; and I rise this morning on behalf of an advocacy group with that in mind.  If that group could be given a little, it would help a lot.  The group is Br&iacute;, a group for people with acquired brain injuries.  For several years, it has sought an identity card to be provided for people with acquired brain injuries so they can go about their lives.  I put this to the previous Minister responsible for health matters and I hoped that if the current Minister, Deputy Reilly, came to the House, we could ask him to implement such a programme.  It would be a great help for such people in going about their lives.  It would not be at great cost and it would make life easier for these people.  If the group got a little, it would help a lot.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment to the Order of Business.  I commend the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and former Congressman, Mr. Bruce Morrison.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the Irish overseas.  There has been a push for many decades on the issue and I spent some time on Capitol Hill with former Congressman Morrison and Mr. Kieran Staunton.  People are seeking a new visa Bill for the Irish, and Senator Schumer from New York has put forward legislation on the matter.  Previously, there was a provision for the undocumented, whereby they would have been able to seek waivers; unfortunately, that will not remain in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, is coming to the House this afternoon and we will put the issue to him then.  A general debate on the undocumented in Ireland would also be welcome, as families are suffering as a result of the inability of people and their loved ones to return from the United States for family events and bereavements.  There will be no waiver provision in the Bill.  There is an opportunity.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, is going to the United States next week and he will be there again in March.  I assume that the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, and the White House would provide a government to government waiver, as they did for Mexico.  That is nothing unusual.  They allowed 48,000 Mexicans to receive a waiver.  That would solve our undocumented problem literally overnight.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate, not just today on foreign affairs as he has done, which I welcome, but also on the undocumented Irish in the United States and the provision of a waiver programme.  The White House, and the Clintons who are great friends of this country, have simply not been asked.  One could ask why that is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnKelly"><NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise an important issue relating to a telephone call I received last night from a business man who is a wholesaler.  Last week he called to two businesses that were closed down and had &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; signs on them.  My constituent was owed &euro;24,000 by one business and &euro;27,000 by the other.  By virtue of the fact that the banks were not lending to the businesses the Revenue Commissioners shut them down.  They had a fire sale of the assets and the stock in the shop and &euro;30,000 worth of stock was sold off for &euro;4,000.  My constituent has no way of retrieving the &euro;51,000 he is owed by both of those creditors.  The businesses are for sale and the banks are indebted to the tune of &euro;400,000.  The banks are seeking to recoup &euro;200,000.  The man still has no way of getting his money at this stage to keep himself afloat.  He employs four people.  If he has to lay them off it will cost the taxpayer a further &euro;80,000.  It <Col N="13"/>is similar to what Senator Healy Eames said about the banks and the way the Revenue Commissioners do their business.  They are now threatening the viability of businesses themselves in a quest to ensure they get their money.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to address such issues.  Unless we do our business differently we will close down small businesses.  The likes of this should not be allowed to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I call for a debate on asylum and immigration issues and ask the Leader to inform us when the relevant legislation will be introduced.  I do so partly in light of the situation regarding the Polish woman who was mistranslated.  I wish to refer to something Killian Forde said, if I could be heard, on radio last night.  He said with regard to the tabloids that the coverage of the issues was cheap, opportunistic and nasty and should not be allowed.  I agree with him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the deportation system, we have the worst record in Europe, 98.5% of asylum cases are rejected.  On its last day in power, the appropriate Minister in the previous Government signed deportation orders for 200 people.  He said he had given due consideration to each one.  That is equivalent to a rate of approximately two minutes per case.  Earlier this week I attended an event organised by BeLong To in Capel Street, an organisation for young gay people which is quite extraordinary.  It has taken an important initiative, supported by Pobal and the HSE, in which it is involved in an educational process with the asylum authorities.  We have had a situation where, for example, an Algerian man was refused because the person in charge said that his demeanour suggested that he was not gay.  That is the most extraordinary stereotyping.  In other words, as he appeared masculine, he could not possibly be gay.  That is the kind of extraordinary attitude women used to suffer.  A Ugandan man was questioned about the existence of nightclubs.  He did not know about them.  It is astonishing that this level of ignorance should persist.  People have also been returned to Nigeria &mdash; where they are in the process of reintroducing the death penalty &mdash; and to places such as Uganda.  Gay people are told that they should conceal their identity.  That is against protocols passed by the United Nations.  Let us imagine if one were told that even if one is a Christian that one could not exhibit it in any way, that one had to conceal it, or that one had to conceal a political opinion.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone"><NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment RTE on its current series, &ldquo;Operation Transformation&rdquo;.  It has got people moving around the country and it is making them aware of the problem we have.  It highlighted to me the fact that food chains, in particular fast food chains, are not doing what is being done in the United States and in the United Kingdom now, namely, displaying food calories on their menu boards.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has written to the various fast food businesses in the country but he has had a limited response.  Legislation has been introduced in the UK and if it is required in this country we should introduce it.  McDonalds in the North, for example, has calorie counts for each item on its menu boards.  It should be very easy for it to do the same in the Republic but it could be viewed as a disincentive for certain customers.  Whatever the reason, it would be an incentive for menu items with a lower calorie count if the calories were listed on menu boards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an epidemic in this country and we are heading the same way as the US in this regard.  We should take the lead from the US where the obesity problem is chronic.  We are definitely heading in that direction.  I do not know the exact statistics but I will do some research <Col N="14"/>on it in the coming days.  The statistics for the numbers of people in this country who are obese or overweight are increasing every day among the young and those who are pregnant.  It is a serious issue.  If we need legislation I see no reason not to introduce it to make businesses show the calories contained in its food, especially if they are already doing it, for example, in the North of Ireland.  They are selling the same food all over the world and it is very easy for them to do.  Supermacs has given the ridiculous excuse that it would clutter the menu boards.  That is absurd.  This issue may sound &ldquo;fluffy&rdquo; compared with economic issues but it will cost the country a fortune in the future because the health service will be completely stuffed with people who have illnesses relating to obesity.  I call for a debate on obesity, healthy eating and the related issue of alcohol with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, if he can afford us some time.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We had many calls this morning for a debate on ethical journalism but we need a debate on ethical banking.  A situation was highlighted by my colleague, Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, in which Bank of Ireland lifted &euro;1.1 million from Galway Airport&rsquo;s bank account to offset against loans.  I wish to make it clear that Bank of Ireland did nothing illegal, but morally it was outrageous.  This has been done at a time when the airport is trying to attract investment and it has devalued the asset that is Galway Airport.  The money must be restored to its bank account.</P>
        <P>My colleague highlighted the experiences of business customers with the banks.  What Bank of Ireland has done to Galway Airport other banks are doing to small businesses.  The matter must be thoroughly investigated.  Treating business customers in this way damages job retention and prevents job creation.  Given the fact that the State has invested so much money in bailing out the banks, they have a responsibility to aid in the recovery of the economy.  There are grounds for a major Seanad debate on the ethics of banking.</P>

	<P>For the information of the House on an issue raised by Senator Terry Leyden, the European flag has not been on display in the Chamber since Ireland last held the Presidency of the European Union.  It will be replaced in 2013 when we will again hold the Presidency.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his explanation, as I did not have an answer for Senator Terry Leyden.</P>
        <P>Senator Thomas Byrne, acting Leader of the Opposition, referred to job creation, the Government&rsquo;s No. 1 priority.  Further announcements on a strategy will be made during the coming weeks.  The Seanad has had an input, as I have forwarded the bullet points of our debate on job creation to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry.  Our points will be taken into consideration.  The Seanad is, once again, playing an active role in suggesting ideas for job creation.  We should continue in this vein.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader agree to hold a debate on the matter in accordance with my amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>No, as we cannot get Ministers to drop everything at the drop of a hat and debate an issue in the Seanad, but I will endeavour to arrange for the Minister to attend the House as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, an amendment will be pressed in respect of non-Government motion No. 6.  Senator Paul Coghlan has explained the position and the Taoiseach has discussed the matter with the Cardinal and the Archbishop.  I understand the Catholic bishops are in contact with Rome with a view to determining whether the Pope wishes to visit.  If he indicates that he does, the Government has stated it will respond positively and that an invitation will be forthcoming.  I hope the amendment will not be pressed, as it could embarrass the Pope.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Good God.  With the exception of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, four groups in the Seanad have backed the motion.</P>

	<P>Protocol must be observed at all times.

	<P>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe referred to the situation in Syria.  I hope she will ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade about the matter when he is present in the Chamber in the afternoon when I am sure there will be a number of questions asked about the situation in Syria.</P><Col N="16"/>
        <P>I assure Senator Martin McAleese that our relationship with the Vatican is close and cordial and will continue to be so.  I hope he will pose the questions he asked to the T&aacute;naiste directly this afternoon.</P>
        <P>Senators R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, David Norris and others raised the misrepresentation of the facts yesterday by the media in respect of a Polish national.  That it occurred is unfortunate and I am glad the matter is being attended to today.  Newspapers should be more careful when publishing such articles.  I have twice advised the House that we will debate the issue of media standards with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, on 22 February.</P>
        <P>Senator C&aacute;it Keane asked whether the Minister for Justice and Equality intended to introduce good samaritan and civil liability legislation.  I will inquire about the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Denis Landy asked about the lack of legislation to prevent murderers from sharing their victims&rsquo; assets.  I will raise this matter of public concern with the Minister for Justice and Equality to determine whether he intends to introduce legislation.</P>
        <P>Senators Sean D. Barrett and Feargal Quinn mentioned the taxi industry, on which I understand a report has been commissioned and is due to be published shortly.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, has indicated his willingness to attend the House as soon as the report is published in order that we might discuss it.</P>
        <P>Senators David Cullinane and David Norris asked for a debate on the issues of immigration and integration.  We will try to arrange such a debate in early course.</P>
        <P>Senator Paul Coghlan outlined the position on the proposed papal visit.  Senator Jim Walsh also addressed the issue.</P>
        <P>Senators Fidelma Healy Eames and Michael Mullins referred to the Bank of Ireland seizing &euro;1.1 million of Galway Airport&rsquo;s money, even though all repayments were up to date.  It is extraordinary and I am sure the company will take action against the bank.  If it is up to date with its repayments, I do not know how the money could have been seized.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Leader to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Tom Sheahan asked about identity cards for people with an acquired brain injury.  I will inquire to determine whether the Minister for Health has intentions in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Mark Daly asked about the undocumented Irish.  I understand a Bill is making its way through Congress and that a waiver for the undocumented Irish is still on the cards. The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have spoken and continue to speak to politicians of Irish descent in the United States on the issue.  The Government is maintaining the pressure for action to be taken.</P>
        <P>Senator John Kelly, among others, called for a debate on the banking sector and, in particular, the attitude of banks to small business.  I agree that we should have a continuing debate on this issue.  The Government is pressing the banks on a monthly basis to show they are lending to small business.  An ongoing debate in the House would keep us informed of the situation and allow us to discuss developments as they occur.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Catherine Noone observed that fast food outlets in the State were not obliged to display calorie and nutrition information in store.  I understand legislation on food labelling <Col N="17"/>will be introduced in the coming months which may encompass this issue.  However, it is worth noting that studies suggest there is no evidence that the provision of such information is effective in combating obesity levels.  That will be a subject for debate when the legislation is brought before the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about reductions in the teacher allocations in rural schools.  This issue was discussed last night during the Adjournment debate.  In addition, I understand the Fianna F&aacute;il Party intends to raise it during Private Members&rsquo; time next week.  That will afford another opportunity to discuss the matter.</P>
        <P>In regard to proposals that the Northern Ireland First Minister and Deputy First Minister be invited to address the House, that is a matter for discussion at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I will also raise it with the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill, which I am commending to the House, while not the longest legislation the Seanad has ever debated, is one of the most significant.  When enacted, it will change fundamentally the way politics is funded and conducted in Ireland.  Corporate donations will be severely curtailed, the books of political parties will be opened up to public scrutiny, the maximum amount that can be accepted as a political donation will be more than halved and there will be greater openness, with significant reductions in the thresholds for the public declaration of political donations.  Other measures in the Bill provide for greater transparency by donors and those in receipt of political donations.</P>
        <P>The people have a right to know how their political system and political parties are funded.  This Bill goes further than any previous legislation in asserting that right.  Excessive and secretive corporate funding of politics is corrosive to democracy and public trust in politics.  Most <Col N="20"/>people who have reflected on the funding of political parties have come to the conclusion that corporate donations need to be restricted.  It is better to have a system of funding based on a large number of small donations from citizens rather than a small number of large donations from big business, which is what this Bill sets out to achieve.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a member of the Council of Europe Group of States Against Corruption, GRECO.  In 2009, this body undertook an evaluation study of Ireland&rsquo;s political system, specifically examining the issue of party funding.</P>
        <P>Among the recommendations made was that all registered political parties should prepare independently audited accounts which would be made public in a timely and accessible way.  It was also recommended that consideration be given to lowering the current disclosure threshold for political donations.  Similar proposals have been made by the Standards in Public Office Commission.</P>

	<P>On a point of order, are copies of the Minister&rsquo;s speech available?  Perhaps the Deputy Leader might take action in respect of this matter.  It would be appreciated if something could be done to ensure that there will be no repeat of this occurrence.  It is a discourtesy &mdash; I accept that it is unintended &mdash; to Members of the Seanad that copies of the Minister&rsquo;s script are not available.  It is much easier to engage with what a Minister is saying if his or her speech is provided.  Out of respect for everyone involved, ministerial speeches should be available from the outset.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Bill will directly respond to the recommendations to which I refer.  It will also address recommendations made in the Moriarty tribunal report which was published in 2011.</P>
        <P>The Bill is an important step towards achieving a significant improvement in the balance of representation in the D&aacute;il between men and women.  When citizens consider our national Parliament, they should see something more akin to their own reflection looking back at them.  This is not currently the case with 183 men and 43 women.  That is hardly balanced representation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I will now outline for Senators the principal elements in the Bill.  We will have an opportunity to scrutinise each section in more detail on Committee Stage.  The Bill will reduce the current limits for acceptance of political donations and the thresholds for declaration of these donations.  In doing so, it is noteworthy that the financial amounts set out in the existing legislation are given in punts &mdash; old money &mdash; even though the euro has been our currency for the past ten years.  This says something with regard to the overdue nature of the changes we are making.  The Electoral Act 1997 is almost 15 years old.  The rules on political donations were incorporated into the Act in 2001.  A major revision in Ireland&rsquo;s laws on political funding is, therefore, long overdue.</P>
        <P>Part 1 entitled &ldquo;Preliminary and General&rdquo;, contains standard provisions of a general and technical nature.  Part 2, entitled &ldquo;Amendment of Electoral Act 1997&rdquo;, provides for changes to donation and declaration amounts and introduces new conditions for corporate donations.  The maximum amount that can be accepted as a donation by a political party, an accounting unit of a political party or a third party is being reduced to &euro;2,500.  The current figure is &euro;6,348.69.  The maximum amount that can be accepted as a political donation by an individual is being reduced from &euro;2,539.48 to &euro;1,000.  This new limit will apply in respect of donations to a Member <Col N="21"/>of either House of the Oireachtas or a Member of the European Parliament, as well as to a candidate in a presidential, D&aacute;il, Seanad or European Parliament election.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government makes clear this Administration&rsquo;s position that the role of corporate political donations in Irish politics must be curtailed.  The measures in the Bill will give effect to this commitment, having regard to the need to respect Ireland&rsquo;s Constitution and our commitments under international and European law.  Our objective is to restrict the influence of corporate donors.  The Bill will do that to the maximum extent feasible and permissible.  Provision is made for a ban on the acceptance of donations or more than &euro;200 for political purposes from a corporate donor unless the donor has registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Such donations must also be accompanied by a statement confirming that the donation has been approved by a general meeting of the members of the body or by its trustees.</P>
        <P>Allowing corporate donations of up to &euro;200 to be accepted without having to comply with the new requirements is based on practical considerations regarding implementation.  It is considered that placing the additional disclosure and approval conditions on relatively small donations of under &euro;200 from businesses or organisations would not be fair or practical.  For example, if there was no lower limit, a local business placing a poster in a shop window in support of a candidate could be regarded as giving a corporate donation by way of a benefit-in-kind.  A shop owner who buys a raffle ticket or offers a small spot prize for a local function could similarly be regarded as giving a corporate donation.  An exemption from the new registration requirements is given to a provider of a programme of education and training or a student&rsquo;s union where such a body makes a payment to a student society or club.  This will allow colleges or students&rsquo; unions to continue to provide financial support to student groups that promote political participation without being obliged to comply with the new corporate donor requirements.  I am sure Members will agree that these grants to student societies can hardly be regarded as the sort of corporate donations which need to be restricted and that this exemption does not contradict our objective of enhancing the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine as long as the students involved use the donations for political purposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Senator will ensure that the students who vote for him in Seanad elections will use such donations for those very purposes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Provision is made for the establishment of a register of corporate donors.  This register will be published in order that people, particularly voters, will know which corporate donors intend to provide funds for political parties, election candidates or elected representatives.  The term &ldquo;corporate donor&rdquo;, as defined in section 5, includes all corporate and unincorporated bodies and trusts.  This definition embraces companies, partnerships, trade unions, trusts, co-operatives, societies, building societies, charitable organisations, non-governmental organisations, clubs, associations and any other unincorporated bodies of persons.  In other words, all bodies and organisations other than natural persons.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have mentioned the reductions in the value of donations that may be accepted.  In addition, the threshold at which donations must be declared by a political party to the Standards in Public Office Commission will fall from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500.  The declaration threshold for a donation received by a candidate or elected representative is being reduced from &euro;634.87 to &euro;600.  There is provision for a reduction from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;200 in the threshold at which donations must be reported by companies, trade unions, societies and building societies in their annual reports or returns.  Part 2 also provides for a reduction in the threshold for donors other <Col N="22"/>than companies, trade unions, societies and building societies in reporting donations to the Standards in Public Office Commission, from a figure of &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500 for aggregate donations given in the same year.  Part 3 provides for the necessary amendments to the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 to enable the new requirements on political donations which I have outlined to apply at local elections.</P>
        <P>Part 4, entitled &ldquo;Political Parties &mdash; Disclosure of Accounts&rdquo;, provides for all registered political parties to prepare an annual statement of accounts and an auditor&rsquo;s report.  These are to be submitted each year to the Standards in Public Office Commission for publication.  In the event of non-compliance with these provisions, funding made available to political parties by the State under Part 3 of the Electoral Act 1997 is to be withheld.  The format of the accounts will be based on guidelines prepared by the Commission, in consultation with political parties, and approved by the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 5 is entitled &ldquo;State Funding of Political Parties and Gender Balance&rdquo;.  The proportion of men to women in the population is approximately 50:50 but this has never been reflected in D&aacute;il representation.  Just over 15% of the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are women.  The fact that this is the highest level of female representation achieved in the history of the State says something.  It has taken too long to travel this short distance.</P>
        <P>Experience shows that if we leave matters alone, the situation will not improve as quickly or as significantly as we want.  We cannot continue to drift along in respect of this matter.  We must take action.  The provisions in Part 5 are designed to hasten our journey towards greater gender equality.  Parties which do not select at least 30% women candidates at the next general election will face losing half of their State funding.  This would be not just for one year but rather for the lifetime of the next D&aacute;il.  To put the potential impact of non-compliance into perspective, a total of &euro;5.38 million was paid to five qualified political parties in 2010 under the Electoral Act 1997.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate that the Bill is commencing its passage through the Oireachtas in the Seanad.  Members of this House have played a particularly crucial role in highlighting the need for legislation to address the shortcomings in our democratic system.  My party colleague, Senator Keane, has been vocal, in public and behind the scenes, in pushing for these reforms.  I also acknowledge the work of Senator Bacik in the preparation of the report, Women&rsquo;s Participation in Politics, published in 2009 by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  The work of that committee informed the design of the legislation now before the House.  I will quote directly from the summary of findings in chapter 5 of the committee&rsquo;s report, which concludes:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . it appears that the single most effective reform for women in Ireland would be the introduction of mandatory positive action measures through legislation requiring political parties to adopt gender targets or quotas in their candidate selection process.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">If such legislation were to be adopted in Ireland, its framing would be critical. In Belgium, for example, under the Smet-Tobback law, a maximum limit is placed on candidates of each gender, i.e. parties are penalised if more than two-thirds of their candidates are of one gender.  This may be a better formula than provision for a minimum number of women candidates.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">A realistic sanction would also have to be imposed where political parties exceed the target prescribed, perhaps based on the French model of financial penalties.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The system set out in the Bill has regard to experience in other jurisdictions.  It draws on models that have succeeded elsewhere, while having particular regard to Ireland&rsquo;s legal and constitutional framework.</P><Col N="23"/>
        <P>Since details of the Bill were published in June last year, there has been a significant public debate on the gender balance provisions.  Some public figures, in questioning the need for these measures, have suggested they may be unconstitutional.  While I welcome the debate, I reject these views.  The provisions are robust.</P>
        <P>The provision contained in the Bill is designed as an incentive mechanism to encourage political parties to apply a more equal gender balance in the selection of candidates.  It is a proportionate response to address a significant weakness in Ireland&rsquo;s democratic system.  In contrast to those questioning the constitutionality of the provision, others have pressed for a similar measure to be put in place for local elections, the objective being to encourage more women to stand in local elections through active measures such as those set out in the Bill.  I agree with the principle articulated.  However, I am not in a position to apply similar gender balance measures to candidate selection at local elections.</P>
        <P>Funding provided for political parties under the Electoral Act 1997 is linked with performance at general elections.  The reduction in funding paid to political parties which do not meet the new gender balance requirements will, therefore, be linked with the candidates of political parties at general elections.  There is no direct funding mechanism attached to local election candidates or political parties and groups contesting local elections.  Nevertheless, while the measures will not formally apply at local elections, I expect that in practice political parties will act and some have already stated they will.  At a minimum, parties preparing candidates for a general election are likely to select a more balanced ticket for local elections.  There is a clear incentive for them to do so.  It can be anticipated that an increase in the number of women candidates at local elections will follow as a consequence of the legislation.</P>
        <P>On the timing of the coming into effect of the provisions, the Bill adopts both an ambitious and pragmatic approach.  This is particularly so when bearing in mind the base-line from which we are starting.  At the general election held in February 2011, 86 of the 566 candidates who sought election were women, representing 15.19% of the total.  If the Bill is passed, the intended outcome is to effectively double this figure to 30% in one general election cycle.  Provision is then made for this figure to increase to 40%, with a minimum of seven years allowed for this change to take effect.</P>
        <P>I want to explain the rationale behind this approach.  Section 16 of the Electoral Act provides that payments made to political parties under the Act are based on their performance at the last preceding general election.  Therefore, the change from 30% to 40% has to be made with reference to the holding of a general election rather than to a fixed time period only.  Otherwise there would be potential for a situation where both the 30% and the 40% gender balance provision could end up being used as a criterion for payments to political parties in respect of the same general election.  In the interests of fairness and in order to ensure compliance with the legislation the Bill must be very clear about when the change from 30% to 40% will apply.  The formula used in the Bill achieves this clarity in a balanced and fair, yet ambitious way.  I ask anyone who seeks to criticise the Bill for not going far enough to bear these points in mind.  We need to be mindful of how far the provisions in the Bill go.  They are ground-breaking and provide for real change and reform.</P>
        <P>Reform of political funding has been promised for years and although the Government has been in office for less than one year, we are presenting another far-reaching and progressive piece of reforming legislation.  The Bill will significantly enhance the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland.  The corporate funding of politics comes at a price above and beyond the value of any donations given and accepted.  It brings with it an unavoidable perception of a mutually beneficial relationship.  As we have seen in Ireland in recent years, this can have an incrementally corrosive impact on public trust in politics.</P><Col N="24"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill will decisively shift the balance of the political funding and regulatory system in favour of the citizen.  It will affirm the right in law to know how politics is funded, who is providing the funding and how that money is spent.  The gender balance provision linking the State funding of political parties with candidate selection at D&aacute;il elections has the potential to change the face of politics forever.  This is real change and reform.  I ask Senators to give the Bill the consideration it deserves as comprehensive, progressive and much needed legislation.  I look forward to hearing their views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AverilPower"><NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome those in the Visitors Gallery.  It is great to see so many women in the Chamber, although there is a good gender balance in the Seanad, due in large part &mdash; this should be acknowledged &mdash; to the fact that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste in appointing the 11 nominees to the House wisely chose seven women.  We have seen the contributions these women have made to the House.  I also acknowledge the presence for the debate of former Senator Mary Henry and the contribution she made over a long period.  She was a role model for many women.</P>
        <P>As the Minister pointed out, women have never made up more than 15% of the membership of the Lower House.  It is worth recognising &mdash; I make this point in particular to those who point out that this will change over time &mdash; that no real progress has been made in the past 20 years.  In the most recent general election in 2011 only five more women were elected than in 1992.  The percentage increased from 12% in 1992 to 15% last year.  The reason for this is very clear: the parties have not offered the electorate a choice.</P>
        <P>Of the 556 candidates who ran in the most recent general election, only 86 or 15% were women.  There is a direct correlation between the number of candidates offered to the electorate and the number of women who make it through.  As some constituencies have had no female candidates, what choice have voters had in these constituencies?  When I ran in Dublin North-East, I was the only woman on the ticket.  This did not offer a real choice of gender balance to voters in the constituency.  Parties of all hues, my own included, have failed Irish democracy during the years by not giving the electorate a real choice.  It is welcome that the Bill will address this issue.</P>
        <P>The lack of women in politics has a real impact.  Although the lives of men and women have changed much and have become increasingly similar in many ways, there are still so many ways in which they are different.  Increasingly, men look after their children and play a caring role in the family, but the vast majority of people who do so on a full-time basis are female, whether it is looking after a child or an elderly parent.  The majority in part-time work are female, as are the majority of those subjected to domestic violence.  Until our democracy is more representative of the population, certain issues which will never really be addressed by the political system.  Therefore, I welcome the measures brought forward in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Like many others, I am a reluctant supporter of quotas.  None of us want quotas and I do not think anybody thinks they represent a a good option.  However, they are a necessary evil.  I appreciate the significant opposition to them outside the House, and there is certainly significant opposition to them in my party.  I have received e-mails and correspondence from people who are deeply unhappy about the idea which they see as undemocratic.  Equally, I point out that in the history of the State the number of women elected points to the fact that the system is undemocratic and represents a failure of democracy.  If the system was perfect, we would not need to tinker with it, but it is fundamentally flawed.  The all-party committee came to the conclusion that the experience in other countries showed that the system could not and would not change unless positive measures were put in place.  That is why we must support the Bill.</P><Col N="25"/>
        <P>Crucially, the report also found that quotas alone would not fix the problem and that we needed a comprehensive package of reforms addressing other issues such as child care, the procedures of the Houses and working hours.  We also need training and support for new female candidates.  It is encouraging to see the 50:50 Group advocating strongly for a change in Irish politics.  Some of its members are present.  Women for Election has received substantial philanthropic funding for the provision of training and mentoring support for women.  This will ensure the candidates put forward by all parties will have the supports needed to be successful.</P>
        <P>It is often said women do not put themselves forward for election.  That really upsets me because it is too easy for parties to say this.  As all Members know, in every constituency women are involved in chambers of commerce and running community projects.  I am often contacted by women from a local group involved in a campaign.  Women are on the boards of management of the local schools and therefore are involved in politics in the broader sense.  If they are not involved in party politics we need to examine what is wrong with politics and not ask what is wrong with women.  If women are taking leadership roles in community organisations and in other professions, which is a dramatic change in recent years, and politics has not changed in 20 years we must examine the political system and change it.  We must change the culture also and I hope that by having a critical mass of women elected to Parliament young girls will see pictures of those parliamentarians and think that is a job they could do.  We need more role models in that regard but, unfortunately, politics is seen as the preserve of men.  We support the legislation although I will table two amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I accept the point the Minister made about the local elections and the way the legislation is currently structured, which is based on general election funding, but I am not sure that has to be the case.  We will look into that in more detail before the Bill comes back for Committee Stage but I do not understand why funding cannot be apportioned on the basis of general election performance, subject to review after the following local election.  That would be an incentive for parties to keep up at the local election because the local elections are crucial.  Of the 83 new Deputies elected to the D&aacute;il last year two thirds were councillors while candidates with no previous experience in elected office generally faired poorly, getting less than 1,000 first preference votes.  The local elections are a key starting point in this regard and the legislation should be amended to change that.  Just because the funding donation is phrased in a particular way currently does not mean it has to remain that way.  We need to be a bit more creative in that regard.</P>
        <P>I will propose a sunset clause on Committee Stage in that once the number of women elected to the D&aacute;il reaches 40% and remains at that level for the next two general elections, the quotas would go.  That is crucial.  The quota system should not be in place forever.  I would be a reluctant supporter of quotas but once the change has been made and, crucially, once we have that critical mass in Parliament, they should go.  We intend to table an amendment in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the issue of political donations, as the Minister is aware my party introduced a much more comprehensive political donations Bill last year but it was rejected by the Government.  We want to ban corporate donations within constitutional limits but we were advised it would not be constitutional to fully ban them and instead proposed that a &euro;100 limit be set on them, which I think would cover the cost of a poster in a shop window.  We proposed that and it should be taken up.  Only an individual who is entitled to vote should give a donation.  I do not support corporate donations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also proposed a lower threshold for the declaration of donations which is crucial because in many respects it is the mystique about donations that causes a lack of confidence in the system and people not knowing who is giving what to whom.  That is the reason we proposed <Col N="26"/>a much lower threshold. The change in the Bill which will require individual candidates to declare donations over &euro;600 as opposed to the previous figure of &euro;634 will not make a tangible difference.  I would like the limit to be much lower.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il supports both aspects of the Bill but we would like to see it improved and will table amendments on Committee Stage to that effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome Dr. Mary Henry to the Seanad and commend all she has done for women in politics.  Dr. Henry worked with the former Minister, Gemma Hussey, and the former Deputy, Monica Barnes, in that regard.  They were three great fighters for women in politics, with many others.  I welcome also the people in the Visitors Gallery from the 50:50 Group, the large delegation from Cork, the representatives from Women for Election, as well as Fiona Buckley, Claire McGing and Yvonne Galligan, to name but a few.  There are many more present but I will not read out all the names.  I welcome also the three men who have come to back them up.  That is important because women need men and men need women.  The 50:50 Group was given the right name in that regard because it does not mean women representing women but women and men for all.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this historic Bill on political funding and urge its acceptance by the House.  It is a landmark day in Irish politics, and for Irish women in particular, and I thank the Minister for introducing it in the Seanad.  The proposed legislation puts forward a structured, comprehensive and legally sound basis for transforming the way politics is funded in our country, making our democracy more transparent, achieving greater representation in these Houses in terms of gender balance, and ensuring a more equal and fair society.  If the Bill is passed it will be a positive and historic change in the way politics is conducted in Ireland.  It will break the ties, be they perceived or otherwise, between business and politics which has long been advocated from all sides of this House but has yet gone undelivered.</P>
        <P>The Minister outlined the various changes made regarding political donations and there are huge reductions in that regard.  For instance, donations of &euro;6,300 can currently be accepted by a political party but that is being reduced to &euro;2,500 and donations to a candidate are being reduced from &euro;2,500 to &euro;1,000.  That is a major change.</P>
        <P>I welcome section 8 which proposes the introduction of a register of corporate donors where a donation exceeds &euro;200 a year.  That must be welcomed as it makes the donating process more open and transparent, which is what everybody wants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the provision in the Bill to place an onus on companies to declare any donations they make to political parties and the new register of political donors, which will be maintained by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, and will include the names of any corporate owners intending to donate more than &euro;200 to any political party or individual over the calendar year.  Furthermore, parties are required to have independently audited accounts.  I will not go into detail on that as the Minister outlined it in his contribution.</P>
        <P>The Moriarty tribunal recommendations must be mentioned in any discussion about political funding as its findings have made a substantial contribution to the consideration of policy in this area.  The recommendations from the tribunal are made in a report that lays bare the failings in the system that existed at that time.  While I acknowledge that rules and regulations have changed since the 1990s, some of the failings identified prevailed until today when major changes are being made.  It must be noted also that the recommendations and views put forward in the Moriarty tribunal are taken on board in the drafting of this Bill, as well as some similar recommendations made by other bodies.</P><Col N="27"/>
        <P>Ireland is a member of the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption.  In 2009 that body undertook an evaluation study of Ireland&rsquo;s political system, specifically examining the issue of party funding.  Among the recommendations made was that all registered political parties should prepare independently audited accounts that would be made public in a timely and accessible way.  The Minister has done that today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the provision in the Bill that will penalise political parties that receive State funding if they do not have at least 30% female candidates and 30% male candidates in the next general election.  That figure will increase to 40% by 2025.  It is hoped that eventually there will be a quota of 50:50, which is the aspiration of the group present in the Visitors Gallery, and mine, in a general election.</P>
        <P>The debate on the introduction of gender quotas in politics is controversial and the arguments on both sides are compelling.  Twenty years ago when I was elected first and new to politics, and even 15 years after that, I was against quotas.  Sadly, I had to change my mind because the international evidence is that countries that fair best in equality of representation are those that introduced quotas.  At the rate we are going it would take us over 200 years to reach any mass.  We must introduce quotas.  The international community today recommends that a number of measures be taken to promote more balanced representation of men and women in decision making bodies.  The shift in equality policy towards affirmative action policies is supported by the 1979 United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  It is now 33 years later, and that is the reason I changed my mind.</P>
        <P>One of the 12 objectives of the Beijing Platform for Action adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995 was formulated as women&rsquo;s equal access and full participation in the power structures.  The clearly stated aim in that document is to achieve gender balance in the nomination process as well as in all the decision making processes.  The platform refers to discriminatory attitudes and practices, unequal power relations, shifting the focus from women, lack of resources, and the practices of political institutions and parties.  Consequently, the affirmative actions we are taking under this Bill today are recommended, even if the controversial word &ldquo;quotas&rdquo; is not a favourite.</P>
        <P>Gender balance in decision making is a stated goal of the European Union.  Ireland lags way behind its European Union counterparts when it comes to female participation.  If we are to change we have to take affirmative action.  During the past 15 years female representation has increased significantly in almost all EU states.  Today, the average participation rate in the EU nations is 24%, which I am aware is poor.  In Sweden, 45% of the national elected representatives in the Lower House are women.  The figure for Norway is 39.6% and the figure for Germany is 32%.   Why are the figures greater in those countries?  It is because quotas are in place in those countries and they have had successful outcomes.  We must follow suit.  We do not want to look bad compared to Lesotho, Sudan and Iraq which have higher rates of female representation in their national parliaments.  That is a cause for alarm when we consider that these are developing nations which have been war-torn for many years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The failure of successive Governments and political parties to confront gender imbalance has meant that female representation here has never reached more than 40%.  That is a poor reflection of our representative democracy and it is time appropriate measures were taken to address it.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Hogan, for taking those measures today.</P>
        <P>While the introduction of quotas is necessary if we are to achieve a higher level of female representation, we must examine the best quota application of the PR-STV system that is in place in Ireland.  I refer to section 27 which proposes that a reduction of 50% in the funding of political parties will come into effect at the next general election.  Alternative methods of <Col N="28"/>encouraging more women to present themselves for election must also be encouraged.  That would help to increase the pool of aspiring candidates and make the transition to the conditions of this new legislation more seamless.  The direct measures could include supporting women and men in education, provision to reconcile family and public life, available child care facilities, and good maternity and paid paternity leave.  The work-life balance of the male and female politician must be examined if we are to encourage balanced representation in these Houses.  Measures such as those I have outlined could be considered to enable us achieve our aim.  A bottom-up approach must be taken alongside this, which should begin at grassroots level in our schools and homes to promote a work-life balance for all people in political life.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 27 amends section 17 of the principal Act.  In addition to parties being required to furnish the names of candidates elected and not elected, I suggest that the constituency of the candidate should be submitted to the Standards in Public Office, SIPO, Commission also as this would be useful for academic research after the elections as well as being able to see at a glance the constituencies in which female and male candidates were fielded, and whether there was a balance in terms of three, four and five seat constituencies, to ensure females did not end up in the no hope constituencies, if there are such constituencies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>The PR-STV system presents more difficulties for the election of women because of the small number of seats in each constituency.  This is borne out by the fact that there is a tendency for there to be higher levels of female candidates in the larger constituencies.  Women accounted for 13.8% of the candidates in three seat constituencies, 15.4% in four seat constituencies and 16.2% in five seat constituencies in the 2011 general election.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Ms Fiona Buckley, UCC, Ms Claire McGing and those involved with women for politics in the Visitors Gallery for all the research done on this issue for every party in this House and for all the documents we have read on this subject in recent years, and I commend all the groups that have been recently set up.</P>
        <P>Parties must encourage local level selection conventions to select women candidates as this may not be done on a voluntary basis, as we know given that we have to introduce quotas.  Preferably women should not have to be added as additional candidates simply for the sake of meeting quotas, as this may mean they may not have the support of the party organisation and may not have adequate support through an election campaign to win.  We do not want it said after an election that women were given a chance but they fouled it up.</P>
        <P>We all know the benefit of the party grassroots canvassing on the ground to aid or hinder the success of a candidate be it a male or female candidate.  There is an onus on all central party organisers to raise awareness among candidate selection committees locally and to engage in the exercise of actively seeking women candidates from existing members of the party or community.  The way the organisation of committees and parties run selection conventions, the timing of them and the transparency of what funding or assistance might be available to candidates with little or no means stops many potential male and female candidates putting themselves forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although gender quotas at national level are welcome, I suggest that the Government should consider implementing them at local level.  I know the Minister spoke about that and why he could not do it at this stage.  Local government is where politicians cut their teeth and if representatives do not have a significant local profile, they will not get it at national level.  There is no direct funding mechanism attached to local elections.</P>

However, I believe in quotas when necessary and I believe the introduction of gender quotas for candidate selection is extremely necessary here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Women account for half of the Irish population, yet we are vastly under-represented in the policy and decision making process that shapes our future.  This is not because women are disinterested.  I know from personal experience with the girl guides and civil society organisations the passion and commitment of many women and the vital role they play in shaping Ireland for the better.  One need only go to any town or community in Ireland to see this role very clearly demonstrated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The historic and persistent under-representation of women in Irish politics is problematic in the interests of democracy and from a human rights perspective.  We recently celebrated the passage of 90 years since women in Ireland first won the right to vote and since the election of Countess Markievicz as the first female Deputy and MP elected.  The intervening years have not boded well for gender parity representation in Irish politics.  Ireland has one of the worst records of women&rsquo;s representation in national parliaments worldwide.  We are currently ranked 22nd out of 27 EU member states and 79th in international rankings.  Since the foundation of the State in 1918 our D&aacute;il has never had less than 85% male representation.  As leader of an independent group of Senators I am part of a group with 57% female membership.  That has not done us any harm but it is an anomaly.  Out of a total of 1,620 Seanad seats filled between 1922 and 2009 only 9.3% have been by women.  It is fitting that the Bill should be initiated in this House and that we are making a move towards balanced gender representation by way of affirmative action and the application of a legislative gender quota.  For those who remain <Col N="30"/>sceptical about the effectiveness of gender quotas, it should be noted that of the world&rsquo;s top ten democratic parliaments in terms of representation of women, eight employ a genderquota.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have two concerns with respect to the Bill.  Are we missing an opportunity by not applying a gender quota to European and local elections?  I agree fully with the 50:50 Group and its contention that for quota legislation to be meaningful and work, it must be extended to local government.  By failing to do that, we run the risk of making the same mistake as was made in France where women who do not come from a political family are effectively excluded from entering local politics and thus gaining political legitimacy within their constituency.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that we must ensure that the gender quota is not only implemented in isolation but that we must also encourage women to run for election.  In this regard, I commend the initiative of Women for Election who endeavour to inspire, equip and inform women to run for political office and to provide tailored training and support programmes for interested women.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the debate today and on the later Stages in the coming weeks to ensure that Ireland enters the ranks of the top ten democratic parliaments.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A quota has been broken.  I thank my colleague, Senator van Turnhout, for sharing time with me. </P>
	<P Just="Left">First, I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill, and particularly on introducing it in the Seanad.  The Bill is historic and a profound opportunity to enhance the political culture and the participation of citizens in our republic.  Yesterday, the Minister carried out a consultation process on local government, which has many connections with today's debate.  Both debates demonstrate that the political forum agenda is firmly on the national agenda too.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Without wasting the House&rsquo;s time, I state categorically that I am in favour of affirmative action via quotas, as a short-term strategy to redress the historical balance of the lack of women participating in Irish political life.  I have had to do the same in my own life with regard to women playwrights at the Abbey Theatre.  In the last 100 years since the State was founded, the Abbey Theatre has produced very few women playwrights.  I felt there was no point in just waiting for plays to be written by women.  I would still be waiting.  We had to put a programme in place actively and affirmatively  to resolve this issue.  We commissioned women writers and produced their work.  I got plenty of criticism from a particular critic for this strategy, but it worked.  For the first time in the history of Irish theatre we produced and presented four new world premieres of plays by women writers in a row in the last 18 months.</P>
        <P>Irish political life has no choice now but to regulate, for the time being, candidate selection for elections.  It is a reasonable option to take and we need to compel all the political parties to achieve the candidate quota for men and women.  I implore the Minister to go straight away to the 40% quota on candidate selection.  The Minister has given reasons for not doing that, but I would like to tease this issue out.  I do not understand why we cannot start at 40% and maybe even go to 45%.  If we do not do that we will need to wait until almost 2021, which is over ten years from now, to achieve the 40% candidate selection quota.  We should be radical and visionary here and introduce the 40% quota for men and women immediately.</P><Col N="31"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill does not include provisions that affect the gender quota of candidates in local or Seanad elections.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s reasons this is not the case.  I understand the reasoning in terms of local elections, but I would like to tease out this issue, which Senators Keane and Power also mentioned.  Does the Minister expect the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad to be passed and is this why Seanad elections are not included in the Bill?  This might be seen as peremptory.  The Minister&rsquo;s vision on local government reform is evident.  We should put a quota in place for the 2014 local elections, starting at 30%.  On Committee Stage, we might find a way to support the Minister&rsquo;s evident political reform agenda.</P>
        <P>To support this provision in the Bill the Houses of the Oireachtas also need to reform their practices and procedures.  Leinster House has to adjust to a modern way of doing business within daylight hours that is supportive of family life.  It behoves the Oireachtas to plan its business better, and we do not need legislation for that.</P>
        <P>Equally critical in the Bill are the requirements of transparency and disclosure with regard to private and public funding.  Under the existing Acts there is no specific requirement that parties keep proper books and accounts, nor any requirement to publish audited accounts of income and expenditure.  I welcome the provision in the Bill that additional requirements on disclosure are included and that the Bill proposes to make payment of public funding dependent on political parties providing annual externally audited accounts to the Standards in Public Office Commission for publication.</P>
        <P>With regard to donations, it is important to state that every citizen has the right to donate and contribute to any political party or cause and we should not see this as something unseemly or undemocratic.  Political parties should not receive funding only from the State.  Through encouraging political participation, donations by citizens should be an elemental part of this.</P>
        <P>We know political parties survive on two forms of State funding.  One is based on the party&rsquo;s first preference performance in previous general elections and is made under the Electoral Acts.  The second payment is made under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2001 and is known as the leaders&rsquo; allowance.  It is based on the number of elected members of a party.  This leaders&rsquo; allowance is also made available to Independent Members of both Houses.  The Bill makes no reference to individual Members or non-party Members of the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  Qualifying parties relate only to political parties.  I would like to propose that all Independent Members of the Oireachtas, including myself, should have a statutory responsibility to provide detailed accounts of donations and public funding to the commission on an annual basis.  This should include the leaders&rsquo; allowance.  I am in receipt of the leaders&rsquo; allowance.  There are guidelines for the use of this allowance but there is no requirement to vouch or keep accounts.  I suggest that the Standards in Public Office Commission draw up requirements for disclosure by non-party Members of the Oireachtas.  Moriarty tribunal findings state that &ldquo;appropriate measures should be adopted to ensure that all equivalent obligations apply to Independent or non-party candidates&rdquo;.  We might include that as an amendment to the Bill.</P>
        <P>I would love corporate donations to be banned.  I understand there is a debate on their constitutionality.  The programme for Government undertakes to abolish them.  My concern is that the Bill suggests that the disclosure of corporate donations should be done within six months of the year end in question.  If there is an election in the month of January disclosure need not happen until June of the following year, which is too late for citizens to be informed before casting a vote.  The report of the Moriarty tribunal mentions that donations should, if possible, be disclosed in something approaching a real timeframe, as in immediately, and that this should be important, particularly during a general election.  In other words, if we cannot ban corporate donations entirely I advocate full and immediate disclosures of all corporate <Col N="32"/>donations.  I hope to bring amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage in the areas I have outlined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am delighted to be here to speak on Second Stage of the Electoral (Amendment)(Political Funding) Bill 2011.  I am particularly pleased and grateful to the Minister that the Bill is being introduced in the Seanad.  It is most appropriate that it be introduced here.</P>
        <P>The Bill will make important reforms to political donations, increase transparency in our system of political donations and place important and significant new restrictions on corporate donations.  We all very much welcome those changes.</P>
        <P>I want to focus on Part 5, relating to State funding of political parties and gender balance, about which I have already communicated many times with the Minister and I am very grateful for his generous and full responses to my submissions to him.  I am also grateful to the Labour Party spokesperson on the environment in the Seanad, Senator Denis Landy, who has generously given way to me and Senators Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe and Aideen Hayden, who particularly wanted to speak about Part 5 of the Bill and to focus on the historic change it will bring about in Irish politics.</P>
        <P>Before discussing Part 5 of the Bill I welcome, as others have done, the large group of men and women who have worked for many years to see the change brought about by the Bill happen and who are here to support it.  They are in the Gallery and in the audio-visual and overflow room, because we could not accommodate them in the Chamber.  They include academics such as Professor Yvonne Galligan, Claire McGing and Fiona Buckley.  We have members of Women for Election, the 50/50 Campaign for Democracy, and the National Women&rsquo;s Council, who have all been pushing very hard for this.  We have many activists and councillors from the Labour Party, including Sin&eacute;ad N&iacute; Uallach&aacute;in and Kirsty Hanafin from Labour Women, and students of women&rsquo;s studies from Trinity College Dublin.  We have a huge array of people.  I also welcome former Senator Mary Henry and the former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, who have also done a great deal to push this issue.</P>
        <P>Many of us were in Dublin Castle two weeks ago for Deputy Kathleen Lynch&rsquo;s excellent conference on how to elect more women.  That, too, was overbooked and could not accommodate everyone who wanted to take part.  There is a real momentum on this issue.  While, as Senator Keane has said, controversy surrounds the question of quotas, a momentum is clearly building in support of the principle.</P>
        <P>The rationale behind Part 5 of the Bill is clear.  It will provide, for the first time in Irish law, enforceable gender targets, or quotas, for political parties to adopt in their candidate selection procedures.  It will impose significant financial sanctions on those parties that do not reach the target of 30% at the next general election. That will rise to 40% subsequently.  Only 15% of candidates in the last general election were women.</P>
        <P>Why is this necessary?  At one point in recent Irish history it appeared quotas would not be necessary.  In 1990, when we elected Mary Robinson as our first woman President, Ireland was in 37th place in the international world rankings of women in lower houses of parliament, when 14% of our Deputies were women.  It seemed as if this would increase.  Sadly, that did not prove to be the case.  Our International Parliamentary Union ranking has disimproved significantly since 1990.  We have fallen to 79th position in the world table, with only 25 women Deputies, or 15%.  It is, as the Minister said, the highest number we have had but it is only 1% higher than in 1990.  We have made no significant increase and it means the D&aacute;il remains 85% male and has never been less than 85% male.  This <i>status quo</i> has been stuck for a long time.  The people who argue that it will change organically have stopped doing so, because it is clear <Col N="33"/>that will not happen without some positive action.  Claire McGing has pointed out that only 91 women in Ireland were ever elected to the D&aacute;il in more than 90 years of the existence of the State, which is a different way of portraying the same appallingly low figure.      As other speakers have said, the current Seanad is better and it looks a lot better today as the attendance is about 90%.  The Minister and Senator Mac Conghail are blessed among women today.  In fact, the Seanad has 18 women Members out of 60, a total of 30% exactly.  The Labour group, which I am privileged to lead, has 50% female representation, six women and six men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris.  This is as a result of positive action as regards the nominees of the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.  In any case, international rankings are based on the lower house in parliaments or on those parliaments which are unicameral.  We know that the Seanad has not increased representation organically and we know that the D&aacute;il will not do so unless positive action is taken.  The evidence from other countries bears this out.  Countries ranked around the same place as us in 1990, at 30% representation, have increased their rankings significantly through adoption of positive action measures.  I refer in particular to Belgium, which is now ranked 11th in the world, with 39% women in parliament and Spain, now 16th, with 36% women.  It is not just a case of looking at the Scandinavian countries, although they are very important because they were among the first to adopt positive action measures.  We can now look at countries which were at the same level as us in 1990 and which have increased their representation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The very clear lack of women Members in the D&aacute;il and Seanad was something that struck me forcefully when I was first elected in 2007 and in December 2008, to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the first election in which women could vote, in December 1918, and when Constance Markievicz was elected, I initiated an Oireachtas women&rsquo;s day in the D&aacute;il Chamber, inviting in all women still living who had ever been elected to the Oireachtas to be present in the Chamber.  A very striking photograph was taken.  In recognition of this historic legislation, I ask the Minister if we might arrange to have that photograph displayed in Leinster House.  I had previously arranged this with the former Minister of State with responsibility for equality, Mary Alexandra White, but the Government fell before the photograph could be displayed in Leinster House.  I would like to see this happen as it is a very important and striking visual representation of a Chamber nearly half full of women.  This sends a very important message.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">Other speakers, including the Minister, have referred to the report of which I was an author and with which I was ably assisted by Aoife O&rsquo;Driscoll of my office.  The report was adopted unanimously by the justice committee in 2009.  The report deals with women&rsquo;s participation in politics.  I am happy to say that instead of gathering dust, it has fed into this legislation.  I refer to the sub-committee hearings leading up to the publication of the report at which we heard numerous arguments, particularly from Professor Yvonne Galligan, about why we should be bringing in legislation like this.  As she told us, the current lack of women candidates is a serious restriction to voter choice.  She and others have identified the five Cs as the obstacles to women&rsquo;s representation, namely, child care, cash, confidence, culture and candidate selection procedures.  As other speakers have said, we made a series of recommendations aimed at addressing problems of child care, difficulties with raising cash, the introduction of mentoring programmes and leadership training programmes to address women&rsquo;s lack of confidence.  It is more difficult to address the cultural issue.  We looked at examples from elsewhere, from Iceland, where a public advertising campaign was held with prominent politicians of each gen<Col N="34"/>der confounding gender stereotypes, with images of a male politician wearing high heels and a female politician Minister shaving in front of a mirror&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is all about transgressing boundaries.  In Norway, a national databank of potential women candidates was established in order to get over the perceived difficulty that women do not put themselves forward for election. </P>
	<P Just="Left">The most significant recommendation was the need for the sort of legislation we are discussing today.  We recommended the model of an opportunity quota which is quite a modest proposal, already adopted in over 100 countries and first used in Latin America, in Argentina.  It is not a European invention but it is relatively modest, enhances voter choice by increasing the numbers of women going forward to face voters in an election but does not restrict them by placing a quota on the numbers of seats in parliament, something which would be problematic in this country and under European law.</P>
        <P>The Seanad held two debates following publication of our report, in April and May 2010, and I note the significant cross-party support at that time for the principle of that legislation.  Labour Women also published a Bill to bring forward the same principle and therefore, a good deal of work has been done on this legislation.  The commitment to introduce this legislation was placed in the programme for Government and the Minister introduced the Bill in December 2011.  I am delighted it is being initiated in the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has referred to the public debate since the Bill was published.  I wish to mention briefly the argument that it might be unconstitutional.  Like the Minister, I believe there is no substance to this argument and I have robustly contested that view in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>  on the basis that there is no basis for it.  To suggest that a political party has a right to any particular level of State funding is misguided and there is no premise for it in the Constitution which does not in fact recognise political parties.  The freedom of association is very restrictively framed but this can be surmounted.</P>
        <P>On the issues of whether the Bill goes far enough, I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point that 30% was the target we recommended in 2009.  It is more ambitious for some parties than others.  Clearly, the Labour Party is already close to that figure but I accept that for some parties it will be much more difficult to reach and therefore it needs to be a realistic but achievable target, given the level of sanction.</P>
        <P>I suggest we should look again at extending the provisions of the Bill to include local and European elections, as recommended in our report.  I can see the difficulty with the funding issue but this might be reviewed.  We might wish to review the sunset clause.  In practice, this has tended to lapse in any case.  Denmark, for example, removed the law on quotas because they had reached a level of women&rsquo;s representation that was self-sustaining.  Once a critical mass in politics is achieved, it will sustain itself.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill.  I also thank all colleagues and hope we will have all-party support in this House.  We know from experience that this Bill is necessary, that the sort of measures it introduces is the best way to increase the numbers of women in politics to ensure our democracy will no longer be unrepresentative and incomplete.</P>

However, I hope to demonstrate that one does not need gender quotas in order to have dissent.  I think this Bill is full of humbug and missed opportunities.  If fact, it reminds me of nothing so much as Eliza Doolittle.  Our distinguished theatre director and the amateur thespians here will remember that Eliza was asked by Professor Henry Higgins to pronounce the phrase, &ldquo;In Hertford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen.&rdquo;  Of course, poor Eliza jumped all the wrong fences and failed to jump the right fences when she said, &ldquo;In &lsquo;ertford, &lsquo;ereford and &lsquo;ampshire, &lsquo;urricanes &lsquo;ardly hever &lsquo;appen.&rdquo;</P>

If I were to be asked which is the greater evil, the public funding of political parties or the absence of corporate donations, I would have to say that public funding and corporate donations raise issues that in my view are more serious than the absence of gender quotas.  Notwithstanding Senator Bacik&rsquo;s attempts to reassure us, in my view, there is a constitutional issue.  I am in agreement with her colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Joanna Tuffy, and I am with our former T&aacute;naiste and Attorney General, Michael McDowell, who have pointed to serious problems with this Bill.  I also note comments made by Dr. Eoin Daly regarding freedom of association.  He has posed a question as to whether constitutional freedom of association protects the internal organisational autonomy of political parties.</P>
        <P>Mr. Michael McDowell, in his inimical fashion, points out the far simpler and more obvious course for those Government parties, which have a massive majority in the D&aacute;il, would be to amend their own rules, so as to give effect to gender quotas.

	<P>Mr. McDowell has asked whether it is open constitutionally for a majority in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, even with the support of a majority at the last election, to introduce discriminatory funding into the political process in pursuit of their particular policy as to the type or types of people whom they feel people should elect or who should be nominated at the <Col N="36"/>next election to the D&aacute;il.  He asked us to consider whether a future all-women, feminist political party should receive only half the political funding of a future anti-immigrant political party which manages to field a gender balanced panel of candidates.  The answer to the constitutional question becomes pretty clear.  I do not think one can wish away those reflective constitutional points.</P>

	<P>It may very well be, she will have to go before Bishop Gilmore perhaps.  In France they have only managed with the change in the law to achieve a 19% representation of women in their Parliament.  She has pointed out that the countries that are frequently cited for having achieved greater participation of women in parliament, Sweden for example, have not done so with the aid of gender quotas.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Let me make it clear that I support much greater participation in politics and would like to see many more women in the roles of Deputies and Senators.  One does that in more thoughtful and less intrusive ways than by introducing gender quotas.  One does it by helping to create more family friendly workplaces here and  encouraging women&rsquo;s participation in political parties and by the political parties adopting measures to try to attract the best and the brightest and arranging meetings and structuring political activities to suit them.  That is a much more mature way to go about solving the problem.  It is all very well for Senator Mac Conghail to point to the excellent example he gave of the Abbey Theatre, and I accept the Abbey Theatre receives public funding, but he is essentially a private entity.  One cannot compare that with party political life.  This is the national Parliament and people should be given maximum choice in all the decisions that have to be made around the process of selecting public representatives.  It is not a good idea for the national Parliament to engage in social engineering of this particular kind.  This is not the way to advance women&rsquo;s participation.  One can do at the cultural level, at one&rsquo;s own political level, but one does not foist one&rsquo;s particular ideological and political views on other parties.  It is to be noted that it is in the ranks of the Independent Members, where the political failure is most evident.  Just look at the performance of political parties in terms of fielding women relative to the number of women who stand as Independents &mdash; one cannot do anything about that.</P>
        <P>I am very sorry to be disagreeing with Members whom, on other issues touching on the dignity of women, I am very glad to share the road, for example, Senator Katherine Zappone, and I suspect she is a supporter of this Bill.  I am very happy to walk the road with her on issues relating to prostitution and the sex industry.</P>
        <P>I do not think this is good legislation in terms of advancing the interests of women.  It invites scepticism and cynicism among the public about the quality of women&rsquo;s participation, that people should feel that the only way to get women into parliament is by this kind of attempt at a discriminatory mechanism.

        <P Just="Left">It was pointed out that the State should be ideologically and politically neutral.  This changes the goalposts.  This goes against the spirit of things like the McKenna judgment, which were designed to get the apparatus of State out of dictating to people what way they should go on particular issues.  This is the antithesis of what one would expect in a liberal democracy.  There is nothing liberal about the proposal.  While I believe the Bill may advance the situation, because by definition more will be selected, it may not advance the number of women who get elected.  It will diminish in the longer term the appreciation among the public of the importance of getting more women elected.  I certainly intend to reflect some of these concerns in amendments on Committee Stage.  I agree with everything in relation to the five Cs.  It is only in the Irish language, however, that the quota begins with a C.  It is a big mistake.  I look forward to tabling amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan for coming to this House to present this Bill.  I thank him for his commitment to the objectives in this Bill and to this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a Seanad Bill and it gives this House a real opportunity to influence the legislation that will be enacted.  I know that fine suggestions will be forthcoming from Seanad Members.  The Government faces an historic challenge in these straitened times.  The trust of the nation has been invested in it and I know the Government is committed to honouring that trust.  While the economic difficulties need to be tackled as a priority, there is a clear need for the political structures to be improved.  To this end the political classes in Ireland must embrace change, share the burden and lead by example.  The Fine Gael-Labour Party Government includes an ambitious programme for reform of the political system.  If our political system is to regain credibility and relevance, it must change.  Our system of government must modernise and start to deliver better services with less resources.  To that end the Government has introduced this Electoral (Amendment)(Political Funding) Bill 2011 to endeavour to enhance the openness and transparency of political funding and to provide a more equal and representative political system by increasing the number of women in politics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill proposes to increase the barriers to corporate donations by reducing the cap on donations and increasing transparency.  The Bill also proposes to use the existing public funding of political parties in Ireland to promote greater gender balance in both Houses of the <Col N="38"/>Oireachtas.  The Bill marks a very important step forward in increasing transparency in order that in future expressions such as &ldquo;golden circle&rdquo;, &ldquo;crony Government&rdquo; and &ldquo;crony capitalism&rdquo; will be consigned to the dim and distant past.  The public deserve and should be entitled to expect that their voice and representation is not trumped by big monied vested interests.  The creation of a new public register of public donors which will be maintained by the Standard in Public Office Commission, and will be readily available and accessible to the public, is a major step forward.  Lowering the thresholds for full disclosure of political donations from &euro;5,078 to &euro;1,500 is another step in the right direction.  By increasing the duty of disclosure by politicians and political parties, this Bill will undoubtedly help to diminish the perception among the public under previous Governments that public representatives were abducted and influenced by private sector vested interests.  This type of reform is a critical starting point in rehabilitating the image of politics and politicians in the minds of the Irish electorate.  It will start a debate from which we in the Seanad could learn as we seek to improve our image with the electorate.</P>
        <P>I have tried in the short time I have been Leader to introduce change and while some of it has worked and has been well received, changing habits and deeply ingrained practices is never an easy task. On that point I wish the Minister well with the Bill.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to spend too much time on the gender balance aspect of the Bill as it may have been addressed by my colleague, Senator Keane, and will be addressed also by my party colleagues, Senators Clune, Henry and Healy Eames.  Suffice to say I am a strong supporter of the Government&rsquo;s ambitions to increase the representation of women in the political system.  This commitment was reflected by the Taoiseach, as has been mentioned by Senator Averil Power, whereby seven out of the 11 nominated Senators were women.  It is heartening to note that there are 18 women Senators, out of 60, and that we are doing considerably better than the other House which has 25 women Deputies out of 166.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the best and most successful ambassadors of the Seanad have been women.  In particular, I call to mind Dr. Mary Robinson who very graciously spoke to the Seanad recently on her reflections as a woman in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1969 where there were just six women Members of the Seanad.  Dr. Robinson provided us with a most amusing anecdote when she described how she was politely informed by lady Members of the Seanad at that time that women should wear hats.  Times have changed and moved on since then.  We all appreciate the significant contribution that women have made and continue to make in the House.  I thank and acknowledge the presence of former Senator Mary Henry in the Visitors Gallery who was one of the finest Members of the Seanad in my time.  Her contributions, certainly to mental health issues, were excellent at a time when mental health did not receive the prominence that it rightly and thankfully receives now.</P>
        <P>The Bill marks a significant step in addressing the under-representation of women in the D&aacute;il.  I wish the Minister well with its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am sure we will have a productive and informative debate on the issues on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is important legislation on the gender issue and is a step in the right direction; it is not a big step but a baby step.  I note it does not cover the local election issue or the Seanad. I realise the Minister may be pre-empting another referendum and we may be &ldquo;tsunamied&rdquo; with referendums.  As the Minister is talking about reform and funding for political parties being based on candidates for one particular House, without saying anything about this House, perhaps it is an issue that will be addressed by Labour Party and Fine Gael colleagues on Committee Stage.  It would be presumptious of the Government to decide the will of the people in advance of any referendum <Col N="39"/>on the Seanad.  There is merit also in being a little bolder if the Minister was to consider a gender quota for the Seanad.  While the quota might be tied in at 30% or 35% in the D&aacute;il, a 50:50 quota for candidates for political parties at a Seanad election would be looked upon favourably.  As the Minister may be aware, commentators often say the Seanad is an ante-room for the D&aacute;il, a kindergarten or a retirement home.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I take that as a great compliment.  Perhaps the Minister, the leader of the Labour Party group and my Fine Gael colleagues would consider a 50:50 quota in the Seanad.  If provision is made for such a quota in the legislation, any subsequent referendum will take care of all those issues, whether the people decide for or against it.  However, it would be a step in the right direction given that we know the difficulties, which have been outlined, when it comes to D&aacute;il elections.  We have failed abysmally for reasons too numerous to mention. That is simply not good enough whereas other countries, such as Scandinavia, have managed to increase the quota.  I realise we are talking about sunset clauses but a step in the right direction would be in respect of this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The funding issue was mentioned but I will not elaborate on it.  However, I welcome the provision for gender quotas.  It is a step in the right direction and has to be done because we have continually failed in the political process.  It is modern day gladiators when it comes to politics and conventions.  The system will ensure that great people can be blocked out and it is very hard, as one of the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s colleagues said recently &mdash; I assume I should take it as an insult as should all males but we will take it in the spirit it was intended &mdash; she wanted to see the day when Leinster House would elect mediocre women.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I note the point.  I presume that if mediocre women were nominated that mediocre women would be elected to the Houses in the same way that she hinted that mediocre men were nominated and elected all the time.  I do not think that remark was addressed to the Acting Chairman, or any of the males in this Chamber.  However, I ask the Minister to look specifically at the Seanad where political parties would have a 50:50 quota in any election.  I am speaking against myself and the Chair&rsquo;s best interest on this issue but in <Col N="40"/>light of the facts, which are obvious in my party, it is difficult given that policy will follow the money.  If the money is provided only if 50% of the party&rsquo;s candidates in the Seanad are women, that will happen.  Aspirations, guidelines and hopes are no good as they do not bring about the required results.  Irrespective of the Minister&rsquo;s views of this House, I ask him to include a provision for what is required, otherwise he may get a bloody nose in any Seanad referendum, by which time the legislation would have passed and the opportunity to provide for the quota for political parties in Seanad elections would be lost.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte romhaibh go l&eacute;ir, agus le mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann go speisialta.  I welcome the Minister, who spoke about this being ground-breaking legislation.  It is ground-breaking, and it is great to be able to agree with that expression, as it is used insincerely sometimes.  I welcome the former Senator, Mary Henry, and the former Minister, Ms Niamh Bhreathnach, to the House, and many in the Visitors Gallery have worked very hard, discussed the issues and made this day possible.  It is a day in which politics in Ireland has changed.</P>
        <P>I also welcome in the Bill the greater transparency for political funding and financing for political parties.  Once upon a time I had the temerity to suggest that Charles Haughey had received donations from big business and that did not go down too well; it went down very badly, as I know to my own cost.  Some 20 years later there is legislation to begin to change that culture of golden circles and the unhealthy relationship between business and politics, which I also welcome.</P>
        <P>I will address my comments to the gender quota aspects of the Bill, and I am glad the quota applies to having more women on the ballot paper.  That is not to say places will be reserved for women in the Houses and we are not telling people how to vote.  We are giving people the option of having more women on the ballot paper.  Voluntary quotas for parties were suggested by a former Minister of State, Mary Alexandra White, and they were not taken up.  The Minister would not have brought forward this legislation if voluntary quotas had been taken up, as they were very successfully in Sweden.  That country did not need legislation like this as quotas were met voluntarily.</P>
        <P>Now is the time for us to embrace the legislation and we must grow up as a country.  We want men and women to be represented equally because we are equal in terms of rights and population.  We are mothers, sisters, daughters and wives.  We are teachers, police officers, bank officials, managers and bosses, and we contribute everywhere in society, including in the home, schools, communities, hospitals and voluntary organisations.  In the place where key decisions are made, we are somewhat absent.  We are missing from the place where we should be the most, and we are missing in numbers where we could contribute, make an impact and bring about a difference.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As women, we operate differently and sometimes we have different priorities and approaches.  We can also work differently, which is okay because it is the difference that matters.  We want that difference in public and political life, in the D&aacute;il, the Seanad, the Government and the Cabinet.  We need that difference because it will be effective.  This difference &mdash; the inclusion of women &mdash; is not emerging through normal procedures, and we are not making progress.  It could be 250 or 350 years before that happens, so we cannot afford to wait any longer.  This is an urgent matter which goes to the core of who we are and how we look after ourselves, our country and future.  Whether it is believed or accepted, there is an invisible quota firmly in place, and it has always been supported and encouraged.  Most importantly, it is pretty much expected that men would be in politics and have the power to make decisions.  In part, that is because of what is reflected when we look around.  Where I live in Sligo, one must go back to 1961, when Mary Reynolds, having been a Deputy for a very long time, lost <Col N="41"/>her seat, for the last time there was female representation in the area.  There has been no female Deputy or Senator in Sligo-Leitrim since then until now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The <i>status quo</i> is what we have and what we are used to.  It is what people know and what is comfortable.  I know that people do not change banks easily, for example, and equally they do not change religion, politics or voting habits easily.  This will be a long process but it is starting today.  Voting for a woman may be difficult for some but there will be a choice.  Some may find it impossible to vote for a woman but if there are not enough women to vote for, it will not happen.  We could see that as how it is and part of life.  We should tell that to cancer patients whose lives have been made better by medical and scientific interventions or the many people who have been improved by all kinds of interventions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We could talk about how important it is for more people to become involved and hope this will rub off on the public.  When Mary Robinson became the first woman President of Ireland, that did not rub off.  We could try instead to intervene and level the playing field, indicating that political parties must make an effort, change their attitude and help to change the <i>status quo</i>.  They should welcome and support women.  We must get women to make the effort, change their attitudes and break the <i>status quo</i>.  Women are not entitled to be involved in politics but rather they are obliged to be involved.  It is our country and we are all responsible.  This legislation is only part of that process.  When it comes down to it, this process will involve organisations like the 50:50 Group, of which I am proud to be a founding member of the north-west branch.  It covers almost the entire nation and the 50:50 Group has encouraged and supported debate, conversation and argument in this regard, which will go hand in hand with this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A new group, Women For Election, has received great funding from Social Entrepreneurs Ireland to do what many critics say is missing, such as running workshops, lecturing, offering training and mentoring to women interested in and who want to know about a life in politics.  When the people involved were canvassing for the Lisbon treaty, they discovered that many women were genuinely interested in politics but did not know how to get in.  They felt excluded and thought that potential candidates might have to be part of a dynasty or know everything about politics.  There was a realisation that some women just needed a little support.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Such movements will operate hand in hand with this brave and welcome legislation.  Together, by women and for women and with the encouragement and support of men, this can work.  I remind men that when more women move into the Houses of the Oireachtas, they will not be sitting on men&rsquo;s knees.  Some men will have to move over or even out, which is okay as it is progress.  Otherwise, we will not have in these Houses the kind of representation reflecting life outside on the streets.  This will make a difference and as a woman, I see a 50:50 split as the only correct form of representation.  I welcome this legislation as part of that jigsaw.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ImeldaHenry"><NameTxt>Senator Imelda Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and take this opportunity to welcome the new legislation.  I know there are mixed views on quotas but we know this is necessary to address the problems facing female participation in politics.  Unfortunately, politics in this country has always been dominated by men, although we have seen changes in the number of female doctors, engineers, architects, as well as those in other professions.  We must encourage more women into political life and change the environment in which they would operate.</P>
        <P>The main problem for some women, particularly those outside Dublin, is their families.  It can be difficult for young mothers to put themselves forward, leave home and base themselves in Dublin for three days.  Men cannot have babies, thank God, but they can do everything else.  Some 45% of the Swedish Parliament consists of women and one would often see men pushing prams while women are debating.  Equality in Sweden starts in school, as boys and girls are given the same opportunities, with girls outperforming boys in education.  Almost half of the <Col N="42"/>PhDs awarded today in Sweden go to women.  An important factor in Swedish equality is parental leave, and new fathers get ten days off work when the child is born before sharing with their partner a further 480 days of paid parental leave.  This allows women to continue to pursue their careers and facilitates men in playing a larger role in their children&rsquo;s formative years.</P>
        <P>Men and women must have a choice.  I was a candidate for the general election in 2007 and the rest of the field in the constituency consisted of nine men.  Some people believe that women vote for women but research shows this is untrue.  We must give people the choice of voting for the best candidate, male or female.  I hope political parties will not use this as a token gesture to women, and when women are on the ballot paper to run for the general election, all parties should give the encouragement and support to ensure election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House and the introduction of this Bill.  I agree that it will fundamentally change the way politics is conducted.  In fact, I would go so far as to say it has the potential to transform the political landscape in the State in a very positive way.  As the longest serving continuous Member of the Seanad &mdash; the father of the House &mdash; it is a matter of pride to me that the constituency I represent has always met the target of 30% female representation.  Past Senators for the University of Dublin have included Mary Robinson, Carmencita Hederman and Mary Henry.  The Deputy Leader, Senator Ivana Bacik, is the latest woman to be elected to the constituency.</P>
        <P>It is very important that any suggestion of corruption, golden circles and so on should be cut away, as is clearly the Minister&rsquo;s intention.  He referred to excessive and secretive corporate funding.  I remember when that type of situation was very much worse.  It has improved gradually in recent years and this Bill represents another step in the right direction.  It was referred to as a &ldquo;baby step&rdquo; by one speaker.  On the contrary, it is a very significant measure in several respects.</P>
        <P>While the Minister spoke about the balance of representation in the D&aacute;il between men and women, he was challenged on the omission of the Seanad in this regard.  I will not extend that challenge other than to express my agreement with colleagues&rsquo; observation that the Seanad&rsquo;s exclusion is curious.  That is especially so given the point made by the Minister in his opening contribution:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is appropriate that the Bill is commencing its passage through the Oireachtas in the Seanad.  Members of this House have played a particularly crucial role in highlighting the need for legislation to address the shortcomings in our democratic system.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister paid tribute to the essential role played by Seanad &Eacute;ireann in this area, yet he has omitted to include it in these proposals.  I hope the Seanad&rsquo;s acknowledged contribution will be taken into account when it comes to making a decision on a referendum on the future of this House.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator Mary White, has drawn attention to considerable discriminatory practices within some of the farming organisations, observations which were subject to widespread comment.  I took part in the debate in 2010 in which I indicated my support for the proposals put forward.  In regard to donations, not only is the Seanad excluded but the question of Independent representation is not properly addressed.  Instead, the entire proposal is once again skewed in favour of the political parties and against Independent Members.  If the Minister wants to equalise matters in regard to women, he should also equalise them in regard to Independents.  While parties have access to enormous resources, the Minister is reducing even further the miserable amounts permitted to Independent Members.</P><Col N="43"/>
        <P Just="Left">In each of the last few elections I received nothing because I considered I was already in the system and sufficiently funded.  However, one of my colleagues received &euro;30,000 in a large number of equal denominations.  That is interesting.  I am referring here to Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen.  If I am wrong, I will withdraw the statement.  It is very valuable to have the Senator's voice in the House, because it is a contrary one which is against the current of the times.  We need that type of exchange of different ideas.  However, I maintain that it was perfectly appropriate for me to point out, when he spoke earlier about cultural elements, that the largest Christian denomination in this country is not at all a cultural leader in this area.  The word "organic" contains the notion of growth, but I am ashamed that we have slipped backward rather than moving forward.  That is not organic; it is a form of decay. </P>
     
	<P>Hitting people in the pocket is the most practical form of political persuasion at one&rsquo;s disposal.  The proposal that 30% of a party&rsquo;s list must be women is very welcome in a context where they are a majority in the State.  It is astonishing that they are not there already.  This provision should be extended to local authorities for the clear and simple reason of public profile.  In the old days a large number of people in this House came through the local authority system and cut their teeth there.  If women are not given the same opportunity they will not have the same profile and will be less likely to be elected.  As it stands, they account for only 17% of local authority members.  Imposing a candidate gender quota for the 2014 local elections would pave the way for the next general election, which is due to take place in 2016.  The idea of twinning lists, which has been tried successfully in Scotland, would serve to maximise the opportunity for participation.</P>
        <P>I have reservations in regard to proposals for a favourable order of placement for women candidates on the ballot paper, as suggested in a submission to me by the 50:50 Group in Cork.  There is certainly a clear advantage in a higher placement.  My own name, starting as it does with an &ldquo;N&rdquo;, is too near the bottom.  I wish it started with a &ldquo;B&rdquo; like Senator Bacik.</P>

        <P>Some of these proposals have been under consideration for many years.  In fact, some of the sums referred to in the Bill were originally designated in another currency back in 1997.  Likewise, it is a long time since the Minister&rsquo;s former party colleague, Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, brought forward legislative proposals on changes to the method of nomination for presidential elections.  I hope the Minister will review that matter, which is another example of inequality.</P>

        <P Just="Left">It is a pity Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen is no longer in the Chamber.  I found it slightly offensive when he referred to this measure as representing a form of social engineering.  The latter suggests a manipulating of outcomes, but that is not what this legislation is about.  Rather, it is about presenting opportunities, namely, giving the people the opportunity to vote for a woman.  It is about ensuring enhanced democracy.  It is clear that the Senator does not consider the dominant position of the Catholic Church in, for example, the education system, which restricts parents' choice of where they send their children to school, to constitute a form of social engineering, yet he considers giving women access to democratic representation in this country as exactly that.  There is a significant inconsistency in that position. </P>
      
	<P Just="Left">Senator Mullen mentioned the legal opinions of the former leader of the Progressive Democrats, Michael McDowell, as somewhat persuasive and as presenting valid reasons that this legislation does not hold water.  I would like, because she did not have the opportunity to do so herself, to refer to some of the comments made by Senator Bacik in her response to Mr. McDowell in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 27 November 2011.  She noted that Mr. McDowell failed to cite substantive constitutional grounds on which the law could be challenged.  She suggested that there was no prohibition in the Constitution against political parties adopting these types of measure.  The Constitution does not refer to parties.  If I read the Senator's article correctly, she found no reason to prevent the measure from being adopted.</P>
        <P>Other issues with the funding of political parties have not been set down in the Constitution and are perfectly open to being set down in legislation.  Senator Bacik, an eminent lawyer, pointed out that, constitutionally, this is robust legislation and does not represent anything dramatic.  It is a modest proposal.  Doctors differ, patients die and this matter may need to be tested in the courts, but so be it.  It is an important consideration and will progress.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen mentioned Sweden and the fact that, in certain societies, there is no need for this type of &ldquo;social engineering&rdquo;.  He was right, as Sweden is an equal society that has developed over many decades.  Ireland is not an equal society.  As other Senators have mentioned, we have not managed to achieve anything approximating the democratic participation of women.  We are not Sweden and do not have its type of equal society.  I wish we did, as we cannot rely on the organic growth of the participation of women in politics.  Therefore, this modest legislation is necessary.</P>
        <P>Equal societies generate greater participation by women.  According to research, equal societies are more successful.  This measure is one of a number that will not only address the participation of women, but also the participation of other disenfranchised people, for example, the elderly and people with disabilities.  We should examine the electoral system to determine how to encourage the participation of gay, lesbian and transgender people and others whose views are not represented in society.</P>
        <P>This Bill will probably be the Minister&rsquo;s most important undertaking in office.  In the past week, he has been subjected to what I would loosely term the septic tank debacle.  This measure will set him apart as a Minister.  I welcome the legislation and the debate to come.  It represents a watershed in society and a watershed for women.</P>

        <P>Speaking as a male politician, I say this legislation is long overdue.  One of the country&rsquo;s greatest scandals has been the under-representation of women in politics and, arguably, in many other strands of society.  I find it offensive for any politician to claim that this measure is a form of social engineering.  The fact is that women represent 51% of the population.  They should be properly represented in the Houses and on local councils.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, to the House.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well in his tenure in office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for inviting me to the House for this discussion.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann on foreign affairs issues.  I have a slight time constraint in that I must leave by approximately 5 p.m.  If we have not completed the discussion by then, I will be more than happy to return to the Chamber for that purpose.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Economic recovery remains the top priority for the Government, and the State&rsquo;s place in Europe and the wider world is key to that recovery.  Ireland is an open trading economy, exporting 80% of everything we produce and depending on inward investment from overseas to generate jobs.  We rely on borrowing from international institutions and are heavily influenced by international market sentiment.  It is essential, therefore, that Ireland&rsquo;s reputation abroad be restored and remain positive and strong.</P><Col N="46"/>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s diplomatic services and experience are called on again and again to promote Ireland&rsquo;s case with the European Union, other international bodies and with individual states.  The role Ireland plays in European and international affairs is critical to the success of our dialogue with European and other partners.  More than many other countries, Ireland depends on a strong international presence.  Promoting Irish trade and our other economic interests abroad is a key contribution that I, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and my Department can make to this objective.</P>
        <P>The Export Trade Council, which I established, is driving the Government&rsquo;s activity in this area.  In two weeks&rsquo; time we will comprehensively review the progress made in the first year of the Government&rsquo;s trade, tourism and investment strategy.  The council will also review how our local market teams in each of the priority markets have implemented their 2011 action plans and will consider the teams&rsquo; plans for the coming year.  The Government is placing a significant focus on China this year, with several reciprocal visits under preparation.</P>
        <P>Trade missions are an invaluable tool for Irish companies seeking to consolidate and grow overseas business.  Enterprise Ireland has a programme of missions in 2012 which I and my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development, Deputy Joe Costello, look forward to supporting.  The unique platform offered by the annual St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day festivities will be effectively utilised to showcase Irish goods and services as well as the country&rsquo;s attractions as an investment location and tourist destination.  A carefully targeted programme of ministerial visits overseas will shortly be announced.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As well as these direct promotional activities, I will avail of all appropriate opportunities to advance Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests that may arise in my own foreign travel schedule, whether linked to my role as chairman of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, or other bilateral engagements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While our focus is necessarily on domestic economic revival, our commitment to tackling the challenge of promoting peace, security and human rights in the world is undiminished.  Globally, regionally and in the neighbourhood of the EU, Ireland has always made its contribution, both in our bilateral relations and in multilateral fora.  We continue this tradition in 2012 with our chairmanship of the OSCE.  With 56 member states covering a population of more than 1 billion, the OSCE is not only the world&rsquo;s largest intergovernmental regional security organisation but also its most regionally diverse.  The organisation has a network of 17 missions in the Balkans, eastern Europe and central Asia.  In my capacity as chair-in-office I addressed the OSCE&rsquo;s permanent council in Vienna on 12 January.  I underlined that Ireland would adopt a pragmatic and fair-minded approach to ensure balance and coherence in the work of the organisation.  I will address the United Nations Security Council next week on the priorities of the Irish chairmanship.</P>
        <P>In regard to the human dimension of the OSCE, we have an ambitious agenda.  We intend to prioritise the issue of Internet freedom, in particular as it applies to new digital media.  As in other parts of the world, the threat to freedom of expression online is ever present in the OSCE region and appears to be growing.  During our chairmanship, we will organise events focused on freedom of association and assembly, freedom of religion and belief, combatting trafficking in human beings and racism and intolerance in sport.  As chair-in-office, I am working closely with the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, which carries out important work in relation to election monitoring.  I acknowledge the work being done today by Senator Jim Walsh, a member of our delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly.  I had a good meeting with <Col N="47"/>the president and secretary general of the assembly during their visit to Dublin yesterday and I look forward to continued co-operation throughout the year.</P>
        <P>In the politico-military dimension, we hope to ensure continued progress on the updating of confidence and security building measures and enhancement of the OSCE&rsquo;s conflict prevention capacity.  We will take forward work which will enable the OSCE to deepen its involvement in all phases of the conflict cycle and to strengthen its capacity to tackle conflict, from prevention to resolution.  Within the economic and environmental dimension, our core theme will be the promotion of security and stability through good governance.  We firmly believe that weak and ineffective governance undermines economic development and exposes states to greater security risks.  As chairman, I will work with others to promote lasting settlements to a number of conflicts in the OSCE area.  As is usual practice, I have appointed two special representatives to assist me in this regard.  Ambassador Padraig Murphy, a former senior diplomat, is my special representative for the South Caucasus, dealing in particular with Georgia and the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  He will also have a secondary role on Nagorno-Karabakh.  Ambassador Erwan Fouere is my special representative for the Transdniestrian settlement process, dealing with the efforts to resolve a longstanding conflict in Moldova with the breakaway region of Transdniestria.</P>
        <P>In taking up these challenges, we will draw on our own experience of successful conflict resolution.  On 27 April, I will host a conference which will focus on Northern Ireland as a case study, aiming to explore aspects which might be applicable to conflict situations in the OSCE area.  I believe we can encourage those engaged in negotiations elsewhere to persevere in their efforts by showing that it has been possible to create and build peace in Northern Ireland and by explaining how this was achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The key event of the year will be the OSCE ministerial meeting which is scheduled to take place from 6-7 December in Dublin.  This event involves participation by all 56 member states and 12 partner states at Foreign Minister level.  It will be the largest gathering of Foreign Ministers ever to take place in Ireland.  As chair-in-office, I will work hard to pursue the principles and aims of the OSCE.  It is an honour for Ireland to have this unique opportunity to make a tangible contribution to the promotion of European peace and security.  We will also reap significant benefits from the chairmanship, including a significantly raised EU and international profile.  It gives us an opportunity for close and sustained engagement with major international players, such as the US, Russia, France and Germany.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to peace and security extends much further than our immediate neighbourhood.  In recent days I visited Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories and I met President Abbas and Foreign Minister Malki in Ramallah and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor and Foreign Minister Liberman in Jerusalem.  My visit afforded me the opportunity to be briefed on and see for myself how the occupation impacts on the ordinary Palestinian population.  I had lengthy and constructive discussions with all the leaders I met on both sides, to whom I made clear Ireland and the EU&rsquo;s continuing strong interest and commitment to doing everything possible to support current peace efforts.</P>
        <P>In my discussions with Prime Minister Netanyahu, I particularly emphasised the importance of Israel taking decisive action in relation to ending the blockade of Gaza and the urgency of Israeli restraint in relation to further settlement expansion.  A primary concern for Ireland in our approach to the situation in the Middle East is the need to defend the fundamental human rights and freedoms of the local population.  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights has been, and will continue to be, a central component of our foreign policy.  It forms the background to the campaign now under way to secure election to the Human Rights Council, the United Nations&rsquo; principal human rights forum.  Ireland is a strong <Col N="48"/>supporter of the United Nations as a community of nations working together to advance the values enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  We champion the vital role which the United Nations plays in safeguarding and advancing human rights.  The contribution which Ireland can make to this work will be considerably strengthened if we become a member of the Human Rights Council.  To this end, we are seeking membership from 2013 to 2015 in elections which will be held later this year.  Our candidature for the Human Rights Council is fully in keeping with the commitment in the programme for Government to restore Ireland&rsquo;s standing as a respected and influential member of the international community.  Our clear message is that economic woes have not diminished our tradition of protecting vulnerable people.  We are strongly committed to keeping the fight against global poverty and hunger at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy.  We do so not only because it is the right thing to do, reflecting the values and sense of solidarity of the Irish people with those who face extreme poverty and hunger elsewhere, but because it is in our own interest, as an outward-looking nation whose future depends on the strength of our political, economic and cultural partnerships worldwide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our newly launched Africa strategy will enable us to further our engagement on these issues.  The strategy contains proposals to build on our strong relationships on that continent, relationships that are mutually beneficial to Ireland and Africa and which foster true partnerships.  Over the coming year we will roll out the implementation of this strategy, using our embassy network in Africa to maximum effect.  Development co-operation still matters.  It can and does make a difference.  Internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is regarded as one of the most focused and effective.  Our priorities in 2012 are to build on that through our work with partner governments, civil society organisations and through the UN system.  In particular, we will work to further strengthen our leadership role in combating hunger and malnutrition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need also to learn from what works best in delivering results on the ground for poor people and to set out clear priorities for our aid programme over the coming years.  This is the reason we are undertaking a review of the 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid.  We will publish the review later this year, following engagement in a wide consultative process.  The review will give us a real and valuable opportunity to recalibrate the aid programme to take into account the lessons learned in the past five years.  I look forward to working with the Oireachtas in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to multilateralism is fundamental to restoring its reputation on the global stage.  It shows us to be a nation that cares, that perseveres despite economic restraints, a nation that can be trusted to hold fast to its principles and overcome challenges and a reliable country with which to do business.  On that subject, the Taoiseach and I will next week attend the &ldquo;Invest in Ireland&rdquo; event hosted by President Clinton in New York city as a direct outcome of the Global Irish Economic Forum to encourage new US investment into Ireland.  The Global Irish Economic Forum held in Dublin Castle last October was very successful and has already contributed to our economic recovery and to projecting a positive image of Ireland abroad.  While in the US, the Taoiseach and I will also meet with the US Administration at senior levels and with both parties in the US Congress, to continue to press for immigration reform.  Addressing the situation of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements with the United States remain important priorities for the Government.  Next week&rsquo;s discussions will build on contacts that we have had with President Obama, Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, and Senator Patrick Leahy, chair of the Senate judiciary committee.  Discussions will focus on recent welcome legislative proposals in this area, such as allocating E3 visas to Ireland and working with the Irish-American immigrant community, we will use the opportunity to encourage the bipartisan support required for the legislation to be successful.</P><Col N="49"/>
        <P Just="Left">I take the opportunity to brief the House on developments in the EU and priorities for the year ahead.  As Senators will be aware, on Monday evening the European Council reached agreement on two important documents, a statement committing leaders to a programme of work aimed at ensuring jobs and growth and the text of a new treaty on stability.  Both are important issues for Ireland.  Both are vital to economic recovery and are very welcome.  It is, of course, true that much, if not most, of what is contained within the new treaty already exists in European law, whether through the Stability and Growth Pact or through the six legislative measures to strengthen it which were adopted last year.  However, setting this out in a treaty and adding a small number of important new elements, including the need for each country to have an automatic correction mechanism that kicks in if it is in danger of breaching the rules, takes our commitment to shared discipline to a new level.  For a small member state like Ireland this is important and welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following this week&rsquo;s meeting of the Government, I have written to the Attorney General seeking her formal views on whether a referendum will be required to enable Ireland to ratify this treaty.  The Attorney General will study the legal implications carefully and will advise on what steps are necessary in due course.  There is no deadline.  It is important that she has whatever time she needs to undertake this important work.  This House may rest assured that whatever path towards ratification is required, the Oireachtas will be fully involved in the process.  It is also important to place the new treaty in the right context.  It is part of the jigsaw but not the full picture.  We must focus on growth and jobs and must ensure that we have convincing and robust firewalls in place.  In this regard, the statement of the European Council on growth last Monday was very welcome, as is confirmation that the European Council will return to the question of the adequacy of the resources under the EFSF and the ESM when it next meets in March. </P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I again express my thanks for this opportunity to brief the Seanad on my priorities in 2012.  It is a full agenda but one that my Department and I are fully committed to discharging to the best of our ability.  In so doing, I am conscious of the role played by the Oireachtas in foreign affairs and it is important to have a chance to discuss matters of such significance to Ireland and Europe in this House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Before I call Senator Walsh, I am sure the T&aacute;naiste and Members of the House will join me in welcoming Mr. R. Spencer Oliver, secretary general of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Parliamentary Assembly.  He is very welcome and we hope he has a successful trip to Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Each group leader has been allocated two minutes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Two minutes is very tight but I will do my best. </P>
	<P Just="Left">I join in the welcome to the T&aacute;naiste, a man for whom I have some admiration.  I dealt with him in the past when he served in a previous Administration in the 1990s as a member of Democratic Left and always have found him to be a fair and committed politician.  I also wish him well in the chairmanship of the OSCE.  Two highly significant years obviously are approaching because next year, Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union.  These years will be pivotal both for Ireland and for the wider global community and we have a part to play in this regard.  I am delighted that the secretary general of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly is present to observe the mission and I join the Cathaoirleach in the welcome extended to him.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this regard, after their meeting with the T&aacute;naiste yesterday, the secretary general and President Petros Efthymiou subsequently met the Irish delegates to the Parliamentary Assembly.  At that meeting, they acknowledged and welcomed the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s priorities and the <Col N="50"/>manner in which he has commenced his period of chairmanship of the OSCE.  They certainly had a constructive meeting with the T&aacute;naiste yesterday.  Moreover, it is fair to state the six Irish members of the Parliamentary Assembly are very keen to play whatever constructive role they can in assisting the T&aacute;naiste during Ireland&rsquo;s chairmanship this year.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste might examine how the OSCE&rsquo;s Parliamentary Assembly can best assist in his various priorities and programmes and I may have one or two suggestions to make in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also greatly welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s comments on Georgia.  I visited that country last October and I am conscious of the difficulties regarding Abkhazia and South Ossetia within that particular country and aware of the influence Russia has on these regions.  It is to be hoped the appointment of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s special representative will make a contribution in this regard.  Nagorno-Karabakh appears to be an issue that could be prioritised in that significant progress could be made during the year given that the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia have recently come together.  However, there was something of a stand-off between them.  While in the region, I was given to understand the chemistry between them was not the best from the point of view of creating or advancing the success they already had achieved in going a considerable way towards reaching agreement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I beg the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s indulgence just for a minute to move on to a couple of items I would like to raise.  Dr. Massimo Introvigne, who I know, was the special representative but the T&aacute;naiste has replaced him with Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness.  Dr. Introvigne was particularly keen on dealing specifically with racism and xenophobia and in particular with the persecution of Christians.  I would like to think this will be pursued by his successor, Mrs. Justice McGuinness.  One can look to Egypt and the persecution of Coptic Christians there, as well as the number who are at risk or who have been obliged to flee that country.  Moreover, in Syria, where many Iraqi refugees now find themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Christians are being persecuted.  Some have been raped and others have been murdered.  In his response, the T&aacute;naiste might comment on the Assad regime and what might replace it because it appears to me that its replacement could be highly dangerous for minorities from both the aforementioned countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>It gives me great pleasure to welcome the T&aacute;naiste, a fellow native of east Galway, to the House.  Even though he represents a Dublin constituency, people in east Galway regard him as one of their own.  He attended Garbally College, as did I, and I wish him well.  He is carrying a particularly heavy workload as party leader, as T&aacute;naiste, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and now as the chair of the OSCE.  I also welcome the secretary general of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly who is present.  I compliment the T&aacute;naiste on his excellent work to date and his success in working with the Taoiseach to repair the image of Ireland abroad.  In less than 12 months, they have brought about a situation in which there has been renewed interest in investing in Ireland and in which we rightfully are back on the world stage where we have the potential to punch far above our weight.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste outlined many issues during his contribution and I understand Members have an opportunity to ask some questions.  During his recent visit to the Middle East, the T&aacute;naiste spoke of Ireland playing a constructive role in the Middle East peace process.  How does he envisage this working in practical terms and what are his plans in this regard?  I spoke to the <Col N="51"/>T&aacute;naiste at a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade with regard to the disappointment and offence caused by the closure of the embassy to the Vatican.  At the time I asked the T&aacute;naiste whether it would be possible to facilitate housing both the Italian and Vatican embassies at the magnificent Villa Spada.  Given the difficult financial position in which we find ourselves, this could be a short-term solution.  Has the T&aacute;naiste given further thought to this proposal?</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the T&aacute;naiste has outlined his key priorities for his chairmanship of the OSCE in the next 12 months, what does he hope to have achieved by the end of that period?  The T&aacute;naiste made reference to the trade element of his portfolio and this obviously will be of crucial importance if we are to repair our economy.  In this context, I welcome the Ireland House concept he is putting in place in various embassies in collaboration with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the T&aacute;naiste been given additional resources to carry out this crucial function?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins"><NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">First and foremost, I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House and commend him for all the work he has done in the spheres of foreign affairs and trade since he took over that portfolio.  In particular, he has been to the forefront of restoring Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation.  This has been proven by recent international commentary and I commend him most sincerely.  I also commend him on his efforts to retain the overseas development aid budget at &euro;639 million this year.  On my recent visit to Ethiopia as part of an Oireachtas delegation, I can confirm at first hand how the money has been spent well there.  Ireland justifiably can be proud of making such an indelible mark on Ethiopian society through the initiatives in which we are helping to eradicate poverty there on a daily basis.  In addition, we are assisting to build the necessary infrastructure and to widen the gap between life and death in that country.  Moreover, I am pleased to note the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s commitment in this regard remains so steadfast for 2012.</P>
        <P>This leads me to my next point, which pertains to Ireland&rsquo;s trade situation.  The T&aacute;naiste is aware that Ireland has always been a desirable country for foreign direct investment and the figures for 2009, 2011 and 2012 have been a source of envy for the rest of Europe.  The T&aacute;naiste has shown a particular commitment to the trade aspect of his portfolio through his introduction of the Africa strategy and his commitment to targeting the so-called BRIC countries for trade possibilities.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>However, it will be one of the defining characteristics of the next economy that we fully recognise the essential role to be played by exports.  If Ireland is to benefit fully from the transformational changes taking place in world markets, we must reorient the economy and the policies that shape it towards increasing exports.  We must be very mindful of how Germany came out of the great recession through the force of an exports sector that now constitutes half of its economy.  We must also be mindful of the fact that almost all of the top 30 performing metropolitan areas are located in Asia and South America, while the 30 poorest are all located in Europe and the United States.  There is definitely a very strong message in this.  It means that as nations throughout the world urbanise and accelerate their growth, we will have new markets.</P>
        <P>It is essential that we place flesh on the bones of commitment and look to starting up a strategic investment bank in Ireland which might target export-dependent companies.  We also need to establish a network of retailers in each country in South America and Asia which could be proactive in establishing trade fairs and showcasing the very best of Ireland and its products. <Col N="52"/> While the various Government agencies have a part to play in this, so do our diplomatic staff.  We must look at measuring the success and impact in increasing trade opportunities through an audit procedure.  Will the Department examine instigating such measures?</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister and the secretary general of the OSCE.  My comments bring a human rights lens to this exchange.  This week I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Anne Anderson, Ireland&rsquo;s ambassador to the United Nations.  She is working closely with the Minister in Ireland&rsquo;s efforts to be elected to the Human Rights Council, as the Minister outlined.  Should we succeed, it would be a prime opportunity to contribute to strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the globe.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s vision which has set Ireland&rsquo;s sights on this position, which I acknowledge.  It is crucial because just as we seek to be a robust, albeit small, player at the international economic table, so too do we seek this role at the international human rights table.  This can only be good for Ireland&rsquo;s efforts at national recovery as we attempt to make our mark socially as well as economically in the international arena.</P>
        <P>Seeking membership of the Human Rights Council is a tough challenge, as the Minister knows, because we are competing against the USA, Germany, Sweden and Greece.  Therefore, it is critical to ask why UN member states would vote for us.  It is critical to lead by example.  In this context, I acknowledge our human rights reputation, to which the Minister referred.  I also note that Ireland&rsquo;s meeting with the Human Rights Council in March to formalise our agreed recommendations for the universal periodic review is particularly significant.  Will the Minister confirm that at this meeting Ireland will indicate when it will ratify the UN disability convention?  It is unclear why it has already taken four years to bring the convention into force.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s vision for the Human Rights Council&rsquo;s role is also pertinent to seeking election, an issue to which the Minister referred.  I have several questions in this regard.  Will the Minister outline how he thinks the Council ought to respond to the events of the Arab Spring?  How can the Council be supportive of the democratic changes under way and ensure the representation and participation of women are not sidelined?  This is of concern to the UN special representative on sexual violence in conflict, Ms Wahlstr&ouml;m.</P>
        <P>I note the recent words of US Secretary of State, Mrs. Hillary Clinton, that issues of freedom, dignity and equality of LGBT people comprise one of the remaining human rights challenges of our time.  Allied to this, President Obama recently gave a direction for US embassies throughout the world to partner their host country to support LGBT people.  I am working closely with the US Embassy in this regard.  Will advancing LGBT rights be a priority for Ireland if we are successful in our campaign for election to the Human Rights Council?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister and our distinguished guests to take my compliments to them as read because time is very short.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister stated economic recovery remained a top priority for the Government.  It is very important, but I was glad that the Minister also referred to human rights, which I would like to see these balanced.  I remind the Minister that it was Mr. Dick Spring who established the human rights section in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, something of which he can be very proud.  In this light I wonder whether we have abandoned Tibet totally because of the financial power of China.</P>
        <P>With regard to the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations, I say, &ldquo;Well done.&rdquo;  I supported Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers in travelling abroad when that party was in government because the celebrations <Col N="53"/>present an enormous opportunity.  I will certainly stand up and support such travel, despite the traditional media onslaught when Ministers travel abroad.  It is very important that they do so.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned racism and intolerance in sport.  I am very proud that LGBT issues were raised by Senator Katherine Zappone because it is very important that they are raised.  The Minister referred to the Africa strategy, but nowhere was sexuality mentioned.  I am grateful to him for his letter dated 31 January in response to what I had raised regarding the Uganda anti-homosexuality Bill, the &ldquo;kill the gays&rdquo; Bill, sparked by the intervention of three American fundamentalist preachers.  What is happening there is appalling.  I welcome and support what the Minister said.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the Minister&rsquo;s response to the draft parliamentary resolution on nuclear weapons abolition?  The resolution has been passed unanimously in a number of European countries.  It notes Kofi Annan&rsquo;s urgent call made on 28 November for action to be taken on nuclear weapons non-proliferation and disarmament; calls on all states with nuclear weapons to develop concrete plans with specific timetables to implement disarmament commitments; welcomes the call for nuclear weapons abolition signed by a series of Nobel laureates; and calls for further steps to be considered to criminalise and abolish nuclear weapons.  I propose to table the draft parliamentary resolution for discussion.  Perhaps my request might be considered.</P>
        <P>On a related issue, I have been contacted by Amnesty International, an organisation for which I know the Minister shares my respect, about establishing an arms trade treaty to ensure arms will not be traded in areas in which they will clearly be used in the violation of the civil and human rights of the civilian population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>A considerable range of topics has been covered.  I join Senators in welcoming the secretary general of the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE.  I had the privilege of formally meeting him yesterday morning, with the president of the Parliamentary Assembly and Mr. Soares from Portugal.  Not only will I work with the Parliamentary Assembly during 2012 in my capacity as chairman of the OSCE, but I also intend to work and maintain close contact with the six Members of the Oireachtas in the Parliamentary Assembly.</P>
        <P>Senator Jim Walsh raised the issue of the appointment of Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness as a personal representative dealing with intolerance and discrimination.  She is one of three personal representatives I appointed at the beginning of the year addressing the issue of discrimination and intolerance in its various forms.  She will focus on racism, xenophobia and discrimination, including against Christians.  That is her brief and I am sure she will look at the situation in Egypt.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I take the opportunity to condemn the appalling events which took place at a football game in Egypt yesterday evening.  I am sure Senators join me in that regard.  They were truly shocking and I will issue a formal statement on behalf of the Government on them.</P>
     
	<P Just="Left">Senator Jim Walsh also mentioned the Assad regime in Syria.  We have taken a very strong position in calling on President Assad to introduce reforms and stand aside if he does not do so.  We support the very strong position taken by the European Union, including the imposition of sanctions.  As Senators know, attempts are being made at United Nations level to get a Security Council resolution on Syria.  I have spoken to Mr. Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, about the situation and hope it will be possible to agree to a resolution.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="54"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Michael Mullins mentioned the Middle East peace process.  We support the efforts which have been made through the Quartet that arose in September following the UN General Assembly where a statement and a timetable were agreed by the Quartet.  We have been encouraging both sides to participate in talks and that was the focus of many of my discussions with the leaders whom I met at the weekend, in particular, Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas.  There are considerable difficulties and there are issues relating to mutual distrust.  On the one hand, there are Israeli concerns in respect of security and, on the other, on the Palestinian side a sense that one can engage in talks forever but if settlements continue and the blockade of Gaza continues unabated, it has an undermining effect on the Palestinian leadership.</P>
        <P>I am hopeful of some relaxation of the blockade regime in Gaza and that there will be some confidence building measures agreed by the Israeli side which will be to the benefit of the Palestinian people.  I am working in close co-operation with Catherine Ashton, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the Vatican embassy, I have addressed this issue, as Senator Mullins said at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The issue of whether the Villa Spada can be used as a common home for both embassies is not a matter of choice for us.  The position is that the Holy See will not agree to a single embassy being used to house both missions nor will it agree to have a single ambassador serve both Italy and the Vatican.  If that position is relaxed on the part of the Holy See, certainly we can look at the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question of additional resources for the trade functions was raised by Senators Mullins and Higgins.  We do not have additional resources.  We are living in times when we have to work within the resources available.  My Department with other Departments has had its budget significantly cut in recent years.  The cut in the budget of my Department is close to 30% and there are significant reductions in the number of personnel.  We are trying to make the best effective use of the resources and personnel available and to refocus on trade and, similarly, to work more closely with the agencies.  Our general representation abroad is not just the Irish Embassy.  There is also Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Tourism Ireland, Bord Bia and sometimes representatives of other Departments in respect of different functions.  We are endeavouring to get a more co-ordinated approach to that level of representation, led by the ambassador in each country and co-ordinated centrally in Dublin through the Export Trade Council.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Higgins for her comments in respect of the development aid programme.  There has been a relatively modest reduction in the development aid budget for 2012 from &euro;659 million to &euro;639 million between the bilateral aid that is provided and the contribution we make to multilateral aid.  It is a programme of which Ireland can be immensely proud.  Even in difficult times, as we are now experiencing, we are making our contribution to relieving suffering, hunger and malnutrition among the poorest people, for example, in the Horn of Africa where there are 750,000 people who are starving, and in many poverty stricken parts of the world.  Ireland can be enormously proud of the leadership it is giving, particularly in tackling hunger. This does not go unnoticed.  Yesterday I got a complimentary remark from none other than Bill Gates who made the point that he was impressed, as are many people, that even in difficult times Ireland is maintaining its commitment to development aid and is standing by the poorest in the world.  It is the right thing to do but it gives us a huge authority as a country when we speak with other countries and international institutions about other issues.  When we speak to the ECB and the EU on matters that impact on us such as whether the debt arrangements can be re-engineered in some way and whether we can get a particular facility, the fact that we make a contribution and have a relationship with other countries and international institutions is advantageous as this is not a one-way street.  One cannot just turn up when looking for something, one has to make a contribution.  We make the contribution in the aid <Col N="55"/>area and in human rights.  We are seen as an honest broker that has a colonial past, its difficulties and conflicts and has an experience to bring to issues.  That is the way in which we are carrying forward our foreign policy.  That is the way my chair-in-office of the OSCE will work this year.  The reason we are seeking membership of the Human Rights Council is to make that contribution in order that we can enhance our position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Higgins mentioned our diplomatic staff.  I made the point to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade that we have a very small number &mdash; 347 &mdash; of diplomats who serve internationally.  We have 73 missions abroad which include our international missions.  Other countries of similar size have many more, for example, Denmark has more than 800.  We get enormous value from the committed and dedicated team of diplomats serving us.  However, I am anxious to ensure they are not spread too thinly.  We have to focus on the areas where they see most value.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Zappone referred to the Human Rights Council.  If it was football it would be called the group of death.  It includes Ireland, the US, Germany, Sweden and Greece and is a very competitive field.  As with any election, we seek the support of other countries and we are doing reasonably well on that front.  The Senator mentioned the disability conventions.  I am not sure where that convention is at in terms of its ratification but I will consult with the Departments concerned and write directly to her on it.</P>
        <P>In regard to the points made by Senator Norris, Ireland is committed to complete and verifiable nuclear non-proliferation.  We are working hard at international level to further this issue.  We played a key role in the NPT review conference in 2010.  We are sympathetic to the thrust of the resolution he mentioned.  We are committed to getting an arms trade treaty.  That will be a major priority for us this year on which negotiations are getting under way shortly.  If I have left anything out, perhaps somebody could remind me.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are continuing our diplomatic representation in Africa.  Late last year we launched an Africa strategy which is aimed at bringing together our diplomatic work in Africa, the aid work, and also bringing into focus the opportunities for trade with Africa.  I do not want our aid programme to appear to be entirely mercenary.  The reality is that the openings Ireland has got through its aid activity give us advantages when it comes to trading.  If one considers the levels of economic growth in some African countries, including countries where we have had a big aid programme, there is great potential for Ireland in the years ahead to be able to convert the good will and the contacts we have established through the aid programme into trading and economic opportunities.</P>

I would like to hear his views on the continuing illegal settlements in the Palestinian territories with which the Israeli Government seems hell bent on proceeding.</P>
        <P>With regard to the EU fiscal consolidation treaty, will the T&aacute;naiste clarify whether the Government sought any type of debt write-down?  On 24 January the Taoiseach said:</P><Col N="56"/>

      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is welcome to the House and I thank him for coming here.  What progress has been made on assessing the recognition of the National Transitional Council in Libya.  I raised this question with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the Adjournment and subsequently wrote a letter to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s office on 29 November.  I am aware, and  I do not know if the two are related, that the ambassador, Mr. Patrick Hennessy, was in Libya on 12 December assessing the situation and he was to make a report.  There is a massive opportunity for trade with Libya, as Senator Higgins mentioned.  Enterprise Ireland would say it cannot help Irish businesses because we do not recognise the council, yet those in many businesses have contacted me to point out that they need such assistance.  The British Ambassador, the Right Honourable Mr. Dominic Acquith, held a trade reception in Libya with the Minister on Friday 20 Jauary 2012 and the United Arab Emirates is in a race to get into Libya.  We do not join the party and we do not go into the room when it is clean, rather we help to clean up the mess.  I would like an answer to my question on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House.  The Labour Party&rsquo;s approach has been one of simultaneously progressing human rights at home and in other countries.  The T&aacute;naiste has initiated a new phase.  We are willing to take leadership positions in international bodies and to seek election to the UN Human Rights Council.  One of the consequences of putting ourselves forward is that our record on human rights at home will receive greater scrutiny.  Ireland&rsquo;s first universal periodic review has been very favourable in terms of our own performance.</P>
        <P>On my specific area of interest which is housing and homelessness, as I am sure most Members are aware, that whole area of people in distressed situations has been a source of great distress at home and we have seen the direct conflicts of a right to property without a counter-balancing right to a home in our Constitution.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste in the context of the debate that will happen around the constitutional convention if he would favour Ireland including a right to a home as a counter-balance to a right to property within our Constitution.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.</P>
        <P>I wish the T&aacute;naiste, in his chairmanship of the OSCE every success and in his efforts in securing Ireland a place on the UN Human Rights Council.  It indicates a new looking approach to looking outside our own borders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>We could all say a great deal but I will limit myself to one specific point.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s commitment to Internet freedom through his work as chair of the OSCE.  It is on this note that I draw his attention to the recent arrest of a 31 year old Indonesian civil servant, whose name I will supply to the T&aacute;naiste separately, for having questioned the existence of God on his Facebook profile page.  He has been charged under Indonesian law prohibiting blasphemy and faces five years imprisonment if found guilty.  The reason I raise this case with the T&aacute;naiste is that Indonesia is one of a number of Islamic states that has cited Irish blasphemy legislation in support and defence of its own.  Irish blasphemy law was cited as an authority in support of Indonesia&rsquo;s constitutional court decision to uphold its law prohibiting blasphemy in 2010.  While I fully support the repeal of this law, I do not believe the intention of the blasphemy legislation introduced by Mr. Dermot Ahern in 2009 <Col N="57"/>was to infringe upon the rights to freedom of expression, religion, belief and conscience in Ireland.  Nor do I think it is a desirable consequence that our law is being used to support such infringements, including against Christian religions in Islamic countries anywhere else in the world.  I consider this as much a foreign affairs concern as a domestic concern.  I welcome that this law is up for review in the programme for Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>In welcoming the extension of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department to cover trade &mdash; we will wonder why we did not do that years ago &mdash; I question if there is enough economic expertise in the Department to assist the T&aacute;naiste.  The traditional division was that administrative officers did economics and went to other Departments and third secretaries tended to be in the area of arts and culture.  I welcome the end of the split between them but I hope that the T&aacute;naiste has the necessary economic expertise.</P>
        <P>Another aspect about which I am concerned is that we have become increasing monolingual and language departments in the universities are being shut.  As the Minister in charge with extending trade particularly towards BRIC countries, will the T&aacute;naiste ask the Minister for Education and Skills to end this linguistic isolation to assist the T&aacute;naiste in increasing Ireland&rsquo;s profile worldwide.</P>
        <P>Having asked those two questions, I compliment the T&aacute;naiste.  Our relationship with the United Kingdom has never been better.  That goes back to the Maryville secretariat which was a fairly inhospitable place for people to be in Belfast in the dark years but matters have developed from that to the First Minister attending Gaelic football matches, and long may that progress continue.  The Queen&rsquo;s visit was also a great a success.  Also, our status in the United States is widely envied.  Many other countries would wish to have something like St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  That again is a tribute to the efforts over many years of our staff in Washington.  I would like the Minister to take those plaudits back to his staff.</P>
        <P>My questions relate to our economic expertise for this role and our linguistic expertise in a society which is turning its back on many other languages, foreign languages as we used to call them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the US Secretary of Defence, Mr. Leon Panetta, has stated categorically that Iran is not building nuclear weapons or developing a nuclear programme, why did Ireland support the EU&rsquo;s move to ratchet up tensions by imposing sanctions on Iran via the oil boycott?  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 January the T&aacute;naiste is attributed as having said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Here we&rsquo;re dealing with an undisputed fact that Iran is militarising its nuclear set-up.  There is no argument about the threat that that poses ...</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Is that quote accurate and, if it is, on what grounds did the T&aacute;naiste make that statement?  What role is Ireland playing at EU level and bilaterally to encourage dialogue and prevent the rhetoric of warmongering?  On a  broader level does he believe that Israel has nuclear weapons and, if so, if those weapons pose a threat to their neighbours in the region?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will deal first with the questions raised by Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.  Yes, Ireland supports statehood for Palestine.  We have made it very clear at the UN General Assembly that if the question of Palestinian membership of the United Nations arises, depending on the way in which resolutions are worded, Ireland will support it. </P>
	<P Just="Left">I raised the issue of the settlements in my discussions at the weekend.  I made the point that these settlements are outside the 1967 borders.  One of the big concerns is the possibility that settlements will continue.  There is a particular area outside Jerusalem, the E1 area as it known. <Col N="58"/> It is a serviced site and there is already a police station on it.  It is clear that the services have been put in for settlement and it appears the effect of that settlement will be to sever the northern part from the southern part of the West Bank.  That would be hugely significant and I made a very strong case to the Prime Minister Mr. Netanyahu that this should not proceed. </P>
        <P Just="Left">On the EU treaty, the discussions in which the Government is engaged with the troika, the ECB and the European Commission in particular, in respect of re-engineering our debt arrangements and the arrangements which were put in place for bank recapitalisation is a separate exercise from the treaty that was agreed last Monday.  We have been very keen to keep the two processes separate.   Progress is being made in those discussions.  As the Minister for Finance said, our objective is to see if we can get the more flexible arrangements which now apply in the EFSF and the ESM made available to us, which would be more to our benefit than the arrangements put in place at the time these things were agreed.  Technical discussions have been taking place with the troika, particularly with the ECB and the Commission, and we expect that they will be concluded by the end of February.  Separately, a diplomatic effort is under way in which we are talking with other member states with the objective of winning political support for a resolution of that when we eventually arrive at it. </P>
        
        <P>With regard to the National Transitional Council in Libya, during the United Nations General Assembly in September the United Nations recognised the National Transitional Council as the legitimate authority or government in Libya.  I was at the meeting which agreed that position.  The position is therefore that we recognise the National Transitional Council as the legitimate authority in Libya.  As its name suggests, it is a transitional arrangement because Libya is moving towards holding elections and the transition to democracy.  The United Nations will lead that exercise, as was agreed in New York.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The ambassador, Mr. Patrick Hennessy, was in Libya recently.  I met him briefly in the course of the past week and he briefed me on his assessment of the situation in Libya.  Certainly, we are anxious to support businesses here that wish to do business in Libya.  It is worth mentioning that two Irish residents are Ministers in the new transitional government and, before they returned to Libya to take up their posts, I met and talked with them in Iveagh House.  I made it clear to them that, given their Irish connection, we were willing to help them in any way we could.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with the point in respect of our candidacy for membership of the UN Human Rights Council.  It is obviously important that our human rights reputation be maintained.  Senator Hayden and Senator van Turnhout referred to that aspect.  The worst way one can be about human rights is complacent.  However, let us face it &mdash; we have a good record and reputation.  The periodic review that was undertaken gave a very good assessment of our human rights situation, but it is something on which we must be constantly vigilant to ensure we provide a leadership role in that regard.</P><Col N="59"/>
        <P>I expect that the Taoiseach will shortly make a statement on how we are proceeding with the constitutional convention.  Obviously, that convention will have to consider a range of constitutional matters and the right to a home should be part of that consideration.</P>
        <P>I note the points Senator van Turnhout made about the Indonesian citizen who was arrested.  There are huge issues relating to Internet freedom.  We see, for example, reports of people having to register before visiting Internet caf&eacute;s in some countries, what they look at is watched and monitored and they are visited by the police if the material is subversive in the view of the authority in that country.  That is one of the reasons that, as part of the OSCE exercise, we are convening an event in Dublin which will bring together not just member states of the OSCE but the industry itself.  The fact that organisations such as Google, Facebook and Twitter are located in Dublin will give a local interest to that.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Barrett, what we are attempting to do in the area of trade promotion is to co-ordinate and bring together the entire national effort on trade promotion.  We are giving a great deal of attention to the BRIC countries in various ways.  As I mentioned earlier in respect of China, for example, there will be a number of exchange visits at very high level over the coming year and we expect there will be much discussion of trade issues during those.  There are issues relating to language.  The Minister for Education and Skills is very exercised about that and is working on it.  He has some proposals in that area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am glad the Senator raised the issue of our relationship with the United Kingdom, not least because I did not touch on it specifically in my opening remarks.  Our relationship with the United Kingdom and the issue of Northern Ireland remain a huge priority for the Government, particularly for my Department.  We have an extensive level of engagement now through the North-South Ministerial Council, in the first place.  I meet regularly the First Minister, Mr. Robinson, the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, and the Secretary of State, Mr. Paterson.  There is ongoing discussion.  The fact that, happily, it is not newspaper headlines any more is probably a very good thing, but an amount of work is taking place all the time building on the North-South relationship and the relationship with the UK.  It is significant progress that the bulk of our discussions now with the UK is in respect of matters other than Northern Ireland.  It is on economic issues and the type of issues one would expect to be the normal issues that would be discussed between neighbouring states.  As the Senator said, therelationship between Ireland and the UK is better now than it has been since the State was founded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In response to Senator Reilly, the position on Iran is that Ireland supports what we call the dual track approach.  As the Senator knows, the International Atomic Energy Agency has produced a report on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme in which it clearly expressed its concerns that the programme was moving towards the development of nuclear weapons.  Now, the one thing we cannot have, particularly in a situation where we wish to reduce the amount of nuclear weaponry in the world, is another state developing the capacity to have a nuclear weapon.  Ireland and the European Union wish to see Iran engage in serious discussions on those issues and to inform the international agency and the international community about its plans in respect of developing nuclear weaponry.  Iran has been reluctant to do that, to put it mildly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The threat to the stability of that region, peace and people&rsquo;s safety is very real.  Therefore, the European Union Foreign Affairs Council and I participated in and supported the decision on behalf of Ireland, decided at its last meeting on last Monday week to impose sanctions on Iran, including an embargo on the importation of oil to the European Union from Iran.  Those sanctions will kick in next July.  There will be a lead-in period before that happens.  As I said at the time, this decision is not without cost.  It will have implications for the price of oil.  An economic cost is associated with this.  There is no doubt that there is real concern in the Middle <Col N="60"/>East about Iran&rsquo;s intentions.  That struck me forcefully during my visit to the region last weekend.  I think the decision the EU has taken will be helpful.  I hope it encourages Iran to come to the table to discuss its intentions with regard to its nuclear programme.  I hope it will help to ensure additional states do not develop nuclear weapons.  It might also encourage those states that have such weapons to get rid of them.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House.  I congratulate him on assuming the role of chairman of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe for this year.  It is a great honour for him, the Government and Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On behalf of Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, who is the leader of the Irish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe &mdash; I am the deputy leader of the delegation &mdash; I invite the T&aacute;naiste to address the April or June plenary session of the assembly in his capacity as chairman of the OSCE.  As Ireland will not hold this position again for a number of years, it is important for us to avail of this opportunity by ensuring the T&aacute;naiste attends one of the assembly&rsquo;s meetings this year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to speak about the Middle East.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste for his courage in visiting Gaza and other parts of the region.  I commend him for the support he has given to reaching a two-state solution.  The T&aacute;naiste and I were fortunate that the Israelis did not fire on us when we visited Hebron in 2006.</P>

I congratulate him on his support for Palestine&rsquo;s application for membership of the United Nations.  He has been true to the political and ideological beliefs he expressed in Hebron in 2006.

I welcome the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Cooney, who is also Ireland&rsquo;s ambassador to the Vatican.  When the T&aacute;naiste and I met one day for a brief exchange on the matter, we had the same view on how a satisfactory resolution might be achieved.  The T&aacute;naiste said in response to Senator Mullins that the ball is now in the Vatican&rsquo;s court.  It is our oldest mission and a very important one.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s decision to review the matter.  He has spoken about it elsewhere.  I have heard his update on the situation.  Now that the new nuncio, Archbishop Charles Brown, is <i>in situ</i>, does the T&aacute;naiste agree there is hope and optimism that the matter can be resolved satisfactorily in the short to medium term?  Does he think the Vatican will accept that as a small country in economic difficulties, Ireland should be allowed to run two missions from a single location in the way the T&aacute;naiste and I discussed?  Perhaps the residences could be separate.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to make a brief further comment on the matter.</P>

He is enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation.  Like other Senators, I commend the important stance the T&aacute;naiste has taken on Gaza and on Palestinian rights.  It serves to maintain and enhance this country&rsquo;s reputation as a protector of human rights.</P><Col N="61"/>
        <P Just="Left">I echo Senator van Turnhout in urging the T&aacute;naiste to take a strong line in support of the Indonesian civil servant she mentioned.  We need to examine our blasphemy law because it is clearly having a repressive effect in Indonesia, Pakistan and other countries.  I know the matter will be reviewed as part of the constitutional convention, but the law should be repealed.  Perhaps progress can be made more quickly in this regard.</P>
        <P>In light of Ireland&rsquo;s changing relations with states like China and India, which used to be recipients of aid but are now more like donors to the EU, should we consider establishing a more formalised programme of student exchange with those countries?  Our third level institutions are making great strides to encourage and attract Indian and Chinese students to come here.  We should be sending our students over there as well.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that we have sent many of our students abroad under the Erasmus programme, which has helped to enhance our linguistic abilities and this country&rsquo;s reputation across the EU.  Does he agree that we should develop a more formal programme of student exchange with China and India?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House.  I am privileged to address the House in his presence.  My comments might be a little difficult.  I have recently returned from Taiwan, which is an island of democracy in a sea of dictatorship.  Taiwan, which has a population of 23 million, is one of the four tigers of east Asia, the others being Singapore, South Korea and Shanghai.  However, we do not export to Taiwan or import from it.  One of the 12 science parks I visited has 2,500 patents and has made $30 billion in a single year.  It is crying out for an export-import arrangement with Ireland.  What are our plans in this regard?  Do we have any plan?  Are we silent on the question of exporting to and importing from Taiwan?  If so, can it be attributed to the sleeping bear that is China?  Such fears would be unfounded because Taiwan has many cross-strait alliances.  It does not have any such thought.  I would like to hear the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s opinion on the matter.  Does he intend to reopen the Irish office in Taiwan?  If the office were reopened, it could be a springboard for all kinds of imports and exports to and from China.  When will that happen?  Why does the glorification of China ignore Taiwan?  How does that fit into our idea of human rights?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is very welcome.  I would like to mention the case of an Irishwoman whose husband has been in jail in Sri Lanka for some years.  The T&aacute;naiste has the details of the case.  The woman in question lives in Ireland with the couple&rsquo;s two children.  We have not been able to bring attention to the matter.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste to see what he can do about it.  He has the details already.</P>
        <P>Can we take it that the T&aacute;naiste will not support the admission of Palestine as a state until it recognises the existence of the State of Israel and allows it to exist?  To the best of my knowledge, Palestine does not recognise the State of Israel or its right to exist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to congratulate the T&aacute;naiste on becoming the chairman of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  His status as chairman will give this country an opportunity to address certain matters.  We do not have any trade with, or diplomatic presence in, central Asia.  We have an opportunity to become known there.  The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe is a household name there.  I would like to think Ireland could become a household name there too.  We have great opportunities to do business in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, in particular.  Irish people and Irish companies are doing business there, but many Irish companies do not know those states exist.  Can we take it that the T&aacute;naiste will do his best to ensure Irish companies know that there are opportunities in central Asia?</P>

        <P Just="Left">The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the good work that is being done on North-South and east-west relations.  He will be aware that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson, appeared before the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement earlier today.  It has been a good and historic day.  Many outstanding aspects of the Good Friday Agreement need to be implemented.  There needs to be an all-Ireland Bill of Rights, an all-Ireland civic consultative forum and a truth and reconciliation process.  The T&aacute;naiste might be aware that Martin McGuinness has called for a referendum on a united Ireland to take place after the lifetime of the current Assembly, by which time there will have been two full terms.  It would be important to give the people of the North an opportunity to vote on their future in a referendum.  I would like to hear the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s thoughts on those issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will begin by speaking about the embassy in the Vatican.  I would like to set out the context for the decision to discontinue having a resident ambassador in the Vatican.  As I said, our small diplomatic service is very stretched.  We have to make the maximum use of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about the decision in respect of the Vatican.  That decision was taken in the context that we have a small diplomatic service and we have to make maximum use of its resources.  We are in circumstances where representation is spread very thinly.  What I would like to have been able to do would have been to combine the embassy in Italy and the embassy in the Vatican.  The position up to now has been that we have had two embassies in Rome, housed in two separate buildings, with two separate sets of staff&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">The T&aacute;naiste to continue, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about two embassies in Rome.  It was in that context that the decision was taken to discontinue having a resident embassy in the Vatican.  I wish to be very clear that our diplomatic relations with the Vatican are good.  The Government has decided to appoint the Secretary General of my Department, David Cooney, to be the ambassador to the Holy See and to service that mission from Dublin.  There are some indications that the Vatican may be willing to show some flexibility with regard to the co-location of embassies and offices and then we will continue to explore those possibilities.  If circumstances improve, we can re-examine the position, but at the moment, the position is as it is and we do not have a resident ambassador to the Vatican.  The ambassador, David Cooney, will continue to service the Vatican.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In that context there has been some media speculation regarding a possible invitation to Pope Benedict XVI to visit Ireland.  The normal practice in the case of visits at this level is that an indication is given whether Pope Benedict in this case would accept an invitation.  In the case of the visit of Queen Elizabeth II, the Government of the day did not simply write a letter inviting Queen Elizabeth II to Ireland.  A lot of tick-tacking was carried out and the indication was that she would accept an invitation.  Both the Taoiseach and I have made it clear publicly that if there is such an indication from the Vatican, the Government will issue an invitation to <Col N="63"/>Pope Benedict XVI to visit Ireland.  To date, the Government has not had an indication that such an invitation would be accepted.  If there is an indication that he wishes to come to Ireland, the Government will issue an invitation and there is no ambiguity in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik asked about China.  The Minister for Education and Skills is in the process of having discussions with China.  He is to lead a trade delegation to China in the near future which will focus on the education sector.  I expect considerable progress to be made between Ireland and China in the education area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recently met the Foreign Minister of India when she visited Ireland to unveil a bustof the Indian poet, Tagore, in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  We talked about the developmentof trade relations between Ireland and India, including in the education area, and this is under way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In reply to Senator McDonnell, the office in Taiwan is an Enterprise Ireland office and comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s concerns to his attention.  Ireland supports the One China policy.  We are anxious to develop trade relations with China.  The relationship between Taiwan and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China has been improving in recent times so there may be potential in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In reply to Senator Quinn, I will pursue the issue of the husband of the Irish woman who has been jailed in Sri Lanka.  The Senator has supplied details of the case to my Department.  That situation is being monitored constantly.  The ambassador briefed the Department when he was in Dublin this week.  He visits the person in prison regularly.  I have been in correspondence with the Sri Lankan authorities urging that the prisoner be released or charged.  I will continue to make those representations.</P>

I may be open to correction but I understand Israel is one of the fourth biggest exporters of arms and munitions, yet it imported &euro;1.6 billion worth of arms and munitions over a period of four years.  The countries purchasing from Israel are European.  The building programme continues on Palestinian lands, yet the European Union has not imposed sanctions on Israel.  Could sanctions be considered to ensure such activities can be stopped?  Ten years have passed and nothing has changed.</P>

The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, is hell bent in trade terms to ensure the Chinese Government&rsquo;s desire to give every child a daily glass of milk will be of benefit to Ireland.

International evidence indicates that Christians are among the most persecuted minorities in the world, be it in Orissa in India, Sri Lanka, North Korea, China and so on.  What specific steps does the T&aacute;naiste propose to take in this regard?  If successful in terms of our election to the Human Rights Council, will he prioritise raising the issue with Ms Catherine Ashton?</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the closure of the Irish Embassy to the Holy See, the T&aacute;naiste will agree that there is a difference between having two missions collocated in one venue, which may be a runner, and having one mission to serve two different states, which I understand is not a runner.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the ambassador, Mr. Patrick Hennessy.  He might be able to advise the T&aacute;naiste on whether his unfortunate Secretary General has a snowball's chance of engaging in the type of networking in which an ambassador on the ground could engage.</P>
        <P>Senator McAleese asked this morning whether the decision to close our embassy to the Holy See was a political decision or if the Government had been advised to close it.  I would welcome a response from the T&aacute;naiste to that question.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Many of my colleagues were among the tens of thousands of people in College Green last year to welcome President Obama.  I presume many of them hope he will be re-elected in November.  In his State of the Union address last week President Obama pronounced, as he has done previously, his desire that American investment would be directed back home and that American tax laws be changed &mdash; I am paraphrasing a little &mdash; to discourage American investment overseas in an effort to bring jobs back home.  American investment is crucial for Ireland.  We are heavily dependent on US investment in Ireland.

        <P Just="Left">On Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s question, I and the Secretary of State, Mr. Paterson continuously discuss the outstanding issues arising from the Good Friday Agreement.  I hope that development of North-South arrangements and institutions will continue.  I am particularly anxious to see the North-South parliamentary body progressed as quickly as possible.  I know that the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach have been doing a great deal of work on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On Senator White&rsquo;s question in regard to Justice for the Forgotten, I met the representative of that group.  It is an issue that has been repeatedly raised at several levels with the British Government.  I have raised the issue with my counterparts, including the Secretary of State, Mr. Paterson, Foreign Secretary, Mr. Hague and the Deputy Prime Minister.  The Taoiseach has also raised the issue with the Prime Minister Mr. Cameron.</P>
        <P>On Senator Burke&rsquo;s question on settlements, we have raised that issue with the Israeli authorities.  The settlement which would cause the most damage is the one to which I referred earlier, namely, the E1 settlement, about which we have spoken directly to the Prime Minister Mr. Netanyahu.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On how safe the euro is in the context of the EU fiscal arrangements, the purpose of the treaty and arrangements discussed last Monday is to stabilise the situation relating to the euro.  That is of huge importance to people here, which point has been lost sight of in the context of discussions on last Monday&rsquo;s summit.  People operating in a political bubble are constantly speaking of referenda and the political implications of the treaty and so on.  The issues of most importance to the people are safety of the euro, what is happening in the European economy and the implications of this in terms of their jobs and businesses and future investment here.  The Irish Government's focus in dealing with this issue has been to put that up front and to make it clear that not only the treaty but the jobs and growth strategy are important. </P>
     
	<P>On Senator Mullen&rsquo;s remarks on discrimination against Christians, that matter is a priority.  I have appointed former Supreme Court Justice Ms Catherine McGuinness as my personal representative in the OSCE context to deal specifically with that area and she is already working on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Mullen and White raised the closure of the Irish Embassy to the Vatican.  I take responsibility for that decision.  While as Minister I get advice from my departmental officials, I recommended closure of the three embassies to the Government.  Senator White referred to the decision to close the embassy in Iran.  The point being missed is that we have only a small diplomatic team of 347 people spread across 73 different missions.  These people have to service the needs of our emigrants abroad, including in Canada, Australia and so on and of people who go on holidays to various places and find themselves in one kind of trouble or another.  They also have to service our requirements across all of the capitals of the 27 European Union member states, service our participation in all of the international organisations and to lead the trade missions and co-ordinate the efforts of our agencies.  We cannot spread ourselves all over the place.  I took the view &mdash; I stand by my decision &mdash; that we needed to concentrate our physical and residential presence on a smaller number of missions and for that reason proposed the closure of three missions, one in East Timor, which is associated with our aid work there, the second in Iran and the third in the Vatican.  I would ideally like not to have toclose any mission.  I would like to be in a position to expand missions.  We have only two resident missions in all of South America.  Our presence abroad is small and we must make maximum use of it.</P>

There is a very high level of investment from the United States in Ireland, which is very welcome.  However, what is not often appreciated is the level of Irish investment in the United States.  Almost as many people are employed in the United States in Irish companies as are Irish people in American companies.  It is a two-way street and we make this point at every opportunity when we talk with the US Administration, including when the Taoiseach and I met President Obama formally at Farmleigh during his visit here.

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="68"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join the Cathaoirleach in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to the House.  This motion has been prompted by the agency worker directive, which was adopted in 2008 and was to have been implemented by the end of December 2011.  However, all Members recognise that the economy is in a far different place now than it was in 2008.  The Government has stated that jobs and economic recovery are the top priorities and all Members would subscribe to that.  The Minister will recognise from his background in business that many organisations use agency workers to give them flexibility and competitiveness in the marketplace.  It allows them to introduce different terms and conditions of employment and prevents a haemorrhaging of jobs from the economy to other jurisdictions with lower labour costs.  I have been contacted by employees from many such organisations who are not agency workers.  The workers within such companies, most of which involve foreign direct investment, work beside agency workers and have expressed concern that if agency workers are no longer available to the company, it may have implications for that company&rsquo;s policy on remaining in Ireland into the future.  Consequently, this does not only pertain to agency workers.  It also potentially affects permanent workers in such companies.</P>
        <P>The purpose of my Adjournment matter is to ask whether an evaluation has been undertaken by the Minister and his Department on the impact of the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Bill 2011 and whether an estimate has been made as to the number of jobs that are at risk and may be lost on foot of its introduction.  Moreover, has an evaluation been undertaken to ensure the legislation does not go beyond the transposition of the EU directive in question?  This is set against the background of Ireland&rsquo;s current serious economic and employment issues.  When the present Government took office nearly 12 months ago, it stated that job creation was being prioritised.  Several measures were taken, about which some reservations were expressed as to how successful they might be or the impact they might have.  However, the statistics do not lie.  Unemployment has increased in the interim, which means there must be greater emphasis and urgency on ensuring that we avoid introducing measures that could undermine this policy.</P>
        <P>The Bill states &ldquo;the basic working and employment conditions to which an agency worker is entitled shall be the same as the basic working and employment conditions to which . . . a comparable worker is entitled&rdquo;.  However, the directive&rsquo;s wording is much more restrictive.  It states &ldquo;the basic working and employment conditions of temporary agency workers shall be . . . at least those that would apply if they had been recruited directly by that undertaking to occupy the same job&rdquo; now.  That is different because a person could be doing a job that may have commanded a higher rate of pay some years ago.  Alternatively, someone else doing a similar job may have been recruited many years ago and may have seniority and skills.  In general, the nature of temporary agency workers is that they arrive relatively unskilled and their skill base must be built up.  However, the Government now proposes to ask companies to take on people and that they be paid the same from the outset.</P>
        <P>This runs counter to the stated policy of the Government.  It definitely runs counter to what the economy needs at present and is somewhat reminiscent of what amounted to a populist decision to go back on the decision to reduce the minimum wage.  If our economy is not competitive and does not become competitive, we will have serious difficulty in generating growth, attracting foreign direct investment, new business or new industries, both domestic and international, to create and generate these jobs.  The proposed measure could lead not only to this not happening but to a haemorrhaging of existing jobs.  I am concerned and those to whom I have been speaking in this regard share my concerns.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board this point and to bring it back to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, whose very title incorporates the objective of generating and creating jobs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his timely and pertinent comments and observations on the proposed Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Bill 2011, which is aimed at fulfilling Ireland&rsquo;s EU obligations to transpose the terms of the EU directive on temporary agency work.  As such, the Bill represents the last piece of a three-part matrix of employment rights protection geared towards employees engaged in non-typical work patterns, such as in the case of part-time and fixed-term employees.</P>
        <P>The Bill is designed to give effect to the EU directive on temporary agency work that was finally adopted in 2008 after several years of discussion.  The directive has a transposition date of 5 December 2011.  At its core, the directive aims to establish in all member states of the European Union a legal framework in which agency workers are afforded equal treatment in respect of their basic working and employment conditions as if they were directly recruited by a hirer to the same job.  In Ireland&rsquo;s transposition legislation, equal treatment is being afforded to agency workers as if they were recruited directly by a hirer to occupy the same job, in respect of basic pay, and any pay in excess of basic pay in the case of shift work, piece work, overtime, unsocial hours worked and hours worked on a Sunday.  This is an exhaustive list of those &ldquo;pay&rdquo; components that come within the scope of the equal treatment entitlement of agency workers under the transposition legislation and are entitlements directly linked to the work undertaken by the agency worker while on an assignment.  This excludes other elements of remuneration that are provided in recognition of the long-term relationship between an employer and a permanent employee, such as bonuses, profit sharing schemes, occupational pension and sick pay schemes, as well as maternity top-up payments and similar benefits.</P>
        <P>In short, the directive established a set of minimum rules to be applied by all EU member states having regard to national law, custom and practices in force in each jurisdiction.  This is geared towards improving the operation of the temporary agency work sector by promoting job creation and by making agency work more attractive and more amenable to employers&rsquo; need for flexibility in the labour market.  The underlying rationale for the directive, as explained by the European Commission at the time the proposal was first tabled in 2002, was that by extending the equal treatment provision to agency workers at the EU level and by creating a common framework for agency working, this would promote agency work.  In the context of its analysis at the time, the Commission pointed to the main difference in terms of intrinsic quality of agency working compared with the terms and conditions enjoyed by employees on open-ended contracts as being related to pay.</P>
        <P>The Bill, to give effect to the terms of the EU directive in Ireland, aims to strike the right balance between further protections and a fairer treatment of agency workers while respecting the flexibility for which this work form is known to provide to employers and hirers of agency workers in meeting business needs.  In giving effect to the directive, the proposed Bill aims to respect the objective of ensuring fair treatment for agency workers while at the same time striking a balance with the need to ensure the necessary level of labour market flexibility that the employment of agency workers affords for workers and employers alike.</P>
        <P>Agency work has a legitimate and valuable role to play in the economy and is the option of choice of some people who benefit from the flexibility, personal freedom and income it provides.  It can often keep people in the labour market at times in their careers or lives when they might otherwise be unemployed.  It serves the business needs of employers in that this type of atypical working can be used as a complementary workforce to assist in managing the peaks and troughs encountered in the normal business cycle.</P>
        <P>In the preparation of the current legislation, my Department conducted a public consultation and obtained the views and observations of a range of key stakeholders, including employers, <Col N="70"/>unions, the recruitment sector and other interested parties, including hirers of agency workers.  The outcome of the consultation helped inform core elements of the published Bill.  Simultaneously, a regulatory impact analysis was undertaken.  This provided an overview by way of qualitative analysis of the potential impact on industry costs and on employment of transposition of the directive into Irish law.</P>
        <P>The background to this approach is that it is very difficult to obtain an accurate profile of the agency work sector in Ireland as established statistical sources do not capture this type of atypical work.  In general, estimates based on surveys conducted by private employment agencies suggest temporary agency workers represent approximately 2% of the total working population, which amounts to 35,000 agency workers operating in the private and public sector.  The majority of agency workers are engaged in the private sector across a diversity of sectors ranging from security, manufacturing, services and ICT.  In the public sector, agency working features predominantly in the health sector which employs significant levels of workers on an ongoing basis, a fact that is now more pronounced with the public sector recruitment moratorium.  A key message from the impact analysis is that implementation of the directive brings agency workers and directly recruited staff closer together in terms of equal treatment in basic working and employment conditions.  It has the potential, therefore, to increase the cost of employment in terms of payroll, holidays and the extension of amenities such as cr&egrave;ches and canteens.</P>
        <P>It has been represented that the directive could have an adverse effect on employment, especially in the absence of any derogation facility under Article 5.4, in that for short-term assignments, employers simply will not take on short-term temporary agency workers and instead provide cover with existing employees through overtime or otherwise, with potential for making the black economy attractive.  Furthermore, the case has been articulated that job losses could arise from the loss of future investment projects in Ireland due to a perception of the loss of labour market flexibility if a derogation facility under Article 5.4 is not available.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health points also to increased costs in terms of Exchequer funding for the employment of agency staff in the health sector following transposition.  This will arise as a result of changes that were made to the contracts of agency staff last year which placed agency staff on one of two points of a pay scale that will have to be rolled back given the requirement for equal treatment with direct employees after the directive is transposed.  Furthermore, agency staff currently afforded only statutory annual leave will, after 5 December, be entitled to parity with direct employees which will have an incremental cost to the Exchequer in terms of employing agency staff.</P>
        <P>The Bill, which was published in December, has the balanced approach required to meet the full and proper transposition of the EU directive.  The Government will continue to ensure the necessary balanced approach is achieved in the proposed legislation as it proceeds through the Houses.  In the current challenging economic times, growth and employment are necessary prerequisites of a well-functioning economy that can retain and grow employment.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his response and note the qualitative analysis recognised the directive could have an adverse effect on employment, particularly in the absence of a derogation facility.  Am I right to assume we do not have a derogation facility and therefore this will have an adverse effect on unemployment?  Loss of employment could arise from the loss of future investment projects.  I was told by someone in the industry it will have implications for that person&rsquo;s business.  A decision would be taken outside of here, but that business could end up moving to India or another lower labour cost country.</P>

	<P>The analysis seems to confirm these fears.  Why are we going beyond the intent of the directive which limits it to taking on someone today at a lower rate than he or she would have been paid five years ago?  The Bill will mean such an employee must be paid the same as someone who was employed five years ago.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Will we restrict it to this?  We are going beyond&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I was Chairman of the Oireachtas committee that scrutinised EU legislation for two and a half years and it is about not gold-plating directives when transposing them.  The Government does not intend to gold-plate any EU directive, and this is the mindset of the Minister, Deputy Bruton.</P>
        <P>In the lead-up to the preparation of the Bill and following the consultation phase with key stakeholders, including union and employer representatives and other interested parties, the Minister impressed on all sides the need for a balanced approach which is all about practicality.  As the Senator stated in his initial comments, there is a fine line.  Implementation of the legislation should help sustain existing jobs and grow employment in the sector.</P>
        <P>I am not speaking about job retention and growth at any cost.  The transposition of the directive will provide agency workers with new protections and fair and decent conditions, and this is important.  It is important that agency work continues to be an attractive prospect for workers who wish to pursue this option as a matter of choice and to help meet the flexible working patterns of firms, including small and medium enterprises, to meet business needs.</P>
        <P>The Bill as drafted, with new protections afforded to agency workers through the application of equal treatment in respect of basic working and employment conditions, meets the needs of agency workers and employers alike.  It will certainly help the sector to continue to provide job opportunities to meet employers&rsquo; requirements to deliver services.  The overall approach of the EU directive aims to protect temporary agency workers and improve the quality of agency work by ensuring agency workers benefit from equal treatment.  A purpose of the directive is to recognise employment agencies as employers with a view to contributing to the retention and creation of jobs and the development of flexible terms.  The Bill meets this objective and will provide in its implementation a positive platform for the future development of the agency sector for agency workers, employment agencies and hirers.  It will also support job maintenance and retention in the sector.</P>

        <P>I raise the issue of the public health nursing service in Connemara in light of the fact that we have heard that the public health nurse based in Roundstone who is due to retire will not be replaced.  Roundstone is a very remote rural community and the public health nursing service is extremely important in that area.  Other health services in the area are being curtailed, particularly dental services, due to staffing issues.  We have also heard of the curtailment of services in terms of old people&rsquo;s homes in the area through the amalgamation of services, which is also due to staffing issues.</P>
        <P>There is great concern, particularly in the Roundstone area, about how the service that was delivered by the public health nurse over the years will be continued, where the burden will fall and if it were to fall on public health nurses in areas nearby, would that have a detrimental effect on how they serve their existing communities?  All the public health nurses working in that area are extremely busy and their jobs involve a good deal of travelling to see their patients.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the matter I tabled I asked if the Minister could indicate the wider geographic area of Connemara and the Aran Islands which would be serviced by public health nurses.  Can we expect similar situations to arise there?  Are more curtailments and cutbacks envisaged in the number of health nurses there and in the provision of the services, or are the services to be rejigged?  This issue must be viewed in the context of the number of people who applied for redundancy in the recent opening available to them under the public service agreement, whereby they could apply to leave the service.  I understand some 3,500 people in the health service have applied to leave under that programme and there is the issue of whether that will impinge on the position.

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue as it presents an opportunity for me to make a number of comments on the future of the public health nursing service, particularly the service in Roundstone, County Galway, and in the wider area of Connemara and the Aran Islands.</P>
        <P>The public health nursing service is a structure within the HSE, which consists of a director of public health nursing, assistant directors of public health nursing, public health nurses and registered general nurses and midwives.  A small percentage of specialist posts are filled by clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners.  Registered general nurses work alongside the public health nurse in the community and assist with clinical nursing and caseload management.  This involves the delivery of nursing care to various patient groups, including children and families, palliative care, the young chronic sick, those with disabilities and older people in the community.  Care of children and families includes a universal child health screening and surveillance programme for children up to the age of three and a half years.</P><Col N="73"/>
        <P>The changing demographic profile of Ireland, a rapidly growing older population, increases in the birth rate, increases in the number of people suffering with chronic conditions, reductions in length of hospital stay, technological advances in care delivery and increased demand for health promotional activities have impacted on the organisation, management and cost of the delivery of the public health nursing service.</P>
        <P>The delivery of a sustainable community nursing service that effectively meets the health needs of the population within a primary care setting is the primary aim of the public health nursing service.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s primary, community and continuing care service in County Galway, which has responsibility for public health nursing services in the county, continues to make every effort to protect and maintain front-line services.  Thanks to significant staff commitment and as a result of redeployment and revised arrangements for cross-cover, Roundstone will be covered by the primary care team nurse based in Clifden.</P>
        <P>In the wider context of Connemara, a level of locum cover will be provided to ensure that essential public health nursing services are maintained throughout the area.  The Aran Islands have public health nursing cover at present and it is the HSE&rsquo;s intention that this cover will continue to be provided.  Individual staffing situations will be considered in light of existing resources and the challenges imposed by the recruitment moratorium.</P>
        <P>Contingency planning is ongoing to ensure quality safe services can be delivered following the retirement of staff from services at the end of this month.  The HSE is currently carrying out a review of public health nursing services, which is expected to be completed shortly.  This review will inform national HSE policy in order to facilitate the integration of services and the delivery of efficient and safe care to patients in the community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to give the Senator an assurance that I see a very bright future for community nursing and public health nursing in particular.  I believe they will become the mainstay of primary care services.  I look forward to receiving the report from the review group and restructuring the way in which we deliver public health nursing services but I see them as being an absolute essential in terms of the rollout of enhanced primary care services.</P>

It do not believe anybody is under any illusion about the kinds of challenges that will face us in the health service at the end of this month.  It will be difficult, of that there is no doubt.  What I am seeking to do in the primary care area is to ensure that we can recruit a certain number of front-line people.  We have managed to secure &euro;20 million to fill vacancies.  We do not know at this point the exact number of vacancies that will arise in primary care but, to the greatest extent possible, we will use that <Col N="74"/>ring-fenced money to fill vacancies at the coalface, professionals providing the services on the front line.  That will be done by employing people but there is an employment control ceiling by which we are bound.  If it is a case that our allocation of posts is used up, we will then have to take another approach in terms of employing people on a sessional basis, ensuring that we get much greater flexibility from the services that are in place.  We were promised that the Croke Park agreement would deliver that kind of flexibility and that will be tested in the coming months.</P>

Nine out of ten sufferers are female with the highest incidence occurring between the ages of 15 and 45.  The symptoms of lupus are various, vague and often almost impossible to diagnose but many of the symptoms can be painful and severe.  They include painful muscle swelling, skin rashes, fever, migraine and other neurological problems.  They also include hair loss, weight loss, chest pain and lung problems, nausea, oral and nasal ulcers, high risk pregnancy and, in some cases, heart, kidney, brain and lung damage.    While it can be mild for some, it can also be very severe and can affect vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, lungs and brain.  The condition can cause severe attacks which can be triggered by stress, a virus or a traumatic experience, and environmental triggers such as the sun.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no cure for lupus.  There was a time when lupus claimed many fatalities but, thankfully, lupus patients can now lead relatively normal lives, but only with the appropriate medication and the ongoing care of a rheumatologist.  The condition can mean that sufferers will either spend significant amounts of money on treatments simply to be able to get on with work and life or they will be forced to go without.  While there is provision for them in terms of the drugs payment scheme, that does not take into account the full cost of treatment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The cost of treating the condition is not small.  Many lupus sufferers require weekly check-ups with their GPs, as well as visits to consultants, which can cost up to &euro;150 per session.  This is still not the full cost.  We should not penalise people for this condition, especially in the current climate.  If we had proper universal health care in the State, the call I am making today would not be so relevant.  However, we are where we are with the health service and this issue remains one that must be examined by the Minister.  I ask that the illness be included in the list covered by the long-term illness scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On a related matter, aside from medication or treatment, there is a lack of information, resources and support available to people with lupus and their families.  Many sufferers must effectively diagnose and treat themselves by looking up articles on the Internet to find more information.  This approach is becoming more common in Ireland owing to the poor health <Col N="75"/>resources available.  We will shortly have a nation of expert amateurs working in the health service as doctors.</P>
        <P>Does the HSE have any plans to provide more information and greater support on this condition?  I ask the Minister to revise the list of conditions covered by the long-term illness scheme and to include lupus in it.  It would make the lives of many people tangibly and significantly better.  Will she agree that the list is outdated, given that it has not been revised since the 1970s?  There is a range of illnesses, including lupus, not covered by the scheme but which have an impact on the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and which should be included in the scheme.</P>

	<P>The long-term illness scheme is a non-means tested scheme introduced in 1971.  It provides free medicines and medical appliances to people with specified conditions.  Some 16 conditions are covered by the scheme.  Requests to expand the range of conditions are frequently made but at this point there are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the scheme.</P>
        <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  In recent times the situation with the assessment of applications on medical grounds has improved.  There is a panel, headed by a GP, that assesses the medical applications.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.</P>
        <P>Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the long-term illness scheme can use the drug payment scheme which protects against excessive medicine costs.  Under this scheme no individual or family pays more than &euro;132 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, non-reimbursed medical expenses can be offset against tax.</P>
        <P>The diagnosis and management of systemic lupus erythematosus takes place in a number of health care settings.  Patients with lupus are generally under the care of a rheumatologist and other specialists as necessary, such as dermatologists.  The programme for Government committed to reforming the current public health system by introducing universal health insurance with equal access to care for all based on need, not on ability to pay.  The universal health insurance system will be underpinned by the principle of social solidarity.  Every citizen will have a choice of insurer and will have equal access to a comprehensive range of curative services.</P>
        <P>The Government is also committed to introducing universal primary care within its first term of office.  This commitment will be achieved on a phased basis to allow for the recruitment of additional doctors, nurses and other primary care professionals.  A universal primary care project team has been established &mdash; we had our first meeting last week &mdash; and it has been tasked with working through the issues relating to this commitment.</P>
        <P>While I take the points made by the Senator, it has been decided that the policy to be pursued will be in respect of providing universal free access to GP services.  There is a clear commitment that we will do that within the next four years.  That will cover everybody in the population.  We cannot do everything, unfortunately, but we are on a clear course in terms of opening access across the population.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The reason I raised this issue is that I was contacted by a lupus sufferer.  She has pointed out that she and many people have found themselves in a position where they are unable to get the supports they require from the State because they simply are not available.  She made the appeal, not only on her behalf but for all lupus sufferers and people who suffer from other illnesses, that they get the proper supports.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides that we will move towards an improved system at some point in the future but I regret that she does not intend to review the scheme.  It would have been the right thing to do.  I appreciate that we are in straitened economic circumstances but I still believe we should ensure that people have access to proper services and supports when they suffer from illnesses through no fault of their own.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that people who suffer from lupus and those who suffer from other conditions would make the case to be included under the scheme.  In an ideal world, we could do that but the policy we have decided on is to pursue free universal access to GP care.  As I said, we cannot do everything.  However, the Senator raised the issue of information being made available.  I will check that with the HSE and revert to him on that point.</P>
