	<P>I have received notice from Senator David Cullinane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Children to discuss the future funding for the Ballybeg Community Education Project and comment on the plans to subsume it into the national school completion programme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Thomas Byrne of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss his proposals to ensure adequate places and adequate choice in primary education in Ashbourne, County Meath.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2012, Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., and No. 2, Employment Equality (Amendment) Bill 2012, to be taken at 4 p.m. and conclude not later than 6 p.m.   The latter Bill has been tabled by Senator Averil Power and will be taken during Private Members&rsquo; business this afternoon.  I have been asked, as a one-off, to allow the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Quinn, to respond to the Second Stage of the debate.  I seek the agreement of the House to allow each Minister ten minutes to outline their position in respect of this important legislation.  I am in no way setting a precedent in allowing both Ministers to speak.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly with regard to influencing legislation.  I ask for the co-operation of the House in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>My party would agree but we must first examine speaking time.  The legislation introduced by Senator Power, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, is well thought out and I hope that the Government will accept it.  Having two senior Ministers present today is a good departure.  It is either a feast or a famine but we are more than happy to have them here to discuss the legislation introduced by my group.</P>
        <P>I have a question for the Leader on the closure and restricted hours of Garda stations.  As of 30 April, 31 Garda stations closed and another ten have restricted hours.  I raised the issue in the House on numerous occasions, as did many of my colleagues.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is also planning another raft of 40 Garda station closures, plus further restrictions.   The loss of a Garda station in a community, be it rural or urban, has a huge knock-on effect.  I also raised the issue on the Adjournment with the Minister directly and I am concerned about his argument that restricted stations will not be open to the public from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. thus allowing more garda&iacute; to be on the street.  That was a spurious claim to put it mildly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have since found it to be fact that the restricted stations will be closed after 9 p.m. and any person detained or arrested, in any of the areas covered by the restricted Garda stations, will have to be driven to the nearest full-time station thus taking up the time of three garda&iacute;.  Let us take, for example, the closest Garda station to me, Malahide, where the only Garda car in the town will have to be driven seven miles to Coolock in order to book in a prisoner but will keep three garda&iacute; off the street.  All of the stations that have been closed, plus the restricted ones, will spend thousands of euro because the superintendents in each area have asked for a quote for CCTV cameras and security systems to be installed in order that they can secure these stations.  When the Minister responded to me he said that there would be insignificant monetary savings from these changes and he was purely doing it to protect the public and allow more garda&iacute; on the beat.  That is patently not the case.  There are fewer garda&iacute; on the beat because they must spend their time driving detained persons to full-time stations and hundreds of thousands of euro will be spent on installing security systems in the Garda stations that have been closed and restricted.  This makes no sense.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is to attend the House this afternoon to deal with important legislation, which we will facilitate.  He also needs to explain why the information in the responses he gave to me and to our justice spokesperson was incorrect.  There will be fewer garda&iacute; on the beat and not only will there be no monetary savings, but his proposal will cost the Exchequer.  As indicated at the recent Garda Representative Association conference, it is putting citizens&rsquo; lives and safety at risk.  I am tabling an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Justice and Equality attend the House in order to explain the situation with regard to the Garda stations that have closed as of 30 April, the stations that are restricted and the criteria he will use to close a further 40 stations throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour group, I also welcome that two senior Ministers will come to the House to discuss the legislation.  It is recognition that the Seanad is a place where important legislation can be discussed and two Ministers can join together to contribute to that debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is with some sadness that the words &ldquo;Catholic Church&rdquo; and &ldquo;child abuse&rdquo; are on the lips of many.  It is sad on the part of those victims who now find themselves back in the centre of a story that has unfortunately persisted for too long.  There is sadness for the families and for the church, and there is also some anger.  I find it ironic that the church has stated that no State or church guidelines for responding to allegations of child abuse existed in Ireland in 1975 and yet a young man, Brendan Boland, knew enough in 1975 to be able to report the things that were wrong.  He was not a priest, had not been trained and had not been to university but he understood something was wrong.  He was the one who was ignored.  I find the irony at the heart of that extraordinary and I echo the calls from the One in Four group for Cardinal Brady to make a proper response to the allegations made in the BBC programme at this time.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to write to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine regarding the payment for those on the AEOS 2 scheme.  The scheme closed in May 2011 and there were 6,500 successful applicants.  This money is given to farmers for the halting of the loss of biodiversity, improving water quality and combatting climate change, which we all agree are very important.  I had understood the payments would be made by Christmas.  I was further told that payments would be made by Easter, yet this week I have received phone calls from people asking where the payments are.  I wish the Leader to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine why the AEOS 2 payments continue to be delayed.</P>
        <P>I am a co-convenor of the mental health cross-party committee.  Tomorrow we will join in the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society of Ireland tea party day &mdash; if Senators will excuse the expression &mdash; in order to raise money and awareness of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease here in Leinster House.  As people will know it is the most common form of dementia in Ireland and the number suffering from the disease is predicted to rise to 104,000 by 2036.  The Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society of Ireland does much work in providing support for families, carers and those suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  That event, sponsored by the mental health group will take place between 10 o&rsquo;clock and noon.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to drop a line to Glen Hansard congratulating him on the 11 Tony Award nominations for his very successful Broadway play, <i>Once</i>.  It is something bright and good news.  It is evidence of Glen Hansard&rsquo;s extraordinary perseverance over a long period of time.  Even though he thought he would never make it, here he is being recognised for the second if not the third time as reward for his hard work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will be aware of the concern I have expressed for a number of years over the number of organ donations in Ireland.  There was great news yesterday when Facebook announced it would provide a facility to allow its users in Britain and the United States to declare whether they were willing to donate organs.  This means that if somebody dies it will not be necessary to check if he or she had an organ donor card and instead it could be found from his or her Facebook page.  I ask the Leader to draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to this development.  If it is available in Britain and the United States we should surely have it in Ireland.  I know the Irish Kidney Association would support that wholeheartedly.</P>
        <P>I had a very interesting day yesterday.  I visited Stormont as part of a delegation from the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education.  I found the visit very educational in many ways.  While Stormont meets for much shorter times than we do, it limits the length of time Members have to speak, in most cases &mdash; I believe there are some exceptions &mdash; to five minutes.  Some Assembly Members indicated to me that it should always be possible to say something in five minutes and it does not take 20 minutes to do it.  Incidentally, if a Member decides to speak in one of the other two languages that are allowed, it eats into those five minutes as it is necessary to get translators for Gaeilge or Ulster Scots.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise an item that might be considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  There were reports yesterday that seven months after new rules came into effect in America limiting the amount banks could charge as a fee when consumers swipe debit cards, the Federal Reserve indicated that the average fee paid by merchants for debit-card transactions covered by the rule was 24 cent in the fourth quarter of 2011, which compares with 43 cent before the federal law took effect on 1 October 2011.  In other words, the US Government was able to introduce legislation limiting the amount retailers could be charged and which they need to pass on to their customers.  I believe in Ireland each trader negotiates how much he pays to the bank for the debit cards.  If they could get anything like the reduction achieved in the United States we should consider it here.  In the case of credit cards it is done on a percentage basis, which means the more a customer spends, the more the bank charges the retailer.  However, the cost to the bank for a &euro;1,000 purchase should not be any more than for a &euro;10 transaction.  That is something we should consider.  At a time when we have concerns about costs, this is one cost on which we could act immediately and show immediate results.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome a debate in due course on rural policing.  While I cannot speak for the experience in the cities, Garda station closures in rural areas were necessary because they were costing a significant amount.  A proper communication system and the availability of more vehicles thereby allowing garda&iacute; to respond quickly to crime would be far more useful than having a member of the force sitting in a Garda station, where he or she might only sign one passport application form in a month.  There is an argument for a mature and reasonable debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>What did the Senator tell the people in Carrigaholt when the Garda station was closed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Conway without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P>When people get proper information about decisions, they understand the rationale and accept it.  Within that discussion and debate there is an argument for increasing the role of the local policing committees.  I used to be a member of a policing committee.  It is a very good model with potential to ensure that the message is properly communicated.  Nobody wants to put anybody in jeopardy or undermine policing, but at the same time we need to ensure the money spent on policing is having maximum effect.  I would prefer to have increased communication and greater ability to make use of the vehicle fleet.  Garda&iacute; are more flexible when they are not tied to desks and that is ultimately what people want.  There is an argument for a full debate on policing with the Minister in which he can explain the rationale for his suggestions.  The personalised nature of the attack on the Minister for Justice and Equality at the Garda Representative Association conference was appalling.  I have yet to hear an apology for that attack, which was completely out of order.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;proposing that the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to discuss the closure of rural Garda stations, and indeed those not so rural, as my colleague has pointed out this morning.  The latest stations to fall victim to the Minister&rsquo;s cuts in recent days have been Clontibret and Smithboro in County Monaghan and Tullyvin in County Cavan.  While he is here I would like him to outline, in his capacity as Minister for Defence, what progress, if any, has been made in disposing of the four barracks that were closed in recent weeks.  Maybe he would outline to the House how much it is costing the State to provide security at these barracks.  I know, for instance, that in Cavan there are a number of security men on 24-hour duty, which is costing a substantial amount.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, to the House.  We read in the newspapers over the weekend and again today that the Minister intends to publish his blueprint for local government reform in June.  I am particularly concerned about reports that the number of county councillors to be elected at the next local government elections will be dramatically reduced.  Indeed, there are reports that he intends to do away with town councils altogether.  This is an affront to democracy.  Fianna F&aacute;il is totally opposed to this measure, and the Minister should give the House the courtesy of coming here, prior to the publishing of any blueprint, to outline to us his plans in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senators about the Garda stations; we should ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss this.  There was an incident last night in the St. Johnston area of Donegal, near the border with Derry, in which a young guy was injured in a punishment shooting at his home.  The issue is not whether the Garda stations should remain open; it is whether there should be more garda&iacute; on the road and out around the place.  I do not think that if the Garda station had been open in the St. Johnston-Carrigans area last night it would have made one bit of difference to the people who carried out this punishment shooting.  The Minister should address the organisation of the Garda in the area.  It would be more useful if Garda cars were employed along the Border area as a deterrent.  I do not think it is any great advantage to have a garda in the station at 10 o&rsquo;clock at night.</P>
        <P>We must examine how the Garda stations have changed over the years.  Garda stations in rural areas were used almost as drop-in centres, but now we have technology and we have drop-in centres in towns and villages everywhere, so the stations have become more of a base for garda&iacute; to come into and leave again.  It is not an issue that stations are closing; it is an issue that garda&iacute; are not available to combat crime.  Garda stations were used for everything; my own wife was born in one.  I do not think that would happen again.  Her father was not in for questioning; he was actually a garda.  The stations used to have a family-oriented function, but now they have moved on.  I agree with the sentiments of the Senators in opposition.  The Minister must show criminals that there are more garda&iacute; on the streets rather than more police stations.  Garda&iacute; on the streets in patrol cars and gathering intelligence act as a deterrent to criminals.  I sympathise with the family in Donegal who had this foisted on them last night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to repeat a call I made last week to the Leader to provide a debate on the relations between Church and State.  I say this in light of the tragic revelations of last night.  It is extraordinary that these have come on foot of the silencing of Fr. Brian D&rsquo;Arcy and Fr. Sean Fagan, and in this case children were silenced as well.  Gay people have also been silenced.  The term used in the church, which demonstrates this prejudice against gay people, was <i>peccatum illud horribile inter christianos non nominandum</i> &mdash; that sin so horrible it must not be mentioned among Christians.  A veil of silence descended.  I compliment Fine Gael on the courage of Deputy Buttimer in coming out.  At least I am not the only gay in the village any more.  There is quite a little flock gathering.</P>
        <P>This is a terribly serious issue, because it also affects the Protestant churches.  The Anglican Archbishop of Dublin repeatedly asked the then Minister for Justice to include the victims of the Bethany Home in south Dublin in the investigations into child abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board, but this was never done.  There is an unmarked grave in which several hundred infants are buried anonymously.  If it had been the Cardinal who had asked, it would have happened immediately.  I simply do not understand it.  Although we are blaming the Catholic Church all the time &mdash; like any institution, it deserves a certain amount of blame &mdash; we must not leave the State out, and we must make sure we consider any instance of abuse.</P>
        <P>I was absolutely shocked to learn of the various cardinals in Britain launching a campaign against gay marriage.  Not only are they instructing politicians and having pastoral letters read out, but they have now gone into the schools and instituted an instruction that schools should be made to campaign.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I can guarantee one thing: that will silence every gay pupil and lead to an increase in homophobic bullying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Do you have a question for the Leader, Senator?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I am asking that we have this debate so that we can discuss this in a reasonably measured way.  I know of continued instances of homophobic bullying in schools, inspired by clergy, and I want to make sure no such campaign against gay marriage is instituted in this country by the religious.  Believe me, it will lead to further examples of bullying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague Senator Conway in his call for a debate on rural policing.  It would be very wrong to judge the quality of our policing throughout the country by the number of buildings we have.  Senators know well that the proliferation of Garda stations around the country date from an era when policing was done by bicycle.  We have moved on from that and we need to consider our policing system overall.  A debate in this House would be appropriate.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader to organise a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on his recently announced early release programme for low-risk prisoners.  Over the past 24 hours there has been a lot of scaremongering, but many legitimate fears have been expressed as well.  It would be good for the general public if we had a comprehensive discussion on this issue.  We want to ensure vulnerable people do not feel less secure in their homes, and do not feel worried or concerned, as a result of this progressive action.  The Minister has taken some brave initiatives, and it would be appropriate that he come to the House for a forthright discussion on the rationale for and logistics of this programme.  Some of the commentary in the last couple of days has been over the top, and it is only right that we set the record straight and have a measured debate in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Last September this House passed a Labour Party motion that was supported by Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Independents and, of course, the Labour Party itself.  It proposed that greater protections be instituted for employees facing collective redundancy and that the Government review existing legislation to examine whether a longer notice period than 30 days should be provided by a company that employs significant numbers of people and intends to make collective redundancies.  That was in the context of what was happening in the economy at the time.</P>
        <P>It was brought forward in the context of what was happening in Waterford, especially with Waterford Crystal and TalkTalk where 500 workers were disgracefully treated by the company and given inadequate notice.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Since then the Government has not introduced any legislation in this area.  We have had Lagan Brick, La Senza, Wilson Publishing, Game, Vodafone, Vita Cortex and many more examples of workers engaged in sit-ins and protests for their just demands.  During the debate, Senator Denis Landy argued that an extension of the notice period for workers to be made collectively redundant was necessary as it would improve the situation of many workers faced on being made redundant.  Yesterday, in the D&aacute;il, my party moved the Protection of Employees (Amendment) Bill 2012.  The response from the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock, who argued against the Labour Party motion at the time was that an increase in the notice period to 90 days is unrealistic and would lead to a prolonged period of uncertainty for employees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator please give the full quotation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>During the same debate, Senator Marie Moloney criticised the inordinate delays which faced applicants for entitlements under the insolvency fund but yesterday the same Labour Party Minister of State said he believed the relevant current legislative provisions provide an adequate level of support for employees who find themselves in a position where their employer has become insolvent.  I do not quote any of that in order to be mischievous but because that is what was said in the House.  In good faith, this House passed the motion which called on the Government to extend the notice period, to enhance employment rights and to ensure workers get their entitlements quicker than at present.  There was universal acceptance in the House that the people in Waterford, in TalkTalk and in Waterford Crystal, who have been treated unfairly, needed to be protected and workers rights needed to be enhanced.  I ask the Government representatives to lobby their parties to pass the Bill before the other House to give practical expression to the motion passed here, and also to ensure we, collectively, play our part in enhancing workers&rsquo; rights in order that there is not a recurrence of such situations and crocodile tears from public representatives.  Our job is to legislate to protect workers.  That was the intention behind the Bill which is before the D&aacute;il.  I hope it is supported by those parties who supported the broad thrust of the Bill which was debated here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent months I have noticed an increasing tendency among Deputies, particularly, Government backbench Deputies, to voice critical comment about this House, the tenure of which is that it should be abolished.  It is undesirable that we would enter into a controversy on the matter with the Lower House but a response is required.  I am happy to engage in any debate on the future of the House with anyone but the difficulty that arises is that the commentators who raise these concerns put forward no argument, which leads me, rightly or wrongly, to conclude that these calls are based on the issue of abolishing the House to save some money.  There may be many reasons to abolish the House but to save money is not one of them.  I could, perhaps, suggest to our colleagues in the Lower House that another way of making comparative savings would be to look at the salaries of politicians in that House.  I am puzzled at the fact that there are 23 Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">There is also the Leaders&rsquo; allowance and, perhaps, that could be looked at.  I am puzzled at the different pay rates for Deputies and Senators.

	<P>The public would consider Senators and Deputies to do primarily the same work in the constituencies.

	<P>I join Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe in calling for a debate on the issues raised in last night&rsquo;s BBC television programme which were shocking in the extreme.  As a Catholic, it is incumbent on the Catholic Church and the institutions of the State, including the Houses of the Oireachtas, to ensure appropriate action is taken.  How many more revelations are to be made?  How much more do we not know?  Do we depend on the BBC, RTE and investigative journalists, such as the Senator in her day, to uncover these issues?  The Catholic Church, in the interests of its own people &mdash; I being one of those &mdash; must clarify the position and ensure all action is being taken, that appropriate comment is given to the issues as seen last night.  There are many reasons for failure but there are no excuses.  People from all religions and none were united in shock at the revelations last night.  Some of the commentary this morning would not inspire confidence.</P>
        <P>On another issue I seek a debate on poverty in Ireland.  Yesterday the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service launched an on-line calculator, after 13 years of research, to help determine the precise level of income required by a household to eat, clothe and pay important bills.  The issue has been raised previously in the context of mortgage arrears and it has been suggested that we identify an amount of money which must be protected for families and may not be drawn upon for the payment of debt and other bills.  Some years have passed and yet no decisive action has been taken on the issue of mortgage arrears.  Families are still suffering.  The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service revealed yesterday that some families have to live on as little as &euro;15 per week for groceries.  Collectively, we are failing on a weekly basis to provide for the protection of basic levels of income for these people.  It would be useful for the Civil Service and Departments to use the calculator to help determine the effects of any proposed reductions or increases on social welfare rates.  We could usefully debate these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senators Norris and MacSharry who have called for a debate on church and State.  While we had a good debate yesterday on pluralism in education it would be valuable to have a debate on church and State.  Senator Norris said he knew of several cases of homophobic bullying by clergy.  If any Senator knows of anything of this nature, the onus is on them to do their level best to ensure it is not happening.  Also there is an onus on everybody involved in the Catholic Church.  As Senators Norris and MacSharry have said when one hears references to notetakers or whatever there is a need to ensure everything is done.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the position of kidney donors.  From today, in the UK and US  Facebook will be able to register donors.  Senator Feargal Quinn will be pleased to hear this as he was one of the first to raise the issue and brought forward a Bill on organ donation.  We do not have such a facility in Ireland.  For myself, I would like an opt-out rather than an opt-in.  In the US and UK, users will be able to register as organ donors through their websites.  I suggest Facebook be approached here to provide a similar service.  The Taoiseach has a good relationship with the leader of Facebook and Sheryl Sandberg and has had many discusssions on bringing Facebook to Ireland.  I ask him to approach Facebook and help the Irish Kidney Association.  Last year it announced an organ donor card app for the iPhone and Android which allows users to make their intentions clear.  As Facebook is used by most Members and widely across the country this would be an easy way to let everybody know one&rsquo;s intentions.  Perhaps it could be done in an official capacity in Ireland as well as in the UK and US.</P>

	<P>I call on the Leader to allow an urgent debate on this issue.  I know there is proposed legislation on this matter.  We see that Fr. Brian D&rsquo;Arcy and others are being silenced, as part of current church policy.</P>

	<P>This abuse is not just in the Catholic Church, but as Senator Norris pointed out, it is across society.  Most abuse takes place in the home and is perpetrated by a family member.  It is the silence and inaction of the church that allows the abuse to continue which is the grave crime.  Anybody who hears about it is totally appalled.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader allow time for a discussion on the NAMA and Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Transparency Bill 2011 which my colleagues and I have published?  This Bill allows the public to see the properties that NAMA is selling.  Last week a property that was never on the market, but which was bought for &euro;100 million, was sold for &euro;7 million.  Nobody in the area knew it was for sale and then it was gone.  Under the legislation NAMA must sell all State assets under its control.  Loans are State assets and NAMA is a State body and must sell them in an open and transparent manner in accordance with the sale of public goods, whether by tender or public auction.  That is what NAMA is supposed to do, but it is not doing it.  We, as Senator Coghlan who is a former auctioneer would know, are losing millions of euro as a result of a lack of transparency.  I ask the Leader to allow time for the NAMA and Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Transparency Bill to be introduced and discussed in the House?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I rise in support of my colleague, Senator Diarmuid Wilson, who has called for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, to come to the House to discuss his proposals on the future of local government.  It is extremely important that the Members of both Houses and also the representatives of the Association of County and City Councils should be the first people to whom he outlines his proposals.  I was disappointed to discover the Minister&rsquo;s first real comment on proposed reform of local government was made at a planning conference in the marble city, Kilkenny, when he had ample opportunity at two other conferences that were organised by councils&rsquo; associations to outline some, if not all, of his proposals.  He did not take that opportunity.  There is a requirement to show respect across the board and to take cognisance of the difficulties that will arise from these proposed changes.  I fully support the points made by Senator Wilson on the process.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Gilroy&rsquo;s call for a debate with our colleagues in the Lower House.</P>

I commend the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for announcing the early years expert advisory group.  This is a very important step forward.  I note the expertise of members but I raise the issue of the Irish language in early years education and the early years education in Gaeltacht areas.  Having made that point, this is a very welcome step.  It would be helpful if the Minister were to come to the House to outline her vision of early years education.  It was also mentioned that we needed to discuss the issue of child care.  While child care and early years education are linked and are not mutually exclusive, early education is a much broader area.  We have a particular expertise in this field.  Members have worked in this area and have been involved with community child care committees and could bring a lot to the debate.  It would be pertinent to have the Minister&rsquo;s vision on some of the child welfare cases we read about in the media.</P>

We have seen it in Killarney and it is already increasing the boat trips on the lakes.  It will do things for Lough Derg and for the other parts of the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Gilroy&rsquo;s call for a debate on political reform.  The debate should not be solely concerned with the future of the Seanad but should be a broad ranging discussion.  I am not sure of precedent but would the Taoiseach take the opportunity to air his views on the raft of areas that could be improved and developed, as a commitment was included in the programme for Government to hold a referendum on the future of the Seanad?</P>
        <P>Due to the Supreme Court ruling on the McKenna judgment, once a referendum is called our hands are tied.  I count this as a form of censorship.  If a referendum is called in the morning on the future of the Seanad, we would be proscribed from advocating a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote or a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote, which I think is absurd.  We are expected to argue the debate with one hand tied behind our back.  The debate on political reform should be broadened.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, and the Garda Representative Association at their recent Easter conferences called for the establishment of an independent policing authority.  It was dismissed out of hand by the Department of Justice and Equality, as if it did not count.  In the context of the matters raised by Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien and Martin Conway on policing in both urban and rural areas, it would be helpful if we had an independent policing authority to look at these matters in a detached and apolitical fashion.</P>
        <P>Everyone is bewildered by the fact that 19 Deputies draw down &euro;50,000 each as an allowance for so called party leaders.  That is absurd in the extreme.</P>

	<P>Senator MacSharry referred to the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  It produced a very useful piece of information last Christmas.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, to come here to facilitate a question and answer session like we had with some Ministers to discuss the multiple welfare payments made to some homes, the multiple welfare payments plus income made to some homes and the lack of balance where homes do not get the support that they need.  There are homes where if a person works it right by working 20 hours per week they will receive family income support, lone parents allowance, a few bob from the partner who has left, wages and every support going.  In contrast some people do not have enough to live on.   We need to arrange a debate to discuss a welfare plus income cap and give people a decent income to live on.  </P>
        <P>I want to raise an important matter.  Last weekend a family in my town ferried its four children to their first communion using three Hummer vehicles and a glass carriage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>The amount of money spent in such instances and provided by the State has gone beyond a joke and gives the two fingers to people living in normal society.   I ask the Leader to invite the Minister here to openly discuss a welfare cap and the provision of an appropriate amount of money for people to live on.  I want to prevent cases like the showboating that took place in my town last weekend, and I am sure it took place in every town in the country, by a particular ethnic group in our society.  No one is in employment in that home but the girls had Swarovski diamonds embedded on their dresses and a young fella had accessorised his outfit with a top hat and cane.  Such extravagance is beyond normal people.  We must arrange for the Minister to come to discuss the matter and we must have the courage to put such matters on our agenda.</P>

	<P>I want to raise the issue of the youth vote and echo a call by the National Youth Council of Ireland urging young people to have their voice heard and register to vote in the forthcoming referendum on the European stability treaty on 31 May.  A previous NYCI study found that as little as 26% of 18 to 25-year olds were registered to vote, rising to 36% among 18 to 21 year olds.  Campaigns such as the Rock the Vote campaign in Canada and the United States went some way to increasing participation of younger people in the electoral process.  I hope that all parties, regardless of their stance on the treaty, will do everything in their power to encourage those in the under-25 age bracket to register and vote on 31 May.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I raise the case because it relates to the treatment abroad fund and the support that it has given to the family in ensuring the transplant took place.  I wish to raise the issue of the EU cross-border health care directive passed in February 2011 and we have 30 months to implement it.  I have contacted the Department of Health on a number of occasions and there has been no indication of when the directive will be transposed into Irish law.  It is extremely important because we do not have expertise in certain medical areas, cannot provide treatment and people must seek treatment abroad.  Therefore, we must ensure that all of the proper procedures are in place to deal with such a situation.  The directive deals with such cases and I ask that it is transposed into Irish law at the earliest possible date so that people like Calum Geary can continue to receive support and at an early date.  I ask that the Leader raise the matter with the Department at an early date and that we can discuss it with the Minister on the next occasion he is in the House.</P>

	<P>I echo the calls this morning for a debate on the church and State and the harrowing cases of child sex abuse in the church, in particular the case revealed in a programme last night on a young Dundalk boy.  It is imperative that Cardinal Se&aacute;n Brady answer the questions raised in the programme.  As a practising Catholic it is important for the credulity of the whole church that he answer these questions.  Recently I played music at a confirmation service in my local parish church where he officiated and spoke about Christianity, goodness and the Holy Spirit.

Recently I carried out a survey on internship programmes and interns in different organisations and found that a large number of them feel undervalued. Jobs are also advertised but suddenly an internship with the same job specifications is notified and companies are taking advantage of unemployed people, recent graduates and young people.  I seek a debate on the issue.  It may not seem like a huge issue but I know that it is following my research over the past number of weeks.  I would be grateful if the Leader could ask for a debate on internships when next the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is in attendance.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, Conway, Harte, Mullins and others spoke about the closure of Garda stations and rural policing.  As Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien mentioned, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was in this House and dealt with such a situation on an Adjournment motion.  The proposed closure of Garda stations was based on recommendations from the Garda Commissioner under the policing plan for 2012.  The closures are a result of in-depth assessment of the Garda authorities, the levels of activity and policing requirements for each station throughout the country.  It is a firm objective of the Government to ensure that garda&iacute; are freed up from unnecessary administrative tasks and are in a position to carry out the functions they have been trained to do, such as policing in communities and throughout the country.</P>
        <P>There has been a focus of criticism to the effect that only modest cash savings can be made as a result of these closures.  This is not solely about savings.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Some savings will be made but it is about more efficient deployment of available resources and the changing of Garda rosters which will free up garda&iacute;, giving us more efficient policing as a result.  That addresses the question of Garda stations.  The Minister outlined that others will be closed in the coming years.  We have had approximately the same number of stations since the foundation of the State.  Northern Ireland used to have 160 stations only some years ago but this has been reduced to 80, with talk of closing more.  This is the situation as it stands.</P>

	<P>Senators O&rsquo;Keeffe, Norris, Keane, Daly, Moran, MacSharry and others spoke about the BBC2 programme about child abuse broadcast last night.  I, too, viewed it.  The fact that families of other victims were not told about the danger of Father Smyth was appalling. The abuse of children continued for years after the investigations mentioned in the programme, which is very damning.  This abuse could have been prevented if action had been taken, but this did not happen.</P>
        <P>Calls were made for a debate on church and State.  We can do that but, as was stated by some Senators, yesterday we had the beginning of that debate with the Minister for Education and Skills in regard to schools.</P>

	<P>Senators Quinn and Keane spoke about organ donation and the Facebook initiative.  Facebook is to be complimented on this and I hope we will have a similar initiative in this country.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn also raised the question of bank fees on debit cards in the United States and suggested we should consider similar measures here.  I will raise this matter with the relevant Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Conway spoke of the role of local policing committees and stated they should have an enhanced role, a point we can take in the context of a debate on rural policing.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson called for progress on the disposal of Army barracks.  Perhaps he could table this as an Adjournment matter in order to get an update from the Minister for Defence.  He and Senator Landy raised the issue of local government reform.  On 1 February the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, attended the House and stated his wish for Senators to put forward informed and practical proposals to improve local government.  That process is ongoing and Senators can make further proposals in this regard, if they wish.  The Minister stated he will issue a White Paper June on local government reform  in June.</P>
        <P>Senator Harte mentioned Garda resources.  Senator Norris spoke of the relationship between church and State and I acknowledge that he has raised the matter of the Bethany Homes in the House on several occasions.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen raised the issues of the release of prisoners and policing.  Many factors are taken into consideration regarding the suitability of prisoners to participate in the scheme for temporary release mentioned by the Senator.  These include the nature and the gravity of the offence for which a sentence is being served by the prisoner, any recommendations made by the court in regard to the sentence imposed, the potential threat to the safety and security of the public by the person to be released and the person&rsquo;s previous criminal record.  There are a number of areas involved.  We might ask the Minister to the House to discuss that scheme at a later stage.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane spoke of the Protection of  Employees (Amendment) Bill.  I believe we would all agree with the Senator it is very important that workers get their rights in a timely fashion.</P>
        <P>Senators Gilroy, Whelan, Landy and others mentioned reform of the other House.  I certainly have no intention of dwelling on such reforms which are a matter for the other House.  As to some of the misinformed comments made by people in that House, I would treat them with the contempt they deserve.</P>

I am sure there will be further proposals in that regard, in addition to those I have mentioned on several occasions on the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly mentioned the Bill on transparency in NAMA.  I am sure he can use Private Members&rsquo; time for this subject.  A Private Members&rsquo; Bill from Fianna F&aacute;il is to be introduced and the party could certainly promote that Bill, if it is important, during their next Private Members&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh welcomed that the early years expert group has been set up, stating it is a step in the right direction.  We will ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, if she will attend the House and give her vision on this matter.  On 7 March, we had a comprehensive debate on early intervention and family support services with the Minister so further discussion is a little premature at this stage.  We will invite her at a later stage.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan reminded Members that white-tailed sea eagles have been born in Killarney.  I am sure we will have a future debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Senator Mulcahy mentioned the Social Welfare Bill.  The House spent all day on Friday and Monday having a comprehensive and excellent debate on that Bill and there was ample opportunity to raise those matters.  I am sure there will be other opportunities to raise with the Minister the points mentioned by the Senator.</P>
        <P>I am sure we all agree with Senator Sheahan about encouraging young people to come out and vote.  We should outline that there is still time for them to register to vote in the referendum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Burke raised a very important item in respect of the EU health care directive and the cross-border issue.  I will inquire when it will be transposed into law by the Minister.  Senator Noone raised the matter of internships and companies taking advantage of young people.  It is a matter I will raise with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and perhaps he will come to the House.  Regarding the point raised by Senator Healy Eames, we dealt with the comments of the Minister for Finance yesterday on the Order of Business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>An additional amendment list has been circulated today and amendment No. <i>a</i>1 is in the names of Senators Norris and Zappone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. <i>a</i>1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;3.&mdash;The provisions of this Act shall be construed as applying in all its sections to the registration of both marriage and civil partnership.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I would like to express my appreciation to the staff of the House, who at the last minute facilitated me in tabling this amendment.  I am extremely grateful to them for their courtesy and efficiency.</P>
        <P>The amendment proposes that the provisions of this Act shall be construed as applying in all its sections to the registration of both marriage and civil partnership.  I want both marriage and civil partnership included because people who do not have a religious belief in the conventional form or who are committed atheists, or whatever, but who have a belief in human values are  entitled to the same degree of respect for their commitment to their relationships and the dignity of those relationships.  This should be reflected in the law of the land.  The same should be also true for same sex relationships and they should be recognised as marriage, but this has not happened.  I know, for example, that the Unitarian church on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green performs same sex unions, but these are simply religious ceremonies and are not recognised by the State.  This is dreadful.</P>
        <P>Perhaps we should go the way of France and separate entirely church and state.  In light of a series of events that have happened recently, including the silencing of priests, instructions given on how to vote in England, Wales and Scotland on these issues, from what is, on one hand, the church and, on the other, a state, the Vatican, I called this morning for a debate on the relationship between church and state.  One way to deal with the issues is to separate entirely the church from the State by stating that church marriages are a sacrament.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I am a believing Christian and I go to church every Sunday.  I am not antagonistic towards any of the other churches including the Church of Rome and how could I be?  However, in France, for example, the religious service is regarded merely as a sacrament which does not preside legally over the distribution of property which is essentially what the civil registration of marriage does as it sets down certain criteria for the division of property and the responsibilities of people towards each other.  That is one way of doing it and as a religious person I would be very happy with this provision, that the State recognises only those that are registered under the patronage of the State and that the religious aspect becomes an option.  It then becomes much more real for the people involved because they have chosen the option, because they want to do it.  I suggest we use this Bill to advance not just one step further, but perhaps two or three.  I recognise and I salute the efforts of my good friend, the leader of the Labour Party in the House, Senator Ivana Bacik, in bringing forward this Bill.  I will be supporting it and I will not be putting this amendment to a vote.  However, I think it is an important opportunity for us to raise these issues and to signal to the Government that we will not wait forever for equality.  We will not put up with hearing a lot of prating about equality coming up to the 1916 commemoration when it simply does not exist and when there is still the absolute violation of the rights of children.</P>
        <P>I note a baby protesting in the Gallery and I agree with you, darling, you are quite right.  It is good to have young people in the House.  Suffer the little children to come unto me.</P>
        <P>I tabled this amendment at the last minute because I want to signal the first shot in a battle to have marriage recognised equally.  I will not be obstructive and I will not press the amendment to a vote.  I congratulate Senator Bacik and I hope this Bill will be voted through by the House today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the members of the Humanist Association of Ireland who are in the Gallery and I thank them very much for their help and support with this legislation.</P>
        <P>As colleagues know, because we had a very full debate on Second Stage on 10 November, this Bill is aimed at making a small but significant change in the law on the registration of civil marriages.  It does not extend to civil partnerships which, of course, are governed by separate legislation.  I hope this Bill will be passed and it had full support from all sides on Second Stage last November.  If passed, it will allow for the registration of legal marriages by members of, for example, the Humanist Association of Ireland and of other philosophical and non-confessional bodies who may apply under the criteria we have provided for.  The amendments which I have put forward, and I thank the Minister for her support, will seek to deal with some issues identified on Second Stage as to what should be the criteria for designation of a non-religious body which can apply for registration.  This is the context of this Bill and I will speak further on those amendments when they arise.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Norris and Senator Zappone for their contribution to the debate on Second Stage and for tabling the amendment today because it is useful that we would debate the broader issue of extension of provisions to civil partnership.  However, I am grateful to Senator Norris for indicating he will not put the amendment to a vote because this would do a different thing as it would deal with civil partnerships.  As Senator Norris knows, I entirely agree with him and with Senator Zappone on the need to separate church and State and the need to ensure equality between gay couples and straight couples.  I support the Senators on gay marriage and I entirely agree with their views in that regard.  However, this legislation is to deal with civil marriages only and with the registration of civil marriages which are dealt with under different provisions.  There is another issue to deal with as regards civil partnerships.  I hope to deal with that once this Bill has been passed.  I would like to work with the Senators in the future on civil partnership law generally.  We are all in agreement in principle but, as Senator Norris said, this amendment is putting down a marker about future developments in the law.</P>

	<P>I commend Senator Bacik on this Bill and it shows again the usefulness of this House that we can bring forward Bills which are given Government support.  I thank the Minister and the Government for supporting the Bill.  I understand that most of the amendments which have been tabled have actually come from the Government and from Senator Bacik and that they are technical amendments.  My party will support these amendments.</P>
        <P>As regards this amendment from Senators Norris and Zappone, I agree with the sentiment behind the amendment, as does Senator Bacik.  This is an issue we should examine at another opportunity.  I note there are unresolved issues related to civil partnerships which we need to consider.  My party fully supports the view that we need to have absolute equality for everybody in this country on all these issues.  I hope we can be given a commitment from the Government to revisit this issue.  I reiterate my party&rsquo;s full support for the Bill before us and we will not oppose any amendments.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Like the other speakers, I commend Senator Bacik on her work on this Bill and also the Minister on her support.  I support the amendment in the spirit of laying down a marker.  However, I believe there will be another opportunity and I will support the measure on that future occasion.  I accept that this legislation is not capable of accepting that amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senator Bacik on this Bill.  It was well indicated on Second Stage last November that there was a broad welcome for the humanist right to confer marriages.  Today is another step in that journey.  I hope, with a bit of luck, we might finish the Bill today.  It is a bright new future and a sign of a society that is more inclusive and more diverse and a recognition that everybody has his or her own views and ways of celebrating marriage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend Senators Norris and Zappone on the timing of this amendment.  They are certainly keeping the issue on the agenda and it signals the need for a full debate at another time.  Today we are dealing with the extension of provisions to include the Humanist Association of Ireland so that it can carry out marriages.  We are dealing only with civil marriages in this Bill but on another day we would welcome the debate about the extension of the provision to civil partnership.  This will be another significant step and we will need to deal fully with the details of such legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FiachMacConghail"><NameTxt>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief in my contribution.  I concur with Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s view that these are technical amendments.  On yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business I congratulated Senator Bacik on this very important and significant legislation.  This shows again how the Seanad can make a difference.  I admire the language in the Bill which describes a philosophical non-confessional body.  In my view this is the beginning of a breakdown as to how we might address our own rights and how we regard our relationships with people we want to marry or with whom we wish to participate in this ceremony.  I welcome the use of that language in the amendments.</P>
        <P>I support my colleagues, Senators Zappone and Norris, on this amendment.  It is important that we continue to bear witness, a phrase I use often in the Seanad, to the perceived exclusion of members of our community to which, perhaps on a technicality, this legislation does not relate although another item of legislation does relate to it.  The Seanad is an apt House for us to begin to have a broader discussion about inclusivity and for that reason I support the amendment.  I acknowledge Senator Norris does not intend to press the amendment to a vote but I support the human rights sentiment behind this amendment.  I will support all the Government amendments to the Bill and I welcome and support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s Bill.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I am not sure if the Minister intends to reply.  Perhaps it is not necessary in light of what Senator Bacik said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Senator&rsquo;s perspective and Senator Bacik made an appropriate response.  I am anxious that we proceed with this and I accept very much the spirit of the Senator&rsquo;s comments on the areas of civil partnership but this legislation deals with the particular issue of marriage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In that case, I very much welcome what the Minister and all my colleagues have said on this issue.  I would like to point out, however, that were this to be capable of being passed, it would have had exactly the effect that I wanted, but it might be a step too far, it might be impossible to sell to the D&aacute;il.  I hope very much this Bill will go from here to the D&aacute;il and be passed there as well.  Having been accused first of all in my early days of being a revolutionary and then of being of a reformist, gradualist and toady, I understand how important it is sometimes in politics to be pragmatic.  I appreciate that if I was to push this and be obstreperous about it, that might impede a Bill which represents significant development in Irish society.  Therefore, I will be supporting it.  I will support the other amendments Senator Bacik tabled and if they are put to a vote I will come and vote in favour of them.  I have to do an interview about one of the Ireland&rsquo;s great women, about whom a book is being written, the late Lily Huban, who was my music teacher and a pupil of a pupil of Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin, and a donator of a prize to the feis.  Therefore, I will not be in a position to take part in the debate but should votes be called, I will vote with Senator Bacik on the Bill.  I will withdraw the amendment.</P>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 3, to delete lines 18 and 19 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;&lsquo;body&rsquo; means the Executive or a religious body or a philosophical and non-confessional body;</P>
        <P LI="1">&lsquo;philosophical and non-confessional body&rsquo; means a body which has as one of its functions the celebration of marriage, and which, for the purposes of this Act&mdash;</P>

        <P FLI="0">I thank Senator Norris for his kind comments and support for the Bill.  He is never obstreperous in this Chamber.  I also thank other colleagues for their supportive comments on the previous amendment.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Burton, to the House and I am very grateful to her for indicating her support for this Bill on Second Stage and for being so supportive of it during the process of coming to Committee Stage.  I also thank her officials who have been extremely helpful and the staff in the Bills Office who have been very helpful on the drafting side.</P>
        <P>As colleagues have said, it is an unusual process that a Private Members&rsquo; Bill would be introduced during Private Members&rsquo; time in the Seanad and would then proceed to Committee and Report Stages in Government time in the Seanad with Government support.  I understand that was formally approved at Cabinet yesterday.  It is a very good day for the Seanad that a Bill of this sort, that was introduced as a Private Members&rsquo; Bill will finish in the Seanad with Government support and will then proceed, I hope, speedily through the D&aacute;il, sponsored by the Minister, Deputy Burton.  I thank her once again for her support.  I am delighted about this.  I have also thanked the humanist association for the initiative it has taken on this and particularly Brian Whiteside who has been extraordinarily helpful on this.</P>
        <P>I wish to give colleagues a context for these amendments.  Everyone is aware that the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Civil Registration Act 2004, the Act which regulates the registration of civil marriages.  Under the current version of the Civil Registration Act, the only people who can solemnise or celebrate legal civil marriages are either HSE registrars &mdash; who only work Monday to Friday as we know, and that is not in any way to denigrate them it is simply the fact of the matter &mdash; or members of a religious body.  &ldquo;A religious body&rdquo; is defined in the Act to mean &ldquo;an organised group of people, members of which meet regularly for common religious worship&rdquo;.  That definition has enabled quite a large number of religious bodies to apply for and obtain registration for individual members.  This issue came up on Second Stage when colleagues asked what organisations were included.  If one goes to the website <i>groireland.ie</i>, the website of the registrar general, one will find a register of solemnisers which contains the list of names and addresses of the individual members of the religious bodies and of the HSE who are authorised to perform civil marriages.  One will also find the list of the religious bodies which constitute quite an extensive list.  It includes the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland but also quite a number of very small churches, some of which are very local churches; the Gospel Hall, Skibbereen jumped out at me, the Spiritualist Union of Ireland, of which we have spoken, the Pagan Federation of Ireland, Riverside Gospel Hall, quite a number of very small ministries which have applied and obtained authorisation.  The Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and so on have authorisation.  Quite a wide range of groups is covered.</P>
        <P>An issue arose on Second Stage about scientologists but I do not believe they are included &mdash; they are not on that list but a wide range of other groups is included.  Clearly the definition excludes members of the Humanist Association of Ireland who, in practice, for many years now have routinely been conducting both funeral ceremonies and humanist wedding ceremonies, but those humanist wedding ceremonies have no legal status.  Couples who wish to have a humanist wedding must in addition to the humanist celebration also go, as everyone in the Gallery knows, to a civil registry office and a registrar to have their marriage celebrated legally, to give their marriage legal effect.</P>
        <P>The fact that humanists and other non-religious bodies were excluded from the definition in the Act is clearly out of line with the current situation in Irish society where the proportion of couples choosing a non-religious civil wedding ceremony has dramatically increased from 6% in 1996 to more than 23% in 2006, and there have been further increases since.  The CSO has stated that this year for the first time the number of non-religious wedding ceremonies conducted by HSE registrars may exceed the number of religious ceremonies.  During yesterday&rsquo;s debate with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, on patronage, we noted the new census figures on the number of non-religious, which has now gone up to 270,000.  Those who say they have no religion are the second biggest group after the Catholic Church in terms of faith and belief in Ireland now.  The 2004 Act no longer reflects the changing reality of Irish life, whereby large numbers of people are not members of religious bodies and do not wish to have their wedding celebrated through a religious body.  I digressed somewhat to give the context of the amendments and I apologise for that.  I wanted to explain how we got to put forward these amendments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I introduced the Bill on Second Stage on 2 November 2011, the text was to simply change the definition in the Act which currently states an authority, meaning the HSE or a religious body, and to include also &ldquo;a body designated by the Minister&rdquo;.  In a very naive act of drafting, I thought perhaps this would mean that the Minister could then designate bodies such as the Humanist Association of Ireland to be authorised to apply for authorisation for its members to conduct legal weddings.</P>
        <P>However, although speakers on both sides universally supported the Bill on 10 November 2011, many speakers, including the Minister, quite rightly expressed the view that specific criteria would need to be provided in the Bill to guide the decision as to which non-religious bodies could apply to have their members conduct legal wedding ceremonies.  Coming away from that debate, I thought the simplest method of dealing with this issue would be to do what Senator Mooney has done, and I am grateful to him for tabling amendments, which was to name the Humanist Association of Ireland as another body.  In amendment No. 2, Senator Mooney has proposed a change to the definition of &ldquo;body&rdquo; such that a &ldquo; &lsquo;body&rsquo; means an authority or a religious body or the Humanist Association of Ireland&rdquo;.  That seemed to be the most straightforward means of amending the Bill to ensure it would do what we all want it to do, which is to enable members of the Humanist Association of Ireland to perform legal ceremonies.  However, after a great deal of discussion with the Registrar General and others, including colleagues and the Minister&rsquo;s officials, and following representation from groups and individuals other than the humanists who might at some stage wish to apply for authorisation, I came to the conclusion it would be preferable not to name any one organisation in the Bill.  I stated this on Second Stage to explain why I had not done so originally.  There is also a clear danger that if we were to name any one organisation in the Bill other organisations might claim discrimination and might launch constitutional challenges.  With all of these issues in mind we examined how best to draft or develop a set of criteria to cover the Humanist Association of Ireland and potentially cover other groups which may wish to apply in future, without being too broad because we are speaking about the very important function of the solemnisation of legal marriages.</P>
        <P>This is why in amendment No. 1 and those amendments grouped with it the new definition being provided for &ldquo;body&rdquo; means the &ldquo;Executive&rdquo;, which is the more correct summary of the HSE, &ldquo;or a religious body or a philosophical and non-confessional body&rdquo;.  This definition is not plucked from the air but already has legal status under article 17 of the Lisbon treaty.  It is used in the dialogue process between the European Commission, the Parliament and the Council and groups such as the Humanist Association through the European Humanist Federation and Atheist Ireland.  The phrase &ldquo;philosophical and non-confessional&rdquo; already has status and this is important.  Article 17 of the Lisbon treaty provides that the European Union respects and does not prejudice the status under national law of churches and religious associations or communities in the member states and that it equally respects the status under national law of philosophical and non-confessional organisations.  We have used this phrase as the short version of a body that may apply for authorisation under the Act.</P>
        <P>Philosophical and non-confessional bodies are further defined to provide specific criteria with which a body must be able to comply to obtain authorisation for its members to conduct legal weddings.  Amendment No. 1 to section 3 provides that the body must, for the purposes of the Act, have been performing marriage ceremonies &mdash; clearly these will have been non-legally binding marriage ceremonies &mdash; for a period of at least five years.  The Humanist Association of Ireland has been doing so for more than five years.  At least 20 couples must have participated in the marriage ceremonies, and these marriages would have had to have been solemnised by a registrar and registered in the register of marriages.  This means we are speaking about at least 20 couples who have had not only a humanist wedding ceremony but also had their wedding lawfully solemnised at a HSE registry office with at least one of the marriages registered at least five years prior to the date of application.  The criteria are rigorous and this is an important point to make.  It means people will not apply lightly for authorisation, or at least they will not be granted it lightly.  It is important that these criteria are specific, but they are also fair and will serve to reflect the reality of modern Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have dealt with amendment No. 2 tabled by Senator Mooney to explain why even though it may seem a simpler option it is not.  The preferable option is the route we have taken in amendment No. 1.  To quickly run through the other amendments, amendments Nos. 3, 4, 6 and 8 make the same technical change to add &ldquo;philosophical and non-confessional body&rdquo; after &ldquo;religious body&rdquo;.  Amendments Nos 5 and 7 are tabled by Senator Mooney and I have dealt with them.  Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 are also technical amendments to make the necessary changes to other provisions of the 2004 Act to include &ldquo;philosophical and non-confessional body&rdquo; alongside &ldquo;Executive&rdquo; and &ldquo;religious body&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am gladdened to hear everyone in the House is supportive of the principle and purpose of the Bill.  The amendments are to give greater detail and more specific criteria on how we can achieve this purpose and how the Humanist Association of Ireland can apply for authorisation for its members.  I am sorry for taking so long to explain it but because the amendments are technical it is important that colleagues are aware of their context, the reason this route was chosen and the reason for the specific criteria.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Perhaps because I was at my son&rsquo;s wedding last week I am minded to comment on this.  This is about enabling the Minister to designate certain bodies to administer civil marriage registration.  I would prefer if these were designated rather than at ministerial discretion but this is not the import of the point I wish to make.  Yesterday morning I listened to an interesting debate on marriage on Newstalk in which Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe took part.  I understand its instigation, and perhaps the Senator will correct me if I am wrong, was the forming of the Marriage Foundation in Britain because of serious concerns about marriage breakdown.  Approximately 50% of marriages in Britain break down with a similar figure in the US.  There is a very significant cost to the children of such marriages and to society in general.  The Minister is not an uninterested bystander because it also impacts on her budget.  There are many compelling reasons for structures to support the institution of marriage.</P>
        <P>Those getting married in a Catholic church must complete a pre-marriage course.  Some people have told me they found it very good and beneficial and others have said they did not think it was as good as it should have been.  Those who apply to conduct civil marriage ceremonies should be obliged to provide properly approved pre-marriage courses.  Failing this, and I understand some bodies may not have the resources to do so although I do not know, the State should do it.  This would recognise that marriage breakdown in this country has caused serious issues for the couples involved and often for their children.  It behoves us to try to ensure we build into the system structures to support and endeavour to ensure marriages are sustainable.  Part of this involves pre-marriage preparation.</P>
        <P>I remember raising a point about the need for mediation services when discussing a justice Bill with a former late Minister.  He assured me we would have mediation services within a short period and we did.  Mediation services were mentioned in the programme yesterday, not the ones about which I had spoken but rather mediation to assist people divorcing.  I applaud this as I think it is good and necessary but many situations arise where appropriate mediation at the early stages of difficulties in a marriage could keep the marriage together.  I was listening to the programme as I was driving and I have a feeling it was mentioned or a message was sent in to state a person had been contemplating divorce but through some mechanism, without any real structured basis, the couple involved had ended up working their way through it and subsequently they conceded they were happy they had done so.  As a society and State we should try to ensure we do this.</P>
        <P>While the Bill is important it is relatively insignificant in the overall context of two people who decide to commit to each other and who have children, and I am very concerned about where children are involved.  I have yet to meet anybody from a broken marriage, unless from a high-conflict relationship, who would state anything other than that they regretted the fact their parents broke up.  Many people have been scarred as a consequence, psychologically and otherwise.  I urge the Minister to consider setting in place either obligations or a State-sponsored system that would encourage and make mandatory pre-marriage courses.  In addition, I suggest that in future consideration be given for a structure that would assist people.  While I acknowledge certain structures are in place, I am uncertain how proactive they are or how skilled some of those who engage in them are either.  There would be a significant payback for society, the State and the individuals involved, were it possible to position the State to be constructive, helpful and of assistance in that particular area.  I urge that this be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While I may not have mentioned it earlier, I should state officially that Fine Gael supports this Bill.  As for some of the amendments under consideration, it is useful to have laid out the particular criteria in amendment No. 1 that could be drawn down by any other group in the future.  That is helpful because it means Members will not be obliged to draw up another amendment subsequently.  Amendment No. 2 tabled by Senator Mooney, which specifically names the Humanist Association of Ireland, also is useful because historically, this marks a special moment as the point at which it will be able to confer legal status on the marriages the association wishes to carry out.  I have one or two questions with regard to amendment No. 1, which proposes to include the phrase, &ldquo;these marriages have been solemnised by a registrar and registered in the register of marriages&rdquo;.  Which registrar is being referred to in this regard and, for example, does it refer to the civil register?  My second questions pertains to a phrase that recurs throughout the Bill, namely, &ldquo;&lsquo;body&rsquo; means the Executive or a religious body or a philosophical and non-confessional body&rdquo;.  While I understand fully that the Humanist Association of Ireland is a philosophical body, what exactly is meant by a non-confessional body?  While all Members are aware of the connotations associated with the word &ldquo;confession&rdquo;, the term &ldquo;non-confessional body&rdquo; is interesting.</P>
        <P>In response to the remarks of Senator Walsh, regardless of whether one ends up with a marriage that is Catholic, civil or humanist, marriage is not simple.  When a couple decide to get married and have children together, there is no magic bullet to ensure that even with all their best efforts and all the best will in the world, the marriage always will succeed.  One must be careful because the term, &ldquo;broken marriage&rdquo; can be dangerous.  I know of marriages that have split up in which the families are better for it and I often have heard that a bad marriage is no good for the children.  The Senator made a good point about how mediation and counselling can be helpful, with which I agree.  He is aware such services are available at present for those who can afford it but in the context of this debate, does the Senator propose a State structure of mediation and counselling to assist people to work through their marriages?  The Minister, Deputy Burton, also may wish to comment on that point, given her brief on social protection and the various allowances and schemes that exist to assist one parent families in various circumstances.  Ultimately, this debate has been highly interesting because Members are discussing the type of Ireland they desire.  Is it an Ireland in which, once one decides to get married, one will be supported in remaining married, if this is what one absolutely wishes to do, for the sake of the couple and the children?  Should the State have a role in this regard?  This is the question now being asked when there is evidence to suggest this would be the better thing for society and the Bill has opened up a very broad debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>As for the amendments before Members, my understanding is they are not discussing the definition of marriage itself in this debate.  Were they to so do, I certainly would assure Senators Norris and Zappone that I would have no difficulty in including gay and lesbian couples within the institution of marriage.  However, I will preface my remaining remarks by noting Members are not discussing the institution of marriage.</P>
        <P>There is no question or doubt regarding the importance of marriage and the critical importance of the institution of marriage for the stability of any society.  In this regard, I consider this Bill to be a positive step because in the context of the stability of marriage, the capacity to marry within one&rsquo;s own belief structures surely is of vital importance to the success or otherwise of that marriage.  I believe this legislation constitutes a significant step forward in that regard.  I also believe it is important not to limit this debate to the humanist group as I believe that in the future, if we are to look forward to inclusiveness, other groups within society will seek to be in a position to solemnise marriage ceremonies.  As such, it is important to consider the criteria as to which groups should or should not have the capacity to perform this highly important role within society.  I consider the criteria as set out to be sufficiently rigorous not to undermine the institution of marriage itself, which is an incredibly significant institution.  If anything, the requirement, for example, that marriages will have been performed for a period of five years before the date of application to be entered on the register of solemnisers will be a quite difficult criterion to reach.  Moreover, for any new body coming forward, particularly given the change in Irish society over the past decade in particular, this will be a significantly high bar to reach.  If anything, I would have suggested a period of three years might be more realistic.</P>
        <P>I agree with the comments of Senator Walsh that it is important to support institutions &mdash; I would not restrict such support to the institution of marriage &mdash; that support the family, whatever those institutions may be.  I also believe there may be a role for a debate, particularly in respect of children, as to how society is treating the changing role of the institution of marriage and other institutions.  As matters stand, given the future development of society, it is important to avoid being overly prescriptive, while at the same time being sufficiently rigorous in how groups that are capable of solemnising the institution of marriage are categorised.  In the context of moving forward in this society, Senator Mooney might consider not restricting the legislation to one particular group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Some specific points were raised and I wish to respond briefly to them.  As Senator Hayden has noted, this debate did indeed open up into a discussion on marriage more generally.  However, the Bill has a relatively narrow purpose.  While it undoubtedly is a small but significant step towards the recognition of a more pluralist Ireland, it has quite a narrow purpose, which simply is to extend the definition to enable organisations like the Humanist Association of Ireland to apply for authorisation for its members to conduct legal weddings.  That is the important point to make and it is not about marriages more broadly.</P>
        <P>In response to a couple of the points raised, I am grateful to Senator Healy Eames for indicating Fine Gael&rsquo;s support.  As I have stated, this Bill is supported by the Government and I am delighted it clearly has this support and will proceed to the D&aacute;il as a Government Bill.  The amendments would circumscribe ministerial discretion.  The concern on Second Stage was that too broad a discretion had been left to the Minister and there were no criteria.  These amendments seek to apply a set of rigorous criteria but that are not so rigid that they would exclude everyone.  They are rigorous and fair.  Senator Healy Eames asked about the criteria which requires that marriages be solemnised by a registrar and recorded in the register of marriages.  This refers to HSE registrars.  In other words, to get accreditation a body like the humanists would have to show that it had performed marriage ceremonies for at least 20 couples in the previous five years and that those couples had also had legal civil wedding ceremonies with a HSE registrar.  As I stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>That is important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and as mentioned by Senator Hayden, the five year provision is relatively rigorous.  At least one marriage must have been registered for more than five years prior to the application.</P>
        <P>The definition of &ldquo;philosophical and non-confessional body&rdquo; was taken from the Lisbon treaty.  The definition of &ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; is clear enough.  As I understand it, &ldquo;non-confessional&rdquo; means that the body is a body which does not take confessions from its members.  In other words it does not apply sacraments.  It is I suppose another way of saying it is a non-religious body.  It is a definition I favoured because it is clearly set out already in European law and appears to be an objective definition in respect of groups such as the humanists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Bacik on introducing this important legislation and thank all parties in the Seanad for their work on it.  </P>
        <P>In Ireland, we rightly value the institution of marriage.  We recognise it in our legislation and acknowledge it socially.  When two people make a public commitment to each other by way of marriage, it is a cause of great celebration.  It is one of those occasions when not only do people wish to have their family and friends around them, but also wish to celebrate in a manner which is appropriate to their belief system.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment to the Bill before us seeks to widen the circle of belief systems whose facilitation of the celebration of marriage are formally acknowledged in our registration system.  I concur with the comments of Senators Hayden and Walsh on the importance of marriage, in particular for the children of marriage and on the need for the State to be sensitive and caring towards people who are married.  It must be acknowledged that many marriages do run into difficulty.  Expert mediation can be extremely helpful to people experiencing such difficulty, in particular in avoiding expensive legally-based adversarial procedures.  What often does the most damage in terms of the break-up of a marriage is intense adversarial legal proceedings involving a couple who were previously sufficiently in love to commit to marriage, which is extremely difficult for the children of that marriage because most children love their mothers and their fathers and do not want to see them in dispute.</P>
        <P>On the technical element of amendment No. 1, the purpose of the amendment is to extend the definition of &ldquo;a body&rdquo; in section 45 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 to include a &ldquo;philosophical and non-confessional body&rdquo;.  The Bureau of European Policy Advisers was established in the 1990s by the then President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Delors, to facilitate dialogue between churches and communities of convictions and the European integration process.  Article 17 of the Lisbon treaty has lifted that dialogue from good practice to legal obligation, enshrined in primary law.  Article 17 provides that the EU respects the status under national law of churches and religious associations in member states and equally respects the status under national law of &ldquo;philosophical and non-confessional&rdquo; organisations and that the EU shall maintain and open, transparent and regular dialogue with these churches and organisations, thus the recognition of philosophical and non-confessional bodies contained in the Lisbon treaty provides guidance as to the most appropriate way to address the objectives of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty does not include a definition of a &ldquo;philosophical and non-confessional body&rdquo; but it is appropriate to devise such a definition solely for the purposes of the Civil Registration Act 2004.  The definition is intended to establish the bona fides of bodies wishing to solemnise marriages, to require that such bodies have a substantial tradition or track record of providing marriage ceremonies and to ensure that such ceremonies are taken seriously by all concerned in that they have been registered in the civil register following solemnisation by a registrar under the provisions of the Civil Registration Act 2004.  I consider that the amendment provides for adequate safeguards in regard to these matters and I am happy to accept it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As stated by Senator Bacik, a register of bodies authorised to solemnise marriages currently exists, which register is available on the website of the General Registrar&rsquo;s Office.  The register includes a wide number of churches and religious organisations, including the Church of Ireland, Roman Catholic Church, the Blanchardstown Baptist Church, the Pagan Federation of Ireland, the Spiritualist Union of Ireland, the Six Principles Baptist Church of Ireland, the Salvation Army and so on.  This Bill seeks to extend that definition in line with the European treaties to include and acknowledge the humanists as people who perform marriages and to recognise in the conditionality that is set down that we mark that this is a serious and solemn power being given to a religious, philosophical or non-confessional bodies.  Hence, the conditionality which we feel to be appropriate to underline and mark the solemnity of the celebration of marriage and the important function carried out by people who are solemnisers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>What should have been a simple and straightforward procedure has become bogged down with a variety of technicalities.  A succession of amendments, which I can only describe as jumping through hoops, have been tabled to this Bill.</P>
        <P>I refer the House to the Second Stage debate on this Bill in which Senator Bacik stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The majority of registered solemnisers are members of the well-known churches &mdash; the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and so on.  The definition I have mentioned covers organisations such as Pagan Federation Ireland and the Spiritualist Union of Ireland.  As they have applied for and obtained registration under the Act, their individual members may seek to be entered on the register of solemnisers.  Although the definition is relatively broad, it excludes members of the Humanist Association of Ireland, who routinely conduct humanist funeral, naming and wedding ceremonies.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is the reason we tabled the amendment.  The main provision of the Civil Registration Act 2004 relates to marriage.  It provides for common preliminaries and a single set of documentation for all marriages, the introduction of the marriage registration form, a single licensing system, establishment of a register of solemnisers and provision for a choice of venue for civil marriages.</P>
        <P>Section 51 provides that a marriage may only be legally solemnised by a registered solemniser.  It goes on to state that a religious body is defined as &ldquo;an organised group of people, members of which meet regularly for common religious worship&rdquo;.  That was what raised the whole issue on Second Stage.  I do not think pagans refer to themselves as being religious, although maybe they do.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>They do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Religious would seem to suggest it is about a higher being but perhaps they have a different wording.  The point has been made that if pagans and spiritualists can get licences, there is hardly any other institution that comes within the scope of the Bill.  That is true.  This legislation was introduced in 2004.  Has there been an application from anybody who has been excluded under the legislation and who has said it is not inclusive?  As I said on Second Stage, and on which we are all agreed, the original legislation and its drafters were attempting to achieve inclusivity.  The whole purpose of the legislation was about inclusivity and they did everything in their power not to exclude anybody.</P>
        <P>One body, to which Senator Bacik referred, the Humanist Association of Ireland, is excluded under the current definitions.  Essentially, that is what this Bill is all about.  Now we have many wider definitions which will be introduced.  I do not have any great problem with them but I am curious to establish their purpose and who they address, other than the Humanist Association of Ireland.  What other organisation has applied and has been turned down for a licence to act as a solemniser since this legislation was introduced eight years ago?</P>

	<P>We are giving the Minister for Social Protection the power to designate bodies which may apply for the registration of members to solemnise marriages.  That is what this is about.  We are giving the Minister the power to do that into the future.</P>
        <P>Time and again in her Second Stage contribution, Senator Bacik made reference to the fact the Humanist Association of Ireland was not involved.  Listening to her Second Stage contribution, it seemed the whole purpose of her drafting this legislation was to include the Humanist Association of Ireland.  Now we have a wider definition and the Minister of the day can decide who or what may register.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage, I argued very strongly about the primacy of Parliament and that it should decide and not the Minister of the day because who knows what particular ethos or philosophy the Minister of the day will have.  The Church of Scientology could be included.  Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe should not look quizzically; she knows what it is.</P>

	<P>It could be included &mdash; people who rely on a bunch of aliens for their higher thinking.</P>
        <P>This is very serious legislation which was initially introduced to be as inclusive as possible and has proven to be over the past eight years, with the exception of the Humanist Association of Ireland.  That is why I tabled this amendment, which is very specific.  It does not go into all the other elements.</P>
        <P>By the way, I am not, in any way, diminishing the efforts Senator Bacik made.  It is her Bill and I praised it and her initiative on Second Stage.  I have not changed my view on that but this was being rolled over as if somehow we were into a new age of enlightenment here by including all these amendments in legislation, which the Minister will agree is quite simple and straightforward.  Now it will have a whole load of bells and whistles attached to it &mdash; the reason being to include the Humanist Association of Ireland.  I have heard no argument from Senator Bacik as to why she is including all of this other than to ensure the Minister is given the widest possible latitude to include the Humanist Association of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Our amendment states that &ldquo;body&rdquo; means an authority or a religious body or the Humanist Association of Ireland.  It seems to be pretty straightforward.  There are no complexities about that.  It is simple language and it fits easily into the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to Senator Mooney.  It is unfortunate in a debate in which we are all in agreement &mdash; everybody has welcomed the Bill &mdash; that Senator Mooney&rsquo;s words were delivered in a somewhat discordant style.  That may not have been his intention but he sounded somewhat hostile at certain times and that is unfortunate.</P>
        <P>The first thing I should say about these amendments is that they have the full support of the Humanist Association of Ireland, members of which are sitting in the visitors&rsquo; Gallery at my invitation and with whom I have consulted at every step of the way.  They are entirely happy with the rigorous criteria set down here.  Senator Mooney quoted my words on Second Stage, which I absolutely stand over.  I am grateful to him for reminding the House of them.  On Second Stage, we debated at length the issue of criteria.  Everyone was in agreement on Second Stage that the Bill, as I had originally drafted it, was too broad and that it did not set any criteria and simply said the Minister would designate.  It was wide open, therefore, for groups such as commercial groups to apply for designation and to be able to perform marriages for commercial purposes &mdash; Las Vegas style, I suppose.  That is certainly not what I want or what anyone wants.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage it appeared as if there were two routes we could go down on Committee Stage.  One route of amendment would be to name the Humanist Association of Ireland and another route would have been to set down a rigorous set of criteria.  As I said, subsequent to the Second Stage debate, I received representations from other groups and individuals who said that they might wish to have authorisation to solemnise marriages in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Could Senator Bacik name them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Atheist Ireland, which is included as one of the philosophical and non-confessional organisations under the European definition.  There are other groups which may not have applied yet but which potentially may do so in the future should they fit rigorous criteria.  I certainly did not wish to close off that potential.  I do not make any judgment about any group as to whether it might wish to apply in the future, because it is clearly not my place.</P>
        <P>There was also a further concern, which I have already set out as a reason for the way in which the amendments are drafted, that if a non-religious group which was not named but which identified itself as wishing to perform marriages in the future wished to apply and saw the Humanist Association of Ireland had been named, there was a danger it might challenge the Bill under the Constitution as being discriminatory.  That concern, having discussed the matter with officials, others and, indeed, the humanists, weighed heavily enough on me and I felt the better of the two approaches we had identified on Second Stage was to go down the route of rigorous criteria.</P>
        <P>I think everyone is in agreement that these criteria are rigorous and it will be very difficult for non-religious bodies to apply for registration.  That is right and proper as nobody wants to see it opened too widely.</P>
        <P>In terms of the numerous groups the Minister and I listed which already have authorisation, the vast number of solemnisers are still from the main churches because the individuals authorised must be members of the religious bodies.  If one looks at the number of individuals listed, the vast bulk of them are from the main churches.  There is usually only one or two named individuals from the very small groups.</P>
        <P>I think we are all in agreement about the need for this Bill.  The format the amendments take is the question.  I think I have outlined fairly fully, as has the Minister, the reason these amendments giving the criteria are preferable to the amendments naming the Humanist Association of Ireland.  I suppose the proof of the pudding is that the Humanist Association of Ireland is very happy with the definition included in my amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody is in agreement that marriage is a fairly fundamental institution in society and that it is important that those who solemnise marriage meet certain criteria and a certain standard and that it is a serious event.  We have seen examples of it being trivialised.  There is one example in the headlines with people doing it for the publicity and maybe the money they will gain from the publicity.  That is not good and sends wrong signals to young people.  If we allow that to happen, we cannot be surprised at the number of marriage breakdowns and the consequent cost to the State and society as a result.  There are many examples.  All we have to do is look at other countries.  We are in a better position than they are now but if we do not do this properly, we will not be in as good a position.</P>
        <P>I am inclined to be prescriptive in this regard.  The Minister may well be very responsible in the way she will adjudicate on this but anybody could hold her portfolio.</P>
        <P>What tends to happen in many of these cases is that anybody could hold that portfolio.  The individual concerned could be susceptible to lobbying for numerous reasons or else ideologically inclined to accept bodies which would bring the institution of marriage into disrepute.  I am not in favour of that.  I agree with Senator Bacik that we need to define section 3 in the original Act because it was wide open.  However, I have yet to be approached by a constituent claiming to have a problem because of this issue.  I do not want a situation where some people sitting in a pub one evening can decide to form a non-confessional body.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I am surprised the Minister intends to proceed with this despite admitting that the concept of a philosophical and non-confessional body is not defined.  That is a recipe for disaster.  I have yet to see legislation which does not clearly define the concepts to which it refers.  That is the minimum I would like to see in this Bill.  I have no difficulty with the involvement of the Humanist Association of Ireland but everybody seems to be hitching the wagons to that organisation.  I have attended a couple of funerals presided over by members of that association and they were conducted with dignity and empathy for the bereaved.  I have not yet attended a wedding involving the association, however.</P>
        <P>I am somewhat suspicious about where we are going with these measures.  Senator Bacik mentioned a number of organisations which might apply in the future.  Perhaps I do not fully understand the definition.  They would have to perform ceremonies for a period of at least five years and at least 20 couples would have to partake in their marriage ceremonies.  How would they meet these criteria if they have not already been designated and approved?  Perhaps I am missing something but we need to be careful not to jump on ideological bandwagons.  We must ensure citizens have a right to be married, appropriately and with the commitment that should accompany marriage, in the environment they desire.  If they do not want a religious environment, they should have the right to choose otherwise.  However, the definition should not be so broad that it allows any group to solemnise a marriage.</P>
        <P>I have seen, not too far from where I live, some celebrities bring a child up a mountain for baptism.  It came across as a bit of a joke and that may have been the intention of the exercise but if we allow that to happen, particularly in respect of marriage, the thought processes of other people may bring them to regard it as a trivial exercise which does not require real commitment.  We have seen examples of that elsewhere.  We would be wrong if by legislating we allow that to happen, and we would be appalling if we encouraged it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Naming an organisation would confine the legislation.  The CSO recently published figures revealing that one in five weddings taking place in this country is civil.  Not all of these will be humanist.  The Minister outlined the organisations that have already been defined.  That law was passed by Senator Walsh&rsquo;s Government.  The definition that applied previously will continue to apply.  If we set out criteria for every single body, religious or otherwise, the Bill would be as big as the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator Walsh regarding the structures to support marriage institutions.  We cannot legislate to mandate groups to do anything because it is their own business but it is a good idea to ask them to facilitate pre-marital counselling courses.  Marriage is not something anyone enters into lightly.  Many of these organisations already offer counselling but I have noticed that commercial groups are now providing courses for profit.</P>
        <P>I welcome the amendments proposed by Senator Bacik and the Labour Party.  We are catching up with Scotland.  The first bride to tie the knot under Scotland&rsquo;s humanist legislation in 2005 came from County Clare.  Society is changing and people are living together.  We have to facilitate them because, as our legislation recognises, living together and marriage are two different things.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Walsh is right to advise caution but this is why rules and procedures have been put in place.  The idea that organisations would apply because an individual desired to conduct marriage ceremonies is fanciful.  Organisations will have to demonstrate their seriousness of intent by seeking to be included.  By putting a framework in place we will be taking the issue seriously.  We do not want to legislate for one group after another.  In a country that is increasingly aware of the separation between church and State, this is our moment to make space for other organisations, like the Humanist Association of Ireland and, perhaps, Atheist Ireland,  to come forward.</P>
        <P>In regard to the idea that a Minister may be more vulnerable to lobbying on this issue than on other areas of policy, we have always taken a risk in regard to whom we appoint as Ministers.  Some have performed better than others but we cannot give up on legislation because we fear a Minister might behave in a manner that is not quite kosher.  If we did that, we would never legislate for anything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed in Senator Bacik&rsquo;s suggestion that my style of debating could be interpreted as introducing a discordant note.  It is probably more out of frustration than anything else.  My initial interpretation of her motives in introducing this legislation was that she wanted to facilitate the Humanist Association of Ireland.  She has since mentioned another organisation, Atheist Ireland, which I did not even know existed.  Does that organisation possess a formal structure?  Does it celebrate weddings?  Does it have some form of blessing or something that meets the criteria set out in the Bill?  Since the legislation was introduced in 2004 has there been one application from any organisation that was excluded under the original 2004 legislation?  By the Minister&rsquo;s silence I know the answer already &mdash; there has been none unless there has been one about which we have not heard.  I will not oppose the Bill.  In one sense I felt it was being helpful by introducing the one organisation that has seen itself to be excluded.  It is obvious that it is a matter of such import to it that its representatives are in the Gallery today and I welcome them.  We tabled this amendment in order to simplify the situation.</P>
        <P>I understand Senator Bacik&rsquo;s reasons for specifying the criteria.  In fairness to her, a query on the criteria was raised on Second Stage.  I will not labour the point further.  While I will not take the matter to extremes, given the original motives of the Bill I feel all this is unnecessary to facilitate an organisation that feels excluded.  The drafters of the original legislation went out of their way to ensure they had almost total inclusivity.  That was the purpose of the original 2004 legislation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was just consulting with the registrar on Senator Mooney&rsquo;s question.  Three bodies had their applications refused by the Registrar General.  These applications were subsequently appealed to the previous Minister.  One appeal was upheld, one rejected and one is still under appeal.  I understand that the one that was upheld was that of Pagan Federation Ireland, which represents people who would describe themselves as witches and so on.  They would have a variety of beliefs and describe themselves as forming a federation.  That was upheld by the previous Minister because it came within the remit of the original legislation.  One is under appeal &mdash; I believe it was a community-type body that applied.  Its qualification was not clear, but obviously the organisation itself felt &mdash; perhaps for good reason &mdash; that it wished to have people solemnise weddings.</P>
        <P>In the very interesting debate we have had all those who spoke said they want to see the celebration of the institution of marriage done in an appropriate and solemn way.  The definition has been taken from the work done at European level to get a definition that is appropriate and reflected in the Lisbon treaty.  As has been said here the conditions are onerous requiring bodies qualifying under those conditions to have a track record and a certain time to have elapsed so that it will be possible to identify that they meet the criteria.  The alternative of having a looser regime might result in the surprising qualification of a number of organisations that Senators present might not welcome celebrating and solemnising marriages.  In some jurisdictions, particularly in some states in the United States, there is a very commercial element to the solemnisation of marriage often in ways that we in Ireland would not find appropriate in terms of the solemnity and the statement the couple is making to their family and friends, and to society in general.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is my final observation.  I quote the Minister&rsquo;s comments on Second Stage:</P>
        <P LI="1">It may also be worth examining whether there is a case for the Registrar General to have a role in the designation process.  Under the current system, bodies may apply to the Registrar General.  If the Registrar General refuses to register a person or cancels an existing registration, the affected person may appeal this decision to the Minister [as she outlined in the cases she mentioned].  In the circumstances, it would appear reasonable for the same system to apply.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While I presume it cannot be dealt with under this legislation, has the Minister given any further thought to it?</P>
        <P>Regarding support for marriage as an institution, it has often been said that states in general facilitate to an extraordinary degree the solemnising of a union between two people without having any safeguards or bells and whistles attached.  In other words people are not required to satisfy any criteria.  Senator Walsh mentioned the Catholic Church&rsquo;s practice of obliging people to take pre-marriage courses.  It is amazing that the State does not provide ongoing support for marriages.  It provides support for marriages that have, unfortunately, broken up or failed, which is commendable.  However, the State does not involve itself in ensuring that people are suitable for marriage.  I know it is an age-old question.  I ask the Minister to address the specific question of her comments on the registrar.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulations are set out in the legislation.  Senator Mooney&rsquo;s party introduced that legislation.  I believe the arrangements are coherent and workable, which is important.  They also provide for an appropriate, if one likes, qualification which assists in ensuring that due solemnity and ceremony is attached to the solemnisation of marriage as opposed to a different model which might result in it becoming over-commercialised as has happened in some jurisdictions.  While ultimately we all hope for the best for two people who get married, it does not always work out, but that is a different situation.  We are just discussing the celebration and solemnisation of marriage.  That is all that is relevant to the legislation.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 3, after section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;7.&mdash;The Act of 2004 is amended by the insertion of a new Section 54A:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;54A.&mdash;(1) An application under section 54 by a philosophical and non-confessional body to have a member or members registered in the Register of Solemnisers shall not be accepted unless an tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) the body in question has been performing marriage ceremonies for a period of at least five years, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) at least twenty couples have participated in the marriage ceremony of the body, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) these marriages have been solemnised by a registrar and registered in the register of marriages, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>d</i>) at least one of these marriages has been registered in the register of marriages at least five years before the date of the application.</P>
        <P LI="2">(2) The body in question shall provide such evidence as an tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir may determine to satisfy him or her that the conditions specified in subsection (1) have been met and such evidence shall include direct evidence from the couples referred to in paragraph (<i>b</i>) and (<i>d</i>) of subsection (1), or as many of them as is practicable.</P>
        <P LI="2">(3) A member of a philosophical and non-confessional body who is registered in the Register of Solemnisers may not solemnise a marriage unless at least one of the parties to the marriage is a member of the body in question.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We have had a very full debate on the other amendments and essentially this is part of the same series of amendments but somewhat different.  The amendment would insert a new section 54A into the 2004 Act which would refer specifically to applications by a philosophical and non-confessional body.  It sets out the same criteria we have already debated and agreed.  It just requires that the body would provide such evidence as the Registrar General, an tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir, may determine to satisfy him or her that the conditions have been met.  This responds to some of the points made by others.  It will not be a body designated by the Minister &mdash; it will be the Registrar General who will adjudicate on the applications as the registrar currently adjudicates on applications by religious bodies.</P>
        <P>Subsection (3) of the new section would require that a member of a philosophical non-confessional body registered in the Register of Solemnisers will not be able to solemnise a marriage unless at least one of the parties to the marriage is a member of the body in question.  This is a further relatively onerous requirement which would mean that anyone, for example, who wishes to have a humanist solemniser celebrate his or her marriage would have to be a member of the Humanist Association of Ireland.  That amendment, which would create a new section, is entirely in keeping with the amendments we have already discussed.  Amendment No. 12 simply inserts a new subsection to create an offence where a person breaches section 54A(3).  Again, this is very much linked with amendment No. 9.  We have already debated the criteria, and the substance of the amendments has already been passed.  These are further amendments to facilitate applications by a philosophical non-confessional body.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group I compliment Senator Bacik, as I did on Second Stage, for initiating this important legislation.  I also thank her for addressing, not just adequately but enthusiastically, a number of points made about inherent flaws in the Bill during the full and comprehensive debate that took place on Second Stage.  I am sure the original objectives she set herself will now be achieved.  We can all feel confident that when the Humanist Association of Ireland makes its application under the new amended legislation, it will be included on the list.  I wish it well.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for dealing with this legislation and also for her prescience in ensuring that those of us who were contributing to the debate were brought up to speed with documentation relating to it by e-mail in the last couple of days.  I am grateful to her for that.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Mooney for his kind comments.  I did try to ensure people were kept up to speed by e-mailing all colleagues a briefing on the amendments and the rationale behind them, and I am grateful to all colleagues on both sides of the House that the amended Bill has passed unanimously.  The aim with which we were all in agreement &mdash; that the Humanist Association of Ireland be included in the Register of Solemnisers &mdash; can now be fulfilled by this legislation.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, for coming to the debate, and, in particular, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, who has been hugely supportive of this Bill.  I also thank the Registrar General, the officials and advisers in the Minister&rsquo;s office, and the Bills Office, as well as colleagues in the Labour Party group, who sponsored this originally, and on both sides of the House.</P>
        <P>This is a good day for the Seanad.  This is a Private Members&rsquo; Bill from the Seanad that has been accepted by the Government and will now proceed to the D&aacute;il, sponsored by the Minister, Deputy Burton, and passed &mdash; very soon, I hope &mdash; as a Government Bill.  To be personal for a moment, I have attended many humanist wedding ceremonies, which of course had non-legal status until now, and I very much look forward to attending my first legally binding humanist wedding ceremony.  There was some reference during the full and considered debate to marriage break-up, but this relates to a very happy occasion, the celebration of marriage.</P>
        <P>This Bill seeks to ensure that those who wish to have their marriage celebrated by a member of the Humanist Association of Ireland or a philosophical non-confessional body can now do so in a legal way.  It is an inclusive Bill and represents a small but significant step towards greater inclusiveness in Irish society.  It will greatly improve the quality of life for those who wish to have humanist wedding ceremonies and it will ensure our laws are somewhat more reflective of our pluralist and diverse society.</P>
        <P>I thank the members of the Humanist Association of Ireland for their forbearance with the difficult legislative process, although I must point out that this Bill was relatively quick to pass through the Seanad.  I hope it will pass through the D&aacute;il even more quickly.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome representatives from the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, the teacher unions, BelongTo, TENI, Gay Doctors Ireland and &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il who are in the Gallery.  We are dealing with an issue of major concern to each of these groups, namely, the threat posed to thousands of teachers, doctors, nurses and other employees by section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act.  In proposing this Bill, I hope we can reach cross-party consensus.  Tackling injustice and promoting human rights is an issue on which we should be united.</P>
        <P>Since I first proposed the Bill, I have endeavoured to do everything I can to build consensus to move it forward.  I engaged with the other political parties and Independents.  I made it clear that I am prepared to work with any Member on any amendment to make the Bill more effective.  On Second Stage we are debating the general principles and on Committee Stage, as we do with other Bills, we can make sure everyone is happy with the precise wording.  I had originally planned to bring the Bill into the House two months ago but I agreed to hold off at the request of the Government side to allow time to consult and collaborate on it.  We have been doing that over the past two months but we must move on because this is an issue of immediate and pressing concern to so many people.</P>
        <P>Under equality legislation, it is illegal for an employer to discriminate against an employee or potential employee on grounds including gender, civil status, family status and sexual orientation.  However, section 37(1) of the Act provides an exemption for religious, educational or medical institutions under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes.  It is widely considered that this section could be used to justify discrimination against an employee simply because he or she is lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, separated, divorced, cohabiting outside marriage or an unmarried mother.  Some people say this is a hypothetical problem and question whether such discrimination, even though it is legal, could take place.  This week, we learned of an investigation by the Ombudsman for Children into a school in Tipperary that refused to enroll a 16 year old girl on the grounds that she was pregnant.  Citing his duty to protect the honourable majority of his pupils, the principal stated the school should not be blamed for having a &ldquo;moral code&rdquo;.  If such prejudice can be used against a teenage girl who wants to finish her education, I have no doubt that it can also be used to deny someone a job or promotion in a school or hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People are at an immediate risk and putting this issue on the long finger will leave them vulnerable.  GLEN and the teacher unions believe section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act is causing real problems for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, teachers.  GLEN states that as a result of this provision, employees or prospective employees, whose lives may possibly be interpreted to be contrary to the religious ethos of some faiths, have lived in fear for their jobs and their prospects within employment.  They acknowledge that no case has been taken under the Act but point out that it serves as a daily chill factor for LGBT teachers.</P>
        <P>Employees and potential employees of religious-run hospitals are in the same position.  According to Dr. Leslie Hannon of Gay Doctors Ireland, &ldquo;The weight of laws like these impress upon gay doctors the type of self-censorship and &lsquo;discretion&rsquo; that enable and propagate homophobia in general, simply because they serve to downsize us and make us invisible&rdquo;.  There are many gay teachers and doctors working in our schools and hospitals but, unfortunately, too many of them feel the need to hide something as intrinsically important as who it is they fall in love with from their colleagues.</P>
        <P>I will give an example of such a teacher.  Mary works in a Catholic primary school and has been working in the same school for the past 20 years.  She is a great teacher and her pupils love how she makes every lesson interesting.  Parents are impressed by how well their children are doing in her classroom.  The school principal appreciates how she is always willing to go beyond the call of duty and help out with after-school activities.  She does a great job of preparing her class for their communion day.  Mary loves teaching and it is all she ever wanted to do but she has never been fully comfortable at school.  She lives with the constant fear of her colleagues finding out that she is a lesbian because section 37 could be used to take action against her.  She hopes the school would not do so but feels it is safer not to test it.  When other teachers talk to each other about their families and what they did at the weekend, Mary is very quiet in the staff room.  She makes a point of only socialising with her long-term partner outside the town that she works in.  Mary is determined that her colleagues will only learn of her relationship with her partner when she brings Susan to her retirement party.</P>
        <P>Over the past couple of months, I have received e-mails from many teachers like Mary welcoming this Bill.  All make the same point that they do not want any special treatment but want to be judged on the same basis as everyone else, namely, on ability in the classroom rather than on someone else&rsquo;s perception of their private lives.  This Bill will ensure that happens.</P>
        <P>Freedom of religion is an important constitutional value and one I fully respect but it should not be used to permit discrimination that would be unacceptable and illegal in any other employment.  It should not be allowed to significantly reduce job opportunities for an entire group of people.  If the Bill is enacted, religious-run institutions will still be entitled to insist that staff members demonstrate respect for the ethos in the workplace and not actively seek to undermine it but they will not be able to dismiss, discriminate against or refuse to hire people just because they do not approve of their private lives.  The Bill was drafted to achieve an appropriate and constitutionally proportionate balance between the right of an institution to uphold its ethos and the rights of the individual teacher.  It has been strongly endorsed by GLEN, which called on the Government to support it.  It has also been welcomed by the INTO lesbian, gay and bisexual group, whose chairman, Cathal O&rsquo;Riada, has said that removing the ability for schools to discriminate would be an enormous and immediate relief for gay teachers.  Representatives from the ASTI and TUI also addressed a briefing session on the Bill for Members in Leinster House and urged Members to support it.  At the same session, a representative from BelongTo spoke of the impact that discrimination against gay teachers has on young people by forcing teachers to hide their true identities and robbing young LGBT people of role models they need at a difficult time in their lives.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has taken the initiative in putting forward this Bill.  As a republican party, we must be committed to fighting discrimination in all forms.  This should not be a party political issue.  The Bill is in line with a commitment in the programme for Government and is in keeping with the progressive approach the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, has taken to the issue of tackling homophobic bullying in schools.  The debate on Second Stage discusses the principle of tackling discrimination.  We are not here to sign off on the final wording and, in any case, we cannot change the wording today.  That will take place on Committee Stage.  I indicated to Members that I am happy to see the Bill amended on Committee Stage.  Two specific amendments need to be made, one of which is to include gender and family status as grounds.  The wording is not perfect but that is not the point.  Two weeks ago, we sat through six or seven hours of Government amendments to the Education (Amendment) Bill because it wanted to tidy up the Bill.  We are not here to sign off on the final wording of the Bill.  We are here to discuss the principle and whether, as a House, we can send out a united message that we want to deal with the principle.  We can sit down on Committee Stage and take input from legal advisers and others and ensure that everybody is happy with the final wording.  Obviously I have had the wording cleared by two lawyers who are satisfied and have read the case law, the original Article 26 reference in the Bill and other related case law on the freedom of religion.  They are happy that it strikes a proportionate balance because it leaves the protection for the religious ethos of the institution and simply qualifies that religious ethos cannot be used to discriminate against somebody, their inherent personal characteristics or their private lives outside of the hospital or school where they work.</P>
        <P>Before Members commence their contributions I want to clearly state that I am happy to work with anybody on any side of the House to finalise the wording and ensure that everybody is happy with it before we go any further.  This is an important issue and I genuinely think that all parties should be willing to put aside their differences and send out a united message.  The Bill addresses a genuine fear among citizens of this State about whether they can go about their lives free from a threat of discrimination.  It is not a hypothetical problem but a real issue that we, as a House, have an opportunity to change today and before the next school year commences.  I hope that the Bill will receive cross-party support today, that we can all collaborate and have a final text passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas and enacted as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the proposal and I am proud to do so.  I commend my colleague, Senator Averil Power, on her work on the legislation and her ongoing commitment to the general area.  I also commend her on her courage because sadly one still needs courage to bring forward legislation in this general area.  We have made great progress but prejudice still exists.  I echo her call to deal with the issue and that the Government side should accept the Bill by consensus from a non-confrontational and non-party viewpoint.  As no amendments have been tabled I hope that the Minister will accept the entire Bill.  It would be a wise decision for the Government because Senator Power&rsquo;s view is in line with its policy as enunciated by several Ministers from the two main parties in government.  My party is often seen by liberals as not being so liberal but the facts prove otherwise.  Fianna F&aacute;il has a proud record of producing sex equality legislation from the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, the 1993 homosexuality discrimination Bill, the Equal Status Act 2000 and the 2012 civil partnership Bill.  All of these prove that my party is forward thinking and conscious of the needs of minorities in every walk of life.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Power has highlighted that there are certain exemptions from the Equality Act in certain religious, educational and medical institutions.  As she has made clear and I reiterate, we believe that such institutions are entitled to uphold their particular ethos, be it Catholic, Protestant or whatever.  We also believe that these institutions are entitled to expect their employees to do their utmost to uphold the ethos in that institution and that employees have a responsibility not to subvert the ethos.  However, we equally contend and affirm the rights of individuals not to be discriminated against with regard to their right to be employed on their merits only and to be free from any and all obstacles on the grounds of sexual orientation.  In the real world, as a parent and former teacher, parents have only one question for the teachers in their schools and the doctors in their hospitals.  Are they efficient and good at their job?  Parents are not interested in anything to do with their private lives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also commend the teacher unions and the medical sector on  their full support for gay and lesbian employees and colleagues.  This year I attended the INTO conference in Killarney and I was delighted to hear such strong support for this issue expressed by its CEO, who is in the Visitors Gallery, and by her executive and members.  I commend the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, who attended the conference as guest of honour and in his speech he picked up positively on those points.  I am interested to hear his comments on the Bill when he speaks on Second Stage.</P>
        <P>We continue to evolve as a caring society even though prejudices still exist.  The workplace is now a much less threatening environment for minorities and the sexual bullying of teachers, nurses or doctors will not be tolerated in 2012.  We have come a long way from the appalling Flynn case in Wexford many years ago when a teacher was forced out of a school simply because she was having a relationship that was not sanctified by marriage.  It was a humiliating case for Ms Flynn and for all right thinking people at the time.  Thankfully, we seem to have come a long way.  Again, as Senator Power has said, we have the story in the mid-west of a teenage mum that I am not informed enough about to comment on other than to say that it is deeply troubling and something we must be conscious of.</P>
        <P>To conclude, I hope that the Government will examine the legislation in a holistic and non-political way.  The Senator has gone out of her way to show that the legislation is not a point scoring exercise for our party.  It is just another step in a long difficult road to gain equality for everyone on the island, equality that was promised in the 1916 Proclamation.</P>

	<P>This is the first time that we have had two Ministers debate the same Bill together.  They will share time and I call the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Power for giving us an opportunity to discuss how we can progress reform in this important human rights area.  From my two meetings with her she knows that I am committed, along with my good colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to strengthening the statutory protection for equality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My unequivocal conviction is that it is simply wrong to exclude people from employment or other opportunities in life on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, family status, marital status, religion, age, disability, race or ethnicity, including membership of the Traveller community.  More specifically, it is unjust that people whose wages are paid by the taxpayer and who are employed to provide essential public services should feel intimidated or feel a need to live their lives in secret for fear that their sexual orientation or civil status or family status, for example, should lead to victimisation by an employer.</P>
        <P>It is important, of course, that we ensure that we cover, in this proposed Bill, the full range of individuals who may be affected.  Senator Power knows from my discussions with her that there are particular concerns that the Bill omits to mention family status or issues of gender.  Essentially, under this Bill, the protection that, for example, should be afforded to the single mother in these circumstances would not be extended to her.</P>
        <P>As a society we have a fundamental duty to ensure that minorities who have historically been subjected to malign discrimination are properly treated.  Treating people properly means assuring them of full equality without qualifications.  Equality law is an important means of positively ensuring that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people can live openly, safely and honestly in society.  The bright-line pledge in our programme for Government is that:  &ldquo;people of non-faith or minority religious backgrounds and publically identified LGBT people should not be deterred from training or taking up employment as teachers in the State&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Self-evidently, the State has a compelling human rights interest in eradicating discrimination based on social prejudice.  The practical challenge for us today is how we can as a pluralist constitutional democracy commit to both equality of treatment and tolerance of and respect for religious differences.  The advice available to me is that the Bill touches on issues of profound constitutional sensitivity and importance.  So we need to tread very carefully.  I am unsure that this Bill as drafted would pass constitutional muster and that is a particular concern.</P>
        <P>The test the Oireachtas faces when it legislates in this area is whether it has preserved a proper balance between the rights of religious denominations to manage their own affairs and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes and the rights of other citizens to equality before the law and to earn their livelihood.  The courts have enunciated this test.  It is important that we consider the relevant constitutional case law.  In their case law, the courts have endorsed the proposition that occasions arise when it is necessary to make distinctions in order to give life and reality to the constitutional guarantee of the free profession and practice of religion.  In McGrath and O Ruairc<i> v</i>. The Trustees of Maynooth College in 1979, Mr. Justice Henchy affirmed this view.  He said that the whole point of proscribing disabilities and discriminations at the hands of the State on the ground of religious profession belief or status is, &ldquo;to give vitality, independence and freedom to religion&rdquo;.  He further ruled:</P>
        <P LI="1">Far from eschewing the internal disabilities and discriminations which flow from the tenets of a particular religion, the State must on occasion recognise and buttress them.  For such disabilities and discrimination do not derive from the State; it cannot be said that it is the State that imposed or made them; they are part of the texture and essence of the particular religion; so the State, in order to comply with the spirit and purpose inherent in this constitutional guarantee, may justifiably lend its weight to what may be thought to be disabilities and discriminations deriving from within a particular religion.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left"><i>In re</i> Article 26 and the Employment Equality Bill 1996, the Supreme Court cited this judicial opinion approvingly.  In this Article 26 reference case, the court considered the constitutionality of section 37 of the Employment Equality Bill 1996, which is now section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998, which is the principal section the Senator&rsquo;s Bill seeks to amend.  The Supreme Court said:</P>
        <P LI="1">It would therefore appear that it is constitutionally permissible to make distinctions or discriminations on grounds of religious profession belief or status insofar &mdash; but only insofar &mdash; as this may be necessary to give life and reality to the guarantee of the free profession and practice of religion contained in the Constitution.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The court acknowledged that sections 37(1) and 37(2) of that Act form an exception to the general rule against discrimination on the religious ground.  The court upheld the constitutionality of section 37(1).  This provision entitles an institution to give more favourable treatment, on the religion ground, to an employee or a prospective employee where it is reasonable to do so in order to maintain the religious ethos of the institution or to take action which is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or a prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution.  The court said that the use of the words&rdquo;reasonable&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo; implies that the test is to be an objective one and that the matter is to be resolved on a case to case basis.  The court also upheld the constitutionality of section 37(2), which entitles an institution to prefer a particular candidate on the grounds of his or her religion if in fact being of that religion is an occupational qualification for the post in question.  Thus, the court took the view that the Oireachtas had achieved a correct balance between the right of free profession and practice of religion on one hand and the right to equality before the law and the right to earn one&rsquo;s livelihood on the other.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the Constitution does not state that religious rights must always trump equality rights.  Freedom to practise religion is subject to the requirements of public order and morality.  However, we may reasonably infer from the Irish constitutional case law that action by the State that burdens a religious practice must be justified by a compelling public interest.  The burden must be reasonable, proportionate and not arbitrary.</P>
        <P>The competing rights in this area include freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, right to privacy and to earn a living, freedom of expression and conscience and the right to freedom from harassment and discrimination.  The constitutional obligation on the State to vindicate the personal rights of citizens is also important.</P>
        <P>Thinking aloud and out of respect for the dialogue the Senator has initiated, I would invite the House to consider that, in drafting legislation to amend section 37, we might draw some important distinctions.  These are not distinctions yet explicit in the Bill before us.  We might distinguish, first, between behaviour that might be purposefully intended to undermine the religious ethos of an institution, on one hand, and on the other hand, possession by a person of an inherent characteristic or ground on which discrimination is prohibited, for example, gender, sexual orientation.  Second, we might also distinguish between an autonomous religious institution and public services that are delivered in a partnership between State and religious-controlled institutions, particularly where the religious institution is the <i>de jure </i>employer, but the State pays the salary.  Making these distinctions might enable us to strike a constitutionally appropriate balance between freedom of religion and the right to equality in the context of publicly-funded educational and medical services.</P>
        <P>We should assess the feasibility of an approach to amending legislation on the following lines.  Section 37(1) could remain unchanged in respect of wholly autonomous religious institutions.  However, for educational and medical institutions, we might provide that first, more favourable treatment on the religion ground as per section (37(1)(<i>a</i>), for the purposes of this section cannot be based on a person&rsquo;s characteristics under one of the other grounds; second, reasonable action to prevent an employee or prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution may only be taken where an employee actively undermines or seeks to undermine, or where there is a reasonable belief based on demonstrable evidence that a prospective employee would so undermine or seek to undermine, the religious ethos of the institution concerned; and the section would be without prejudice to a person&rsquo;s constitutional right to privacy or freedom of expression.  The crucial aspect would be to ensure that the power of the institutions to differentiate between employees or prospective employees should only apply where there is a real danger for the institution, based on evidence.  This might include if the person acts with the conscious purpose of directly undermining the employer&rsquo;s core religious beliefs or dogma; or if it is a genuine and demonstrably necessary occupational requirement of the employer that the employee act in a way consistent with the employer&rsquo;s religious beliefs.  The provision might specify the specific considerations that must be weighed in arriving at this determination, including, for example, whether the employer&rsquo;s action is rationally and strictly related to the employer&rsquo;s core beliefs or dogma.  One might also balance the consequences for the person, in particular in relation to his or her rights to dignity, equality, self-determination, self-expression, social life, and privacy; and also the consequences for the employer should the distinction be allowed or disallowed.</P>
        <P>These are my current and preliminary ideas on how reform might be approached in a manner that is constitutionally sound.  I consider that a more extensive consultative process and formal assessment of the options that might be before us should be undertaken.  Last October, I announced plans to merge the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority in order to create a new and enhanced Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  One of its functions will be to advise Ministers and the Government on new legislation.  I expect to be in a position to publish my proposals for legislation to establish the new commission very shortly.  I expect that the commission will be in place within a few months.</P>
        <P>It would be useful to ask the new commission to consider the issues that arise in this area and how reform might be best approached in a way that does justice to the cross-cutting constitutional rights involved.  Given the complexity of the issues involved and that at the heart of the issue are competing constitutional rights and questions about the constitutional obligation of the State to protect the personal rights of all citizens, in my view it is worth taking the time to ask the commission to report on its views and recommendations to the two Ministers centrally concerned, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn and myself as the Minister for Justice and Equality and to the House.  Once the commission has reported, I commit to bringing forward Government proposals in this area early in the new year.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that I accept the spirit of the Bill.  I am proposing that the Senator would agree to defer further consideration of it until the new year, when we can return with amendments which can be fully and properly discussed in the context of a continuing Second Stage debate to ensure that the ultimate Act will be workable and which will survive constitutional challenge.</P>
        <P>I seek agreement from all sides of the House on this measure.  I ask the Senator not to divide the House on what is a very important Bill.  It is vital that the Bill is a strong measure and that it is constitutionally sound.  We do not wish to enact a piece of legislation which may be struck down by the courts before it can achieve the true and good objectives it is designed to achieve.</P>
        <P>We will now travel the unusual route whereby my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, will address the House.</P>

	<P>If I may first mark this unique occasion by saying it is a testimony to the respect and the commitment to this matter of both the Minister for Justice and Equality and myself.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Power for affording the Oireachtas the opportunity to debate this legislation.  Our agreed programme for Government states that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people should not be deterred from taking up employment as teachers in this State.  I know it is with the spirit of that commitment in mind that Senator Power has tabled this constructive legislation.  I have had many conversations relating to this matter in recent months with Senator Power as well as with Senators Bacik and Zappone and I have made my views and those of the Government known to teachers and to the public, as was said in a previous contribution.  I will repeat the sentiment expressed by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, lest there be any doubt &mdash; it is the position of this Government that we will ensure that discrimination against LGBT people, or against single mothers, will be brought to an end.</P>
        <P>The society in which we live has undergone a seismic shift in recent decades.  The changes we have witnessed touch on all aspects of life &mdash; political, social, economic, cultural and educational.  The Ireland of today is a far more diverse, open and questioning one than that of a generation ago and certainly of the one in which I came of age.  This brings with it exciting opportunities.  Diversity is good for society.  It fosters new ideas and fresh thinking.  It creates the possibility to share in each other&rsquo;s worlds, to gain new perspectives and, most important, to learn.  It also creates its own challenges.  One of those challenges is the issue we are debating today.  How do we balance the rights of those who wish to receive a denominational education with the rights of those employed within the schools system?  The role of the churches in the provision of education in Ireland is well known and has been a part of the formal system of education since its inception.</P>
        <P>With the establishment of the primary school system in 1831, schools were recognised by the State, largely under the patronage of the different Christian religious denominations.  Even now 96% of education provision at primary school level is delivered in a Christian denominational setting.  There have, however, been increasing demands to make available other forms in which education is provided.  The recognition of gaelscoileanna and multidenominational schools demonstrate a commitment by the State to meet this demand by providing alternatives to what was the traditional approach.</P>
        <P>When I published the report of the advisory group to the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector last month, I pointed to the need for the primary school system to adapt to the needs of a more diverse society.  Despite the many societal changes I have talked about, many Irish parents continue to wish to have their children educated in an environment supported by a denominational religion, which is entirely their right.  This is a valid exercise of parental choice and is one which is underpinned by our Constitution.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution contemplates children receiving religious education in State schools to be in accordance with their parents&rsquo; wishes.  It also recognises that parents have a right to have religious education provided in schools that their children attend.</P>
        <P>Given this backdrop, what is a school to do where a member of its staff overtly rejects the ethos it is mandated to uphold and deliver for its students?  How is it to behave if it has a genuine belief that appointing a prospective employee could lead to the undermining of the characteristic spirit which is the hallmark of the school?  These are legal questions which must be considered as part of this debate, and questions which must be aired in public.  As against this, there are the rights of teachers and other school staff.  Principles of equality before the law and the right to earn a livelihood are also enshrined in our Constitution.  In a republic, we must acknowledge that all citizens are free and equal before the law, and those rights must be given recognition in all of the laws created by this State.</P>
        <P>There is at least anecdotal evidence to suggest that many teachers who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender experience feelings of isolation and disempowerment in their work.  They feel constrained in what they can disclose about their personal lives to their colleagues fearing that this will affect their career or even their daily working experience in the school.  They may also fear the prejudices of parents and students.  In essence, it forces many into a denial of who they are.  What a sentence for life.  We cannot ignore the right to be treated with dignity and respect, and brushing this issue under the carpet and choosing to ignore it is simply no answer.  If we are to become a genuinely pluralist, tolerant and open society, we need to meet these challenges realistically and honestly.  I thank Senator Power again for giving us the opportunity to do so today.</P>
        <P>I do not deny that there are significant legal issues underlying this issue, to which the Minister, Deputy Shatter has already referred.  A number of constitutional rights &mdash; some of them competing &mdash; arise and need to be weighed up.  This will take some time.  There are also cultural issues which are informed by the law but sit separately to it.  How are we to foster a fully inclusive society?  For example, how do we reconcile a child&rsquo;s right to receive education in a denominational school with a teacher&rsquo;s right to live by their own set of values?  It behoves us all to tackle these thorny issues.  There are no easy answers to this dilemma, nor should there be.  Reconciling the rights of people when they interact with each other is often complex and requires a high degree of creativity, foresight, wisdom and judgment.  No one person or entity has a monopoly on these attributes and I very much look forward to these issues getting the time and attention they deserve by all those who are affected by this important issue.</P>
        <P>Today is an important day in beginning to put an end to discrimination which has been enshrined in our laws.  I look forward to continuing to work with the Seanad and with the Minister, Deputy Shatter, as well as all the parties in reaching a consensus on how this matter can be legislated for.</P>
        <P>I believe that good and honest progress has been made in recent weeks through conversations between Members on all sides of this House.  This is a model of how Oireachtas work can be done and in particular how the Seanad can work.  In light of this recent work, I would like to echo the suggestion raised by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, that Senator Power would consider adjourning this debate this evening, allowing for a full consultative process before responding early in the new year for the reasons that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has set out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome both the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, to the House.  The presence of both of them today as we debate this historic Bill put forward by Senator Power is deeply appreciated by many throughout Ireland who have advocated change in regard to section 37 of the Employment Equality Act.  I also welcome members of the public in the Gallery, as Senator Power did, because many of them have been champions of that desired change.  Over the years I have referred to section 37 as the inequality clause of Ireland&rsquo;s employment equality legislation.  I wish to commend my colleague, Senator Power, on bringing forward this Bill for all of the reasons she has indicated to us today.  By doing so, she has demonstrated not only her political acumen but also her solidarity with those whose lives have been negatively impacted by the dark shadows of discrimination and unsafety that this section has cast on so many people over the past 14 years who have worked within religious institutions delivering public services.</P>
        <P>My spouse, Dr. Ann Louise Gilligan, was one such individual.  She had to face head-on the shadow of discrimination and unsafety the day she decided with me to take the Irish State to court because of its refusal to recognise our Canadian marriage.  At the time she was teaching in St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, Drumcondra, one of the colleges of education that teaches teachers and the manager of that college is the Archbishop of Dublin.  Though her action could be interpreted as undermining the religious ethos of her employment, Dr. Gilligan decided to do it anyway, carrying though it did a heavy threat of financial insecurity, professional loss and the culture of prejudice that section 37 imposes on her and thousands of others throughout our land.  This section requires change.</P>
        <P>Instead of adding further subsections to the Employment Equality Acts, I suggest it is more effective and just to delete the problematic subsection.  My principle is that no one should be in the shadow of this section on the basis of his or her identity, and that is the principle I put forward.  I will outline my reasons for this proposal, of which there are three.  First, I think a religious ethos is adequately protected already.  As the Ministers have both said, it is an important balance to strike between protection of an institution&rsquo;s religious ethos and the rights of an employee to pursue their career without fear and discrimination.  Religious ethos is protected by sections 16, 25, 37(1)(<i>a</i>) and 37(2) of the Employment Equality Acts and by a number of other laws.  Section 37(1)(<i>a</i>) allows an institution to give preference to members of its own faith for a job, a promotion or for particular duties.  Sections 37(2) and 25 permits all employers to treat people differently where there is a genuine and necessary occupational requirement.  All of these sections are an adequate safeguard to the religious ethos of an institution.  Taken together, these provisions also reflect the exceptions which are permitted under EU law.  Section 37(1)(<i>b</i>) goes beyond that and, is in my view, unjust.</P>
        <P>My second reason is to question if section 37 is compliant with EU law.    It would appear we are not currently compliant with EU law in a couple of ways.  It is not clear whether section 37 permits discrimination based on a person&rsquo;s gender in order to protect the religious ethos of an institution.  I say this because section 37 does not apply to the part of the Act, namely, Part III, which contains provisions to protect people against gender discrimination.  Thus section 37 does not appear to be compliant with the EU recast directive of 2006 which does not allow us to discriminate for any reason on the basis of someone&rsquo;s gender.</P>
        <P>The EU framework recast and race directives prohibit discrimination with regard to sexual orientation, disability, age and race in addition to gender.  These are categories that refer to people&rsquo;s identities first and foremost as distinct from their behaviour and this is a similar distinction to the one made by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, in his remarks.  Section 37(1)(<i>b</i>) in its current form permits discrimination against people on the basis of their identities.  A European Commission report expressly states section 37(1) as it stands is broader than allowed for in the framework directive.  To discriminate against someone&rsquo;s identity if she is a lesbian, disabled or older is not reasonable because one&rsquo;s identity is irrelevant to how one performs the job of teaching young people or caring for the sick.</P>
        <P>Who is still not protected by the Bill as tabled by Senator Power?  The Bill does not cover everyone affected by the legislation.  Even if a person cannot be discriminated against on the basis of their gender to protect religious ethos, although I suggest this is not the case, it is sometimes difficult to predict which ground of discrimination is applicable in some circumstances.  For example, a married heterosexual woman or a lesbian woman who becomes pregnant through assisted reproductive technology could be regarded as undermining the religious ethos on the basis of having a disability as opposed to on the basis of her gender.  Since this would be a form of disability discrimination she would not be protected by the proposed Bill or by section 37 as it stands.  Singling out two, three or four of the nine equality grounds for particular treatment in the context of the Bill could be seen as implying it is acceptable for an institution to discriminate against an employee on one of the other grounds, for example, a pregnant woman or the partner of a pregnant woman who is covered by the gender ground, a person who is HIV-positive who is covered by the disability ground or transsexual person who is covered by the gender and disability grounds.  Given that we do not have the definition of gender identity as yet in Irish legislation, the gender ground under the equality legislation covers only transsexual people and not transgender people.  Only a repeal of section 37(1)(<i>b</i>) can offer full protection to all people.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Power for tabling the Bill before us this afternoon.  Certainly it raises a challenge for all of us.  I did not come here with a prepared script or defined views but I listened with interest to the speakers.  Senator Power&rsquo;s challenge to us is high and demanding and the bar has been raised by the very interesting questions and concerns raised by Senator Zappone.  The initial responses of the two Ministers present, and I acknowledge the unusual political situation we have this afternoon, were considered, fair and balanced.  The word &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; must be at the heart of our response to the Bill and our more long-term response to the legislative situation which has been outlined.</P>
        <P>All of us claim to live in a modern republic.  We must also aspire to live in a moderate republic where respect and generosity are at the core of all we do by way of law and politics.  In responding to what Senator Power has proposed, we must try to keep this balance to the fore.  A sentence from the response of the Minister, Deputy Quinn, sums up the situation.  He stated there are no easy answers to this dilemma nor should there be and reconciling the rights of people where they interact with each other is often complex and requires a high degree of creativity, foresight, wisdom and judgment.</P>
        <P>It is also a challenge for us to get involved in the debate to bring about a fair, balanced and just solution.  As has been outlined, people who operate religious-run institutions have a particular view of society and under the Constitution have particular entitlements to practice in a certain fashion.  However, those who live outside this scope must also be respected and constitutionally protected.  I would like to come up with a simple solution but I cannot do so.  However, I look forward to engaging in the debate.  If we keep generosity, fairness and respect at the core of what we do politically, we will resolve this issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Zappone raised questions beyond the confines of the Bill but which are equally valid and from which we cannot run.  Perhaps if she was not here this afternoon it would be easier for us to respond to what Senator Power stated but Senator Zappone&rsquo;s comments are very pertinent and very much part of the ongoing debate and they cannot be ignored or brushed aside.  It has probably been the tradition of Irish politics that we generally try to kick matters to touch and brush them under the carpet but we cannot continue to do so.</P>
        <P>While I am thankful to Senator Power for the presentation of her views and the Bill, the Ministers are outlining a response which will allow all of us to work with her to bring about a solution based on fairness.  I would not like to see the House divide on this issue this afternoon.  Yesterday, when we debated education we saw the Seanad at its best where genuine fair debate can bring about the type of changes and solutions we require.  I ask the Senator to bear with us for a few crucial months and work with us and we will get it right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senator Power on bringing forward the Bill.  I have had many discussions with her and I support the Bill.  Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan stated some people in his party would not be regarded as liberal and it is the same with mine.  However, this is not about liberalism; it is about justice.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimDarcy"><NameTxt>Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will switch it off.</P>
        <P>I recall the words of Fidel Castro, not that I am a supporter.  He stated he did not have a liberal bone in his body but that he believed in justice.  I do not know how true this is but he said it.  I also believe in justice and I hope people would not be discriminated against when going for a job or in employment on the basis of gender or civic status.  I recall when I went for a job in a religious school 30 years ago and I was before the Sanhedrin of three brave priests who asked me whether I thought someone with no religion could teach religion in schools.  I was going for the principalship and I knew it was the defining question.  I stated such a person could do so and I got the job.  My friend who also went for the job answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; to that question and stated he knew from the body language that he was gone.  Even 30 years ago people could make judgments based on one&rsquo;s ability to do the job.  We must move forward and ensure it is on a more steady basis.</P>
        <P>This brings me to a point made by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  He wants us to be a little careful because the Bill touches on issues of profound constitutional sensitivity and importance.  I do not think the Minister would say this lightly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To judge from the fact he is in support of the spirit of the Bill, the Minister wants Members to hasten slowly.  He wants them to take their time and come up with a long-term solution to this issue and I ask Senator Power to hold this Bill, based on the fact it is her Bill.  Moreover, if I understood the Minister correctly, I am delighted to learn it will continue to be so.  As I told her the other day, my main concern was that it would continue to be her Bill, because she deserves to bring it through the Seanad.  I hope to be able to offer my full support to the Bill, with amendments.  Finally, I note the phrase &ldquo;early in the new year&rdquo; is somewhat akin to Samuel Beckett&rsquo;s book, <i>Malone Dies</i>.  I seek a specific date in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">First, I commend Senator Power, as it comes as a great relief to me not to be the person introducing such legislation, as well as to discover I no longer am the only gay in the village.  I note another one has joined from the Minister&rsquo;s party in recent days, a development on which both he and his party must be congratulated.  I also commend Senator Power on her flexibility.  She has indicated she is prepared to have the Bill amended and will not press it further.  She has started the process and discussion and a number of the Minister&rsquo;s comments have been extremely constructive and helpful, albeit not all of them, a point to which I will return in a minute, as I remember very well the cases he has cited.  However, I make the point that people are afraid and have grounds to be so for as long as the sections under discussion exist.  I was a Member of the House in 1998, when these provisions were put through by a very fine Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor.  He maintained that while there was no constitutional objection, it was politically impossible to get the equality legislation through because of the conservatism within all the political parties, that this was the maximum achievable and it would be necessary to continue to discriminate against gay people.  I believe that Joe O&rsquo;Toole and I were about the only two Members who voted against it on that basis.  This demonstrates how far we have changed and thank God for that</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I also remember the case law that applied in the neighbouring island and how dangerous it was.  Approximately 15 years ago, a young fellow, who was employed as a gardener in a public school in Scotland, attended a gay rights rally as a member of the public.  Unbeknownst to himself, he was photographed and his photograph appeared in the local newspaper, after which he was dismissed simply for attending a rally.  While he had never attempted to subvert anything or to attack the ethos, he was dismissed and that case was upheld in the courts in Britain.  There is an impact on bullying and Members should not fool themselves that this has stopped.  I am delighted there are people from BeLonG To in the Visitors Gallery, although I cannot see everyone terribly well.  However, I attended the opening of the BeLonGTo premises 18 months ago by the former Minister of State, Barry Andrews, at which a 16-year-old youth told of how he had put up the officially sponsored anti-homophobic bullying posters in a Christian Brothers school in north Dublin city and was forced, in the presence of his classmates, by the brother in charge to take them down.  His life was made so intolerable that he was obliged to leave the school.  This still is going on.  Perhaps five or eight years ago, I launched a book about bullying. which included a section on homophobic bullying.  At that point, 80% of schoolyard bullying included a homophobic element and 80% of cases were not addressed because teachers were afraid.  One key to that fear is section 37, a section I would like to see removed.  It is also very important to consider the question of the equality tribunals because the existing five rights fora are being subsumed into a single two-tier system.  My concern is the unique features of employment equality cases do not appear to have been given appropriate attention under this new arrangement.  Perhaps the Minister will confirm the welcome reports that equal status cases will not be heard before the District Court as it is very important that they do not do so.</P>
        <P>As for the Minister&rsquo;s speech, he spoke of the rights of religious denominations to manage their own affairs and so on.  I fully agree but as an Anglican, I am ashamed that it was my church, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, which insisted on denominational schooling.  As a Christian, I do not believe that is proper and is one factor that has led to the situation in the North of Ireland.  The Minister&rsquo;s cited the case of McGrath and &Oacute; Ruairc<i> v</i>. The Trustees of Maynooth College.  While I am unsure whether the Minister remembers the case, I remember it extremely well and I know the reason they were fired.  They were fired because they left the priesthood and I believe one of them got married.  They were teachers of history and that judgment was a disgrace.  I do not care whether it came from the Supreme Court or from where it came as it was outrageous and certainly should be superseded.  I certainly doubt whether that could happen in Maynooth now because the college has been separated into a pontifical university and a kind of secular institution.  Mr. Justice Henchy was responsible, which just shows that an excellent judge can give a bad judgment.  He gave a very good dissenting judgment in my own case.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s helpful suggestions in outlining areas in which shading and nuancing must be included in the Bill and I believe Senator Power accepts this point.</P>
        <P>I wish to make one comment on the contribution of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, who stated, &ldquo;I will repeat the sentiment expressed by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, lest there be any doubt &mdash; it is the position of this Government that we will ensure that discrimination against LGBT people, or against single mothers, will be brought to an end&rdquo;.  If that is the case, I wish to see some action.  For example, I refer to the most disgraceful example of child abuse perpetrated by the last Government, with the collaboration of a fair number of Members of this House, which allowed the non-recognition of the rights of children in same-sex marriage.  It is the single provision that otherwise blights that otherwise excellent legislation.  I was glad to see the Minister nodding and I hope it was in agreement.  I hope this issue will be addressed because it constitutes a violation of the rights of children.  While I note this commitment has now been made by two Ministers, let them live up to it.  I do not believe there will be a Division in the House this evening and I believe this represents an important stage in the development of human rights.  However, as a believing and practising Christian, I do not believe it goes far enough and would like to see the whole thing gone.</P>
        <P>My final comment is that I was fascinated to hear Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy state that he applied for and got a job even though he thought that someone who was an atheist could teach religion.  I do not believe this because I believe children can pick up on sincerity.  Children will know well if someone obviously thinks it is complete and utter poppycock.  I would not have got the Senator&rsquo;s job because I would have agreed with the other fellow.  I would have said the answer was &ldquo;No&rdquo;, that such a person should teach geography or whatever and that someone else should be brought in.  While one should not discriminate against such a person, I would not wish to be told something was true by someone who does not believe it, because I can smell dishonesty.  Consequently, I think the Senator got the job on the wrong pretext.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to the House.  I also welcome this development whereby two Ministers are dealing with a Bill that clearly cuts between two different Departments, which is a welcome initiative.  I also welcome to the Visitors Gallery members of groups such as GLEN, Marriage Equality, BeLonGTo and others, which have campaigned for a change in the law.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by others.  I commend Senator Averil Power on introducing this Bill and on her eloquent contribution on the need for it.  We are all agreed that section 37 of the Employment Equality Act as currently drafted is untenable.  It is a mandate to discriminate.  As stated so eloquently by Senator Zappone, it is an inequality clause which upholds the principle in the appalling judgment in the Eileen Flynn case.  Ms Flynn, a teacher at the Holy Faith Convent in New Ross in the mid-1980s, was sacked from her job when she became pregnant outside of marriage.  The teaching unions have condemned that principle, enabling a religious-run educational institution to discriminate against a person it believed was undermining its ethos, as untenable in a modern society.  It should be repealed.  Like Senators Zappone and Norris, I would much prefer that this section be deleted, thus ensuring no exemption from discrimination is afforded to religious run institutions.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Power on taking the initiative in this Bill, which is drafted in a minimalist way and does not cover all people currently facing potential discrimination.  Senator Power and I have had many meetings on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>

	<P>I drafted amendments that would have extended the reach of the Bill to cover other grounds of discrimination, including gender, family status &mdash; which deals with the Eileen Flynn issue &mdash; and disability.  Having listened to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, I accept that there is a need for more time and consideration of the correct framing of legislation to deal effectively with this exemption, which we are all agreed should be removed.  I particularly want the Minister, Department and commission to have time to consider the more radical proposition put forward by Senator Zappone, namely, that the offending section in its entirety be deleted.  This would be by far the preferable model if it would pass constitutional muster.</P>
        <P>I agree with others that there is immense goodwill on the Government side in relation to this Bill.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has publicly stated his support for the spirit of it.  All of us support it in spirit.  It is in the spirit of goodwill and of working together in the Seanad that we would prefer no division on this matter, although I accept that is Senator Power&rsquo;s prerogative.  It would be a pity if we were to divide the House on an issue on which we are all agreed, in particular in light of the firm commitments given.  A historic precedent was set in the Seanad today in terms of acceptance by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, of a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2012, to legalise humanist weddings, which I introduced.  That Bill will now go before the D&aacute;il as a Government Bill.  Another Private Members&rsquo; Bill, which I introduced, on the prohibition of female genital mutilation was accepted in spirit by former Minister, Mary Harney.  I did not call a vote on that Bill and was glad I did not do so because the Government investigated the matter further, following which it produced a much more robust Bill which is now an Act.  That is the way the Seanad works best.  I welcome Senator Power&rsquo;s initiative.  It would be great to see this legislation go forward as a Government Bill.  We will hold the Minister to the introduction of his proposal in January.</P>

        <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill introduced by Senator Power and congratulate her on bringing it forward.  It provides a welcome opportunity to address the issues in policy terms, which debate it is hoped will establish cross-party support for the principle of the reform.  I congratulate Senator Zappone on her powerful and evocative contribution this afternoon.  I wholeheartedly agree with her that we are perhaps not going far enough and that the section concerned needs to be deleted.</P>
        <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, that he will refer the matter for advice to the new human rights and equality commission when established.  Following its report, I look forward to the Minister returning to the Seanad in the new year with more developed proposals.  I, too, would welcome a date in this regard.  It is hoped Senator Power will take this into consideration and will agree to return the Bill to the Order Paper until the New Year.</P>
        <P>We are all unanimous that discrimination against people on the basis of religion or sexual preference needs to be removed and that all people have equal right to employment, free from harassment and discrimination.  As a teacher for many years, I witnessed how our education system evolved over the past decade.  We now have students from different religions and countries in our schools, whose cultures and beliefs are incorporated therein.  It is great to see our children embrace children of other religions, faiths and cultures.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I raised the case of the 16 year old who became pregnant and was refused entry to a school because according to its principal it was against the ethos of the school to admit her.  We are all agreed that this type of discrimination needs to be removed immediately and that all children should be entitled to an education regardless of colour or creed.  The programme for Government states that people of non-faith or minority religious backgrounds and publicly identified LGBT people should not be deferred from training or taking up employment in the State.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Quinn, on his recent announcement of his intention to develop within a few weeks proposals for Government on this issue.</P>
        <P>As I stated, I support the principle of Senator Power&rsquo;s Bill.  However, I am concerned that it might not be fully compatible with the Constitution.  In addition, there may be better ways of doing this that could eliminate discrimination more completely, as pointed out by Senator Zappone.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan that education, particularly in schools, is based on what children learn.  As a parent and former teacher, I totally agree with the sentiment that it is what children learn, rather than the beliefs of those teaching them, that is important.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am tempted to give up when I hear the Constitution invoked on a Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  The Constitution has been invoked as a reason not to accept every Bill ever introduced in this House by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is about time that stopped.  This Bill has been drafted in light, in particular, of the reference to the Supreme Court and the Employment Equality Bill in Article 26 of the 1997 Irish reports, which refers to balance.  That Article states: &ldquo;.....it is constitutionally permissible to make distinctions or discrimination on grounds of religious profession, belief or status insofar, but only insofar, as this may be necessary to give life and reality to the guarantee of the free profession and practice of religion contained in the Constitution.&rdquo;  It is not necessary to discriminate against homosexuals in order to guarantee the free profession and practice of religion as provided for in the Constitution.  That is as clear as day.</P>
        <P>Last summer, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, while patting us on the head for having introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill said the Government could not for constitutional reasons support it but would within a few weeks take action in respect of mortgages.  However, nothing has happened.  The Title of this Bill is: &ldquo;Bill entitled an Act to amend the Employment Equality Acts, 1998 to 2011 and thereby extend the general protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, or civil status in, and in connection with, employment, vocational training and membership of certain bodies.&rdquo;  If one supports the Bill, one votes &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  If against it, one votes &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  One does not pat people on the head, saying well done, nice Bill but we cannot support it.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Quinn, made the ludicrous statement earlier that conversations in the Seanad is how things get changed.  That is not true.  It has not worked in this Seanad in respect of the many Private Members&rsquo; Bills put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il, all of which the Government supported but voted against in accordance with the instructions of party leaders.  On the forthcoming referendum, Fianna F&aacute;il was down in the opinion polls last week because of the comments of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in regard to the famine.  The Government needs to take Fianna F&aacute;il more seriously if it wants to win the vote on the referendum.  We are fully on board but our membership do not like us being continually patted on the head and told well done.  If the Government supports this Bill it should vote for it.  If not, it should vote against it.</P>
        <P>I, and my party, wholeheartedly support this Bill because it is progressive and republican legislation.  It is a Fianna F&aacute;il Bill reflective of Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  In the 21st century, Ireland must stand firm in its opposition to discrimination of any type.  It is unconscionable that a teacher, nurse or doctor could be fired, or not hired in the first place, because he or she is gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.  The fact the various staff unions are heavily engaged in this issue shows how important it is to them.  This Bill is a further step along the road to ensure all teachers and other professionals are treated equally and that their roles are based on capacity and not the perceived options of society of a person&rsquo;s private life.</P>
        <P>President Lyndon Johnson, a one-time conservative who brought in some of the most far-reaching civil rights legislation, said in regard to the Voting Rights Act:</P>
        <P LI="1">This time, on this issue, there must be no delay, or no hesitation, or no compromise with our purpose.  We cannot, we must not, refuse to protect the right of every American to vote in every election.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Hubert Humphrey, in 1948 when there was a choice in his party as to whether to go with civil rights or the state&rsquo;s rights, said:</P>
        <P LI="1">There are those who say to you &mdash; we are rushing this issue of civil rights.  I say we are 172 years late.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That spirit and that urgency to protect civil rights contrasts with the Minister&rsquo;s contribution today.  Because this is a Fianna F&aacute;il Bill, he is talking about delay, procrastination and postponement.  I commend my colleague, Senator Power, who is doing no more than her duty, as the main spokesperson on education in the Seanad for Ireland&rsquo;s main republican party, in putting forward what is republican legislation.  If she calls a division, I urge Senators to support the legislation and not to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  What message would a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote send to gay, lesbian and bisexual people?  It would send out the message that they are willing to sacrifice human rights for political expediency.  That is a very sad message indeed.</P>
        <P>I urge Senators to support this Bill.  It may not go as far as Senator Zappone wants it to go but I do not want to go as far as that because I believe in the rights of religious organisations and religions to uphold their ethos in their institutions.  However, it is not necessary to discriminate against gay people in order to uphold their ethos.  Anyone who thinks it is should read the Roman Catholic catechism which talks in different terms than most people would presume about the Catholic Church in regard to gay people.</P>
        <P>I support this Bill and urge the Government to stop patting us on the head, asking us to withdraw it and saying it might progress it next year.  I have had enough of this.  We hear this time and again in regard to Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; Bills.  The Government should be serious.  Senators should read the legislation and if they are for it, they should vote for it and if they are against, they should vote against it.</P>

I am delighted to speak after Senator Byrne who asked us not to pat him on the head, etc.  l remind him that this legislation is long overdue.  He said 172 years.  Who was in power last?  Why was it not introduced when it was very necessary and when the Equality Authority, society and all the groups in the Visitors Gallery called on the Government to change the legislation?  As Senator Bacik said, it goes back to the Eileen Flynn case in the 1980s.  That is how long Fianna F&aacute;il had to do it but it did not do so.</P>

	<P>On 11 April, the Minister for Education and Skills made an announcement, which was welcomed by the chairperson of the Equality Authority, Ms Angela Kerins, that section 37(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Employment Equality Act would be amended to ensure it cannot be used to discriminate against lesbian, gay and bisexual teachers.  Section 37(1)(<i>b</i>) is not explicit in regard to gay and bisexual people but Ms Kerins stated: &ldquo;It is clear that this clause has reinforced fears of discrimination against lesbian, gay and bisexual workers in religious-run institutions, for example in schools and hospitals and makes it even more difficult for such workers to be open about their sexuality.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Research published jointly by the Equality Authority and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland in 2007 found that fear associated with section 37 has a significantly negative impact on lesbian, gay and bisexual teachers and that the presence of this provision effectively forces these teachers to avoid seeking employment in given sectors or to take up employment in conditions in which they are compelled to conceal their sexuality.  That was published in 2007 and who was in power then?</P>
        <P>I welcome the commitment given and the respect shown to Senator Power, with two Ministers coming into this House.  I am only a new Senator but I think it is unprecedented that two Ministers would come into the House for an Opposition Bill and give it the support they gave it and a commitment to move it forward.</P>
        <P>Senator Power and everybody else can rest assured that I will follow up on this and ensure it comes back to this House because it is serious legislation.  The INTO has come out in support of the amendment of the legislation as well.  I will follow up on this, so it will not be left to those in opposition to do so.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, who is a man of his word, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, have given a commitment.  It is also in the programme for Government.  We will ensure it is followed up on.  Once again, I congratulate Senator Power on introducing the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in warmly welcomes this Bill and congratulates Senator Power on her initiative and assure her we will support the Bill should it be pressed.  We firmly believe discrimination and intolerance should be challenged and stamped out wherever it exists and that the days of loopholes and shelters for any type of ignorance should be put behind us.  Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teachers have the right to have their private lives respected and the repeal of archaic loopholes which allow discrimination in the name of ethos must be removed as quickly as possible.  We all believe teachers should be judged, employed and treated on the basis of their ability alone.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The ending of this legalised discrimination is about more than teachers, as was alluded to by a number of speakers.  The weight of laws such as section 37 impress upon gay, lesbian and transgender people the type of self-censorship which enable and propagate homophobia in general.  We all know schools are where children form their identities and learn and develop as individuals.  Our legislation and legal protections need to have tolerance, diversity and equality as paramount within them.</P>
        <P>The treatment of lesbian, gay and bisexual teachers can have a major bearing on how young gay people see themselves.  Teachers are role models for school children and this is no less true of gay teachers.  Young people coming to terms with their sexuality should feel comfortable in having gay role models as teachers.  When young gay people see that their role models are being discriminated against, or even verbally bullied, they will be less confident and less comfortable in asserting their individual rights.</P>
        <P>While the ethos of the school must be respected, this should, in no way, allow for discrimination against teachers because of their sexuality.  This week the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, told of us his plans to reshape the patronage system for schools.  His plans show the need for our schools to reflect the reality of Ireland in the 21st and so does this Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomed his proposals as a step in modernising our education system and we do the same today with Senator Power&rsquo;s Bill which, like the Minister&rsquo;s proposal, is long overdue.  We wholeheartedly support this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome both Ministers to the House.  A significant part of the debate has focused on constitutional issues.  I read the Minister, Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s speech with interest and I listened to Senator Zappone.  As I am not sufficiently <i>au fait</i> with the Senator&rsquo;s arguments to know whether they are constitutionally robust, I will not respond to them.</P>
        <P>A wider public issue must be addressed.  Recent weeks in particular have given legs to our debate.  A number of Members referred to the commitment in the programme for Government that clearly stated that people of non-faith or minority religious backgrounds and publicly identified lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, people should not be deterred from training or taking up employment as teachers.  Religious freedom has been discussed in the context of the Constitution.  Some bodies that try to protect their ethos by ensuring that the people employed by them are sympathetic to their ethos will never employ openly gay persons.  A number of Catholic parents regard being gay as abhorrent and against Catholic teaching.  If there is a constitutional respect for the preservation of ethos, one cannot have legislation that will ensure that some schools will employ gay teachers.  I would like to say that this argument is going in the right direction.  Having heard of what has occurred, though, particularly the silencing of certain theologians, I am not convinced.  It may be going in the opposite direction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a perception in the media that every member of the Labour Party is atheistic, anti-Catholic or whatever the case may be.  I will put my views on the record.  I am what one might call an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> Catholic.  It is not wrong to be a homosexual, nor is the silencing of priests and brothers who take opposite views to the hierarchy in Rome.  Neither is it right to discriminate against an entire section of the Irish population.</P>
        <P>I agree with the sentiment of Senator Power&rsquo;s legislation.  It is equally wrong to be against religious teaching from an atheistic point of view.  I will illustrate using a personal story.  My 15 year old daughter was attending a philosophy course at a large university and was derided for having pro-Catholic views.  I am not in any way anti-Catholic, but ethos is important.  We have a choice to make.  If there is a contradiction between constitutional rights, those being, to religious expression, to earn a living and so forth, the Irish people must make a choice.  I respect the Ministers&rsquo; remarks and I agree with them that we may need more time to consider the issue.  However and as Senator Reilly stated, the current situation is depriving some of the children of this country of a right to be taught by people who hold the same sexual preference that they do.  We are not respecting gay children, given the fact that our tradition does not respect the rights of gay people.</P>
        <P>Difficult choices must be made.  If we cannot reconcile this situation, the time has come to put the issue to the people as a constitutional amendment.  If this is what it takes to do what the Government has committed to, so be it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the sentiments of respect for people&rsquo;s private lives and of promoting a culture of inclusiveness, which have been key hallmarks of this debate.  I appreciate the respect shown by both Ministers, particularly Deputy Shatter, for the fact that there are competing values.  I agree with many of Senator Hayden&rsquo;s comments.  In particular, I was struck by her account of the culture that exists in some quarters of deriding people for their religious beliefs.  This is part of the issue that we must bear in mind.  We must shape our institutions and policies in such a way that people with competing aspirations can have them reconciled as much as possible.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to change a section of legislation that allows religious education or medical institutions to take action that is reasonably necessary to prevent a prospective employee from undermining an institution&rsquo;s religious ethos.  As it stands, this legislation does not mention homosexuality in particular.  It provides a general protection.  The right currently enjoyed by religious institutions is subject to an objective test of reasonableness and necessity.  We must not allow ourselves to run away or be run away with the notion that there is a blanket right in law to engage in cruel and unjust discrimination.  When the Supreme Court considered this matter, not only did it find that the section was constitutional, but it considered submissions from the Attorney General on whether the legislation would be constitutional without it.  I am open to correction on that last point.  There is a clear issue of competing rights that must be protected.</P>
        <P>That there have been no test cases on this issue is testament to a genuine spirit of inclusivity and getting the balance right in institutions.  That people cannot point to a single injustice so far speaks volumes.  When we discussed the civil partnership legislation last year and I raised the question of whether a registrar would have the right to opt out of providing certain services as long as someone else could provide them, many Senators asked me to show them a case of a registrar having such a problem.  I was able to point to a case in England, but the fact that no mischief had arisen in Ireland was deemed to constitute a strong point against the relevance of what I was proposing.  The same applies in this instance.  We have a good record in our schools and it is important that we appreciate the fact that they are not bastions of homophobia or unjust discrimination.  Assuming otherwise does a severe disservice to the sensitivities of their patrons, managers and day-to-day administrators.</P>
        <P>In considering the balance between guarantees of equality and the right to work and earn a livelihood on the one hand and, on the other, the right to religious freedom, the Supreme Court held that there was a reasonable balance in existing legislation.  The court was clear that equality rights were not absolute.  No one&rsquo;s rights, be they to equality, freedom of expression or to run institutions according to their particular values, can ever be absolute.  There will always be competing rights.  However, a church-run school must be able to protect its ethos in the case of a teacher who, for example, might tell a class that atheism is preferable to Christianity, religion is a waste of time, all of us are nothing more than bundles of atoms devoid of moral worth, the occult is a healthy spiritual community, there is no such thing as objective truth, the unborn child is nothing more than a parasite and can be aborted accordingly, marriage discriminates against polygamists&rsquo; partners or the State and not God is the ultimate arbiter of what is right and wrong.  These values are not held universally, yet they are essential issues in a church-run school.</P>
        <P>Every Senator is united in the belief that we must have greater diversity but, in providing for such among types of schools, we must allow distinctive value systems to breed and thrive.  This is not a question of guaranteeing the cold, sterile rights being asserted by institutions that have no compassion.  This is about the values held by people who do not believe it is wrong to be a homosexual, but who may very well want to uphold a particular value of theirs, for example, the importance of marriage between men and women in the upbringing of children in society.  These people should not be treated as second class citizens or made to feel ashamed of their values.  I was encouraged by the Minister&rsquo;s comments because they reveal a sensitivity to the existence of competing values.  However, there is a danger that the legislation will strike the wrong balance in circumstances where it is not possible to show that mischief has taken place.</P>
        <P>The subculture of bullying that exists in our schools takes various forms.  Bullying can occur for a range of reasons, including perceived sexual orientation.  This is an important area in which people who have different value systems should be able to work together to ensure our schools are cold houses for bullies of any kind.  I was fortunate to attend a school which applied an iron law that came down hard on anybody who bullied or dissed people for any reason, whether sexual orientation or physiognomy.  These are the values that could be shared by schools of different kinds.</P>
        <P>It is significant that existing legislation provides a test of reasonableness and necessity and there does not exist a situation of unjust discrimination to which anybody can point.  It is important that we prepare sensible legislation.  I am open to discussing possible changes but let us not treat people as second class citizens for holding values that some would characterise as traditional but which none the less are respectful of others&rsquo; private lives.  We must not pretend they do not have the right to access education for their children according to their values.  To portray such people as bigots would be a travesty of a debate and I hope such a debate never takes place in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I followed the debate with interest.  Most, although not all, of the contributors made accurate points and the Minister made a subtle distinction between behaviour orientation and other constitutional matters.  I debated this issue with Senator Power late one night and I have do difficulty with the Bill, with the exception of the provisions in section 2 on positive discrimination.</P>
        <P>The Bill deals with the categories of single mothers, separated and divorced people and gay people.  I assume every Senator knows somebody working in a Catholic school who fits into one or other of these categories.  I certainly know of people from these categories who are working in and accepted by that structure.  I fully concur with Senator Power that gay people should not be in fear because of their sexual orientation.  Everything we do should ensure that does not happen.  The majority of speakers acknowledged that teachers should respect the ethos of the religious institutions in which they work, particularly given the role of such schools in the formation of the next generation.  I know school principals who fall into the aforementioned categories but they do not broadcast their orientation or marital status.  We should not produce legislation that would create a conflict in that regard.</P>
        <P>There is a move towards secularisation, some of which is to be welcomed, but it tends to overrun religious beliefs and sometimes conscience is set aside.  We had this argument in the context of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill but, unfortunately, that argument was not accepted.</P>
        <P>Several speakers referred to the Eileen Flynn case.  I assume that most Senators are familiar with that story through the media, which did not factually represent the circumstances of the case.  I knew Eileen Flynn well.  She was a good teacher and a lovely person.  Unfortunately she has died.  It was not the nuns who insisted on her being dismissed; it was the parents.  I do not want to discuss the circumstances of the case because she is not around to defend herself.  However, there are times when a person&rsquo;s lifestyle and behaviour is fundamental to his or her job, whether as teacher, garda or politician.  Garda&iacute; have been suspended for hitting people while playing hurling because such behaviour is regarded as incompatible with their professional responsibilities.  Similarly, teachers are role models for their pupils.  It is essential, therefore, that the legislation finely balances these distinctions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the initiative that Senator Power has taken with this Bill, which is fully endorsed by the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party.  Under the law as it stands, a school can claim that hiring a gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender teacher could undermine its religious ethos.  In 1993, the then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Justice, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan Quinn, decriminalised homosexuality.  It is important to remind Members that Fianna F&aacute;il is a party that stands for justice and equality.  Two years ago this House passed the Civil Partnership Act, which transformed the position of gay and lesbian people in Irish society.  No longer are they the butt of jokes.</P>
        <P>However, transgender individuals continue to suffer discrimination.  They are the outcasts of society and they continue to be mocked.  They were not born 100% physically male or female and over their lifetime they have had to come to terms with the fact that their sexuality is no longer what it was at birth.  My sister worked as a midwife in the Coombe hospital in the 1980s.  She once delivered a baby whose gender was not clear.  That baby was sent home to the west of Ireland without any advice to the parents from the hospital.  I have often wondered what happened to that child.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il will be taking up the issue of rights for transgender people over the coming months.  Ireland wholeheartedly welcomed gay and lesbian people and we have put the issue of homophobia behind us.  Over my years as a politician, this society has become less conservative and judgmental.  The biggest changes occurred when families found out they had gay or lesbian relatives.  It was the same with unmarried mothers, who were discriminated against.  In the 1950s and 1960s it was nearly taboo to look at an unmarried mother.  We have made significant progress and this is another step in the direction of creating a just society.  We have had a very interesting discussion today and the opinions expressed show the fascinating depth of knowledge in the Seanad.  If I dare pick out one person, I compliment Senator Hayden.  It is always a pleasure to listen to her.</P>

	<P>This has been a good debate.  I take a very simplistic approach to all this.  I believe everyone in this country is equal.  If we believe that people are equal, the law should reflect that.  It is the job of the Houses of the Oireachtas to make good laws or to reform and repeal bad laws.  That is the fundamental reason for us being legislators.  I fully accept the bona fides of my colleagues who have spoken today.  However, too frequently with successive Governments, including the previous Government, I have seen delays with caution getting in the way of progress.  There is no reason not to accept this Bill on Second Stage to allow it to go to Committee Stage.  Senator Power has put in phenomenal work and I welcome my Government colleagues&rsquo; comments in that regard.  It should be allowed to progress because there is no timeframe set on Committee Stage.  Committee Stage can be taken and some of the concerns raised by both Ministers, Deputies Shatter and Quinn, can then be addressed.  No one has said this is unconstitutional.  The Minister said there may be some constitutional issues and I accept that it is complex.  However, as legislators we need to do our job in what is not a political issue but a human rights issue.</P>
        <P>I wish to make one comment on Senator Mullen&rsquo;s contribution.  Just because a case has not been taken under section 37, that does not mean we should not act.  I do not agree with the death penalty and would not want it on the Statute Book again.  The death penalty was repealed here even though an execution had not been carried out for decades.  However, it was deemed that that law was wrong and infringed on people&rsquo;s human rights and their right to life.  In this case it is very simple.  Teachers, garda&iacute; and doctors are constantly being fobbed off by successive governments effectively with the line: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask; don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo;, which was the famous fudge used with the military in the United States.  We are a progressive Republic.  I respect those of all religions and those of none.  I respect people regardless of their sexual orientation, creed, or where they come from.</P>
        <P>It is our job to make the Seanad relevant &mdash; it is relevant.  I accept what the Minister, Deputy Shatter, said to some degree and I fully accept his bona fides and that of the Minister, Deputy Quinn.  However, there is no reason not to accept this Bill on Second Stage and allow amendments to be tabled on Committee Stage, on which there is no timescale.  I do not want this matter kicked out until early next year.  Why should teachers need to go through another school year from September waiting for action?  Senator Keane is right in saying that much progress has been made over the years &mdash; but not enough.  It is our job to pick that up.  I urge colleagues in a non-political fashion to agree the Second Stage and then we can sit down to consider the amendments required.  Every person in the State is equal and the law should reflect that.</P>

	<P>I join others in welcoming the opportunity to make a few points on the Bill, many of which have been made already.  At this stage I do not want to take from Senator Power&rsquo;s concluding comments.  I agree with our Leader on this side of the House that it is a basic question of all people in the country being equal and as such the same rights should be available to everybody.  For far too long on a range of issues we have had the approach from George Orwell&rsquo;s <i>Animal Farm</i> that all people are equal, but some are more equal than others.  Senator Power and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in introducing the Bill this evening have provided the Legislature with the ideal vehicle to begin the journey in changing this injustice.  There is a bit of &ldquo;previous&rdquo; here in terms of legislation that has been suggested from this side of the House, which has been wholeheartedly welcomed by successive speakers on the other side of the House including the line Minister and then the constitutional safety net was introduced as the reason for not progressing beyond Second Stage &mdash; the Family Home Bill comes to mind.  However, given that the Minister was able to accept Second Stage of the Debt Settlement and Mortgage Resolution Office Bill in the other House, it proves that Second Stage could be accepted here today.</P>
        <P>Many of the people sitting behind me in the Gallery, many more watching online and very many more throughout Irish society would like a clear signal notwithstanding the Minister&rsquo;s comments which have been welcomed by everybody.  The appropriate action would be to accept Second Stage and embrace what is after all the legislative process.  Committee Stage will offer all &mdash; whether it is Senator Walsh on this side, others on the other side or indeed Senator Power herself &mdash; the opportunity to propose the necessary improvements so that the law can pass.  For that reason I very much hope we will be putting the House to a vote on the issue.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators on all sides of the House for their contributions to the debate and thank the Ministers, Deputies Shatter and Quinn, for attending and giving us their views.  I reiterate the commitment I made at the start.  I had hoped we could agree on this issue as a matter of principle and finalise the text later on Committee Stage.  I still believe it would be good to send out the message that we accept the urgency of it, want the Bill to move on and can argue over language later.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>My concern is that progress should happen soon.  Since I published the Bill, many people have contacted me to inform me that it is a real issue for them every day and is making them miserable.  I made that point to the Minister and to other Members of the House over the past two months since we introduced the Bill.  It is a real issue and it is immediate.  When we initially started discussions with Members on the other side of the House I had hoped we could agree to progress this through to the next stage and that we could do that quite quickly.  I am genuinely disappointed with a delay until January 2013, because if we suspend the Bill today, it will be January before anything could happen.  As we would not have completed Second Stage we would need to restart the whole process again, which I find disappointing.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that there are differences in wording.  I again draw attention to the fact that the Bill was deliberately designed to balance different interests &mdash; the ones the Minister mentioned relating to people&rsquo;s religious rights and those of the individual to be protected.  I believe it is proportionate and fair.  There are obviously different perspectives in the House with some people wishing to delete the section altogether.  My advice is that that would be unconstitutional.  We could get into a nasty and unpleasant row about religion by taking on a broader fight and dragging lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people into it.</P>
        <P>Over the past week discussions about timeframes have changed.  We started off with a short timeframe which got progressively longer.  Each night when I went home I had to think about what was the right thing to do with the Bill because I genuinely wanted Members on all sides of the House to send out a message that we are united on this.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>I am concerned that if I pause it, nothing will happen.</P>
        <P>It is with a very heavy heart that I call a division.  I ask Members to vote on this Bill and ensure it goes through to the next Stage.  We can argue about language at that point.  We change legislation in here every day of the week; we agree in principle on Second Stage and then argue about language on Committee Stage.  I ask colleagues to please put aside party differences.  If they genuinely support the principle of this legislation, I ask them to put aside their differences and support it.  We will not bring this Bill back on Committee Stage until work has been done on the legal side and elsewhere in terms of the wording of changes and until Members on all sides of the House are happy for it to proceed.  I ask Senators to send out a message to all the groups that are here, the people who are watching at home and the people who have been in touch with me every day of the week for the last two months.  Let us send a message that we understand the urgency of this, that we understand that from April to January is too long, and that we are starting this process today.  We do not know where it will end up &mdash; we might end up with a very different wording from Senator Zappone or others on Committee Stage &mdash; but please, let us start.  I do not want to put this on pause for the next few months.  Let us send out a clear message that we are going to support this today.  I regret that I will have to put this to a vote because I was hoping we could avoid it by saying we would accept amendments on Committee Stage.  It is too important, because many people are relying on us to make a decision today.  That is why I have to put it to a vote.  I am genuinely sorry; I had hoped I would not have to.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, for coming to the House to take this Adjournment matter.  I draw to the Minister&rsquo;s attention a project which operates in County Waterford, Ballybeg community education project, which has been in place for many years.  It provides a useful and worthwhile service for many young people who live in a so-called disadvantaged area in Waterford.  It is a schools completion  programme but offers much more.  The pupils attend three and four times per week for two to three hours and avail of study support, homework assistance, tutorials for examination year students.  It also provides comprehensive youth work programmes, mentoring, career guidance and healthy lifestyle based recreation.  It is available for pupils ranging from fourth class in primary to sixth year at second level.  The programme provides an excellent service for those young people.  I pay tribute to all those associated with the project.</P>
        <P>The project is community-based and community-managed.  That has been a useful exercise and has worked well up to now.  It has received funding through the Waterford schools completion programme which has, effectively, acted as a conduit, with the money coming from the Department.  Recently there have been some changes to the project.  Those concerned are concerned at the implications for the project and the young people who avail of it.  The project is for 55 young people each year and it gives them the supports they need to remain in school.  We would all accept that is a worthwhile objective, the funding for which is &euro;60,000 per year.  While that is a large sum of money, it is a small amount considering the service provided.</P>
        <P>The Department intends to remove the autonomy from the project.  Essentially, it is trying to subsume the project into the Waterford schools completion programme.  That will result in the disappearance of the community-based element of the programme.  The reason the project has been successful is because it is community-managed and community-run and is accountable back to the community and has a community board of management who understand the needs of the young people who live in the community.  If the community element and autonomy is removed from the project, those involved would regard that as a retrograde step and ask the Government to consider it.</P>
        <P>Given that the project comes within the remit of the overall Waterford schools completion programme, there is a concern about funding because there is no guarantee the project will be funded post September 2012.  That is a matter of major concern to those who manage the project and the community individuals involved in helping to run the project and also the young people who have availed of its services.  A presentation was given in the audio-visual room by those who manage the project and the community board of management.  They spoke of the success of the project, how young people in the community have benefited and of the cost, both socially and economically, of removing the funding of such a project which would be immense.  They are asking for two things, first, that the current status, in terms of the community-based element and project autonomy, remains and, second, for some certainty about their funding.  They want to provide the service and continue with the successful programme that was put in place.  That is obviously desirable both for the community and those who benefit from the programme.</P>
        <P>I have spoken to many young people who have come through the programme and have benefited.  They have gone on to do good work in their community, get jobs and have been successful but they would not have had the opportunity to do so were that programme not in place.  It is a form of school completion programme and provides extended services beyond what the national school completion programme provides.  It is a different type of project to that although somewhat similar.  That is why the people concerned want to keep its autonomy, keep its difference and uniqueness going and have security about the funding so that they can continue.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to relate these points to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and ask her to communicate directly with the project to ensure there is a satisfactory outcome for all involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.  I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.</P>
        <P>Senator Cullinane has had a long involvement with community services in Waterford and I listened carefully to what he had to say.  I am therefore pleased to take this opportunity to update the Seanad on the work of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to address educational disadvantage and the provision made for the Ballybeg community education project under the school completion programme, or as it is known generally, the SCP.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the valuable work of Ballybeg community education project.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs recognises the contribution of the project to improving educational outcomes for children at risk of educational disadvantage.  The project delivers community-based after-school support to primary and post-primary students.  In this respect it shares much in common with other SCP projects, including its holistic educational objectives, a local management structure and a child-centred approach to addressing local needs.  It is for these reasons the Department is working to ensure that the services provided can be further consolidated and enhanced within the SCP, under the DEIS framework.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to supporting the educational attainment of children and young people from disadvantaged communities through a variety of formal and informal educational support services.  The Department&rsquo;s recently published statement of strategy defines its vision, values and objectives and explains how it will lead the effort to improve outcomes for children and young people.  In this regard the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is working strategically to co-ordinate and consolidate its programmes, maximise efficiencies and ensure it works from an evidence base in the interests of children and young people.  This involves examining existing services within communities to maximise synergies and efficiencies while, at the same time, minimising the potential for overlap among services which have, in essence, the same objectives.</P>
        <P>It is in this context that officials have communicated the requirement to achieve a greater level of local service integration to a range of local projects funded under the SCP, including those in Waterford city.  Similarly, officials of the Department have also recently met with the providers of services under the special projects for youth scheme, or SPY, in Waterford.  Providers were encouraged to examine their provision of services to ensure the optimum use of the available resources.</P>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, the comprehensive expenditure report identified the requirement for savings of 6.5% per annum over the period 2012-14 in the SCP.  As a first step towards identifying efficiencies and other necessary reforms, the Department is working with the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, and the Department of Education and Skills to complete a review of the programme this year.  This review will enhance the process of integrating all SCP initiatives.  I apologise, there are so many acronyms for a broad range of items in this script.  It is extraordinary how they are invented.</P>
        <P>I return to the point I was making.  This review will enhance the process of integrating all SCP initiatives within a national approach to attendance, participation and retention under the board&rsquo;s remit.  In the present financial climate it is therefore not feasible to ring-fence funding or insulate any project from the necessary reforms.  However, it is not expected that there will be any significant adjustments to the programme this year, beyond those measures already communicated to projects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NEWB is responsible for the operational management, development and direction of the SCP, along with the educational welfare and home-school-community liaison services.  As part of this work the board is assisting projects to enhance the planning, targeting and co-ordination of services.  I understand the NEWB has been in contact with projects in Waterford in this regard.  The objective is to consolidate the work of local programmes and ensure that evidence-based services can continue into the future on a sustainable basis.  Officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs have been in contact with the local co-ordinator in Ballybeg and arrangements have been made to meet the project&rsquo;s local management in the coming week.  The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has requested the chief executive officer of the NEWB - I apologise, this is a serious issue and I would not like anybody to take it that I am not taking it seriously but if I confront another set of initials for an organisation I will probably collapse. They should spell out what they are talking about. </P>
        
        <P>The Minister has requested the CEO of the NEWB to engage with this process to ensure a positive outcome is achieved through a structured and co-ordinated interaction.  She looks forward to developments in this regard.  I appreciate that Senator Cullinane&rsquo;s concerns in regard to this issue are serious.  I will draw to the attention of the Minister the specific comments he made in the Seanad today.  In so far as he has concerns about the continuation of the project, I will ensure she communicates with the Senator in that regard.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Shatter, for taking this Adjournment debate and for expressing his support and his intention to bring the information I provided back to the relevant Minister.  Of course,  in the current climate it is difficult to be asked to ring-fence funding or insulate any project but as the Minister noted, this is a serious issue.  This project is providing a very worthwhile service and we have to look at the cost of removing funding from projects of this kind.  If the project ceases to exist where do these young people go to get the service they have been getting up to now?</P>
        <P>I welcome that the Department has been in contact with the local project co-ordinator and that a meeting will take place in the coming week.  I hope this will amount to a good outcome for all involved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending.  I raise a very important issue concerning which I am not sure the Department is fully apprised.  The balanced patronage of our schools is a topical issue and was discussed in some detail in the Seanad yesterday.  It is also an emotive issue.  Equally important is the right of all parents to send their children to a school of their choice.  As important, and above all of that, is the need to ensure there are sufficient places for children in our primary school system.  We have had too many disasters throughout the years where there was a lack of places, including in my constituency, County Meath.  Six years ago there was the so-called Laytown schools crisis and I swore that I never wanted to see the likes of that again.  However, I fear it is happening in Ashbourne.  I wrote about this situation to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, more than a month ago but he has not replied.  I pointed out that I was only writing such a letter because of the seriousness of the situation.  I have raised this matter on the Adjournment because I received no reply to my letter.</P>
        <P>An issue has arisen in recent weeks in the town of Ashbourne where 120 parents came together at a public meeting.  Most of these parents have no place for their child to begin primary school next September.  Most of the parents at that meeting were campaigning for a place in a school with a Catholic ethos but there did not seem to be places in any school.  It is a case of more questions than answers.  They want to know will there be places for their children to begin school next September and will they be educated in a school with a Catholic ethos.</P>
        <P>Up to now, Ashbourne had two mainstream Catholic schools and a Catholic gaelscoil.  One would have thought the addition of an Educate Together and a multi-denominational gaelscoil would be the answer to the issues of school places and of diversity.  However, this has not proved to be the case, according to parents.  The reality is that a major flaw in the Department&rsquo;s approach to this issue is that no surveys have been conducted to ascertain the preferences of parents for the type of education they want.  No information has been given to parents as to how the Department of Education and Skills decides the number of places required in the primary school system year on year.</P>
        <P>I understand one of the Catholic schools applied to expand to allow children attend the school of choice but this expansion was refused by the Department.  I understand some of the other schools are not happy with this expansion but it would have solved the problem and in my view, it would not have impacted on either of the two new schools proposed for Ashbourne this year.</P>
        <P>I understand from media reports that the Minister has refused to meet Oireachtas Members from County Meath, including myself.  However, this news has not been communicated to me in writing.  I have had no response to correspondence from the Minister on what I regard as a very serious issue.  I was heavily involved in the Laytown schools crisis and I criticised my own Government at the time in order to have the issue resolved.  Therefore, when I raise a similar issue, I think it should be taken seriously in the Department because I would not raise it if I did not regard it as a serious issue.</P>
        <P>It is a poor decision by the Minister not to meet local Oireachtas Members as it flies in the face of openness and transparency.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm the Department&rsquo;s plans to deal with the issue of children without school places.  I ask him to inform the House about the Department&rsquo;s policy on the ethos of schools it funds.  I ask if any research has been undertaken with regard to the policy so that there is an informed choice.  It is wholly unfair to force parents to send children to schools with an ethos to which they do not subscribe.  Parental choice and parental support for new school patronage schemes are absolutely necessary in any new system.</P>
        <P>As regards Catholic education, it should be noted that the increase in the Catholic population of County Meath in the period from the 2006 census to the 2011 census, is twice the overall figure for those with no religion.  We should not overlook the majority when it comes to a question of choice.  The Government is proposing to establish an Educate Together school and a multi-denominational gaelscoil in Ashbourne and this is to be welcomed.  However, there seems to be a substantial cohort of parents, enough to make up one or two classes, who want a Catholic education for their children and this is being denied to them.  In my view, this goes against the spirit of choice and diversity and respect for each and every child.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding school provision in Ashbourne.</P>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, in June of last year the Minister announced that 20 new primary schools and 20 new post-primary schools would be established over the next few years to meet our increased demographics.  Of these new schools, two primary schools were to be established in Ashbourne, one in 2011 and another in 2012 and one post-primary school was to be established in Ashbourne in 2014.  The need for additional primary school provision in Ashbourne was identified through detailed analysis earned out by the forward planning section of the Department, using both enrolment data and the demographic trends in the area.</P>
        <P>Prior to September 2011, there were three primary schools in Ashbourne town, all under Catholic patronage.  During 2010 and 2011, the Department had been examining the question of increasing the number of primary school places in Ashbourne to cater for the expected increase in enrolments.  As part of that consideration the Department consulted with the patron of the three Catholic schools regarding extending the capacity of those schools.  The patron indicated that following local consultation in Ashbourne the consensus was that the parish should not be involved in further primary school provision in the area.</P>
        <P>The Department then put in place an application and patron selection process for the establishment of new schools to cater for increasing demographics in Ashbourne.  Applications for patronage of the new schools were received from An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta and from Educate Together, both of which are well established national patron bodies.  Following consideration of these applications, approval was given for the commencement of a new gaelscoil which opened in September 2011 and a new Educate Together school which will open in September 2012.  Both patron bodies proposed to establish multi-denominational schools in response to parental wishes.  Given that all existing schools in the town were Catholic in ethos, the provision of multi-denominational schools would increase diversity and parental choice in the area and approval was given for the establishment of these new schools on that basis.  With the commencement of the two new primary schools in Ashbourne, there will be capacity for at least seven junior infant classes across the five schools in Ashbourne for September 2012.  Five of these junior infant classes will be provided in schools with a Catholic ethos and at least two will be provided in schools with a multi-denominational ethos.  Apart from significantly increased capacity in the local primary schools, the parents in Ashbourne now have greater choice than ever before in the range of primary schools available to them for their children.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State has thrown a spanner in the works as regards the situation in Ashbourne.  His response will probably cause fear in Ashbourne.  At least seven streams of junior infants classes are required and the Minister of State says that at least two will be provided in schools with a multi-denominational ethos.  People had understood there were at least two streams in one of the multi-denominational schools and there is also a multi-denominational gaelscoil.  This response will sow complete confusion among parents and it is unacceptable.  It illustrates my point that the Department does not seem to know what it is doing.  The Minister of State has not answered my question as to whether there are sufficient places in Ashbourne.  In fact, he has cast doubt on whether there will be sufficient places and he has not provided any information as to how it was decided that parental choice would be expressed in the provision of these two schools.  In my opinion, the Educate Together and multi-denominational school are required because there will be a demand for such schools and this is also the case with regard to the multi-denominational gaelscoil.  However, there is no doubt there is a demand for more Catholic education but the reply does not deal with this fact.  I ask if the Department knows what it is doing with regard to Ashbourne.</P>
        <P>I advised the Minister in writing one month ago that he should take this situation very seriously or he would have another Laytown on his hands.  It does not seem to me that he is taking it seriously.  I do not want to have children without school places in September and this situation needs to be clarified as soon as possible by means of a public statement from the Minister.</P>

	<P>The Senator seeks clarification regarding the statement which I read on behalf of the Minister.  Is it the case that seven junior infants classes will not sufficiently cater for the group of young children entering primary school for the first time in Ashbourne this year?  Is it the case that there will be a requirement for more than seven junior infants classes?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not convinced that the research has been done to make that absolutely certain.  I attended a meeting of 120 parents and most of them did not have a place for their child for this September.  We were informed by the representative of Educate Together who is doing great work and who also attended the meeting that they had allocated 30 places and they expected to open another classroom.  My point is that nobody had any certainty nor does the reply read by the Minister of State provide certainty.  I do not know the exact number of places required but it seems neither does the Department and this is worrying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department uses existing enrolment and the demographic data gained through the GIS system using DSP records.  This will show the number of children of varying ages from zero to school-going age.  The Department uses this data to plan for primary school provision and also for post-primary provision in the area.  I can only conclude that the Department has used that data to determine what is sufficient capacity in junior infants classes across Ashbourne next September and that it will have apportioned those places across the whole school-going population in order to serve the needs of those who wish to attend schools with a Catholic ethos and those who wish to attend schools with a multi-denominational ethos.  If the Senator is saying that in his opinion more children will turn up than can be accommodated in the seven infant classes last year, I am willing to take on board that concern on his behalf and seek clarification from the forward planning unit.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State should not forget the second issue, that of patronage, which is very important for many parents.</P>
