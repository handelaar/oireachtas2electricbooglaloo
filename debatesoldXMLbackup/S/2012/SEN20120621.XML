	<P>There is a lot of map reading going on.  I have notice from Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to clarify if, during the development of the Corrib gas field and other fields off the west coast, environmental impact studies had taken account of the possibility of seismic activity such as occurred off the coast of Mayo recently; if this was taken into consideration in planning the pipeline and ancillary developments; and if there is any intention to carry out such a study.</P>
        <P LI="1">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to confirm when he will give approval to Donegal County Council to seek tenders for the construction of the Gweedore sewerage scheme in County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Cathaoirleach mentioned there is a lot of map reading going on this morning.  I commend the Constituency Commission on its work but we cannot forget that it leads to a reduction in representation.  I welcome the reunification of Swords and the correction of a number of anomalies in the system.  Later, we will debate the Gaeltacht Bill, which represents another diminution of democracy with the removal of the rights of people in Gaeltacht areas to elect their representatives to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  My party will oppose it at every Stage.</P>
        <P>I raised the issue of the pyrite report two weeks ago and the Leader gave me a response.  The report was due at the end of March, then the end of May and has still not been published today, the longest day of the year, 21 June.  As I mentioned on numerous occasions, over 70,000 houses on the east coast are potentially affected by this scourge.  I have visited houses that are unsafe for people to live in.  People have no recourse to insurance companies and there is no action from the Government.  I ask the Leader for a broad debate on the environment portfolio with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  Such a debate could encompass this point.  I seek a commitment that the report will be made public before the summer recess.  People cannot wait any longer.  The Statute of Limitations is six years.  The more there are delays with action on the pyrite issue, the more thousands of people will become statute-barred and will be unable to take cases and legal challenges.  The average cost of remediating a standard house is in the region of &euro;30,000.  Action is urgently needed.  I call on the Leader to inquire of the Minister of the Environment, Community and Local Government and to seek a commitment that this report will be published well in advance of the recess, due on 19 July.  It is too important for feet-dragging.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on policing.  I have stated on the record of the House that the Government has received a report from its consultants, PricewaterhouseCoopers.  The report proposes the closure or downgrading of more than 400 Garda stations.  People are only finding out on a drip-drip basis which stations are to be closed or restricted.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has stated he will introduce another list.  If anything, the job of the Government is to safeguard its citizens.  The reduction in the number of Garda stations throughout the country is not something we support.  We need a broad debate in the House with the Minister for Justice and Equality on the Government&rsquo;s plans for policing in rural and urban areas.  I realise we have a busy schedule between now and the recess but I call on the Leader to try, if possible, to ask about the Government&rsquo;s plans.  Will the Government continue to announce these closures on a staged basis, and announce the closure of 40 stations this month, 40 the next month and a further 40 the following month, or will it produce a full list and let people have advance knowledge of what is taking place, that is to say, that the Government is proceeding with the closure and downgrading of more than 400 Garda stations?  I call on the Leader to arrange, at the earliest possible opportunity, for the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to come to the House for a broad debate on the issue.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join other colleagues from yesterday who called for a debate on children&rsquo;s rights in light of the report, which has generated a great deal of controversy and discussion, on the deaths of children in care who were known to the HSE.  Some 196 children died in the course of a decade.  Senators van Turnhout, O&rsquo;Keeffe and others stated yesterday that it is imperative we debate the report and the measures that must be taken to ensure these appalling deaths can be prevented in future.  One of the issues debated was the need for a promised new body to take over responsibility for children.  There has been a concern that the HSE has been too fragmented at one level but not sufficiently close to the issues at another level and this has been part of the problem as well.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the Leader has indicated that he will get the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs into the House to debate children&rsquo;s rights generally in the context of the report.  It is imperative that we hold the debate before the end of the session.  The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill is before us today on Report and Final Stages.  The Bill started in the Seanad and it is one of several important measures taken by the Government to protect children&rsquo;s rights.  A more comprehensive debate in this area is important and is certainly of more direct importance to the lives of ordinary people than the debate on Seanad reform and all the heat that it generated yesterday.  We need to examine this issue, especially since we are facing a children&rsquo;s rights referendum in the autumn.</P>
        <P>I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on a report published today by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I and other colleagues in the House are members.  The report is on hearings on the heads of the mediation Bill.  The committee heard some interesting and important contributions.  Like so many other justice Bills, the mediation Bill will be started in the Seanad but it might be worth our debating the observations made by the justice committee.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien made some remarks on policing.  It is worth noting that the justice committee has set up a sub-committee on policing which, I hope, will report later this year.  We might hold a debate on policing when that report comes out to examine the recommendations made by the sub-committee.</P>
        <P>Today is not the best day to be a cyclist.  I know this because I cycled here in the rain but I urge colleagues to take up cycling during Bike Week 2012.  I will e-mail all Deputies and Senators today to invite them to take part in an all-party Oireachtas cycling group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Probably one of the most important reports to be published is that of Geoffrey Shannon on the rights of children in care.  I am not unique as many in the House have raised individual questions and questions on the general picture during the past several sessions of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. Shannon and his colleagues have joined up the lines and they have shown a systematic violation of the human rights of very vulnerable children who have been exposed to difficulties in their family situations.  It is not an easy situation to address and I do not believe that we should necessarily point the finger at particular case workers.  That would be unfair.  They are over-stressed and the whole area of children has been under-financed and under-resourced.</P>
        <P>My concern is that the costings for this exercise, if we are to fully implement the recommendations, would amount to &euro;20 million and given the economic situation I do not foresee that materialising.  I see it fizzling out once again just as the financing of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> legislation for which this House was responsible, to a certain extent fizzled out through lack of resourcing.  Perhaps the Leader will convey our concern that the report will not simply be shelved like so many reports but that it will be acted upon.</P>
        <P>This is an area where the House plays a significant and important role.  We have the opportunity, the time and the lack of partisanship whereby we can debate these issues in the interests of the most vulnerable sections of our society, unlike the other House which is charged with more directly political matters.  This is yet another argument for the continuation of the House, as was the very honourable exercise of conscience by three Members who voted against the Whip.  That was highly unusual and I salute those people who had such courage.  I hope they will not be severely disciplined for it.  During the debate yesterday it was interesting to hear people on both sides suggest that in Seanad &Eacute;ireann there should be a lack of or at least a relaxing of the Whip in order that people could vote on conscience.  In many instances people would vote against what I might see as the right thing to do but I have this right and I would like to see it extended to my party colleagues.</P>
        <P>I support the remarks of Senator O&rsquo;Brien on the pyrite situation.  I am aware of situations where people were sold local authority houses under the affordable housing scheme.  They then discovered that the houses were not properly examined to determine if they were safe and now we know they are not safe.  Do these people have any recourse?  The local authorities seem to be washing their hands of this issue and it is completely and absolutely wrong.</P>
        <P>Finally, I strongly support the remarks of Senator O&rsquo;Brien on the closure of Garda stations.  The community should be involved and the truth should be told.  In my area we were deliberately lied to.  We were told that Fitzgibbon Street Garda station was being closed for refurbishment.  That was not true.  We took action as a united community and now at least we have a vestigial presence there and we are going to push to have proper policing in our area because it is so significant in these difficult times.  This has been highlighted by the tragic situation where a young boy in a very pleasant County Wicklow town had four of his fingers blown off by picking up a bomb.  This was a five year old child whose mother was behind him with another child in her arms.  He picked up a pipe bomb and had five fingers blown off.  That is intolerable.  We need proper policing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been rather stunned to read in <i>The Irish Times </i>of the cases of children and young people who died in State care of non-natural causes between 2000 and 2010.  A 12 year old girl died in 2008, a 15 year old girl died in 2000, a 16 year old boy died in 2003, a baby girl died in 2008, a 17 month old boy died in 2003, an 18 year old died in 2002 and a 17 year old male died in 2009.  These are only some of the cases.  This shows clearly that children in the care of the State have not been safe in our country.  Obviously, they were not safe in their families or homes or they would not have been in care in the first place.  We must put our full weight behind the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the programme of reforms she has started.  Early intervention and appropriate care must be given to children in vulnerable families who need our care.  Above all, I ask the Leader to ask the Government to expedite as quickly as possible the children&rsquo;s rights referendum, which will allow for the first time ever that children in care from families where the parents have been married can be adopted.  This is huge.  It has never happened in this State before.  It has always been controversial but, clearly, where families cannot take care of their children, why should the children languish in State care if there are families out there who wish to adopt them?  Bring on the children&rsquo;s rights referendum as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>On 10 June the Kernel Capital group, which manages seed capital and venture capital funds for investment in emerging Irish companies, published an open letter in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the presidents of all the Irish universities and institutes of technology.  The open letter has brought much-needed national focus on the need for graduate programmes in our third level colleges focused on international sales.</P>
        <P>We have all heard a lot about research, development and innovation that will create and deliver the products we need as a trading nation but all of that counts for nothing if we cannot sell the products.  Sales are the engines of growth.  To be a major export nation we need to be world class at selling our technology and innovations, yet, relative to the availability of scientists, engineers, barristers, finance experts, legal experts, venture capitalists and other professionals, our innovation-led companies have a critical shortage of world class internationally focused sales expertise.  While there are a multitude of marketing programmes and marketing degrees, there are no degrees focused on international sales.  Indeed, there is an attitude of mind very prevalent, and which I personally experienced in developing L&iacute;r Chocolates, that selling was somehow beneath the status of the marketing graduate.</P>
        <P>I commend Kernel Capital on taking the initiative in the national interest in campaigning for international sales specialisation in our third level sector.  I ask that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, would come to the House to respond to this proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues who are reflecting in a very rueful fashion on the publication of the report into the child care scandal and the very grave cases which have now been highlighted.  We must all work with the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to ensure that whatever legislation, management systems and reviews are required will not just be reflected upon but acted upon in the very near future.  As a country, we are quick to reflect and sometimes deflect anger to others but this report and all its horrors must be like a mirror to the soul of the nation.  We must ask ourselves what priorities we have in this country and what sort of management systems and structures we have in place that would allow so many children to be not just marginalised, but to have their lives almost ruined and in some cases to allow children to die.</P>
        <P>I suggest that if this was the church rather than the State, we would be having a march already.  We have to respond with the same strength, anger and sense of purpose that we have in regard to the abuses in the church.  The State is not on trial; the State is guilty.  We all have a duty to respond and to ensure that the lives of the children and future children of this country will not be blighted in the way so many children&rsquo;s lives have been blighted in past generations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The good news is that last night the Construction Contracts Bill passed through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I mention this as it is a Bill that was initiated in the Seanad over two years ago.  It now goes to the Select Sub-Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform.  Although that is not our baby, anything we can do in the next couple of weeks to get that Bill into that sub-committee and then passed so it can come back to the Seanad and become law should be done.</P>
        <P>This is a Bill to protect subcontractors from some of the business dealings that have been going on over the years.  It is essential we get it passed as it has taken over two years to get this far.  We can get it passed in the next few weeks but, as there are only five weeks of the session to go, I ask the Leader and the Cathaoirleach to do all they can to encourage the passage of that Bill through the Select Sub-Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform in order that it comes back to this House before the session finishes.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White has just raised a topic that is worthy of consideration.  A lot of university time is spent on various subjects but not the subject of actually bringing something to sale, particularly technology and innovation at international level.  There is a need to do that and I support wholeheartedly the words of Senator White.  It seems there is still a tradition in the universities of aiming at some of the softer, more traditional subjects, whereas bringing something to the point of sale is critical.  It is amazing the number of times it happens in business that a product is marketed but nobody is asked to buy it in the end.  That is the process we need if we are to succeed in the years ahead.  We can succeed and the topic Senator White has introduced is one I would love to see brought to the fore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Senators who have raised the issue of children in care.  I have every confidence in the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, who has been very proactive in the first Department dealing with children&rsquo;s affairs.  She has a background in social care and working with children so this is in good hands and we look forward to seeing the issues dealt with.  Hopefully, this will never happen again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to raise the issue of participatory budgeting.  Will the Leader ask the two Ministers involved, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, to introduce, as a pilot project initially, a programme of participatory budgeting?  This is where the citizens themselves decide at local level their priorities for the funding of their areas, including local authority areas.  Having started off in Brazil, this has mushroomed in many countries in Europe and is now used in France, Italy, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and other countries.  It is not in every municipality in those countries but is in many.  I would like to see it start as a pilot project in one or two areas.  In light of the fact local government will be raising money through property tax and water tax, it would bring transparency for the people and a right to have a decision as to where their money is spent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At present, too much decision making is at executive level in local authorities.  I would like to see this introduced as part of the reform of local government which the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is bringing forward.  Included in that reform, I ask that we would look at participatory budgeting.  Fine Gael has raised this before and I hope it can be implemented, particularly given the fact local government will be raising money.  It would bring transparency and prioritise what local people want.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>WB Yeats said this is no country for old men.  At present, it does not seem to be a country for young men, young women or young families either.  I call on the Leader to make time available as soon as possible for a discussion on youth unemployment, as I have done previously although it has not yet happened.  Youth unemployment is currently running at approximately 30% in this State and, realistically, that figure would be a lot higher if it was not for the thousands of young people who are emigrating every year.</P>
        <P>This cannot be lumped in with a general discussion on jobs with the Minister.</P>
        <P>It is an issue that will have huge repercussions for the future.  If we do not deal with it, it will have a boomerang effect, economically, socially and politically.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The Government&rsquo;s jobs plan document mentions youth only twice.  It is clear that we need some new ideas on the issue, so I would like the Seanad to discuss this matter as soon as possible.  It is something that the EU in particular tells us it is focused upon, but no concrete action has happened to date.  Four months since the arrival of the youth action team from the European Commission we have not seen any concrete plans forthcoming.  Next week in the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe we will be discussing a report on the implications of the financial crisis on the young generation.  One of the report&rsquo;s recommendations is to ensure that youth policies are put high on the political agenda and receive adequate funding.  This House should discuss this topic as soon as possible.  Some 70,000 young people are currently finishing their leaving certificate exams, which is the same number who are emigrating every year, so it would be timely to discuss the situation facing them and the 30% of young people who are currently unemployed.</P>
        <P>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business on which Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh will elaborate.  The amendment calls for the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, to attend the House to discuss the current situation that is unfolding around the State with regard to turf cutting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for Justice and Equality on the publication of the heads of the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill.  It is a novel and worthwhile idea to lay out the Bill&rsquo;s general scheme before detailed drafting of the legislation.  It will go to the justice committee and other interested parties, including I hope this House.  The legislation takes on board the important recommendations of the Mahon tribunal report.  We could have a useful debate on it here at an opportune moment, perhaps even before the justice committee has concluded its consideration of the Bill.  We are all aware, anecdotally at least, of the way in which money was sloshing around and how public officials and others succumbed.  I am referring to developer-led projects in provincial towns where managers may only have been thinking in terms of increased rates.  Towns were crucified as a result and have suffered so badly all over the place.</P>
        <P>We could have a useful consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government as to how he is treating recommendations contained in the report  and how they could affect local authorities.  I ask the Leader to arrange for such a debate at a suitable juncture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Is mian liom tagairt a dh&eacute;anamh i dtaobh an Bille Gaeltachta a bheidh os comhair an T&iacute; um tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.  Bille f&iacute;or th&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo a bhaineann le st&aacute;das na Gaeilge, chan amh&aacute;in sa Ghaeltacht ach taobh amuigh di fosta.</P>
        <P>The Second Stage of the Gaeltacht Bill 2012 is before the House later today.  It deeply disappointments me, however, that the scheduling of this House gives little opportunity for any of the Irish language organisations, or people in Gaeltacht areas, to make their views known to Members of the Oireachtas before Committee Stage next Tuesday.  Members of this House only have from 6 p.m. today until 11 a.m. tomorrow to table amendments to the legislation.  That time is insufficient so I am calling for Committee Stage to be put back by at least two weeks to allow us to scrutinise the Bill and reflect on what the Minister has to say.  He may or may not provide reassurances, but democracy should at least prevail.  If the Leader indicates that the Minister is unwilling to do that, I will be tabling an amendment to the Order of Business.</P>

T&aacute; an Bille le pl&eacute; tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na inniu, t&aacute; na leasuithe Coiste le bheith istigh maidin am&aacute;rach agus t&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite linn go bpl&eacute;ifear C&eacute;im an Choiste agus C&eacute;im na Tuarasc&aacute;la an tseachtain seo chugainn agus go mbeidh gach rud socraithe.  N&iacute;l sin inghlactha.  T&aacute; g&aacute; le n&iacute;os m&oacute; ama a thabhairt le pl&eacute; ioml&aacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh ar an mBille seo.</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom tac&uacute; leis an leas&uacute; at&aacute; molta ag mo chomhleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir Kathryn Reilly ar an Riar Gn&oacute;.  I would like to second the proposal to amend the Order of Business.  We have had an absolute debacle overnight in Clonmoylan in County Galway where there has been a stand-off between garda&iacute; and turf cutters.  I call on the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, to attend this House if he can take time out from his charity walks, book launches and writing his memoirs.  He should debate the really serious issue of turf cutting that is currently unfolding.  The Minister made promises during a Private Members&rsquo; Bill debate that he would act in a much more equitable fashion.  Apparently, however, he could not keep those promises in Europe and they have since been renegued upon.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorOClochartaigh"><NameTxt>Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important for the Minister to come here today to clarify what exactly he will do to resolve this serious issue.  We want the turf cutters&rsquo; rights upheld so that they can continue to cut turf in their own areas, as they have done traditionally.  They are not interested in moving to different bogs, nor do they want compensation.  They want to continue cutting turf in their home areas, as they have done traditionally.  They need to be able to do so now that their incomes have diminished and the cost of living is increasing.  It is appalling the way in which the State has dealt with this issue.  We seem to have plenty of garda&iacute; to send to peaceful protests and on to bogs, but when it comes to looking after older people in their homes or having community garda&iacute; on the streets, they do not seem to be available.  It is disgraceful.</P>

	<P>I welcome this morning&rsquo;s report from the Irish universities&rsquo; nutrition alliance.  This week we had hearings by the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on cancer and heard calls for changes in our lifestyles, including the way we eat and drink.  The IUNA report found that 23% of children aged two to four years, are now obese.  This is a serious problem.  While we have started this good work with the Seanad Public Consultation Committee&rsquo;s hearing this week, we should continue to put pressure on and keep the matter before this House.  We must not lose the momentum that we built up on Tuesday.  The hearings earlier this week show that this House is working well and in an open manner.  The report containing these figures was funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in conjunction with the Department of Health.  We should keep this joined-up thinking between Departments to the fore as we continue our work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to join with my colleague from County Leitrim, Senator Comiskey, in welcoming the recommendations of the constituency commission, in that Leitrim has been reunited politically.  I sat on the Government benches, where Senator Comiskey is now, when the previous constituency commission report was debated in this House.  During the debate on the previous constituency commission report, I made it clear that if given a free vote I would not support its recommendations because of the shabby treatment of Leitrim by successive Administrations during the past 40 or 50 years.  I welcome that this wrong has been corrected.  We already have a Deputy in the constituency.  It was more a quirk of the electoral system than anything else.  The county has now been reunited politically and this should give the people of Leitrim great confidence going forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, to take action on the recently published report on large-scale obesity among young people, which is proving to be a matter of great national concern.  The report makes for stark reading.  Its conclusions are that children as young as three and four years are grossly overweight.  While the State does not have any direct involvement in ensuring that parents act responsibly when it comes to providing proper nutrition for their children it does have a role to play in the area of soft drink and crisp manufacturing, the manufacturers of which have managed to ingratiate themselves with school authorities across the country in a variety of different guises by way of promotion of their goods as a healthy option.  As stated in the report to which I am referring they are not a healthy option.</P>
        <P>The Minister should do all he can to encourage schools and, by extension, parents to take a more responsible attitude to their children&rsquo;s nutrition.  Those of us who are parents will know that it is easy to say we should ensure children eat proper food.  However, children have their own way of consuming food.  They tend to opt for the worst possible options rather than the best ones.  I am not for one moment simplifying this issue but I do believe the State &mdash; I am sure the Leader will agree with me &mdash; should play a role in this regard.  I would hate to see this report gathering dust on a shelf.  It is not the first on this issue but it is the latest, which points for the first time to the fact that this problem in not so much one among teenagers and adolescents but among children of a very young age.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Leader raise this issue with the Minister for Education and Skills given the direct involvement of schools on this issue.  If the Minister is willing to attend the House, the Leader might consider providing for a wide ranging debate on healthy eating and living.  I accept this may not be relevant to only the Minister for Education and Skills but could also come under the auspices of the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall.  The Leader will understand the point I am trying to make.  I second the proposed amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>With regard to An Bille Gaeltacht 2012, while the Seanad agenda and availability of the Minister may dictate that it be taken next week, I believe it would be reasonable that people are given an opportunity to review it.  I am not trying to be controversial but I would welcome if that could be facilitated.</P>
        <P>The report into the death of children in the child protection agency is appalling.  However, I am comforted by the statement by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, that money will be made available to progress the report&rsquo;s findings and to ensure what happened in the past in the child protection agency never occurs in this State again.  The report on obesity puts on paper the problem of obesity in our society, of which we are all aware.  This is a delicate issue to address with children given the enormous psychological implications for parents of coming down hard on their children in terms of what they are eating.  It is a complex area.  I believe there is a need for a public awareness campaign to educate parents on this issue.  It is tantamount to child abuse when a child of one or two years is overweight.  We need to educate society on this issue.  A child&rsquo;s relationship with food is developed by the time he or she reaches, six, seven or eight years of age.  I join with other Senators in calling for a fulsome debate on healthy living.  On a wider level, we need this to be something the Government is pushing hard with schools, youth organisations and organisations which educate parents.</P>

Perhaps the Leader will tell us the Senators who have been invited to defend this House.  I express the hope that this does not set a precedent.  Also, perhaps a group seeking to abolish D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann might be facilitated in the D&aacute;il Chamber for the purpose of putting forward such views.</P>

	<P>For all my criticism of Sinn F&eacute;in, there is one voice of reason among them, namely Senator Reilly, whose call for a full debate on the serious problem of youth employment I support.

	<P>I second Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  I again call for a debate on mortgage arrears.  Reports in today&rsquo;s newspapers state that the banks have been given the go ahead by the Central Bank to offer split mortgages to people in distress.  To take the good out of it, it seems an additional interest rate will be applied to the warehoused part of the mortgage.  It is almost a year since the Family Home Bill 2011 came before the House.  Other Bills have come before the other House, and all of these were suppressed by the Government.  What we need is a Government-led solution.  A bank-led solution will always look after the bottom line first.  We need something that puts the people of Ireland front and centre and this is not happening as we have seen in the reports in today&rsquo;s newspapers on the split mortgage idea.  I call for a debate on this.  We also need action.  There has been much commentary on the Order of Business and in other debates in the past year.  I would like to see some tangible results with a Government-led initiative rather than one led by the banks.  When this debate takes place it is my ardent wish that the Government Members will be permitted to participate in it.</P>

	<P>I wish to refer to the unfortunate stand-off at Cloonmoylan bog.  It saddens me very much that the situation has arisen.  As previous speakers have stated, the rule of law must be upheld.  It is unfortunate that a political football is being made of this issue by a particular Deputy.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>In my view the particular Deputy is very seriously misleading people.  He would want to reflect on whether serious financial consequences could arise for any farmers involved in breaking the law if it were to impact on their farm payments.  This must be considered by everybody.  While we do not like the EU directive, it is in place and the country stands to be fined &euro;25,000 per day.  We have a responsibility to uphold the rule of law.  A few months ago there was a window of opportunity for some negotiated concessions from Europe on the issue as initiated by the Minister, Deputy Deenihan.  However, the opportunity was not taken and people were badly advised not to go along with the proposals put forward by the Minister.  We are in a most unfortunate situation.  People feel passionately about cutting turf and their right to do so.  We must try to balance this with upholding the rule of law.  The previous Government had 14 years to sort out the issue but it did nothing about it.  It was left to the incoming Government to do so.  Now we are feeling the flak because of what is happening.  I would like to see a cooling-off period in which everybody withdraws from Cloonmoylan bog and we consider whether negotiations on the concessions discussed by the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, can be re-opened.  I hope the rule of law will be upheld, the Garda will be supported, common sense will prevail and no serious injuries or damage is caused.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader consider rolling debates on the economic situation?  This morning, I was alarmed to see an economist is predicting Ireland will slip back into recession.  Any reasonable person would conclude that we are facing stagnation in the medium term.  When the crisis broke there was much identification of the procyclical policies which gave rise to the depth of the economic crisis, such as tax incentives for property and trying to drive growth at a time it was already at a fast pace.  The corollary of this is now happening as the Government&rsquo;s procyclical policies are driving the economy in the other direction.  I know this is probably based on advice from officials &mdash; I presume the same officials who gave advice previously on the procyclical policies to drive growth &mdash; and they are now looking to consolidate stagnation and the recession.  While there has been much talk about charges and increased financial imposition on households, undoubtedly it will prolong the current crisis.  I suggest to the Leader that consideration should be given to having expertise in various areas of economic development involved in our deliberations.  Whether this is done in our ordinary plenary sessions or as part of the public consultation, which is a good initiative, there is a role for the Seanad in this area.  There are many voices here, probably more than there are in the D&aacute;il, who have insights.  We may have different views on it.  By debating these issues in a very open way we are more likely to come to a solution.  I urge the Leader to consider this.  Without more enlightened policies nationally and at EU level we will consign a generation of people to difficult financial situations.  While I took a different view on the leaking of the troika report, it is important that it is considered.  These types of issues need to be fully flushed out and debated if we are to find solutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of the report published yesterday on the deaths of children.  I am involved in a small way with a centre dealing with young people who drop out of the education system.  It is a life centre which looks after 15 to 18 young people.  Its funding falls between the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Children.  Previously we were very fast to criticise religious orders.  However, the only funding being provided to keep the centre going is &euro;50,000 per annum from a religious order.  All of the young people have been involved in either drugs or drink and they have no family support at home.  People work on a voluntary basis, including more than 18 qualified teachers.  The report published yesterday showed people fall between a number of agencies with tragic results.  Unfortunately, certain young people do not fit into the education system.  There is not a huge number of them, but the number is significant and we need to take action on it.  It is important that one Department takes responsibility for it.  When we debate the report, this issue needs to be dealt with and decisions need to be taken so we do not have a repeat of what has happened in the past ten years.  This matter is urgent and it should not be left for another report.  Now is the time to take action on it.  The report will be debated by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children this morning.  I hope the publication of the report will bring about positive results.  What has occurred is frightening and it is important that it is not repeated in the next ten years.  It is important that we debate the issue as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I support everything Senator Burke stated.  He is quite right.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for Education and Skills has responded to the report on patronage and pluralism in primary schooling.  While signalling my concern about any excessive attempt by the State to control the flow of information to parents in various urban areas and areas with an oversupply of Catholic primary schools, such as Tuam in Galway and Malahide in Dublin, it is good that parents are to be surveyed and that it will take place in an orderly fashion which will canvass people&rsquo;s opinions on what model of school patronage they want for their area and children.  I was surprised and concerned to read in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that town hall meetings and activities that might whip up a media frenzy are to be prohibited.  I was also surprised to read in the same article that no public meetings will be allowed.  As far as I know, freedom of association is guaranteed by the Constitution and people are perfectly entitled to organise meetings off their own bat.  The State has no business interfering with this.  If what this report is referring to is that there will be a particular structured consultation initiated by the Department in consultation with patronage bodies and that this consultation will not involve public meetings, that is the State&rsquo;s business.  However, it seems rather bizarre to hear talk of the prohibition of public meetings.  People are entitled to meet on their own terms and to discuss issues as they see fit.  If this forms part of the context in which people will be canvassed for their views on school patronage, I for one would have no problem with it and would be extremely critical of any attempts to curb it.  This of course is rooted in the report on patronage and pluralism, which contained among its recommendations the rather unhelpful statist idea that the flow of information should be controlled.  That may be how things work in a statist democracy but not in a genuinely pluralist democracy.  The Minister should be on notice that there will be opposition if there is any excessive attempt to curb the flow of information.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>Having listened to Senator Walsh&rsquo;s earlier contribution on the state of the economy and the possibility it may be returning to recession, I refer to the most recent proposals from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, on speeding, driving in general and changing the penalty points system.  However, I draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to one specific issue on which he should contact the Minister, namely, learner drivers who must, by virtue of their employment, drive to work unaccompanied.  Last weekend, I met one such person, who is a second-year apprentice electrician, who may be obliged to drive to work to Cork on one day, possibly to Limerick on the next day and perhaps to Kilkenny on another day.  He told me clearly that the only way in which he could avoid breaking the law was to ask his father to get out of bed at 6 a.m. to sit with him in the car on the drive to Cork.  His father would then be obliged to sit in the car all day and then accompany him home from work.  This is a time when efforts are being made to get the economy back on its feet and when young people are getting back into employment.  While they are trying to do it for themselves, by so doing they are breaking the law because they cannot get to work.  I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  There must be some provision in law whereby a person travelling to and from work is allowed to do so by virtue of a letter from his or her employer to state that within certain specified hours, the person in question is travelling to or from work.  This is a very important issue for young, responsible drivers who do not go out at night to speed or to get into their cars having taken drink, but who need to be in their cars at 6 a.m. to get to their place of work to get on in life and to enable the country to recover.  I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the Minister&rsquo;s attention and to ascertain whether legislative provision may be made to deal with this matter.  I understand this has been done in other countries and could be done here, if so desired.</P>

	<P>I welcome the recommendation by the Constituency Commission that County Leitrim once again be united in a single constituency.  This is to be welcomed and I condemned its division the last time around.  It is regrettable that to achieve this unification, it has been necessary to take in parts of County Donegal and in particular, I regret it is proposed to take in 13,100 people who are resident in west Cavan.  This means everything west of a line from Ballananagh, located just three and a half miles from Cavan town, to Belturbet will from henceforth be part of the Sligo-Leitrim constituency.  I consider this proposal to be ludicrous.  It makes no sense and to the best of my knowledge means that for the first time in the history of the State, four counties will be represented within a single constituency.  The proposal for a constituency comprising counties Sligo and Leitrim, County Donegal from Donegal town to Bundoran and everything in County Cavan west of a line from Belturbet to Ballananagh is ludicrous and disenfranchises 13,100 people in west Cavan.  I will oppose it at every opportunity I am given.</P>

However, I am sure Members will have an opportunity to discuss it at a later stage.</P>
        <P>As for Bille na Gaeltachta, at a meeting of leaders approximately a fortnight ago, I indicated this Bill would come before the House at this time.  Last week, I again announced in the House during the Order of Business that Bille na Gaeltachta would be coming into the House.  Consequently, there has been ample opportunity for Members opposite to take into consideration representations from any organisations to enable the framing of amendments.  I have no intention of stifling debate on this Bill.  As is evident from today&rsquo;s Order of Business, the Bill has been ordered and Members can speak on it for as long as they wish.  I have not specified a concluding time and this Second Stage debate can finish whenever Members stop speaking on it.  There is ample opportunity to have a debate on this issue.  Moreover, there has been ample opportunity to table amendments for Committee Stage and there still is an opportunity to so do.  If necessary, Members can have two sessions next week on Committee Stage and the Report Stage of the Bill probably will be taken the week after.  Consequently, there has been and will be, ample opportunity to table amendments.</P>

        <P>Senator Bacik and eight other Members raised the issue of a debate on children&rsquo;s rights and the report of the independent review group on the deaths of children.  Eight Members spoke on this subject today and seven others spoke on it yesterday.  While I responded comprehensively to the matter yesterday, there is no doubt but that the report&rsquo;s findings are deeply disturbing.  Services often were willing but fragmented and were not comprehensive in their responses.  The question must arise as to how, after a period of so much and such unprecedented economic prosperity, the country was left with a child protection service in need of such reform.  If ever evidence was required of the scale of the challenge the present Government must face, this report provides it.  If ever evidence was required as to the reason and need for an utterly reformed system of State care intervention, this report provides it.  If ever evidence was required of the need to take child protection away from the HSE, wherein up to recently it was lost, and to establish a new agency, the proposed child family support agency, than this report emphasises it.  Members will have a debate on the issue.  I have raised the matter with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, who is quite willing to come in here and debate that report.  It is simply a matter of fixing a date.  However, I assure Members that this debate will be held within the next couple of weeks as the Minister is anxious to attend.  Moreover, I assure Members, including Senator Norris, who have mentioned the possibility that this report, like others, might be left to rot on the shelf that this will not be the case.  Quite a number of the report&rsquo;s recommendations already have been acted on and already have been implemented.  I mentioned such cases on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business.  I assure Members the Government is treating this report seriously and already has acted on some recommendations.  Moreover, I am sure that all its recommendations will be implemented.  I note 260 additional social workers also have been recruited.</P>
        <P>Senator White raised the important issue of the Kernel Capital letter to <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>.  I agree with Senator White that sales are the engines of growth of any economy.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has attended the House on several occasions but we can ask him to attend again, on an ongoing basis, to discuss unemployment, specifically, youth unemployment, the area mentioned by Senator Reilly.  We will endeavour to have the Minister attend the House to discuss those items.  He has been a regular visitor to the House but I entirely agree there is a need for the House to deal with those specific items.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn raised the Construction Contracts Bill, Second Stage of which, I am very pleased to note, was passed in the other House.  It is a matter for that House now to deal with on Committee Stage but if there is anything I can do to expedite it, I will do so.  Presumably it will return to this House before the end of the summer but I cannot give the Senator any guarantees.</P>
        <P>Senator Keane mentioned the report on participatory budgeting in the context of dealing with it at local government level.  We will ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, to the House at a later stage to speak on the whole issue of local government reform.  He attended previously but is willing to return at which time that matter can be discussed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Paul Coghlan spoke about the Criminal Justice (Corruption) Bill, a very important piece of legislation, which has been published by the Government.  It is very important that the public has confidence in its elected representatives, public officials, and so on.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice will debate this in early course and I hope the House may debate it, even prior to Second Stage, if necessary, and if we can have the Minister present to discuss it.</P>
        <P>I have addressed the matter raised by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill in regard to Bille na Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised another amendment to the Order of Business which, again, I do not propose to accept.  It referred to the turf-cutting situation concerning which EU directives are in place.  The Minister has been very conciliatory in his actions in this entire regard.  The garda&iacute; are only doing their duty and are upholding the law, which is what we expect them to do.  I regret that legislators are advocating the breaking of the law.  That is not acceptable.  I agree with Senator Gilroy that the upholding of the law is of paramount importance and it is despicable for legislators to advocate breaking the law in any way.</P>
        <P>Senators Comiskey and Mooney spoke about the political reunification of County Leitrim which I am sure all people from that county will be delighted to see.</P>

        <P>Senators MacSharry and Walsh referred to a debate on the economy.  We have had a number of such debates and the Minister for Finance will attend the House on 3 July for two hours of debate.  Senator Walsh also mentioned that the Seanad Public Consultation Committee could be used for this purpose.  If my memory serves me correctly, a number of Senators were to come forward with proposals for public consultation and the House was to consider something of this kind and make a draft but that was about a month ago and I have heard nothing further.  Perhaps something will emerge in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen spoke about patronage and pluralism.  The Minister for Education and Skills is willing to engage with all interested parties on this issue and I am glad he came to this House to discuss that subject at length.  There were some very valuable contributions from Members.  The Minister is certainly not afraid to engage with people on the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Landy referred to road safety and the new legislation that proposes changes to the Road Traffic Bill.  The Senator can make submissions to the Minister on the subject.  I am sure that when the Bill issues the Senator will make a contribution similar to the one he made on the original Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson now has four counties in his constituency.   I have not seen this happen before but I am sure we will have an opportunity to discuss the Boundary Commission&rsquo;s report.</P>

    <Title>Credit Guarantee Bill 2012: Second Stage</Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to present the Credit Guarantee Bill 2012 to the Seanad.  The Bill is one of the key targeted actions in the Government Action Plan for Jobs 2012 to address access to credit and support lending to SMEs, and will, I believe, prove to be a practical way of facilitating additional lending to SMEs.  This is not a grant nor a support for ailing businesses. It is a scheme intended to address specific market failures that prevent bank lending to some commercially viable businesses, by providing a 75% guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job creating firms.  The target beneficiaries are commercially viable SMEs, that is those which display a repayment capacity for additional credit facilities, but that cannot secure credit facilities under current conditions due to two market failures, namely insufficient collateral or lack of appreciation by the credit institutions of the growth-expansionary business model.</P>
        <P>I would like to present some background on the rationale for introducing a credit guarantee scheme for SMEs.  In February this year, the Government launched a range of measures under the Action Plan for Jobs to improve the competitiveness of the economy, to improve supports for job-creating businesses and to remove barriers to employment creation across the economy.  Every Department and over 35 agencies and offices of the State are engaged with actions to support jobs which will be delivered in this calendar year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for interrupting but is there a copy of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will arrange that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it will be provided.</P>
        <P>The plan is an engine for change and will be reviewed and revitalised every year.  It is the start of a programme of strategic interventions designed to aid economic recovery and clearly shows the Government&rsquo;s determination to get our economy back on the right path to sustainable, exporting, innovative and enterprise-led growth and through that the creation of sustainable jobs.  The introduction of the State backed guarantee scheme this year is one of the commitments that the Department made which will deliver positive results for the vulnerable SME sector quickly.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>With regard to the importance of supporting SMEs, the Government has placed supports for the SME sector at the heart of its strategy for economic recovery because of the important role that SMEs play and in recognition of the challenging environment in which they have operated over the past few years.  SMEs play a critical role in Irish economic life.  Indeed, the existence of my post as Minister for State with responsibility for small business clearly demonstrates the focus of Government policy on this key sector.  SMEs form the majority of all businesses in Ireland.  They are the creative and innovative backbone of the economy and are the job creators of the future.  It is imperative that Government policy helps them to grow and prosper.  The Government is focused on ensuring that entrepreneurs and all companies throughout the economy are supported in every way possible to develop their business, increase exports, and maintain and create jobs.  This strategy will revitalise and rebuild the economy and lighten the burden we have all been carrying over the past years as a result of a failed economic model.  The Credit Guarantee Bill is one of the Government&rsquo;s initiatives to give substance to this focus and commitment.</P>
        <P>By far the most talked about problem in recent times facing the Irish small business sector is the lack of availability of adequate credit facilities.  Financing of the economy is critical to long-term economic success.  While large businesses have various options open to them, including the capital markets, SMEs are heavily dependent on the banking system.  Therefore, a crucial aspect of supporting growth and recovery is fostering a favourable business environment including a well-functioning financial system.  Clearly, to support the recovery, we need to find ways to ensure that credit worthy borrowers have access to needed loans.  While this problem is not unique to Irish SMEs but rather a worldwide phenomenon, it is a problem which the Government feels needs urgent redress, hence the movement of the Credit Guarantee Bill.</P>
        <P>The Government has been, and remains, particularly active in the context of addressing the issue of credit accessibility since it took office last year.  The House will be aware that the Government secured a commitment from the main lenders, AIB and Bank of Ireland, to each make available not less than &euro;3.5 billion next year and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  The aim is to restore the lifeblood of the market economy &mdash; the lending and borrowing that help fuel business investments, run factories, buy machinery and equipment and pay wages etc.  This remains a key task and the establishment of this facility is another step in addressing market weakness in this area.  New initiatives must complement rather than substitute for the main banks&rsquo; lending commitments and activities under the recapitalisation package and they must represent value for money from the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective.  I have endeavoured to ensure that this guarantee scheme facilitates additional lending of up to &euro;150 million, that would not otherwise have been extended by the banks, to directly assist businesses while at the same time ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>With regard to specific market inefficiencies to be addressed, for all the efforts of Government in the area of getting credit moving, I would like to emphasise that it remains the responsibility of the banking system to provide credit to businesses.  Government is prepared to offer additional targeted supports by identifying and addressing specific credit gaps or market inefficiencies which are impediments to lending.  We have identified two distinct characteristics of the Irish SME lending market, namely lack of collateral and lack of comprehension of new markets or models by the banks which provide the rationale for a temporary partial credit guarantee scheme as follows.  There is a cohort of commercially viable companies in the SME sector with growth potential that have experienced difficulties accessing credit as they do not have the security required for conventional collateral based bank lending.  There is also an issue that predates, but has been exacerbated by, the banking crisis, whereby new companies or expanding companies engaged in new sectors, new technologies and markets struggle to secure finance.  This can be due to a lack of familiarity or understanding on the part of the banks, of the new industry, the new product or the potential of new markets.  These market failures in the provision of credit to viable businesses became particularly acute in Ireland during the property bubble, during which time the Irish banks lost capacity to assess credit risk in real economy companies that were unable to offer property related collateral.</P>
        <P>This guarantee scheme will encourage lending to commercially viable SMEs and reorient lending to the real economy.  It will encourage banks to lend to commercially viable SMEs in new sectors, technologies and markets, and in so doing place Irish firms on a more level footing with other international competitors that have access to similar schemes, thus making them more competitive and their jobs more sustainable and secure. The scheme will allow a business to not only acquire a loan it could not otherwise obtain but also to establish a favourable credit history with a lender so that the business may obtain future financing on its own.  It will realign bank lending with enterprise policy and secure economic benefits from additional lending by increasing exports, creating and sustaining jobs and facilitating investment in the real economy.</P>
        <P>The net Exchequer cost for an annual portfolio of &euro;150 million of guaranteed lending is approximately &euro;6.38 million.  However, those costs should be seen in light of the benefits that will be generated by the additional lending attributable to the scheme.  Economic gains arise in terms of improving the financing environment for SMEs, encouraging a banking system that is fit for purpose, increased GDP, improved competitiveness, increased innovation activity, job creation and maintenance, savings on welfare payments and increased direct and indirect tax payments.  The benefits forecast to arise from this intervention in each year of operation, assuming &euro;150 million of additional lending, include the creation of more than 1,000 jobs, over &euro;25 million of Exchequer benefits in tax revenues and welfare cost savings, and a 398% return on the State&rsquo;s investment.</P>
        <P>Section 1 defines certain commonly used terms in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for certain conditions that must be satisfied in respect of participating lenders.  The Minister will enter into an agreement with each lender and will accredit the lender to participate.  For lenders to participate, we will require a detailed consideration of how the lender will use the scheme to support lending over and above that currently being achieved.  In order to demonstrate an understanding of the additionality principle, lenders will be requested to provide examples of situations in which the scheme could have been used in the past, such as viable lending applications that were declined specifically due to the circumstances that the scheme is intended to address.  Section 3 provides for specific eligibility criteria for qualifying enterprises.  The guarantee scheme is targeted at micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, employing not more than 250 staff, as defined by the EU Commission.</P>
        <P>Section 4 confers on the Minister power to enter into agreements with the banks to give them a guarantee for qualifying enterprises.  The aggregate of loans permitted within the scheme shall not exceed &euro;150 million in any one year, thereby capping the State&rsquo;s liability.  The Government, having considered a range of possible combinations of guarantee rate and portfolio default limit that, when applied to the guaranteed portfolio, will deliver the desired overall risk share, has agreed on a guarantee rate of 75% and a portfolio default limit of 10%.  This sets the overall portfolio claim limit at 7.5%.  For a given portfolio of lending allocated to each bank, each loan in the portfolio would carry a 75% guarantee, but potential claims under the guarantee are capped by the 7.5% portfolio claim limit.  Therefore, the actual default performance of a portfolio may in fact exceed the portfolio default limit.  However, the extent to which the State covers overall losses is capped at the default rate of 10%, and any losses in excess of that must be borne by the lender.</P>
        <P>Section 5 provides for the Minister to set up a credit guarantee scheme.  The scheme may make provision for various terms and conditions such as conditions with which the participating lenders must comply, purposes for which loans may be given, reports and information by lenders to the Minister, conditions with which SME borrowers shall comply, and other matters.  Section 6 requires the Minister to lay the scheme before both houses of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made.  Section 7 permits the Minister to appoint an operator via a commercial contract to administer the scheme after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the terms and conditions of the contract.</P>
        <P>Section 8 provides for a premium to be charged to participating borrowers in respect of loans guaranteed under the scheme.  This 2% premium will be paid directly by the borrower to the State.  The costs of the scheme will be partially offset by receipts of premiums paid by borrowers.  Section 9 confers on the Minister the power to withdraw any guarantee if a lender fails or refuses to comply with the terms of the scheme.  It also provides for protection for the SME borrower in the event that a guarantee is withdrawn from a lender, in that a lender cannot impose less favourable terms on the borrower upon the withdrawal of a guarantee.  Section 10 provides for review of the guarantee scheme at any time.  I have committed to review the scheme after 12 months of operation.  The Minister must also submit a report of the review to both Houses of the Oireachtas not later than two months after the review is completed.  Section 11 provides that costs associated with administering the scheme will be subject to sanction from the Minister for Finance, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and will be met from moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 12 provides for the short title, the Credit Guarantee Act 2012, and commencement.</P>
        <P>I must emphasise that facilitating small business financing is not a particularly simple or straightforward matter.  Notably, the term &ldquo;SME&rdquo; encompasses a large mix of enterprises, and each SME faces a unique combination of local economic conditions and complex relationships with customers, suppliers and creditors.  Hence, we are not advocating a one-size-fits-all solution.  This scheme is designed to support commercially viable SMEs that are at the margins of SME commercial lending decisions.  The initiative is a small step towards a more sophisticated and accessible financing environment for SMEs in Ireland, and is just one component of a suite of initiatives aimed at ensuring the flow of credit.  Backing enterprise by providing a State guarantee to those who struggle to get credit from lenders meets a vital need.  Such Government interventions inspire confidence and encourage small business owners and consumers to expand their businesses, invest in new plant and machinery, conduct marketing campaigns, be innovative, recruit new employees and increase the size of their businesses and of the economy.  Therefore, it will add value to the measures already taken to address the SME credit supply issue, representing value for money to the State.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on the tremendous work he is putting into increasing the availability of finance for small and medium-sized companies.  I know his heart and soul is in this job.</P>
        <P>Any Bill or initiative that seeks to help viable businesses to survive and weather the great economic storm is to be welcomed.  Specifically, the Government has targeted the SME sector as the key beneficiary of this Bill, which is also to be welcomed.  We have heard a lot through the years from successive Governments about helping the SME sector, yet this help has not always materialised.  This Bill, while welcome, is not a magic fix.  As the Minister of State has said many times, there are 200,000 small businesses in this country, employing more than 655,000 people.  When he was Minister of State with responsibility for enterprise in the 1990s, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan used to say that if every small business recruited one extra person, this would have a major impact on unemployment.  This holds true today; small businesses are the backbone of the economy.  Sadly, however, small businesses are being starved of credit.  We know this because Mr. Trethowan of the Credit Review Office, in his eighth quarterly report, has seen the light for the first time.  He pointed at the banks, saying that he was &ldquo;disappointed that there is not more evidence of support for &lsquo;enterprise risk taking&rsquo; on new and increased lending in the banks&rsquo; current lending policies.  This would suggest that their current risk appetite needs to be reassessed in order to support economic and employment recovery&rdquo;.  It appears, therefore, that the banks are funding existing companies but are terrified to act in an entrepreneurial manner.  Unless we can support new companies with finance they will not create employment.</P>
        <P>The latest assessment from ISME is even more forthright and makes for disquieting reading.  ISME claims that the banks are hindering recovery, with 54% of credit applications refused by bailed out banks in the last three months alone.  Its survey found that 82% of the businesses which applied for funding believe the banks are making it more difficult for them to access finance.  The survey also indicates that 96% of business owners believe the Government had either a negative or no impact on SME lending.  I acknowledge this does not apply to the Minister of State, who is doing his best to address the issue, but the ISME survey confirms what many of us suspect from our dealings with the SME sector, namely, that the banks are not lending.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A Central Bank paper found that &euro;1.6 billion was issued in new loans to the SME sector in the first nine months of 2011.  However, the banks also removed &euro;2.4 billion by closing credit facilities.  Overall, lending to the SME sector was down by &euro;800 million.  This is the environment in which the present Bill is being considered by the Oireachtas.  The banks which lent too much in the past now lend too little.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party is not opposing the Bill notwithstanding certain reservations we have about it.  My colleagues in the D&aacute;il argued that the Bill was somewhat restrictive, especially in comparison with other countries.  It is also coming late compared to other countries.  The intention of the Bill is to provide a 75% guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job creating firms.  Up to &euro;150 million is to be guaranteed annually.  The Government has indicated that the net Exchequer cost for an annual portfolio of &euro;150 million of guaranteed lending is approximately &euro;6.38 million and that the benefits forecast to arise from this intervention in each year of operation, assuming &euro;150 million in additional lending, include the creation of more than 1,000 jobs, more than &euro;25 million of Exchequer benefits in tax revenue and welfare cost savings and a 398% return on the State&rsquo;s investment.  In other words the cost-benefit ratio will be approximately 4:1.  By any standards that would be a remarkable return.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Why are we capping it at &euro;150 million, however?  The Small Firms Association, SFA, estimates that the fund will benefit a mere 1,800 businesses and has asked the Government to commit to meeting in full the demand for guarantee funding from small businesses by removing the funding cap from the Bill.  I am sympathetic to this position because if the prospective return on the Government&rsquo;s outlay is so fantastic we should at least set a higher cap.  If, for example, the Government&rsquo;s outlay was increased fourfold to &euro;27.4 million, more than &euro;100 million of Exchequer benefits in tax revenue and welfare savings would ensue.  That would be a handsome benefit at a time when budgets are tight.  I understand that the cap may have been the price for getting the scheme off the ground and I presume it originates from the Department of Finance.  If that is the case I hope the Minister of State will put pressure on that Department to review the cap if the demand greatly exceeds it.  By this means it would truly be a demand led scheme.  The SFA also drew attention to the 2% annual risk premium.  This could well pose further cash flow problems for small businesses and should be modified.  The SFA suggests that the premium should be paid in instalments at the same time as the full loan repayments are being made.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister of State sees the Bill as a means of providing additional lending rather than a substitute for existing lending.  How is this to be policed and what is to stop the banks from using the scheme to guarantee lending they might have provided anyway?  I am anxious to hear how this will work.  The banks have broken the country and were bailed out by the taxpayer.  The burden is enormous and the actions of the banks have done nothing to alleviate it.  Any attempt by the banks to use this scheme to reduce lending must be strenuously resisted.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill with reservations.  Whatever its limitations we must give it a chance to work and I hope it can deliver the benefits predicted for it.  If these benefits materialise I will be calling on the Government to expand the scheme.  The major challenge facing the country is the unemployment crisis, with one in five people on the live register.  We rely on the private sector, entrepreneurs and go getters to lift the gloom.  It is up to us to provide the right environment for enterprise to flourish and, limited as it is, this Bill is a step in the right direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator White in commending the Minister of State on the work he has done to date.  I welcome this Bill for providing a targeted temporary partial credit guarantee scheme aimed specifically at small and medium enterprises.  The Bill also identifies SME sectors which have insufficient collateral for traditional loan arrangements and which operate in areas with which the banks are not familiar.  We are all aware of the need for credit among small businesses and the Bill is one of a number of initiatives the Government has introduced in the context of the action plan for jobs.  The action plan outlined improvements that would support job creating enterprises and sought to support small indigenous companies and potential entrepreneurs, identify the obstacles that were in their way and find ways for the State to facilitate their job creation potential.</P>
        <P>SMEs are the life blood for this country.  We hear a lot about multinationals but SMEs operate in every town and village the length and breadth of this country.  They form the majority of businesses across the State, whether in manufacturing, services or support to foreign direct investment.  Growth in the SME sector will lift this country from the difficulties it is experiencing at present and contribute to the much needed growth targets that are required to get the economy back on track.  We cannot focus solely on multinationals because we must also realise the benefits offered by small and medium indigenous enterprises.  The biggest obstacle that small businesses face is the lack of access to credit.  The introduction of the scheme outlined in this Bill will contribute to alleviating the pressures on viable businesses which have potential for growth and job creation but face difficulties in gaining credit.</P>
        <P>The two main reasons for credit refusal are a lack of collateral and the shortage of expertise in the banking sector.  As Senator White noted, our banks have become too soft and risk averse.  I commend the Senator for establishing a small business at a time when it was not fashionable to do so.  The banks have become too dependent on what were once guaranteed returns from property.  It was too easy for the banks during the property bubble and they neglected the opportunity to develop expertise and an understanding of their customers&rsquo; needs in terms of developing new business models and products.  This issue is particularly important for new and expanding companies engaged in sectors such as technology.  Banks should develop the competency to evaluate growth potential in new technology companies.  The banks lack understanding of the market opportunities available to these companies.  If a company&rsquo;s accounts do not show X euro in credit at a particular time, the bank is not skilled in assessing its potential.</P>
        <P>The credit guarantee can support these businesses and help the banks in their learning process by encouraging them to understand the businesses to which they lend.  The State will provide a 75% guarantee to banks against qualifying loans.  Initially, the scheme will facilitate &euro;150 million.  Senator White sought a revaluation of that, which is provided for in the scheme.  If it is working well, growing and has potential, perhaps the Minister will decide to expand it.</P>
        <P>It is important to support business and I welcome the safeguard introduced by the Minister.  When the State is guaranteeing something, it is important to insert safeguards.  Section 9 of the Bill provides for the intervention of the Minister to withdraw the guarantee scheme if the lender fails or refuses to comply with the terms of the scheme.  The Bill provides for a review of the scheme.  The Bill provides for a three-year partial credit guarantee scheme.  It is important for the small business sector for each of these years.  It is important that lending takes place in addition to, rather than instead of, normal day to day practice.  Senator White also referred to this, whereby the banks give with one hand and take back with another.  I ask the Minister of State to keep an eye on this so that credit guarantee schemes currently in place are not hidden by the back door and replaced by this.  He should ensure this is additional money.</P>
        <P>The cost of lending during the three year lifetime of the Bill will be &euro;19 million.  This will be money well spent.  The size and nature of the guarantee involved and the sums of money to be loaned are dwarfed by some of the guarantee facilities available in other EU countries.  Reference is often made to our 12.5% corporation tax rate but, for example, Italy&rsquo;s largest public guarantee fund guaranteed &euro;4.6 billion worth of loans in the first six years of operation.  Many OECD countries have similar programmes.  For example, the guarantee in the Netherlands is up to 50%, with up to 75% available for start-ups and innovative companies; Belgium and the United Kingdom offer 75%, the same guarantee provided for in the Bill; and in Germany up to 80% is guaranteed, with the average between 50% and 80%.  It is worth noting that the Bill provides a guarantee for a duration of three years, as opposed to the lifetime of the loan.  Any time our corporation tax rate is mentioned, we can say that other countries have initiatives to ensure businesses are attracted to their countries.  This is somewhat shorter than those on offer elsewhere.  In the Netherlands the guarantee is for a maximum of six years, or 12 years if real estate is involved.  We know where real estate is going in this country.  In Denmark and Belgium, the guarantee is for up to ten years and in Germany it is up to 15 years.</P>
        <P>These important provisions will ensure that a close eye is kept on this scheme.  Ireland is not alone in being the only country across Europe to introduce such schemes.  The UK, Germany and Italy all have various experiences and it is important that Ireland has such a scheme as it will be of benefit to Irish SMEs competing against others that have such support.  In the absence of credit flowing into small businesses, this economy will not recover, as has been acknowledged time and time again.  It is important to ensure viable businesses that have a credible business plan and can get much needed credit.  It is encouraging to know the Irish Banking Federation&rsquo;s response to the publication of this Bill suggests it is fully committed to its application in supporting the SME sector.  The Bill has also been supported by Chambers Ireland, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, and the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland.  They all acknowledge the Bill as a necessary part of facilitating small and medium enterprises in providing a much needed credit line.</P>
        <P>Of the 1.8 million people working in the Irish economy, more than 900,000 are working in the SME sector.  The SME sector is a significant contributor.  I tried to research the number of women in SMEs but I could not find figures.  The Irish Women in Business network came to the House last week.  In March 2011, the EU Commissioner Viviane Reding, called for a pledge on women on boards, women in business and entrepreneurial women.  She asked for companies to come to a voluntary agreement that, by 2015, 30% of board members will be women and 40% by 2020.  I would like to see Ireland going down that route.  We should also ensure banks facilitate women entrepreneurs.  Quotas are important but I do not like them and neither does Ireland.  I went for them in politics but I would not like to have to go for them in business.  Norway has a quota for women in business resulting in 42% of board members being women.  We must consider this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill.  I am delighted the Minister of State, who has responsibility for SMEs, is taking the Bill.  Over recent years I went around the country visiting retailers and others and discovered an assumption that they could not get a loan.  In the first few years, I found that if they put forward a strong proposal, money was available and it could be granted.  People had talked themselves into assuming they could not get a loan.  In recent times, it has tightened up a great deal.  In the past three months, 54% of credit applications were refused but the original reports were much better.  It seems there has been a deterioration.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has already heard ideas on helping SMEs such as longer banking hours, a mobile telephone app to help with applying for a loan or addressing the fact that SMEs do not know which person in larger branches of the banks is dealing with the accounts.  A dedicated person should be appointed to SME accounts in each branch in order to build trust between the business and the bank.</P>
        <P>There could be one common application form common to all banks.  This would streamline the process and reduce accountancy costs.  Is the Minister of State considering that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>That has been introduced in Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank.  The simplified application form was launched two months ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not aware of that.  I would like to take credit for it even if I am two months late.  I draw attention of the Minister of State to the US small business innovation research, SBIR, scheme.  I think we could learn from it.  It came into being in 1982 and obliges all US federal agencies to set aside a small percentage of research projects to procure research from SMEs.  It particularly helps the high-tech industry, which the US Government talks so much about.  The SBIR programme has developed more than $21 billion of research since 1982 by more than 15,000 firms, resulting in more than 45,000 patents.  The programme founder, Rowland Tibbetts, said the purpose is to &ldquo;provide funding for some of the best early-stage innovation ideas &mdash; ideas that, however promising, are still too high risk for private investors, including venture capital firms&rdquo;.  For the purpose of the SBIR programme, small business is defined as a for-profit business with fewer than 500 employees.  That is a large business Ireland.  The Government could make a difference by pledging a percentage of money in this area.  A similar model operated in the United Kingdom for a period and we could adopt similar legislation.  The UK plans to introduce an SME champion in every Government department to check whether its procurement processes are appropriate for small businesses and smaller suppliers and to introduce mechanisms to speed up payment to SMEs.  The US system, where SMEs must gain a percentage of budgets, could be of real benefit to SMEs.  Has the Minister of State heard of this model and will he consider it?</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Crowd funding is an interesting term.  What is the Minister doing in terms of crowd funding to allow more businesses access to credit?  Many people are willing to invest venture capital but they are unaware a certain company exists.  We should consider the concept of crowd funding in order to solve this.  Social networks of investors lend millions of euro in loans to entrepreneurs and small businesses.  The business is worth &euro;2 billion in the US.  An entrepreneur makes use of online communities to solicit pledges of small amounts of money from individuals, who are typically not professional financiers.  They have some money to invest but they do not know where to find the opportunity.  They can now do so with social media.  We can also think of this in terms of the Irish diaspora.  They may have money to pledge but they do not know of an SME or start-up company in Ireland looking for finance.  Many start-ups and venture capitalists have successfully connected through the system and it is worthwhile considering.</P>
        <P>In other words, I am not stuck rigidly to what the Minister is trying to do but we support it.  I have listened to what Senator White has said and to the remarks of Senator Keane as well.  Clearly, we would prefer to see these measures on a greater scale but there is almost a need to convince people that they can get money if they do it correctly.  We must help them to make the application and, then with the benefit of this finance, we can help them to take the first step on the way.  I believe it is a worthy Bill and I am pleased to support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I realise he has a passion for small business.  His portfolio will give him great satisfaction if we can produce the necessary jobs in the country.  Small and medium-sized enterprises have been the lifeblood of the economy and they will be the saviour of the economy in future.  As Senator Keane noted, up to 900,000 people operate in the SME sector.  Almost every family in the country has someone involved in SMEs at some level.  They are adding value to their products and providing employment and credit for people who are finding the going tough at times.  They are acting in the place of the banks in some cases and they are taking a greater risk than the banks because those involved are keen to hold on to their businesses.  The last people to give up on their businesses in this country will be those with small family-run businesses.  These people will be prepared to fight tooth and nail to hold on to what they have built up over generations and we cannot afford to lose that ethos.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and the Government on bringing forward the Credit Guarantee Bill.  Recently, I met a young couple who sought to change their mortgage and move to a smaller property.  Their current mortgage is almost up and they have a faultless credit history.  The fact that one was working full-time but the other was working only part-time meant the bank refused the loan.  The young couple who bought the property were planning to put in a new kitchen, new furniture and to improve the house they were planning to leave and the people who would have bought it would have done the same.  There is a knock-on effect; it is not simply the case that the bank would not lend one mortgage.  The decision stopped one couple spending because they had savings that they wanted to spend on the next property.  Only when the credit sector starts moving and the banks begin to give credit to young couples, who want to move house, buy furniture, improve the garden or put in an extension, will we be able to help SMEs and then SMEs, in turn, will pass on their profits somewhere else.</P>
        <P>It is like the engine of a car and we are starving it of oil.  A credit guarantee is important to get businesses that are viable off the ground and to keep them going.  The Minister of State indicated that it was no guarantee for people who are not making money; it is really only for those who can.  Earlier, the banks moved from risk lending.  They followed the United Kingdom model and went into house purchases and fees.  There is little risk involved in that model.  The clients of the bank are charged every month for using an account and they can be charged up to 20% for using an overdraft.  Then, when they are behind the counter they can be sold house, life and motor insurance.  The banks were travelling down the road of low risk until they were caught in the property bubble.  Then, they got greedy because they thought it was easy and they did not believe they had to take any risk.  It was easier to lend &euro;1 million for a residential property rather than lend &euro;1 million to a small business that would create jobs.  The banks have been found out as a result.</P>
        <P>We are in a position where we need the banks to buy into this and the efforts of the Government should be commended in this regard.  I have spoken to people at various levels in various bank branches.  They have indicated that they are constrained by their head offices.  They fill in forms from when they come in at 9 a.m. and they are obliged to tick boxes all day until they leave in the evening.  In the meantime, if a loan query comes through they must ring someone in London, Edinburgh or outside the country to get approval.  The banks are reluctant to lend money because they want to get back into the fee business.  They want to get clients back in the door to sell them insurance and charge them for using the accounts.  No one hears of free banking any more because the banks are determined to get the money off their clients one way or another.</P>
        <P>The Credit Review Office is doing a great job.  According to Mr. Trethowan, up to 50% of refusals are overturned on his advice.  I have stated previously in the House that perhaps someone should go to the Credit Review Office before they are refused by the bank to get some advice initially from the office.  It appears to be more switched on to the needs of small businesses than the banks.  If the banks had their way, they would lend no money to small businesses because they believe there is risk involved.  Mr. Trethowan appears to have debunked that theory and his analysis is correct.  The banks are prepared to knock young businesses off their perch and suggest that those involved are incapable of repaying borrowed money.  It is possible that such people will simply give up.  Other small businesses trying to survive might be encouraged to try again but it takes a great deal of effort and guts to go back to the bank through the Credit Review Office and make the case that the bank simply did not believe the analysis of the business owners.  Many small businesses are giving up because they are afraid.</P>
        <P>I am unsure whether there is a facility whereby an SME can speak to John Trethowan before going to the bank.  They may not need a full scale analysis but perhaps a basic analysis.  The office may be able to indicate that those in the business are wasting their time and that they should not go to the bank without giving a total commitment.  At the moment businesses are approaching their local banks and are being refused money.  Subsequently, the Credit Review Office may return with a different opinion.  I believe people are afraid to go to the Credit Review Office because they have gone through so much with their banks and accountants and they may be struggling to survive.</P>

	<P>The first thing those running a business want is to open on Monday morning and then to have enough money on a Friday evening to pay the wages.  This is the greatest concern for any small business at the moment.  It is difficult to go through banking procedures and the Credit Review Office and spend a great deal of time and stress on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is torture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte"><NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
	<P>Anyone operating a small business knows how difficult it is to go to the bank for anything at the moment.  I call on the banks to streamline their application systems and to have people doing less paper work and to spend more time meeting small business owners on their premises.  They would get a better feel for the business rather than examining a spreadsheet, which might tell them a good deal but it will not tell them about the staff in the business, how long the business has been in the area and how important it is to an area.</P>
        <P>Some small businesses have been in place for generations.  They will survive through the recession and provide jobs at the end of it but the banks have to get real.  I have never heard a small business man declare that the banks have carried out a review of his business and decided to lend him more money.  More usually, they come out to try to get the business to pay more money or to put pressure on it.  There is an opportunity, however, through the credit guarantee scheme to give small businesses a leg-up.  It is important whether for a county like Donegal or a city like Dublin that credit is available.  Otherwise things come to a halt.  We cannot depend on foreign direct investment to turn around the economy.  Local people have done it in the past, including the shopkeepers, publicans and small businesses and these people will do it again.  I commend the Minister of State on his work in this area.</P>

Cuid mhaith den rud at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute; sa t&iacute;r seo n&aacute; nach bhfuil na gn&oacute;tha&iacute; beaga in ann feidhmi&uacute;.  Cuireann Sinn F&eacute;in an mille&aacute;n do go leor de seo ar na polasaithe d&eacute;ine at&aacute; tugtha isteach, ar na buis&eacute;id &eacute;ags&uacute;la a tugadh isteach ag na Rialtais a th&aacute;inig roimhe seo agus ar an Rialtas f&eacute;in, mar gheall nach bhfuil airgead ina bp&oacute;ca&iacute; ag daoine agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir leo, d&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, a bheith ag ceannach sna siopa&iacute; agus sna haonaid beaga miond&iacute;ola agus mar sin de.  Sin r&aacute;ite, t&aacute; baint m&oacute;r ag c&uacute;rsa&iacute; creidmheasa sna bainc le seo chomh maith.  C&eacute; go bhf&aacute;ilt&iacute;onn muid roimh an Bille seo, n&iacute; d&oacute;igh linn go dt&eacute;ann s&eacute; s&aacute;ch fada.  Ach is fearr ann &eacute; n&aacute; gan a bheith ann.  Even though this Government and the previous Government were able to find lots of money to bail out the banks, both Administrations were very slow to put pressure on the banks to make credit available to businesses.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in cautiously welcomes this Bill as being of some help to struggling SMEs, but it needs to be complemented by a whole raft of other measures if it is to have any effect.  Six businesses close each day in Ireland, far more than are opening.  This is the clearest evidence anybody would need to show how we are living in a shrinking economy.  The Government has chosen the path of austerity and of shrinking the economy.  This is failing and small businesses are feeling that failure more than most, which is the context in which we are examining this modest proposal.</P>
        <P>I note that in places like Clifden in Connemara, where I am from, some 50% of retail outlets on the main streets have closed in recent years as a result of the economic decline and the failed policies that have been brought in.  Were we in government, our approach would have been to be more aggressive, using the State&rsquo;s stake in AIB and Bank of Ireland to compel them to get on with lending to SMEs and to others who are critical to the functioning of the real economy.  The banks are still too focused on lending to the construction industry.  These banks have received massive bailouts and also received low interest loans from the ECB, yet they are not passing on the credit to SMEs.</P>
        <P>This Bill is overdue.  Such schemes operate in 100 countries worldwide and have operated in the north of the country since the 1980s.  The Bill is enabling legislation and leaves a great deal of discretion to the Minister in terms of the critical nitty-gritty.  We would say the Minister will certainly need to wield any power he has over those banks to ensure credit is made available.  We also note the lack of ambition in the Bill which is obvious from the fact it is predicted that only 2% to 4% of SMEs will benefit even though the Irish SME body&rsquo;s survey shows that up to 50% of its members have been refused credit recently.  We would hope to see that percentage increased.</P>
        <P>We welcome the fact loans will be limited to smaller businesses with fewer than 250 employees.  This makes sense as bigger enterprises could soon soak up what moneys are available and they are better placed to avail of traditional loans.</P>
        <P>The 2% charge on the borrower contained in section 8 has the potential to undermine many of the other positive aspects.  Sinn F&eacute;in will consider trying to remove this unfair charge through an amendment at a later stage.  We will also consider the possibility of proposing that the Bill be amended to compel the Minister to lay before the Oireachtas an annual report on the impact of the Bill.  There is potentially a large amount of public money involved here and democratic scrutiny of that money should be part of the Bill.  There is also the issue of who is liable when there is default on one of these loans.  We propose that the recovery of money or assets should reflect the level of guarantee shared between the lender and the Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although parts of the Bill are to be welcomed, we feel it does not go far enough.  It also needs to be taken in the context of the wider economic situation in this country, which we feel is failing.  The jobs initiative is not yielding the jobs it promised and the austerity measures that are being imposed, particularly on the middle and lower income earners in this State, are a huge additional factor in the problems SMEs have.  Measures such as increasing the cost of fuel in the budget have had massive impact on small businesses which transport goods or are, for example, dependent on salespeople travelling about the country, and this is all adding to the bottom line.  Such measures are completely detrimental to supporting SMEs.</P>
        <P>Beidh Sinn F&eacute;in ag tabhairt isteach roinnt leasuithe ag C&eacute;im an Choiste den Bhille seo, ach n&iacute; bheidh muid ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille ag an bpointe seo.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State is welcome.  This is one of the most positive moves we have had for a good while in terms of helping SMEs.  The Bill will help small businesses across the country to access credit and create jobs.  Let us face it, the pillar banks have let down SMEs.  Despite the fact they have been capitalised with that purpose in mind, we know there is not enough evidence of them doing it.  What they have been doing, in fact, is inviting people in and converting their overdrafts into term loans, thus cutting off the supply of credit.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to welcome the Bill, which was published recently by the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and will make it easier for SMEs to access credit and thus create jobs.  We know that access to credit is the biggest single challenge facing businesses across the country, SMEs in particular.  Every week, I meet local business people in Galway who express their frustration and dismay at their inability to access credit from the banks.  We know SMEs need a reliable stream of credit to function, particularly in the current trading environment, and this will assist in tackling the problem.</P>
        <P>A number of years ago, I learned about an approach, for example, in Germany, whereby the government backs the business, not the bank.  I have been watching this model for some time.  I am delighted that we are considering this here and I believe that to back 75% of the loan requirement is fantastic.  Unfortunately, once our banks come under pressure, they get nervous.  Just when we need them, they let us down.  Quite seriously, one would be inclined to say &ldquo;What a useless bunch&rdquo;.  This is when we need them to show their mettle and to say &ldquo;I see potential in your business.  I believe in you, the person, and your reputation will be trusted&rdquo;, but no, they have always had the reputation of calling in the loans or just refusing.  Fair do&rsquo;s to the Government.  I know Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh is gone but I wish to God&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al.  I would like to see Sinn F&eacute;in being positive when it comes to trying to invest in the economy and SMEs.  I am somewhat outraged because, truly, we need to look at every measure that will help our SMEs continue, as Senator Harte said, to be the lifeblood of our economy.</P>
        <P>I recently did an interview on this Bill in Galway and it was met with a lot of positivity.  There are many positives to the Bill.  It will help 1,800 businesses throughout the country and will facilitate an extra &euro;115 million extra in lending per year, which, in turn, will put badly needed turnover into the economy.  It will also help the banks get a bit of a lesson on who else they might be able to trust out there.</P>
        <P>I am delighted with the company the Government has chosen to give the tender to because it has a great reputation.  Capita Asset Services is part of Capita plc, which is a FTSE 100 company whose prime area business activity is the provision of business process outsourcing services.  It currently employs over 1,200 staff in the Republic of Ireland and almost 1,800 across the island.  I do not know it personally but, by the sound of it, the company has good experience in this area and will, hopefully, teach our banks a lesson or two in who to trust.  Obviously, I would be the first to say we need to back viable propositions but, sometimes, people need to take a little bit of a risk as well.  Let us face it, entrepreneurship is based on risk taking.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have some questions for the Minister of State.  First, if an SME is granted a loan under this scheme and then grows and requires more capital, can it apply for a second loan under this scheme?  This should be clarified as growth of small businesses and the creation of jobs is the goal of the scheme, and to prevent growth of businesses would be a retrograde step.  Second, could we clarify whether SMEs involved in horticulture, agriculture and fisheries are excluded from the scheme as they can also be small enterprises and SMEs in these industries also require help?  Does the Minister of State have particular suggestions in this regard in the absence of them not being allowed into the scheme?</P>
        <P>Third, will people who avail of this scheme be also able to avail of the upcoming microfinance loan fund or are they mutually exclusive?  The fund, which will cap applicants at &euro;25,000, will be very beneficial.  I welcome the fact the Western Development Commission is providing &euro;1 million of the money it has obtained from recycling loans for the very same purpose, namely, a microfinance loan fund through which it will give out loans to a maximum of &euro;25,000.  It is a positive move and it is not the end of the world.  We should tell the banks, however, that we have had to do this because they did not step up to the plate.  The banks should learn a lesson from this.  It is great that the State is showing confidence in SMEs and valuing their importance by guaranteeing 75% of their loans.  I presume that SMEs will get the guarantee from this company, then go to the bank and get the money.  Is that how it will work?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the Bill which is long overdue.  It was in the programme for Government and it was announced three or four times over the last year, so it is good to see it finally before us.  It was promised in May 2011 and was announced a few times after that also by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State.  It is good to see it has finally been published.  Nonetheless, I have a few concerns about it.  The Bill gives authority to the Minister to establish a credit guarantee scheme.  In addition, there is some basic information on what the scheme might involve in terms of &euro;450 million per year and 75% loans.  However, what will the underwriting criteria be and whose criteria will be applied?  Who will the underwriters be?  Are they the same people who are underwriting the banks at the moment, who are taking a very literal approach to ticking boxes in terms of what can or cannot stand up?</P>
        <P>One of the many downsides of the financial crisis in which we all find ourselves, is that so many people have gone out of business or bankrupt and so the risk-takers are out of the picture.  The people who naturally take risks which can lead to successful companies and employment creation are somewhat out of the game.  From a banking perspective, having prohibitive underwriting standards and conditions is like shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.  I may go to a bank with an idea that I feel can work, create jobs and be successful but the underwriting criteria being used by banks to assess such ideas are too stringent.  Underwriters should probably have taken a stricter approach over the last 15 years when a lot of the problems were caused.  I am not sure, however, that taking such a strict approach now will nurture the natural innovative genes of entrepreneurs who are trying to get business ideas off the ground.  I have concerns about that approach.</P>
        <P>Most banks have centralised underwriting so the local knowledge of senior lending managers of Ulster Bank in Ballymote &mdash; the Minister of State&rsquo;s own town &mdash; or in Sligo, Wexford or elsewhere, is not taken into account as much as it was in the past.</P>
        <P>Of course we need more stringent guidelines and need to be prudent and not throw money around, but equally we are just taking a clinical approach to lending.  If one ticks the boxes one gets the money, but that approach is not adequate given what is needed at the moment.  Money will have to be loaned to ideas that will fail in order to achieve a percentage of successful ones.  Ignoring local knowledge and expertise is not the way forward.  In putting together details of the scheme, I ask the Minister of State to adequately address underwriting, which does not just tick boxes but which also takes into account local factors and knowledge that will contribute to the success or failure of a business idea.</P>
        <P>The commitment of pillar banks to lend &euro;3.5 billion or &euro;4 billion specifically looks to existing business and safe bets, including extending a local authority&rsquo;s overdraft or financing blue-chip schemes.  While that is of course necessary, I am not sure that in meeting those targets enough of that finance will go to risk takers.  I am not talking about reckless lending, but we should ensure that the money gets to those ideas.  Some of them may be crazy but if they are not backed they will not end up being successful.  Can anyone imagine someone coming into a bank in Ballymote with the idea of setting up Facebook?  If the banks were to apply their current box-ticking method of underwriting, there would be no hope of the John Perry Facebook idea getting off the ground.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a good thing we do not need money for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>In my view that would be wrong.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s background is in small business and he fully appreciates my point of view.  Let us get more information on how the scheme will be underwritten, who the underwriters will be and what assurances will be there.  We must ensure that we are not just guaranteeing the banks to lend to more blue-chip companies, rather than capturing the spirit of what the Minister of State is trying to achieve, namely, to support risk-takers in creating more employment and getting credit flowing.</P>
        <P>I do not feel a 2% levy is necessary.  It should certainly be linked to a company&rsquo;s profitability as opposed to an annual 2% charge to be levied on them, which is wrong.  It is a bit like the banks having split mortgages but charging more money for the warehouse section, as we read in today&rsquo;s newspapers, on the personal finance side of things.</P>
        <P>When is the micro-finance loan scheme going to begin and how will it work?  I agree with what Senator Healy Eames asked about whether companies can avail of both if necessary.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>If somebody is lucky enough to avail of this scheme, can they also avail of the other one?  I congratulate the Minister of State on his commitment to this area, which I do not doubt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have tracked his work activity since his ministerial appointment, and I have personal experience of it in my own area.  I commend him for the work he has been doing.  He has been totally engaged with this area and has identified that there is a gaping hole which the legislation aims to fill.</P>
        <P>Approximately six months ago, during a debate on a Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; motion on small business, I asked the Minister of State to instruct both pillar banks to attend the Oireachtas and provide a presentation to us on their procedures, rules and regulations governing the provision of loans to small businesses.  Through no fault of the Minister of State, that still has not happened so I am repeating the call now.  I know that in recent weeks the Deputy Leader of the House wrote to the Minister of State about this.  Day in and day out, I am facing constituents who have been refused loans.  In recent weeks I had reason to provide some back-up support to a thriving business involved in the horse industry.  The equine sector is facing difficulties at the moment but, while no pun is intended, it has a proven track record.  Nonetheless that particular business was refused a loan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it should appeal the decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  We will do that but it is extremely frustrating for this to happen when people have rigorously put business plans together.  There appears to be no thinking outside of the box in terms of the banks&rsquo; attitudes.  This legislation provides new opportunities for people.  I have a number of questions for the Minister of State.  </P>
        <P>How are start-up businesses who have no track record by virtue of the fact that they are new but whose owners may have track records from previous employment or life experiences to be treated?  Currently people who have been unemployed for more than 15 months can participate in a back-to-work scheme while retaining their unemployment benefit, which is tapered off over three years by 50%, 75% and 100% respectively.  Will these people who are trying to upskill and create employment be covered under this scheme?  If so, it is important they are aware of that.</P>
        <P>The level of funding available to county enterprise boards has been drastically reduced in recent years.  These boards do a great deal of good work and provide mentoring for fledging businesses.  They also encourage new business.  Will those organisations be brought into the loop in terms of their being able to introduce SMEs to the new guarantee system?  Senator Healy-Eames referred to the agriculture community, which sector, thankfully, is doing well.  I live in rural Ireland.  My next door neighbour is a dairy farmer.  Young people involved in this sector want to expand.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>And yoghurts and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The state aid rules apply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister of State will elaborate further on that point in his concluding remarks.  Further consideration needs to be given to that sector.  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with Kildalton Agricultural College, which is located only a couple of miles from where I live, albeit in County Kilkenny.  It is massively over-subscribed in terms of applications for courses on an annual basis.  As stated by Senator Healy Eames not only mainstream farming but side products of it are affected.  Those involved should be cut some slack.</P>
        <P>In terms of the current banking system, how will take up of the &euro;3.5 billion available this year be monitored?  ISME published its most recent quarterly report last Monday, which states that 54% of SME applicants were refused credit by the banks, which is phenomenal.  There is breakdown in terms of what the Government wants to see happening with that funding and what is actually happening.  We are half way through 2012.  I am concerned that by the time we reach December no real amount will have been drawn down and that money will remain in the banks who will be saying those who applied for loans did not qualify.  There is a need for clarity on this issue.</P>
        <P>I welcome what the Minister of State is doing in terms of this legislation.  Like everything else he is doing in his ministry in terms of getting people back to work, creating employment and thinking outside of the box, it is extremely positive.  However, I plead with him to ensure the banks are brought before us so we can quiz them on this issue.  We effectively own the banks and they should be answerable to us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators White, Keane, Quinn, Harte, &Oacute; Clochartaigh, MacSharry, Landy and Healy Eames for their contributions to this debate.  I also thank my officials for their tireless work on this Bill.  The Senators made some very interesting points.</P>
        <P>This legislation will address some of the difficulties being faced every day by SMEs throughout the country, of which I have been made aware daily since my appointment last year as Minister of State with responsibility for small business.  The ability of our SMEs to succeed and grow underpins the future potential for employment, growth and prosperity.  This Bill underpins the Government&rsquo;s commitment to implement change and reform taking a step-by-step approach.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate Senator White&rsquo;s point in regard to ISME&rsquo;s survey in regard to the unavailability of finance, this legislation is only a start.  A review of the legislation after 12 months will, it is hoped, indicate it has been a success.  On Senator Quinn&rsquo;s point, high potential US companies are doing an effective job within Enterprise Ireland.  A key issue for Government is innovation procurement.  I have looked at the idea of crowd funding, which is very successful in the US.  On Senator White&rsquo;s point in regard to a survey in terms of returns for investment, that will become clear once the guarantee has been established.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this Bill is to re-energise the economy, meet the challenges of recovery, address a failed economic model, restore confidence and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s position in the world.  The Jobs Plan 2012 prioritises where Government efforts over the coming months should best be placed.  It adds up to a co-ordinated plan of vigorous targeted action to achieve change and make a real difference.  It is important we do make a difference.  Businesses need action not words from Government.  This legislation is clear evidence of concrete action which will produce tangible benefits for businesses who avail of the guarantee scheme.</P>
        <P>Senator Harte made an important point in regard to the banks and the role of the Credit Review Office.  I appeal to anyone who has been refused credit to first take up the matter with the banks and if not resolved to then take up the matter with the Credit Review Office, which has been successful.  I welcome Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh&rsquo;s remarks in regard to the Bill and the role of banks.  The banks have been recapitalised to the tune of &euro;7 billion.  The Government is working with them.  I will come back to Senator Landy on the matter of the banks appearing before the Oireachtas to familiarise Members on their role.  The banks have been effectively recapitalised.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Healy Eames made the important point that this Bill will potentially assist 1,800 companies and provides an opportunity for business to engage with the banks.  I believe that those businesses which previously have not applied to the banks for credit will do so through this scheme.  The credit guarantee scheme, in conjunction with the microfinance loan fund, the legislation for which will be published tomorrow, are not a substitute for bank lending.  The banks have been recapitalised.  Banks need good business and businesses need banks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Banks are interested in making money.  It is important they refocus on their role.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Will a business be able to get loans from both?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The detail in that regard is not yet clear.  However, I believe a business&rsquo;s needs would be satisfied by one loan.  The domestic banks rely on successful businesses.  Senator Keane&rsquo;s concerns will be addressed on Committee Stage.  Business is about confidence.  The Government has enormous understanding, concern and respect for the 200,000 companies in the Irish economy that employ up to 655,000 people.  There has been much detailed work on this scheme.  My officials worked tirelessly on this Bill.  Getting it this far has been a torturous task.  The pillar banks have a particular role to play in this area.  With regard to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s point, alternative funding mechanisms such as crowd financing exist and these can be effective.  This is just one suite of measures we can potentially implement.  I have noted a range of comments from all sides of the House and I listened very actively.  I will consider them in advance of Committee Stage.  Some of the points were raised previously with regard to the charge, review and scheme.  We will take on board the points which were well made today.</P>
        <P>The Bill will help to restore confidence, which is an integral part of economic health.  It will also form an essential part of our recovery.  Business must develop sufficient confidence in the future to begin expanding order books and payrolls.  This is about creating jobs and the role of small enterprise.  The best examples in other European countries show it has been successfully operated.  In this country First-Step is a good example.  Recently, I attended an event also attended by companies which had been refused credit.  Instead they were funded by First-Step and have been very successful since.  Banks must again be willing and able to lend sufficiently to meet the needs of business.  Consumers must regain the confidence to spend again.  People must buy to support small companies which are the backbone of the economy and the engine of growth.  Our overall strategy is aimed at ensuring our citizens and businesses feel confident we have their interests at heart and that we are implementing necessary change.  The Government is concerned about, respects and will give service to small companies because we believe they are the engine of growth.</P>
        <P>Senator Keane made a point about women in business and we are very much taking this issue on board.  We have attended a number of events which recognise this with regard to the BRIC and European networks.  Behind most successful businesses is a great lady and I subscribe to this view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Deputy John Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>When it comes to credit control they are hard to beat.</P>
        <P>We must ensure we have an outlet for entrepreneurial initiative.  It is about the marketability of ideas and the chance to turn them into commercial products.  Ensuring entrepreneurs are confident about going into business and creating jobs is an essential element of government.  Ensuring Ireland is strongly perceived as a good place to do business is essential to generating this confidence.  We are committed to making Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business by 2016.  The Taoiseach is very committed to this and we are reducing the regulatory burden on business and cutting down the red tape, which is very important.  Access to credit is also important as is the recognition of employers.</P>
        <P>The Government has a legitimate and important role in improving the financial environment for small and medium enterprises.  Carefully designed legislative intervention such as this can help the market function better and gives certainty to businesses and confidence to consumers.  The legislation will inspire confidence among small and medium enterprises in the banks&rsquo; ability to provide an improved service to them as customers, including those who were previously discouraged from borrowing.  The Taoiseach has held the banks to account.  He has met the two pillar banks and I believe a simplified application form has been created.  Where someone has been refused credit the code of conduct means an internal review can be done and Mr. Trethowan&rsquo;s office has overturned 50% of the appeals it has received.  I strongly recommend people avail of this service.  I also encourage people to make applications and if they are refused not to be intimidated and to appeal it to Mr. Trethowan&rsquo;s office.  It has been frequently acknowledged that in the recent past a cohort of discouraged borrowers assumed they would be turned down and therefore did not apply for credit.  These are the people we want to encourage to make applications.  The introduction of a guarantee scheme may help to support this group to pursue business opportunities again.</P>
        <P>The majority of our enterprise sector comprises small business.  Now more than ever we need ambitious and energetic business owners, entrepreneurs and managers who can play a real part in driving a positive uplift in the economy.  Senator White said a former Minister stated if 50,000 companies created one extra job each at little or no cost to the State it would have a huge impact.  It would be a huge win-win for the Government.  We can encourage people and give them ten reasons to create a job and this is what the Government wants to do.  All too often the risk takers and innovators remain unseen and the hard work and entrepreneurial skills of these individuals lie at the heart of the success of our small and medium enterprises.  All of these companies have financing needs during the various stages of business development.</P>
        <P>A point was made about encouraging people on welfare to start a business.  There is no reason unemployed people who have an innovative idea should not be supported.  It is about having a simplified business plan that will stack up.  Obviously the banks will not give money to something that will fail and the risk is twice as high in recessionary times.  I believe simplified mentoring support and the role of the county enterprise boards will be important.  The Government plans to roll out one-stop shops for businesses and I have no doubt this will be part of the facilitation.  People will have the opportunity to work with banks and mentors.  Mentoring has been very successful with companies in the past and it will be needed now more than ever.  We have many successful business people who are determined to give something back and mentor a company at no charge.  I appeal to these people to do so.</P>
        <P>Along with starting up, other stages of business development at which financial needs arise are managing working capital, investing in new products and services, the commercialisation of knowledge, marketing strategies, innovation, research and development and expanding output.  It is essential that the financial system supports the needs of our small and medium enterprises through the stages.  Many businesses have contacted me about the problems caused by the difficulties in accessing credit.  Increased risk aversion among banks has made it significantly more difficult for smaller companies to obtain finance in recent years compared to before the crisis.  However, it is not all about obtaining money; it is about having a plan of action and sitting down with one&rsquo;s mentor and accountant to work on the management accounts and the monthly accounts which will show the profit and loss.</P>
        <P>People have a responsibility to go through a simplified but effective application for lending.  It is about engaging with the banks, which have indicated to me they are prepared to nominate a commercial liaison member of staff who would know the business.  The banks are also considering visiting customers at their business which is also very important.  Herein lies the mismatch between the needs of a productive business and the bank finance available.  Banks are trying to reduce risk but business lending, particularly to small and medium enterprises, is risky.  Entrepreneurship is risky but, as is said, no problem, no business.  There are always problems in business but Irish people have been very successful in the past when difficulties have arisen.  The suite of services, including the roll-out of the one-stop shops later this year, recognises the critical role of small and medium enterprises in the Irish economy and the Government is committed to it.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and all of the team in the Department is working in every way we can on legislation with regard to procurement, reducing the amount of red tape, access to credit and engaging with the banks.  Senator Landy is correct that it is very important to engage with the banks and we will discuss with them how best to arrange it.</P>

	<P>Introducing new products and services, exporting to emerging markets and innovation are all risky.  The Bill will enable the Government to absorb some of the risks of lending to businesses so they can get on with what they do best.  We must dismantle unnecessary barriers which stymie growth and hold back investment.  This is what the Government is determined to do and the Bill moves in this direction.</P>
        <P>Access to credit is crucial and consulting on the issue with business has been a major priority for me.  In conjunction with the Department of Finance I held a series of regional meetings to discuss access to credit with key stakeholders.  The meetings allowed Mr. John Moran, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, to hear first-hand the views and experiences of local business representatives, bank representatives and State agencies.  These meetings ensured Government policy on credit and small and medium enterprises are based on as much information as possible.  I met various companies on the margins of decisions on commercial lending to small and medium enterprises because they had insufficient security or the lender did not have the skills to carry out an appropriate assessment of the business.  It is essential to address this issue in a way that will not reduce the onus on banks to honour their commitments to increase overall lending to the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector but which would facilitate additional lending, over and above those commitments.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, this Bill is important legislation that will be of assistance in the Government&rsquo;s plans to reshape the financial landscape in order that it is more effective in meeting the needs of Irish business.  The Government is taking decisive action to create the environment that will support new companies, new jobs and new economic opportunities.  Such action keeps open the doors of Irish business, supports existing businesses to scale up and expand and facilitates more people, who have the ambition and drive, to set up their own businesses.  This Bill is just one of the many steps for delivery on such a challenging agenda.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;(4) If, in relation to an application under <i>subsection (2)</i>, the Minister is not satisfied having regard to the provisions of <i>section 4 </i>that it is appropriate to prescribe the organisation or body concerned as a prescribed organisation for the purposes of that section, he or she shall refuse the application.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated on Committee Stage on 12 June, I have tabled some minor amendments to clarify further the provisions of sections 5 and 6 of the Bill.  These sections deal with the prescribing of organisations and the prescribing of a class or classes of persons who work for those organisations.  The purpose of the sections is to allow that the defences set out in section 4 of the Bill will apply to these organisations and the relevant persons.  These provisions are important to ensure that organisations that provide counselling and crisis support to victims of offences can engage with the victims and can provide the necessary therapy and support without immediately being required to report the offences against the victim to the Garda.  I again highlight that such defences only apply in cases in which the organisation or person can show that it, he or she acted in the interests of the health and well-being of the victim concerned.  The purposes of the amendments that I have introduced are twofold.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 make a provision that the Minister can refuse an application for the designation, in respect of an organisation or in respect of a class or classes of persons, if the Minister is not satisfied that the organisation or classes of persons meet satisfactorily the requirements of section 4 of the Act.  This is implied by sections 5 and 6 of the published Bill but I have introduced these amendments to make this clear and explicit.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 provide that the Minister may revoke the prescribed status of organisations or class or classes of persons.  The amendments also provide that in such cases, the Minister will be required to notify the organisation before making such a decision and will be required to allow them to make a submission to the Minister, which will be taken into account before a decision is made.  Logically, given that the Bill provides a mechanism for the Minister to prescribe certain organisations and persons, there clearly also must be a mechanism for the Minister to revoke the decision to prescribe an organisation or classes of persons, should this be necessary.</P>

Th&aacute;inig meath agus f&aacute;s ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge agus n&iacute; m&oacute;r athr&uacute; chun &eacute; sin a leigheas.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In effect, the Bill has two primary aims, to provide for a statutory language planning process to support the Irish language, within the Gaeltacht and nationally, and to provide for amendments to the board and functions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  On the first point, this will be achieved in part by redesignating current Gaeltachta&iacute; in seven counties as 19 new Gaeltacht language planning areas that must draw up and implement a language plan if they are to remain strongholds of native Irish speakers.  This is a positive move.  It presents challenges to people in those areas but they must prove their viability as Gaeltachta&iacute; and I see no reason this should not happen.  The designation of Gaeltacht should mean something.  With this development, we should see growth in Gaeltacht areas.  There will be more strategic thinking and more benefits should flow from that.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is right when he says it is time for action.  Action in this area is long overdue and I want to see action that consults with all relevant stakeholders and then takes the necessary steps in the interests of all concerned.  I join with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill in expressing concern that all relevant stakeholders be properly consulted in the legislative process.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt there will be dissenting voices but action must be taken and I am confident the vision outlined in the Bill is the correct vision.  It is essential, as the Minister of State pointed out, that the Gaeltacht is based on linguistic, not geographical, areas, although geography will always be relevant.  For some this is a serious issue and it may not be politically palatable but we must think of the national interest and that interest lies in sustainable Gaeltachta&iacute; where the language is actually spoken.</P>
        <P>The Bill also introduces new ideas to promote language usage both within and outside of the Gaeltacht.  Under the Bill, towns can be designated Gaeltacht service towns and urban areas will be able to join Irish language networks where the language is widely used in the community.  This will be welcome in Dublin.  I am concerned, however, about the exact measures that will be used to define an Irish language network.  How will that be measured and what are the metrics of success?</P>
        <P>I welcome the progress being made with this Bill.  While there will be critics, I am glad to see the Minister of State is bringing a much needed sense of dynamism and rejuvenation to the Department and I am glad to support the Bill.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach chun Bille na Gaeltachta 2012 a phl&eacute;.  The Bill makes provision for the potential geographic redefinition of the Gaeltacht and will, for the first time, provide for a statutory language planning process for the Gaeltacht, towns in or adjacent to the Gaeltacht that service Gaeltacht areas and communities outside the Gaeltacht that have made progress in restoring Irish as a community language.  Mar at&aacute; a fhios ag gach duine anseo inniu, t&aacute; a l&aacute;n fadhbanna leis an teanga.  Despite the census last year that showed an increase of 7.1% in the number who can speak Irish, with 1.77 million people able to speak the language, the comprehensive linguistic study of the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht has found results that are worrying for the language.  Nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ar mo laethanta saoire i mbliana, bh&iacute; m&eacute; ar Oile&aacute;n Acla i gConamara agus sa Daingean.  Bh&iacute; an-d&iacute;oma orm mar n&iacute;or chuala m&eacute; a l&aacute;n Gaeilge.  The study has shown a continued language shift towards English in the Gaeltacht and concluded that, without urgent remedial action, the Irish language may only have a lifespan of 15 to 20 years as a community and household language in the Gaeltacht.  This is a very worrying development and I hope this Bill will help to retain and vigorously encourage the use of Irish not only in the Gaeltacht but in the island of Ireland as a whole.</P>
        <P>The first aim of the Bill is to provide for a statutory language planning process which will designate the existing Gaeltachta&iacute; as a number of Gaeltacht language planning areas, as referred to by Senator Noone.  These GLPAs will comprise electoral divisions in which a significant proportion of the population are active Irish speakers and in respect of which language plans have been agreed by the communities concerned with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The ultimate aim of this language planning process is to strengthen the use of the Irish language which must be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I would have to ask Minister of State, however, why this Bill will place all GLPAs on an equal footing when it is clear that there are large differences in the vitality of the language among different areas within the Gaeltacht.  The comprehensive linguistic study recommended that resources should be focused on areas based on their specific needs.  In these difficult economic times it is incumbent upon us to use resources efficiently in order to get the best value for money.  By placing all GLPAs on an equal footing, we are not offering the best value for money to the electorate.</P>
        <P>The Bill refers to Gaeltacht service towns, towns that are in or adjacent to GLPAs and deliver public services to these areas.  The Bill envisages language plans being put in place for these Gaeltacht service towns also.</P>
        <P>A commendable provision in this Bill is the designation of Irish language networks, which are Irish language communities that are outside the existing Gaeltacht.  It is clear that there are a number of areas outside what is currently regarded as the Gaeltacht in which Irish is used as a community language and it is this type of initiative that should be encouraged.  T&aacute; aiteanna ann sna bailte m&oacute;ra cos&uacute;il le Clondalkin and Ballymun ina mb&iacute;onn a l&aacute;n daoine ag labhairt na Gaeilge gach l&aacute; and they need to be encouraged to continue using the Irish language.  I hope this Bill will help to maintain the use of the Irish language in these areas.  Ennis in County Clare aims to be a bilingual town by 2017.  This is a fantastic endeavour and I hope the Minister will see that sufficient resources are given to Ennis and other areas that are striving to become bilingual.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second aspect of this Bill relates to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, and this was referred to by Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and Mac Conghail.  The purpose of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is to &ldquo;develop the Gaeltacht economy to preserve and enrich the Irish language as its principal language.&rdquo;  I know from the time I spent when I was a young lad in Gaeltacht areas how important &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta can be, how it provided services and established cooperatives, helping people to develop their own industries.  However, in reviewing the role of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in 2005, the former Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs received some startling submissions from the public which included allegations that the &uacute;dar&aacute;s was in fact contributing to the demise of the Irish language by not ensuring that companies it supported actually implemented their obligations towards the Irish language.  There was a consensus that the &uacute;dar&aacute;s was not sufficiently focused on language affairs.  This is clear when you look at the findings of one Irish language commentator, Donncha &Oacute; h&Eacute;allaithe, who stated: &ldquo;Sara re&aacute;cht&aacute;ladh an toghch&aacute;n deireanach don &uacute;dar&aacute;s in Aibre&aacute;n 2004 rinne m&eacute; mionscagadh ar mhiontuairisc&iacute; na gcruinnithe a bh&iacute; ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s thar tr&eacute;imhse bliana agus fuair m&eacute; amach n&aacute;r arda&iacute;odh ceist na Gaeilge ach aon uair amh&aacute;in.&rdquo;  Is rud an-truamh&eacute;alach &eacute; sin, agus feicimid nach bhfuil an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s ag d&eacute;anamh oibre chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
        <P>This Bill will make a number of changes relating to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  lt abolishes the requirement for direct elections to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and replaces it with a new system.  That system has received a mixed reception from Gaeltacht residents and Irish language commentators.  Both Conradh na Gaeilge and Guth na Gaeltachta are against the abolition of the electoral process and I can understand their frustrations to a degree.  The new process would also see the board reduced from 20 members to 12 members.</P>
        <P>The first issue with this is that there are seven county councils within Gaeltacht areas but only five members of the board to represent them.  The proposal is that four members would be nominated from the county councils of Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry and the final county council nomination would be filled in rotation every two years by a member nominated by one of the county councils of Cork, Waterford and Meath.  There are two issues with this: the counties of Cork, Waterford and Meath will only have representation on the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta for two years out of every six, and the term of the board is five years so the last member in the rotation would serve one year on one board and the second year on the next board.</P>
        <P>The Bill allows for the Minister to appoint the other seven nominees to the board provided they possess a level of expertise and experience that is necessary.  Can the Minister of State outline c&eacute;n s&oacute;rt taith&iacute; agus scilleanna a bheidh riachtanach le bheith tofa?  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeadh s&eacute; n&iacute;os fearr na poist seo a chur ar <i>publicjobs.ie</i>, mar a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Domhnaill.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister of State will address those questions in this response.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it ach n&iacute; chuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an mBille seo.  Easnamh daonlathach &mdash; democratic deficit, that is what this Bill represents.  Quoting the wikipedia reference to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta:</P>
        <P LI="1">&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is run by a board.  A unique feature of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeilge is that 17 members of the 20 member board are directly elected from constituencies in Gaeltacht areas.  This is in contrast to every other State-sponsored body in Ireland, where the board members are appointed directly by the relevant Minister, with the result that most are party political members.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is what appears on websites globally and today we are being asked to do away with that.  It is a shame and I ask the Minister of State not to proceed with that.  The Gaeltachta&iacute; are extremely weak and will not be adequately represented by those from outside the Gaeltacht.  Can the people of the Gaeltacht in R&aacute;th Chairn be represented by people from Bettystown?  These are vital linguistic communities that have kept a spoken language going when we have nearly destroyed it by excessive emphasis on grammar and a rigid approach.  The B&eacute;arla briste people speak in the European Union and the soccer players speaking where people do not correct their grammar has made English a language spoken by 1.5 million people.</P>
        <P>We are trying to keep a language that is now down to 77,000 people.  If we undermine the Gaeltachta&iacute; by denying them their democratic representation, that will be the death knell of our language.  These are vital linguistic communities and I cannot see the language surviving outside the Gaeltacht.  I was in An Spid&eacute;al at the weekend as my daughter is studying there and I noticed that the situation has weakened there over the past 20 years.  If the Gaeltacht is undermined and An Spid&eacute;al is allowed to be represented by somebody from Portumna or somebody from 80 miles away, the connection will be lost with the Irish speaking community on which we depend.  Any revival of the Irish language must be based on the Gaeltacht and I believe it is a shame that somebody has advised the Department to do away with that democratic representation.</P>
        <P>We should not allow Irish be lost as a spoken language as it is such a complicated written language, with strict rules which most young people find appalling.  We do not use the &ldquo;mol an &oacute;ige&rdquo; approach with regard to the language but are extremely critical with regard to this complex language.  Therefore, undermine the Gaeltacht and the language will disappear quickly.  I urge the Minister of State please to keep the democratic representation.  It is unique and worth praise.  The fact the Government will not tolerate even one board with a majority of democratically elected people says something about the public administration which brought this country to its knees in the past number of years, something the Minister of State and his colleagues are trying to solve now.  Bureaucratic people abolishing democracy is something that is damaging in itself.  It is particularly damaging where it affects a fragile linguistic community, as is any Gaeltacht area.  I have submitted an amendment in this regard &mdash; I met the deadline &mdash; but I urge the Minister of State to reconsider the issue over the weekend because this proposal will do the language no good at all.</P>
        <P>Other aspects of the Bill should be addressed, such as the budget.  Some half of the budget, over &euro;9 million out of &euro;18 million, of the &uacute;dar&aacute;s goes on administration.  Capital grants came to &euro;5 million and current expenditure came to &euro;3 million.  Could we not look at the budget to see whether it is possible to make changes?  The analysis done on the Bill by the Oireachtas Library shows that the bulk of the money is spent in the category C areas, not category A, which are the ones we are trying to promote.  Can we not do this better and retain the democratic element?</P>
        <P>I apologise for not speaking in Irish.  I was getting a lesson in Irish and had been told this debate would be at 4 p.m., but because it was changed, my preparation was less than I would have wanted it to be.  The debate was changed three times, from 4 p.m. to 3 p.m. and then to 2.30 p.m.  However, the important point is that these linguistic communities are essential if the language is to survive.  We would like to see it extend into language development areas, but to remove democratic representation from the people who have kept our language going would be a serious mistake.  I ask the Government to reconsider.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There is a provision which amends the functions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus bh&iacute; a l&aacute;n daoine ag labhairt faoi thoghch&aacute;n and the democratic process being removed.  Democracy must play its role and it is good we have elections to boards but because this is a specialised area for language planning, it is vital we get the right people on boards.  A methodology of appointments like the system used by TG4, where recommendations would be made to the Minister by those qualified in language planning, would be of benefit.  Donncha &Oacute; h&Eacute;allaithe carried out a study that pointed out that enterprise takes pride of place, and rightly so, in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, and that the language was only discussed once at a meeting before the elections in 2004.  If the language is not a priority with the board, it is important to have the right people on boards, not just people sitting on boards for electoral purposes.</P>
        <P>Under the strategic language planning process, the Bill provides for the designation of existing Gaeltachta&iacute; as a number of direct Gaeltacht language planning areas using language planning criteria rather than geographical criteria.  I understand provision for amendments to the functions of Bord na Gaeilge are necessary to support the proposed statutory language planning process.  I presume there is other legislation to address that.</P>
        <P>The Bill makes provision for areas within the existing Gaeltacht to be designated Gaeltacht language planning areas.  It would be important to define the role of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s is answerable to the Oireachtas while Foras na Gaeilge is answerable to the North-South Ministerial Council.  We must marry the two and ensure the competences and areas of responsibility for both are not duplicated.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s should not be left trailing, particularly in the designated areas.  Can the Minister overrule or choose particular enterprises?</P>
        <P>Abolition of the regional councils weakens &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and I ask the Minister of State to consider that again.  The Bill provides that the Minister may designate a Gaeltacht planning area by order.  What process would this involve and what would be the criteria?  It is based on the language planning process published in April and 19 is a large number.  Perhaps smaller areas should be considered.  Will those smaller areas be represented on the board?</P>
        <P>The approach taken in the Bill differs from that recommended in the linguistic study and is not classified by linguistic vitality.  What was the basis for that decision?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  An staid&eacute;ar cuimsitheach teangeola&iacute;och laid out a rather stark scenario for the future of the language and stated there was approximately from 15 to 20 years to save the Irish language as a living household language in the Gaeltacht.  This is the case, particularly in smaller Gaeltachta&iacute; around the country.  In my county of Waterford, An Rinn Gaeltacht needs support.  It needs economic and social support.  It needs support in terms of job creation, so as to stem outward migration and it needs support in terms of investment in language planning, not just from the &uacute;dar&aacute;s, but from the State.</P>
        <P>Many of the provisions of this Bill, such as the language planning provisions, are to be welcomed.  The most contentious issue, borne out by the representations made to us from people who live in Gaeltacht areas, from people who support the language and its development and from Irish language advocacy groups, is the removal of the representation of people elected to the boards.  That is the critical issue.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of any organisation that advocates on behalf of the language that supports what the Minister of State is doing.  Today, we got the formal publication of the Constituency Commission report and I am sure politicians, political anoraks and all sorts of people are poring over its findings.  It is interesting that while that report and whatever legislation follows on it is being considered, this legislation does away entirely with democratically elected representation for Gaeltacht communities.</P>
        <P>Senator D&rsquo;Arcy asked what difference it makes and whether it is really important for each Gaeltacht area to have a representative on the board of the &uacute;dar&aacute;s and whether it is more important for them to be elected or appointed.  What people want is critically important.  That is what democracy is about.  I made the point, in the context of a different Bill, on the need for localism rather than more centralisation and the creation of more democratic deficits.  We have far too much of that when we consider what is happening in Europe and Ireland.  We need as much localism and democratic representation as we can get.</P>
        <P>The issue here is that we want a bottom-up approach, rather than the top-down approach where people are appointed.  I already referred to my own county and the Gaeltacht area of An Rinn and An Sean Phobal.  We will now see the people in these and other such areas being unable to elect somebody to represent them and their interests and the needs of their community on the board.  The county councils will have a say, but the county council representatives are not the right people to make the call for the Gaeltacht areas.  It should be the people who live in those communities.  Already, they do not have representation for the full six years, only for two of the six years of the board&rsquo;s lifetime.  Therefore, it is understandable why these communities have genuine concerns with regard to the provisions of this Bill.</P>
        <P>There is a democratic deficit at the heart of the Bill.  Senator Heffernan made the point that the board of the &uacute;dar&aacute;s was more than just about protecting the language.  I am aware of that from all of the engagements I have had with people who live in the Gaeltacht in Waterford, and I am sure the situation is similar throughout the country.  The board and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has done a significant amount for those communities and has a lot to offer, beyond supporting the language.  It is about economic development and job creation, or at least it should be.  It is also about social development.  The people who understand this best are the people who live in these communities.  It is a bad move on the part of the Government to go down this road.  It is undemocratic and farcical and for those reasons Sinn F&eacute;in will oppose the Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh will go into more detail with regard to other provisions with which Sinn F&eacute;in has a difficulty.  My concern today does not just relate to County Waterford and its Gaeltacht, although it is important.  It is that this proposal has an impact on all Gaeltacht areas.  It is about local democracy and defending local democracy.  It seems that what the Government is doing with regard to political reform is simply cutting numbers, as if that is the real solution.  It proposes to cut the number of local councils, merge Waterford City and County Council, get rid of the elected representative from the bord of the &uacute;dar&aacute;s and to cut the number of D&aacute;il Deputies.  However, it is not really dealing with the powers and responsibilities of any of these boards, local authorities, the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.  The cuts are being made to save money although they may not even do that.  However there are no real reforms coming and there is no real reform with regard to the needs of the communities in this Bill either.</P>
        <P>These are the reasons I will oppose this Bill.  I cannot support a Bill which creates even more of a democratic deficit in this country.  There is already far too much of a deficit.  We need more localism and more democratic input into decisions being made.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus f&aacute;ilte roimh an mBille freisin.  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceist t&aacute;bhachtach agam.  This Gaeltacht Bill must be a major step towards saving our language, which has been under threat for some time, despite the discussion and trial and error approaches we have had over the years.  This Bill provides an opportunity for a debate and we must see that opportunity and not rush the legislation.  I urge the Cathaoirleach to convey that message to the Leader of the House.  This is too important an opportunity to mess up.  Therefore, for amendments to be submitted by tomorrow morning is too short a time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill focuses on the linguistic rather than the geographic areas, which is quite a different policy from the current approach.  Will the proposed 19 new planning areas be called Gaeltachta&iacute;?  Will there be Gaeltacht areas?  Senator Barrett raised an important point about the concept of linguistic communities.  Of the 90,000 people living in Gaeltacht areas, we have 23,000 people speaking the language daily currently.  Do those 23,000 speakers need the Gaeltacht area to legitimise and support their use of the Irish language?  What evidence is available on that?  I used to teach Irish, yet I am not delivering my contribution through Irish, because I do not think I can properly express the importance and complexity of this issue through Irish.  Shame on me.  I have always pointed out that while schools and Gaelscoileanna teach Irish, we live in communities.  It is the communities we need to speak Irish, not individuals spread throughout the country.  Language is interactive and it needs community legitimacy to support it.  What will the 19 planning areas be called?  Will they be called Gaeltachta&iacute;?</P>
        <P>I would be delighted if all the deontais the Department gives Connemara currently were spread around the 19 Gaeltachta&iacute;.  I often point out how generous the Minister of State is to west Connemara.</P>

This will be organic, bottom-up and good and may be better than any democracy.  It is not the approach of the Bill to increase the number of speakers of the language.</P>

	<P>If that is all I have left I had better keep going.  How many of the 23,000 who speak Irish daily currently live in Gaeltacht areas?  Scoileanna l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge, Gaeltacht schools and small rural schools in Gaeltacht areas are an important resource.  How will the Bill be supportive of them?</P>
        <P>I hear the point regarding changes to the &uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I support democracy, but the ultimate purpose of the Bill should be to ensure that the Irish language grows.  I will support whatever methodology will achieve that.  I ask the Minister of State to keep this matter under review.  If the proposed format, with a focused and more driven board and people nominated to it who will ensure that the language grows, does not work, the Minister of State should review it after a three year period.</P>
        <P>I also like the point about Irish language networks outside the Gaeltacht.  At the briefing, the Minister of State mentioned a new family support programme so that mothers who want language support would receive it, from the day their child is born.  Will that support be statutory and how will it be resourced?  Will special incentives attach to the new &uacute;dar&aacute;s format in the 19 language planning areas around the country?</P>

	<P>Ag dul taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, baineann an strait&eacute;is leis an t&iacute;r ar fad.  T&aacute; pobal taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht at&aacute; ag d&eacute;anamh an-chuid oibre ag cur na Gaeilge chun cinn.  Sin &eacute; an f&aacute;th go luaimid l&iacute;onra&iacute; Gaeilge.  Thug m&eacute; cuairt ar go leor acu, &aacute;iteanna ina bhfuil na bunscoileanna, na Gaelscoileanna, &aacute;iteanna cos&uacute;il le Ceatharlach, Cluain Dolc&aacute;in agus cathair na Gaillimhe.  Beidh Foras na Gaeilge, a bhfuil c&uacute;raim&iacute; uile-Eireann air, ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis seo agus dul ar aghaidh leis an obair at&aacute; idir l&aacute;mha aige.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh f&oacute;cas n&iacute;os fearr ann ach t&aacute; air dul ar aghaidh leis an obair at&aacute; &aacute; d&eacute;anamh aige.  T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go mbeidh 250,000 cainteoir leath&uacute;il Gaeilge sa t&iacute;r faoin strait&eacute;is 20 bliain.  T&aacute; s&eacute; uaillmhianach ach m&aacute; chuirimid chuige, is f&eacute;idir &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.</P>
        <P>San daon&aacute;ireamh deireanach in 2011, bh&iacute; 96,000 ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht agus 23,000 a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge gach l&aacute;.  Sa chuid eile den t&iacute;r, bh&iacute; 1.77 milli&uacute;n a deir go bhfuil eolas acu ar an Ghaeilge.

        <P>T&aacute; m&eacute; ag tagairt don chrith tal&uacute;n a tharla coic&iacute;s &oacute; shin amach &oacute; ch&oacute;sta Mhuigheo.  Bu&iacute;ochas le Dia, n&iacute; raibh aon tubaist mh&oacute;r i gceist leis, &oacute; thaobh daoine a bheith gortaithe n&oacute; mar sin.  Ach cuireann s&eacute; imni ar phobal Mhuigheo agus ar phobal na h&Eacute;ireann go dtarl&oacute;dh a leith&eacute;id de rud.

        <P>I raise the issue of the potential impact of the earthquake off the coast of County Mayo on gas and oil infrastructure off the west coast.  We know that this is a very contentious issue and that the rigging is very complicated.  There are many potential dangers associated with the industry.  The earthquake was unexpected and not predicted.  Was the impact of an earthquake taken into consideration when environmental impact statements were produced during the planning process for the gas pipeline in question?  The Government needs to carry out an independent examination of the gas well structures, the offshore pipeline and the processing refinery at Bellanaboy to ensure no damage has been done, bearing in mind that the infrastructure is unique.  It will be impossible to judge whether there has been damage without an independent inquiry or investigation.  We certainly should not just take the word of the oil companies on an issue such as this, as is evident from what occurred in the Gulf of Mexico, etc.  They oil can be economical with the truth when telling us how efficient their infrastructure is.  Stating very quickly after an earthquake that everything is hunky-dory based on information given to us by an oil company is very dangerous.</P>
        <P>Should a stability analysis be conducted on Dooncarton Hill, where there were large-scale landslides a number of years ago?  I appreciate this may not be covered by the Minister&rsquo;s answer, but he might revert to me on it.</P>
        <P>During an oral hearing by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the gas pipeline, local residents attempted to refer to the potential consequences of an earthquake, in addition to the effects tunnelling under Sruwaddacon Estuary would have on the stability of Dooncarton Hill, for example.  These concerns were dismissed and deemed unworthy of consideration.  It appears that there are more occurrences such as earthquakes worldwide.  The State needs to ensure the safety of the people is paramount.  It should not put the wishes of large multinational companies before the needs and rights of citizens and ensure the oil and gas infrastructure is checked in order that we can be assured there is no potential for a disaster in the future.  The planning process ought to take into consideration potential occurrences such as earthquakes.</P>
        <P>The Minister should clarify again that the work being done had nothing to do with the earthquake happening in the first instance.  It is a vague possibility, a long shot, but it is a question that must be answered.  People in the local community are asking it.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an Aire agus t&aacute; m&eacute; ag s&uacute;il go m&oacute;r lena fhreagra a chloiste&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>I am grateful to the Senator for his contribution to this debate.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the independent expert consultants engaged by my Department to monitor compliance with the conditions of the Corrib consents under the gas and petroleum Acts that pipelines are normally designed taking account of the largest loads they are likely to experience during their lifetime, including transport, loading, installation and operation.  Operational loads include those due to the pressure and flow of the fluid they contain and externally imposed loads from the environment, both normal and accidental, such as earthquake loading.  The normal practice is to design the pipeline to withstand the largest of these loads taking account of the likelihood of extreme events.</P>
        <P>I am further advised that, in the case of the Corrib pipeline, the original design pressure of 345 bar and the forces imposed during the laying of the offshore section will have determined the strength and, therefore, material and wall thickness of the pipe.  In the North Sea and north Atlantic regions these loads dominate over the environmental or accidental loadings and provide a margin of safety for loadings due to earthquakes experienced in the region.  The risk of earthquakes of magnitude five or more is assessed by the British Geological Survey as less than very low, the lowest risk assigned to any area.  I am advised that earthquakes of magnitude less than five in these low-risk areas will not give rise to forces on the pipeline greater than its design allows for.  The Corrib pipeline design documentation states that as the area is categorised as less than very low for earthquake risk, in accordance with the relevant codes, the pipeline design incorporates no specific provision for seismic activity.  The design documents also considered seismic events leading to a release from the subsea equipment and onshore in the qualitative risk assessment.  However, based on the code criteria, these were screened out as being a non-credible cause for loss of containment.  It should also be noted that the British Geological Survey reference on which this is based only addresses events of magnitude five and higher.  The magnitude 4.0 earthquake that occurred 60 km off the north Mayo coast on 6 June was located in a geological fault system that drops the Slyne-Rockall basins down to the west of the Irish shelf.  These naturally occurring faults, formed millions of years ago, have had a long geological history and are related to the continuing opening of the Atlantic Ocean.  While the location and magnitude of this event were, as the Senator noted, unexpected, there is a clear geological reason for it.  I am advised that future seismic activity along the fault system may be anticipated but not of significantly larger magnitude.</P>
        <P>The magnitude was far below the threshold for generation of a seismogenic tsunami or to cause significant structural damage.  Shell E &amp; P Ireland Limited has informed my Department that the Corrib wells and manifold were inspected by a subsea support vessel after the earthquake and that it has confirmed there has been no impact on the facilities.  A report will follow to confirm this, which will be reviewed by my Department in liaison with its independent consultants.  Shell also has advised that the observations of the pipeline system confirm that there is no issue with the integrity of the pipeline.  The Corrib pipeline is scheduled to be inspected this summer and survey reports will follow.  These reports also will be considered by my Department and reviewed by the consultants.  Before the Corrib gas project can commence production of gas, it will be the subject of a safety assessment in accordance with the Commission for Energy Regulation&rsquo;s recently published petroleum safety framework.</P>

	<P>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimhe sin.  During the development of this project one argument made has been that many opinions have been based on the information provided by Shell E &amp; P Ireland.  I imagine the data for the decisions taken or the conclusions drawn by the Department are based on data from Shell E &amp; P Ireland.  While I will not cast any aspersion on the company, it is known, on foot of disasters that have befallen this type of company worldwide, that sometimes some oil companies are not fully forthcoming with data and somewhat lenient regarding the truth.  Does the Minister intend to have an independent assessment carried out by the Department on the pipeline to ensure he and his Department will be fully satisfied there is no danger to communities along the western seaboard in the event that there is a similar earthquake?  Incidentally, it was reported by the media as being of a magnitude of 5.8 as opposed to 4.0, but will such an assessment be carried out to satisfy the Department that a similar event would not result in any damage and, therefore, be of concern to the people of north Mayo and the west?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is the case that, in the first instance, the company will carry out this assessment and report to the Department.  However, that report will be subject to analysis by the Department and independent consultants retained by it.  This is important.  As I have indicated to the Senator, the pipeline is scheduled to be inspected this summer and as a result, the survey reports will be given to the Department.  Again, with the technical expertise available to it, it will assess them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise the issue of the Gweedore sewerage scheme, or sc&eacute;im s&eacute;arachais Ghaoth Dobhair as it is commonly known.  It is a scheme that should have been built many years ago but has not been to date.  I recall reading archived notes dating back to the 1940s and 1950s, when the local Deputy at the time, Cormac Breslin, who was Ceann Comhairle in the Lower House, was raising the issue in the D&aacute;il of the need for a sewerage scheme in the Gweedore parish area.  There is no such scheme and even though it is a rural area, it contains the twin towns of Bunbeg and Derrybeg in which many people live.  It is actually the most densely populated rural area in western Europe.  Since before I became a member of Donegal County Council in 1994, the council was working on trying to progress a serwerage scheme through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for the parish extending from Gweedore to Glassagh.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Department ruled subsequently that the scheme would have to be much tighter than this and confined to the Bunbeg-Derrybeg catchment area.</P>
        <P>I understand significant progress has been made by Donegal County Council which has submitted all or most of the required documentation to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and is awaiting approval to seek tenders for the construction of the Gweedore sewerage scheme.  The urgency attached to the project cannot be over-estimated because if the septic tank legislation comes into force and inspections take place in the area of Gweedore around Bunbeg and Derrybeg, most of the septic tanks there will fail to meet the standards set down or proposed under the regulations to be published by the Minister under the wastewater legislation enacted.  I fear that unless the sewerage scheme is put in place, people will face sanctions as a result.  Moreover, this will be through no fault of their own because ultimately the State, in conjunction with the local authority, should provide the funding for the sewerage scheme.  I hope progress is being made in the Department, which is the reason I have raised the matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Senator is aware, I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who is in Rio de Janeiro on Government business.  I thank the Senator for providing me with the opportunity to clarify the position on the development of proposals for, and the procurement of, further wastewater facilities in the Gweedore area.</P>
        <P>The Gweedore sewerage scheme is included in the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2010-13 as a scheme to start construction during the lifetime of the programme.  The proposed scheme will comprise one or two contracts providing for a treatment plant capable of dealing with effluent from a population equivalent of 4,550 and a sewer network of approximately 21 km, serving the core areas of Dore, Bunbeg and Derrybeg, and a 5.7 km outfall.  The estimated cost of this work is &euro;11.4 million.  I believe progress has been made since the late Deputy Cormac Breslin was seized of the issue.</P>
        <P>The scheme is one element of the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2010-13 which consists of 340 contracts to be progressed to construction during the period of the programme, with a value of &euro;1.8 billion, as well as a further 190 schemes, on which planning is being advanced.  Following a review of the programme in 2011, a further 24 contracts, with a value of &euro;57 million, were added.  In Donegal, there are 15 contracts at, or due to start, construction during the lifetime of the programme, at a total estimated value of &euro;80 million, including major sewerage schemes in Letterkenny and Killybegs.  A further 11 contracts are at planning stage.</P>
        <P>Donegal County Council&rsquo;s design review report for the Gweedore scheme is with the Department, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has said.  However, the Department has sought further clarification on a number of issues and will continue to liaise with council with a view to progressing the scheme as quickly as possible.</P>
