    <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien">
      <NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">Yesterday I asked about the notice the Minister for Finance received with regard to the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; initiative to send 150,000 letters to senior citizens.  The Leader said yesterday he did not believe any notice was given to the Minister.  I do not believe that, nor do I believe what the Taoiseach said to my party leader yesterday.  The Government cannot simply wash its hands of this; it is in office to govern.  I do not believe in any way that there would have been no discussion between the Revenue Commissioners and <Col N="598" />the Department of Finance on an initiative to collect &euro;45 million, and that the Minister for Finance, at the very least, would not have known about this.  I ask the Leader to confirm whether the Minister actually had notice of this initiative of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>We will all be concerned by the news from Ulster Bank this morning that 600 people will be losing their jobs in the bank in the Republic, and that 350 will lose theirs in the North.  The Leader will recall that on a number of occasions last year I raised the issue of Aviva.  Some 900 staff in Aviva will be losing their jobs some time this year.  They do not know what sections or staff will be affected.  Colleagues on this side of the House and I made a suggestion to the Government that an audit of businesses at risk be carried out and that contingency plans be put in place in areas where there may be job losses.  The financial services and banking sectors are sectors in which it is very clear there will be further losses.  There is talk of another 2,000 staff redundancies in AIB this year.  What plan has the Government to deal with the mounting job losses in this sector?  What contact, if any, has the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation had with Aviva since its announcement in the summer and with Ulster Bank and the other banking institutions?  Thousands of jobs may be lost and it is important that the Government not only react to each announcement, when it is made, but also put in place a plan to deal with the thousands of staff who will, unfortunately, lose their jobs.</P>
      <P>Even with the jobs budget, which became a jobs initiative, and the other jobs initiative announced by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, yesterday, the unemployment rate last year rose to an average of 14.2%, up from 13.8% in the previous year.  It is as clear as the nose on one&rsquo;s face that the jobs initiative is simply not working.  Based on the European Commission&rsquo;s report, which was quite critical of the Government&rsquo;s budget in that the amount of money cut from our capital programme was far too great, it appears the cuts will further depress any chance of growth in the economy.  The VAT increase of two percentage points will put further pressure on an already strained retail sector.  I am glad we are to have a discussion in the House next week on jobs but the staff in Ulster Bank, Aviva, AIB and Bank of Ireland and I want to know now the plans the Government has in place to assist staff at this very difficult time.</P>
      <P>I will not ask again about the mortgage arrears implementation strategy.  The people to whom I refer have mortgages and young families.  It is three months since the issuing of the Keane report but nothing has been done.  When can we expect the much-vaunted plan to assist people in mortgage arrears to be published and, more important, implemented by the Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik">
      <NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
      <P>As with Senator O&rsquo;Brien and all other Senators, I am very concerned by the announcement of prospective job losses in Ulster Bank and by the news that there are likely to be other job losses in other banks.  It is a matter of real concern and emphasises the importance of the jobs strategy the Government announced yesterday.  It will be launching a more detailed plan in the coming week.  We must feel sympathy for the staff who face potential job losses.  This prospect obliges all of us to think more creatively about job creation and activation measures.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Burton, has spoken persuasively about the need to ensure social protection strategies are geared towards retraining, activation and getting people back into the jobs market.  I agree with Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien that the Members of this House will have an opportunity to engage in some brainstorming on this matter next week.  As part of a new method of debate, no Minister will be present for the discussion.  I have been reflecting on the experience of my legal background to consider how the high level of legal knowledge and training in this House can be used to try to generate jobs and resources for society.  We can all <Col N="599" />come up with interesting and creative ideas that are informed by our particular backgrounds.  A particular strength of the Seanad might be as the forum for such a constructive debate.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I call for a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills.  I assure my colleagues that I have been trying to ensure the Minister, Deputy Quinn, comes to the House for a general debate.  The Minister will be present for legislative debates, but Senators would like him to come here for a more general debate as well.  We were all glad to hear the Minister announce last night that the impact of budgetary changes on DEIS schools will be reviewed.  He said the Department of Education and Skills will report on the position of DEIS band 1 and band 2 schools within four weeks.  I was particularly pleased to hear that the report will focus on how the loss of posts under the older schemes will affect such schools.  I think we will see a renewed commitment to the maintenance of supports for students in DEIS schools.  We need a bigger debate in light of the reports that have been commissioned by the Minister on the extent to which programmes like DEIS ensure greater educational opportunity for students.  I understand the reports in question are being published today.  We need to examine carefully the impact of DEIS and the other schemes.  We should reflect on whether, in some ways, we are allowing for the segregation of economic classes within our schools.  We have to be careful about the way our school system is run.</P>
      <P>I welcome the presence of officials from the Revenue Commissioners and other bodies at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  It was an important demonstration of the exercise of the investigative powers of Oireachtas committees.  The ham-fisted attempts of the Revenue Commissioners to inform people of potential tax liabilities have been the subject of significant public concern.  The failure of the Revenue Commissioners to stay on top of this matter on an ongoing basis clearly points to an inefficiency in the system.  Many people felt shock and unnecessary fear when they considered their possible tax liabilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett">
      <NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I express sympathy to the widow and family of the late John Ross, a former Member of this House, who died during the Christmas vacation.  His son, Shane, is a current Member of the D&aacute;il.  Mr. Ross represented the Dublin University constituency in this House for three years.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The 40% increase in the levy on private health insurance is a problem that has arisen.  During our lengthy discussion on the matter on 8 December last, I pointed out that the Department of Health has been in breach of decisions of the European court and the Supreme Court in this country.  I mentioned that the Milliman report has shown that many of VHI&rsquo;s problems are generated internally by subjecting people to excessive hospitalisation.  The report states that a VHI customer getting a medical implant will be admitted to hospital as an inpatient for 10.6 days, on average, and suggests the correct figure should be 3.7 days.  Equally, it points out that VHI pays out for 7.5 days, on average rather than 3.7 days, in the case of a surgical inpatient admission.  When we asked about the report, the Cathaoirleach clarified that an unredacted version of the Milliman report should have been distributed to those Senators who attended the debate in question.  I suggest that the 40% increase would probably not have been necessary if there had been a full debate on the Milliman report.  That is a serious point.  It is important that the report be circulated because it makes a serious criticism to the effect that VHI causes many of its own problems.  It contradicts VHI&rsquo;s cherished belief that its problems are caused by other companies going out and deliberately recruiting younger people.  There is no evidence that health insurers have refused to recruit older people.  Serious issues of efficiency in the health service are raised by the Milliman report.  I thought we concluded last month&rsquo;s debate with the understanding that the Minister would circulate the report to enable it to be debated here.  The prospect of throwing good money after bad, as part of a policy that <Col N="600" />is designed to protect VHI from competition rather than to deal with older people, arises in this context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">We are all concerned about the job losses at Ulster Bank, to which Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien has drawn attention.  However, I do not think we should engage in scaremongering regarding AIB, which is 99% owned by the State.  It was suggested in the past that a serious number of job losses might be proposed.  As I understand it, talks between the Irish Bank Officials Association and the bank are ongoing.  We should not prejudge the outcome of those talks by coming up with a headline figure of job losses which might not arise.  While there might not have been consultation between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance on the other matter to which Senator O&rsquo;Brien alluded, I am sure there will be contact between the institution in question and the Department of Finance in this case.  We should steady ourselves. </P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Quinn, on his U-turn regarding DEIS schools, approximately 20 of which are in my constituency.  It seems that the sideline tactics of Labour Party Deputies and Senators at parliamentary party level have reaped rewards.  That is a welcome and important movement.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader for a specific debate on the aquaculture and mariculture industries.  The Leader mentioned yesterday that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will come to the House later this month for a discussion on fisheries.  Much of the produce of our fish farming industry &mdash; salmon, trout, scallops, mussels and oysters, etc. &mdash; is exported.  That adds to the value of our national exports.  The success of our exports is very important to this country.  The fish farming industry seems to be at a standstill by comparison with places like Scotland, Norway and France.  We are really in the penny farthing place, on a <i>per capita</i> and <i>pro rata</i> basis, when compared to many European countries in our development of this industry.  While the special debate I am seeking is not of immediate urgency, perhaps it could take place before the Easter break.  There is huge potential for jobs to be created here.</P>
      <P>I had the fortune many years ago to visit a town in Chile &mdash; Puerto Montt, which is 300 km or 400 km south of Santiago &mdash; where 50,000 people were employed in the fish farming industry.  One of the factors hindering our efforts to create such jobs here is the fact that it can take six or seven years for mussel or salmon farming licences to be issued.  I criticised several Ministers <Col N="601" />in the last Government for such delays.  A special debate on fish farming is deserved and warranted.  We need to reflect on how we can create jobs in this industry.  We should compare ourselves to our neighbours in Scotland, whose achievements in meeting their potential in terms of job creation, exports and value to the economy are ten times greater than ours.  I am not blaming the Government.  It seems to be an endemic problem.  I hope a substantial debate on the matter, in addition to the general debate on fishing that the Leader has kindly told us will take place before this month is out, can be facilitated in this House before Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKelly">
      <NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Over Christmas, I learned something new about the fair deal scheme, about which I have spoken in this House in the past.  I was not aware of it.  I have always referred to the scheme as an unfair deal.  That is becoming more and more clear.  It was brought to my attention once more over Christmas.  In the past when somebody went into a nursing home the nursing home subvention was granted from the date of entry.  Now, however, if a person needs to go into a nursing home and is placed in one, always granted there is a free bed, he or she must wait six, seven or eight weeks for the HSE to give approval for the fair deal scheme to kick in.  When it does give that approval the subvention applies only from the approval date.  Elderly people may enter a nursing home and be there for six to eight weeks before the HSE decides to pay the bill which means an elderly person may have to pay as much as &euro;4,000, &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 that he or she may not have.</P>
      <P>As a result of this measure, instead of going into a nursing home elderly people are deciding to get admitted to our county hospitals where they are clogging up the wards.  In my own county the hospital is full of patients waiting to get beds in nursing homes.  They are not leaving the hospitals until the beds are available and approved by the HSE which means admissions to the hospital are being clogged up.</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, deals with nursing homes but it is the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, who must be informed about what is going on because it is an enormous problem.  The cost of care in our county hospitals is twice as much as the cost of a bed in a nursing home.  That is another anomaly falling under the radar and the Minister needs to be informed.  I call on the Leader either to pass that information to the Minister or to ask him to attend the Seanad to hear our concerns about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly">
      <NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader mentioned that the Minister for Health will attend the House.  Yesterday, there was an announcement that there would be a 25% cutback in staffing in outpatient departments in Cavan and Monaghan hospitals.  The proposed cutbacks in Cavan are completely unacceptable when one takes into account the further curtailments that occurred in Monaghan hospital last year.  This demonstrates that the HSE is completely out of touch with reality concerning the public health service.</P>
      <P>I was advised that the Minister is to sign the HSE service plan tomorrow.  This will mean that each HSE area will seek to impose further cuts within its reduced annual allocation.  There has been no consultation at local level with nurses, representatives or elected representatives on this issue.  We cannot accept a situation where after the event occurs, the HSE involves itself in discussions, not about the decision but about how it will be implemented.  There should be a real process of local consultation.</P>
      <P>Given the Minister is signing the HSE service plan tomorrow,  will the Leader bring the Minister to the House as soon as possible to discuss this plan and how he will protect front-line services and ensure that patient safety is not sacrificed, as will be the case in Cavan and Monaghan hospitals?  The HSE has stated this will not affect clinics but the reality is that when there is a cutback in staff there will be further waiting lists and people will suffer, which is unacceptable.  I ask that this might happen within the coming week, given that the cutbacks are <Col N="602" />to take effect in Cavan from 23 January.  It is important that, as elected representatives, we have some dialogue with the Minister on this issue as soon as possible.  It does not merely affect Cavan; the HSE service plan affects all areas.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader take into consideration that yesterday&rsquo;s debate on small businesses will continue next week? I am sure that many speakers will wish to contribute to the debate on suicide, to take place this afternoon.  Perhaps it could be extended, given we have so much time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames">
      <NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of cutbacks in budgets, we must be careful about the way we deal with the education of children in primary schools, especially concerning the restructuring of schools which is likely to emerge in the area of small rural schools.  Let us look at the evidence.  One size does not fit all.  In this context I wish to welcome one measure, namely, the review the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, is now to grant for DEIS schools.  We need the same measure to apply to small rural schools.</P>
      <P>I am aware the value for money report on small schools is to issue next month and I will wait to hear the results.  When one cuts small schools, those with two to four teachers, one does not simply affect the children and the school but the entire community.  I taught in a small rural school which originally had four teachers but went to three when numbers fell, whereupon I had to leave.  I know the effect that had across the board.  Perhaps this point was missed.  However, if we are about to cut back on small schools, it would be much more honest to call for a debate on the amalgamation of small schools instead of getting rid of them by stealth.  We must proceed carefully on this issue.  It is a matter of great concern across rural Ireland.  Some 1,000 schools are affected.</P>
      <P>I welcome the comment of Senator Coghlan on the words of the <i>Lonely Planet</i> guide.  It is worth noting the guide still recommends Ireland as a place to visit even though it states Irish people have low self-esteem.  Some counteract that by alcohol but the good news is that same endorphins that are released by alcohol can be released by exercise &mdash; walking, running, etc.  Many people throughout the country have cottoned on to this and in this context we are doing the same in Leinster House with the setting up of a walking group.  We should be much more positive about ourselves.</P>

      <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to take note of the concern about the increasingly repressive nature of the Hungarian Government and the manner in which this now poses a real threat to the fundamental democratic ideals that inspired the European Union, and membership of same of countries such as Ireland.  I am grateful to <i>The Irish Times</i>, in particular to Daniel McLoughlin, who yesterday gave a comprehensive overview of what is going on in Hungary.  For the information of the House, the EU is threatening legal action against the Hungarian Government because of its increasingly anti-democratic measures, especially in light of the fact it is attempting to <Col N="603" />dismantle hitherto independent institutions such as its central bank by appointing its own people, thereby compromising the independence of the bank.</P>
      
      <P>I am more concerned, however, by the attacks on the media in Hungary.  Mr. McLaughlin stated: &ldquo;The constitution introduced on New Year&rsquo;s Day removes a host of checks and balances on Prime Minister Orb&aacute;n&rsquo;s power, places many formerly independent institutions under government control and makes it extremely hard for future administrations to reverse the changes he has made&rdquo;.  He goes on to state that a journalist, Nagy Navarro, is currently camping outside the parliament in protest at the shutting down of one of the few independent radio stations in Budapest, Klubradio.  &ldquo;Despite its being one of the most popular talk radio stations in the country the media authority run by Orb&aacute;n loyalists has refused to renew its broadcasting licence and it is expected to close next month.  In another heavy-handed move a leading news website has been banned from parliament for mocking MPs in a satirical song&rdquo;.</P>

      <P Just="Left">In light of these repressive measures and the threat of EU sanctions, it might be opportune to invite the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to the House for a debate on the media landscape in Ireland.  There are many questions and challenges now facing broadcasting in this country.  I do not suggest linking in any way what I described concerning Hungary to the Irish situation &mdash; thankfully &mdash; but there are questions surrounding the introduction of digital television, the crushing cost to RTE for that introduction, the reduced advertising revenue radio stations now experience, nationally and locally, and the plans for the renewal of licences at local level by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  All of these issues, and perhaps many other matters, could be discussed if the Minister were to come to the House to outline the Government&rsquo;s views on them. It would afford Senators an opportunity to have a wide-ranging debate.</P>

      <P Just="Left">More penalty points were recently introduced for 16 further road traffic offences.  Will the Leader get clarification from the Minister on the penalty point for failure to ensure a proper view from a vehicle windscreen?  It strikes me as an urban-based decision.  A car with a Dublin registration is more valuable than a rural-registered car because it does not have to encounter potholes full of water or spray-back from tractors after spreading slurry or lorries carrying gravel and sand.  What constitutes a dirty windscreen or failure to keep it clean?  Is it the area the wipers cover or the whole windscreen?  Is it having no water to spray-clean the windscreen?  Will it be at the discretion of the garda who stops one?  If he has had a bad day, will one get penalty points?  I will be off the road soon enough in any case because my car is covered in spray-back dirt from driving from Kerry to Dublin.  Will the Leader get clarification from either the Minister for Justice and Equality or the Minister Transport, Tourism and Sport on how they will implement these penalty points which are causing some concern?</P>

      <P Just="Left">On yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business, I called for a debate on growing inequality in society.  Ten schools in Jobstown, Killinarden Brookfield and Fettercairn in west Tallaght are designated as disadvantaged and in the DEIS programme which delivers opportunity in education.  For the information of Members, and Senator Bacik in particular, the 2012 budget will see the Department cut DEIS programmes in these schools.  The Government is incompetent and inefficient.  Due to the protests we made over cuts to public nursing homes, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, whom I referred to as Cromwell here, has recently decided he will review the policy.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Yesterday morning, people from the Tallaght area protested outside Leinster House about the proposed DEIS cuts and I spoke about it on the Order of Business.

      <NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I join Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien in calling for a debate on unemployment, specifically about this morning&rsquo;s announcement by Ulster Bank.  Several times in the past few months, as Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien said, we have called on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to have his Department carry out an audit of <Col N="606" />businesses at risk.  Clearly, the banks have been at risk for some considerable time.  Far be it from scaremongering, Senator Paul Coghlan, it would be prudent for the Department to assess where the biggest risks lie and what can be done to address them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Department is being prudent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I did not interrupt Senator Paul Coghlan.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It would be important for the Government to assess what it can do to alleviate the difficulties experienced by some businesses such as banks, many exporting companies and service industries.  If the Department does not have the resources to assess these businesses, it should engage with the representative organisations such as Chambers Ireland, ISME and IBEC in order that they can do the work on behalf of the Department.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader organise a debate for soon as possible on mortgage arrears?  This matter has been bounced along for several years.  I raised the matter in this House when I was on the other side but to no avail.  Two Bills dealing with mortgage arrears have been introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il which offered tangible solutions to the problem.  When I was on the other side of the House, we all had to listen to Ministers, including current ones, talking about the systemic importance of the banks.  When are we going to acknowledge the systemic importance of the people?  In this morning&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>, Charlie Weston reported on suggestions of a non-judicial resolution process for mortgage arrears.  While I would welcome such an approach, it cannot be in the banks&rsquo; control.  In his article, Charlie Weston speaks about people losing their family homes.  That is not acknowledging the systemic importance of the people.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We cannot promote strategic defaulting.  Having said that, we can take tangible measures to protect families in arrears.  Will the Leader, who understands this issue, arrange an immediate debate on mortgage arrears with tangible resolutions to be introduced by the Government instead of report after report when, in the immortal words of Senator Barrett, the backstairs to the Department of Finance is very much open for the banks and the builders?  That is what is holding up progress on this issue. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte">
      <NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ulster Bank announcement is regrettable.  It has many fine staff and the bank has had a significant presence in County Donegal over the years, particularly along the Border.  Some of those shedding crocodile tears about job losses are the same people who were saying the bank should have been left to flounder some time ago.  They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot say they feel sorry for the bank staff on the one hand while, on the other, make statements that the bank should been allowed to go to the wall.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan referred to the <i>Lonely Planet</i> guide.  I am more concerned about the commentary in <i>The New York Times</i> which I would like the Leader to raise with the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport.  Earlier this week, the newspaper published a list of the 45 most desirable places to visit in 2012 throughout the world and no location in Ireland was mentioned.  Birmingham, Glasgow, London and Wales featured.  <i>The New York Times</i> has a significant readership and it is well regarded in America while New York is a major tourism market for us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyHarte">
      <NameTxt>Senator Jimmy Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Lonely Planet</i> has a different readership from the <i>The New York Times</i> but we must be concerned that no location in Ireland featured in the top 45 places to visit in 2012.  Birmingham and Glasgow are regarded as more desirable to visit than Dublin or Donegal.  Donegal is the most desirable place to visit in the world.  The Cathaoirleach visited <Col N="607" />Donegal during the Christmas break and I congratulate him on travelling that far to enjoy himself.  Will the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport explain why a newspaper such as <i>The New York Times</i> would not feature Ireland in its travel section?  Birmingham is a fine city but it has nothing to offer in comparison to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu">
      <NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
      <P>Serious illness can be a traumatic time for a family and it can be exacerbated in the current economic climate by other pressures.  We are all aware of this when we are out in the community but it is an emotional experience for a family when a loved one has to move into a nursing home.  Many Members have had this experience over the years and that is the reason, when this issue was discussed in both Houses and other public fora, the fair deal scheme was introduced.  It is a good scheme and, in many ways, it is radical.  It is an example to us of the way we should respond to what we hear on the ground about difficulties people experience.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Currently, those who move into a nursing home are in limbo until their application under the scheme is approved and families must cover the nursing home costs during this period or find free accommodation for them.  I have witnessed this and have been contacted about it by a number of people.  This is not happening in order that the HSE can make a saving but the issue has gone unnoticed until this time.  Waiting periods of six and seven weeks have been mentioned but I am aware of waits of several months for approval.  A family may have to pay between &euro;700 and &euro;800 a week for three or four months while coping with the difficulties presented by the current economic climate.  Perhaps the Leader will use his goodwill to raise this issue with the Minister for Health, even though his office may be aware of it.  The Minister or the Department should give a positive response to this issue.  It may seem like small change to some but it can be devastating for people during this traumatic period.  I hope this issue will not be put on the long finger.  I would love for it to be attended to with the same urgency as the introduction of the scheme.  Many people are worried and they are suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins">
      <NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the comments of Senators Kelly and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; regarding the fair deal scheme.  It is well designed but the major issue is the delay in arriving at decisions.  Clarification is needed on whether the delays result from a lack of funding or from administrative difficulties within the HSE because families are being landed with large bills from private nursing homes while patients await decisions on applications under the scheme.  As Senator Kelly said, acute beds in hospitals, which are needed, are being tied up and this, in turn, is extending hospital waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader organise a wider debate on the care of the elderly and on private versus public sector care provision?  Last year, a new community nursing unit was completed in my home town.  It is practically idle because nursing staff are not available to transfer patients who would qualify for care in that unit from other facilities.  Other issues relating to care of the elderly need to be examined.  I do not seek a debate next week but perhaps during this session we could have such a debate with the Minister for Health in order that we can achieve the best outcomes for the elderly and the best return for the significant amounts spent by the State on the provision of care to the elderly.  That would be a useful debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn">
      <NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I have been looking for good news in recent times and every now and then I come across some.  Agriculture has been a success story, particularly in the area of infant formula.  Perhaps everybody else knew this but I did not know that one in seven children in Asia drinks Irish made infant formula.  Danone is investing &euro;50 million in a facility in Cork which is due to open shortly and, following its opening, one in five children in Asia will drink Irish made infant formula.  The reason I raise this is that we must concentrate on winners.  In the past, we have tried to be good at everything but sometimes in business, one finds an area <Col N="608" />that one can concentrate on and then tries to do something.  I am optimistic about the production of infant formula because milk quotas are likely to be abolished in 2015.  If so, that will present opportunities to expand this market.  I understand Irish producers cannot get enough milk and they have to import raw material to make the infant formula.  I am not sure whether that is accurate but this rumour has been reported.  There are success stories.  Let us concentrate on them and make sure we can do more with our winners in the future.  Exports of agricultural products to Brazil have increased by 22% in recent years and it is only five years since that market opened.  Let us make sure we identify opportunities and concentrate on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomSheahan">
      <NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Quinn, I also like good news.  However, I thought the best news that came from last year was from the Road Safety Authority in that the number of people killed on the roads was below 200 for the first time.  While that is good news in itself, it is still unacceptable.  Of the 185 people killed on our roads, an unfortunate point is that 48 were pedestrians.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I asked the Leader late in the last session that we would have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the House for a discussion on road safety.  To have 48 pedestrians killed is a disproportionate number of lives to be lost.  Over Christmas, I was quite fortunate that I did not kill three young people on the side of a dark, unlit country road because they were wearing dark coats and trousers without high visibility jackets.  I got the fright of my life from the experience.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There is a feeling among the community that anybody who is unfortunate enough to knock somebody down on the roads is nearly always to blame &mdash; either the driver was speeding, the driver had drink taken or the driver had done this or that.  Given the number of people who are walking our roads in pure blackness, wearing dark clothes, it should be a criminal offence not to wear a high visibility vest when walking the roads at night.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come to the House for a discussion on road safety.  While it is good news that the number of fatalities on the roads has reduced to under 200 for the first time since records began, it is still an unacceptable level and the figure of 48 pedestrians killed on the roads is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh">
      <NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a relatively early debate in this session with regard to NAMA.  While NAMA is now a very important functionary of the State, some recent reports give rise to an element of concern which should give rise to caution.  I refer to a report concerning the Durkan group, which recently claimed that because of a lack of commercial engagement by NAMA, the group decided to pay off a loan of &euro;43 million, which it was able to fund from British banks in order to continue its developments there.  A second point relates to a member of the Grehan family who decided to declare bankruptcy in Britain.  He complained subsequently that part of his reason for taking that initiative was that he found it impossible to engage with NAMA with regard to loans and properties he had, although he felt participating and engaging with NAMA might ultimately have extracted the best possible return for the taxpayer.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I do not know whether that is correct, and perhaps NAMA would have a counter-view.  However, what is important is that NAMA is a success.  There is certainly a view in the marketplace that if people are holding loans on developments outside Ireland, NAMA tends to be not that interested in supporting them.  Ultimately, while there is obviously an onus on NAMA to recover the best possible return for the taxpayer, equally, there has to be a secondary, if not an equal, objective of ensuring we get the development and the construction sector functioning again.  NAMA has and will have a huge influence and responsibility in that area.  While I know <Col N="609" />it has recruited from across the financial sector, I am not sure the range of skills that are in place are commensurate with what is needed to effectively operate a two-scale objective, first, of recovery for the taxpayer on the loans and, second, to ensure it is a catalyst for economic development.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Given the size of that conglomerate, I have no doubt it will have an influence on economic growth.  Given that 1% growth in GDP would yield &euro;1.5 billion per annum to this country, the objective of economic development must be a crucial part of this.  I ask that the Minister of Finance come to the House for a debate and engagement in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaitKeane">
      <NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">That point on 1% per annum yielding &euro;1.5 billion is a good place for me to start.  If we had 1% per annum improvement in the fitness level of children, there could be a &euro;3 billion saving to the health system.  We had a debate on fitness among schoolchildren and Senator Eamonn Coghlan carried out a major survey of the issue.  I would like to see more support given to that survey.  The Physical Education Teachers Association of Ireland came out against Senator Coghlan in that regard because he was promoting 15 minutes of exercise in schools, which the association claimed was regimental.</P>
      <P Just="Left">A survey of schoolchildren in Athlone, highlighted in newspapers and on radio today, found that 70% were on the road to obesity.  In addition, although I do not have the figures with me, the level of unfitness was worrying.  Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan has called in the D&aacute;il for a well known personality to promote fitness.  While there is a lot of promotion, the Department of Education and Skills has obviously charged the physical education teachers of this country with promoting physical activity.  I agree with them that their work includes more than just physical activity.  They said in answer to Senator Coghlan that it was also holistic and social, and that the work should also be done by parents.</P>
      <P>As questions have been raised, we must ask whether physical education should be included in the points system for the leaving certificate.  Obesity in this country is at such a stage that I believe it should.  I ask the Minister for Education and Skills to examine this issue to ascertain whether such a system could be introduced.  It would be cheaper to give &euro;5,000 to every child who was physically fit on finishing the leaving certificate than to counteract the problems ten years later if the child is not fit at the leaving certificate stage.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There are two points.  First, how do we incentivise children to be fit and, second, what can we do about it?  I commend Senator Eamonn Coghlan for the work he has done.  I condemn the Physical Education Teachers Association of Ireland for the big article in <i>The Irish Times</i> stating the association did not agree with that.  I want the Minister for Education and Skills to take up this issue again and to ask whether we should introduce points.  I believe we should, because the health of this country is involved.  Obesity and diabetes are at outrageous levels and we should be considering preventive as well as current-day medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmBurke">
      <NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I join my colleagues in regard to the nursing home issue.  There is a need for a debate to consider how we will move forward.  In particular, as I have done previously, I wish to raise the issue of the number of private nursing homes which cannot get qualified nurses.  There are over 750 vacancies for qualified nurses in private nursing homes.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I was delighted to see the Minister for Health has taken up the point on the review of the nursing qualification, which is now an academic qualification although it was not ten or 15 years ago.  People who come through the college system are looking for something more challenging when they qualify, hence we do not have a huge number applying for jobs in nursing homes.  We need to devise an educational structure that gives a qualification to people to work as nurses in nursing homes.  For example, there are many care assistants who are very good in the care and management of elderly people but they are not given recognition.</P>
      <Col N="610" />
      
      <P Just="Left">I hope the review of the nursing training programme will take into account the need for a dedicated course to educate people in regard to elder care, which is an area that will grow.  We have more than 560,000 people over 65 and this will grow to over 1 million in the next 20 years.  If we are to have a debate on the matter, I ask that we include this element.</P>

The Minister for Education and Skills has met school principals, teachers and parents to hear their concerns and clarify the position following the changes announced in the budget.  Following this engagement, he has asked his Department to produce a report on DEIS band 1 and 2 schools which currently have posts under older schemes in the context of the staffing allocations due to issue to all schools in the coming weeks.  The report will set out the factual position on staffing in these schools from September 2012, taking into account the impact of demographic changes.  The Minister looks forward to receiving the report and continuing the process of engagement with schools on the impact of these measures.  We would all agree with that.</P>
      <P>Senator Healy Eames and others asked for a debate with the Minister on the issue of smaller schools once the value for money report is published in February.  Schools are an important part of the fabric of our communities and it is important that we debate their role.</P>

Tourism numbers increased by 7% last year and I am confident they can continue to increase.  Work is being done on the proposed Gathering and communities throughout the country are striving to promote home holidays.  We have a lot to offer and should be singing our praises rather than talking ourselves down.  Let us continue to play a positive role in this House.  There is too much pessimism regarding tourism.</P>
      <Col N="611" />
      <P Just="Left">I concur with Senator O'Donovan regarding aquaculture.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine spoke passionately about this issue when he was previously in the House and he is due to meet us again in the coming month.  There is tremendous job creation potential in this area and Senators would be pushing an open door with the Minister in this regard.  I commend him for negotiating a good deal for Irish fisherman in the European Union.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senators John Kelly, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Mullins and Colm Burke spoke about the problems with the fair deal scheme and delays in the HSE approving applications which are, in turn, tying up acute beds in hospitals.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Reilly referred to the health service plan and its implications for counties Cavan and Monaghan.  She also asked for more time to be allocated for the debate on suicide.  I do not think we will be able to allow additional time today but, if the Minister of State at the Department of Health is agreeable, perhaps we can resume the debate next week.  A considerable number of Senators wish to speak in it.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney spoke about the situation obtaining in Hungary and the media landscape in Ireland.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has agreed to discuss the media with the House.  He has not yet confirmed a date but we will pursue the matter with him.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Moloney also asked for clarification on the penalty points applying in respect of windscreens.  I will raise the matter and hope the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will attend the House at an early opportunity.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn spoke about the success of Irish agriculture and referred in particular to infant formula.  This is a matter which the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine mentioned when he was last in the House.  Our market share in infant formula is one in seven globally and one in five in Asia.  This is the type of positive story we should be promoting.  There are opportunities in this area when milk quotas are removed.  The growth in exports to Brazil is also to be welcomed.  We are only at the tip of the iceberg, however, and will have to further expand our trade to countries like Brazil, India, China and Russia.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Sheahan spoke about road safety.  All of us welcome the news that the number of road deaths last year was only 185.  This is 185 deaths too many but it is a massive improvement over previous years.  The Senator rightly pointed out that 48 pedestrians had died and reminded us to bear in mind the need for high visibility jackets when walking along country roads.  The large number of cyclists who do not have lights of any description on their bicycles clearly present a danger.  We must all pay as much attention as possible to road safety with a view to further reducing the number of road traffic fatalities.  In the case of each of the 185 deaths in 2011 a grieving family has been left behind.  Our hearts go out to all of them, especially the families of those who passed away in the large number of accidents over the Christmas period.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh called for a debate on the National Asset Management Agency.  As he noted, NAMA&rsquo;s purpose is to secure the best possible outcome for taxpayers.  It also needs to stimulate economic development.  Perhaps we will be able to have the Minister for Finance come before the House to discuss this issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Keane raised the issue of physical education and the promotion of physical fitness in schools.  She also asked whether physical education should be an examination subject for points.  This worthwhile idea should be considered by the Minister for Education and Skills in light of the problems we are experiencing with obesity, diabetes and so forth.  Making physical education an examination subject would focus minds on the issue of physical fitness.  We can raise this matter with the Minister who will come before the House to deal with legislation in the next month or two.  I hope he will also come before us for a general debate on education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch">
      <TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt>
      <NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that one can discuss the issue of suicide enough, particularly when one considers the scourge it has become in communities.  For this reason, I appreciate the opportunity to make a statement on suicide prevention.  The importance of exploring the causes of and ways of dealing with suicide cannot be over-emphasised.  A suicide is a tragic and shattering occurrence that not only brings a life to an untimely end, but also has a devastating impact on family, friends and communities.  The increasing number of deaths by suicide is of great concern.  While discussion around suicide tends to be dominated by statistics, it is important that we remember the human factor.  Each death is someone&rsquo;s loved one and statistics cannot capture the grief and desolation of those left behind.  The unanswered questions of &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What if?&rdquo; and &ldquo;If only&rdquo; will always remain.</P>
      <P>There is not a community that has not been affected by the trauma and despair that surrounds suicide.  We know that reducing suicide rates requires a collective, concerted effort and, most important, a collaborative approach.  The Government is committed to fostering and building on the existing levels of all-island co-operation in the interests of promoting positive mental health and tackling the issue of suicide.  In saying this, it is impossible to have a debate about suicide prevention without recognising the number of people who have died by suicide.  Provisional data for 2009 shows a record number of 527 recorded suicides.  When I see this <Col N="613" />number I always close my eyes and think of a small town because it equates to the population of a small town being wiped out.  While there was a slight decrease to 486 in the provisional figures for 2010, the number of deaths remains unacceptably high.</P>
      
      <P>Suicide is not only a mental health issue.  Many factors contribute to the rise in suicides, including the economic downturn, unemployment, the breakdown of relationships and financial difficulties.  One study shows that a 1% increase in unemployment leads to a 0.79% increase in suicides.  It is important that we recognise that since 2007, there has been a particularly high increase in the number of deaths by suicide of men in the 35 to 54 years age group.  While there is an increase in the number of women dying by suicide, the numbers are still significantly lower than in the male population.  The current economic circumstances are undoubtedly having an effect on mental health and well-being.  Our young adult population who grew up in a time of prosperity when work and opportunities were plentiful are particularly affected by this downturn in our financial circumstances.  One readily understands the devastation that can occur when one considers the relative speed with which the recession hit and its severity and very high impact on lives, particularly of those with young families who acquired large mortgages in the preceding years and then suffered the hardship of unemployment.  In such circumstances, the shock to the system for many was overpowering.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, I am working closely with the Health Service Executive and voluntary agencies to introduce initiatives to address much more effectively and appropriately the issue of mental health and suicide.  The total funding available in 2011 nationally through the HSE for suicide prevention was about &euro;9 million, of which &euro;4.1 million was available to the National Office for Suicide Prevention and approximately &euro;5 million was available regionally to fund resource officers for suicide prevention, self-harm liaison nurses in hospital emergency departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.  The funding provided in this area in 2011 included a special allocation of &euro;1 million specifically to target initiatives to address the increasing incidence of suicide and deliberate self-harm which allowed the HSE to focus on further developing skills-based training and awareness programmes in suicide prevention, improving the response to those who deliberately self-harm, developing the capacity of primary care to deal adequately with those presenting with suicidal behaviours and enhancing interagency co-ordination.</P>
      <P>The challenge of suicide prevention is one of the most urgent issues facing society.  However, it is important to acknowledge the suicide prevention initiatives that are in place and which are being developed.</P>
      <P>Since 2004, approximately 25,000 people have been trained in the two day ASIST, applied suicide intervention skills training, programme in suicide first aid, which is an internationally recognised effective course.  This training programme is provided to health workers, teachers, community workers, the Garda, youth workers, Defence Forces, veterinary organisations, volunteers and people responding to family friends and co-workers.  A half day training programme called Safetalk, which prepares participants to identify persons with thoughts of suicide, has been provided to over 3,000 participants.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In response to the economic downturn the HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, has launched a &ldquo;tough economic times&rdquo; programme following requests from organisations such as citizens advice and the MABS for information and training for staff because of the increasing numbers of people presenting in distress.  Farmers&rsquo; marts were targeted with similar information as well as the major National Ploughing Championship event.  At first this seems an unlikely area to target but given that farmers in the main work in isolation, they are probably the one group who have less contact with others and, therefore, it was important to target them.</P>
      <Col N="614" />
      <P>Mental health awareness campaigns including the Mind Your Mental Health and Let Someone Know awareness campaigns and the See Change and Make A Ripple stigma reduction campaigns are being ramped up with the objective of achieving a significant change in attitudes to mental health, to encourage people to be more aware of their mental health and, above all, to seek help.</P>
      <P>The HSE clinical care lead for mental health is working with key stakeholders to develop a uniform approach to self-harm assessments in emergency departments in order that patients can receive the best care and treatment available.  A pilot project is also under way in the Cork hospital group to train all appropriate clinical staff in self-harm-suicide management and it is hoped that this will be in all other hospitals in due course.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention has also funded a number of suicide community assessment nurses who work within primary care to provide an effective and co-ordinated response at health care professional level in that setting to deal with the issue directly and to avoid admissions to hospital.  These projects are being evaluated.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention also supports a number of voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Jigsaw programme, developed by Headstrong, is another example of an initiative aimed at making mental health services more accessible to those who need them.  The programme creates safe spaces in communities where young people can access a wide range of mental health supports for free.  It works by engaging young people, organisations, families and other support agencies in the community in order that we are all better able to respond to the mental health and well-being needs of young people aged from 12 to 25.  The most important thing I can say about this project is that it works.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Jigsaw programme is up and running in five counties &mdash; Galway, Roscommon, Kerry, Meath and Dublin in Ballymun &mdash; and the HSE in partnership with Headstrong will progress six new sites, Donegal, Offaly, Clondalkin, Tallaght, Balbriggan and Dublin 15 through the allocation of &euro;1 million in innovation funding.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Following on from the special consideration which was given to mental health in budget 2011 with a maximum reduction in funding of 1.8% for this sector, budget 2012 provided an additional &euro;35 million for mental health services in line with the programme for Government commitments.  Details of how the funding will be apportioned are still being worked on in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s draft national service plan for 2012 which is under consideration.  Final decisions on funding of individual care programmes will become clear when the Minister approves the national service plan for 2012 in accordance with the Health Act 2004.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Funding from the special allocation for mental health will be used primarily to strengthen community mental health teams in adult and children&rsquo;s mental health services.  It is intended that the additional resources will be rolled out in conjunction with a scheme of appropriate clinical care programmes based on an early intervention and recovery approach.  Some of the funding will also be used to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and response to self-harm presentations and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care specifically for people with mental health problems.  Some provision will also be made to facilitate the relocation of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities, in line with A Vision for Change.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am committed to ensuring mechanisms are put in place to ensure the funding is used only for the purposes for which it is specified in the HSE national service plan.  Members will be aware that the Government has already approved the drafting of legislation to give effect to changes in the governance of the HSE.  This involves radical reform of the health service <Col N="615" />generally which will see the introduction of universal health insurance.  Significantly, the new system of governance will involve seven directorates, including a separate directorate for mental health which will have full responsibility and accountability in that area.</P>
      <P>In this context, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, intends to bring forward detailed proposals at a later date for the reorganisation of the HSE at directorate, regional and local levels in a manner which facilitates a smooth transition from the current governance arrangements to the proposed new structures.  This is a significant step forward for mental health and puts it on a par with all other health care services.  It is equally important &mdash; in fact, I would argue that it is possibly even more important.  This is a critical move in the right direction and one I have fought hard for since taking on responsibility for this area on assuming office last year.</P>
      <P>We need to get best value for our available resources.  Duplication of mental health services and suicide prevention initiatives need to be avoided in order to provide a more streamlined service.  We need to co-ordinate our efforts and work together to stop the tragedy of the loss of life through suicide.  I recognise the many challenges that lie ahead and I am aware that there are no easy interventions that will guarantee success.  However, I can assure this House that I am totally committed to tackling the high incidence of suicide and deliberate self-harm and to working with the HSE and voluntary organisations to introduce initiatives that will reduce the number of deaths by suicide.  We have no choice but to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Members in welcoming the Minister of State to the House.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the issue.  I welcome the representatives of Clondalkin community action on suicide group.  We received their paper and congratulate them on their work in suicide prevention.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons for failure but there are no excuses.  Collectively, the Houses of the Oireachtas have failed society on the prevention of suicide.  The Minister of State said this issue cannot be spoken about or assessed enough in the search for answers to provide the help society needs to deal with suicide prevention and the wide variety of mental health issues.  When I speak of failure I am not directing it at the Minister of State but at the collective because resources in this area are not sufficient for the work being carried out.</P>
      <P>I am a novice to this issue in the sense that I have not spoken on it previously.  In my research for the debate I learned a couple of small points.  In other debates on more general mental health we have acknowledged some of the good elements within A Vision for Change and the individual projects and initiatives that have started in the mental health area, such as the positive advertisements on television and so on.  We are great at writing reports, assessing the problem and what might be done, but we are not good at implementation.</P>
      <P>Once we assess the problem and come up with a solution, we leave the report on the shelf assuming that by the time we next convene the work will have been carried out.  Of course, one definition of stupidity is to continue saying the same thing and expect a different result.  I think that is where we are at in the context of suicide prevention.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There is significant prejudice and discrimination against people with mental health issues or facing personal challenges which society stigmatise as negative.  Members of these Houses are not immune from that level of prejudice or discrimination.  A Millward Brown survey last year of Members highlighted that more than 60% of Members believed that people with mental health issues should not have children.  Is it not shocking that the representatives of the people in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann hold that view?  It is indicative of the magnitude and scale of the problem that faces us.  If there is this level of stigmatisation, how can we begin to offer assistance to people?  That is not to say that organisations such as Community Action on Suicide <Col N="616" />or the initiatives, the training, and the Assist and Jigsaw projects and the other initiatives are not worthwhile and making a contribution but they are fragmented and non-penetrative in getting around this problem in order that real progress can be made.  When one considers the magnitude of the problem and the results of the Millward Brown survey of Members which shows our approach to mental health and how we are prejudiced and discriminatory we are to mental health issues, it begs the question as to how Government, going back to 1984, can preside over such low levels of funding towards suicide prevention?  The figure in 2011 was &euro;9 million, I accept that &euro;35 million will be provided for mental health services generally this year, but how much is allocated for suicide prevention?  One of the things that struck me, which the Minister of State so rightly pointed out, is that the 2009 figure of 527 people, is the population of a small town.  That figure was 24% up on the previous year.  The provisional figures for 2010 are 486, but many groups say that the real figure is substantially greater; there are no figures yet for 2011.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">The allocation of &euro;9 million is disgracefully low in the context of what we are allocating to try to save lives.  The Road Safety Authority is charged with saving lives and while this is a completely different issue, I think it is instructive to compare the level of resources and the approach that has been taken.  They too had to deal with the numbers killed on the roads.  In 2006, 368 people were killed on our roads.  The Road Safety Authority has achieved a 59% reduction in the deaths on the roads since its establishment.  The Road Safety Authority had a budget of &euro;32 million in 2010.  That budget of &euro;32 million helped to save a significant number of lives.  Senator Sheahan made a point on the Order of Business that the Road Safety Authority has been a great success.  I remember when it was being founded, I was critical of Mr. Gay Byrne as being the person to head it up, and how wrong I was, in light of the exceptional job that organisation has done.  The point is that the RSA is an integrated, cohesive national organisation with a joined-up approach and resources of &euro;32 million.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In making such a comparison, I am not trying to disenfranchise any of the groups working hard on the issue of suicide prevention throughout the country but I feel we need one national entity to deal with it.  The issue of multi-disciplinary community mental health teams has been agreed and is national policy through consecutive Governments since 1984, yet they are still not established.  Presumably that is a resource issue.  This should be done as a matter of urgency.  I reiterate that I do not doubt the Minister&rsquo;s personal commitment, but if it is a question of resources that is preventing these steps being taken, then pressure from all sides of the House must be brought to bear on the Government, regardless of how scarce resources are throughout other Departments.  The people who die by suicide and as a result of mental health issues are no less important than those killed on the roads.</P>
      <P>When one compares the advertisement on television for road safety and mental health, I recall the mental health advertisement but not as much as the various advertisements for road safety.  That is down to two issues, resources and the fact that a national authority is focused exclusively on the issue of road safety.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the destigmatisation of mental health issues.  We have a serious problem with prejudices.  One in 20 people will have suicidal thoughts throughout our lives, and one in four of us will suffer from mental health issues.  Is it really the view of Members that 25% of people should not have children?  A Vision for Change includes many good ideas, but we need to take an integrated approach to mental health and provide adequate resources and destigmatise mental health issues.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I wish the Minister of State well and hope she will take some of these observations on board.  Some people in the Visitors Gallery are from organisations dealing with mental health issues <Col N="617" />and their views are important.  What I wish to highlight is the need to provide adequate resources and to take an overall integrated approach and to undertake a public education campaign starting from the beginning of secondary school right through to destigmatise mental health issues, because they are as common as the common cold.  People who suffer from these ailments are entitled to the full resources of the State in assisting them to deal with their difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmBurke">
      <NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and thank her for her comprehensive speech.  I have worked with her in Cork North Central for a number of years and know that when she takes on a project, she sets her mind on achieving an outcome.  I hope that by the time she finishes her term in the Department, the targets she has set will be met.  The Minister of State is dedicated and committed to dealing with this area.  I welcome Deputy Derek Keating and the group from the Clondalkin community action on suicide who are in the Visitors Gallery and thank them for the work they are doing.  I thank all the voluntary groups around the country who are working on this issue.  It is important to give public recognition to the work of Deputy Dan Neville who has worked in this area for a long number of years as president of the Irish Association of Suicidology and thank him and all who work with that association.</P>
      <P>The tragedy of suicide affects every family and community in some way or other, in every part of the country.  It also affects every health care professional at some stage during his or her working life.  When a person passes away from a medical complaint there is an explanation as to the cause of death, but in cases of death from suicide there is no explanation in the vast majority of cases and it leaves unanswered questions.  Unfortunately it is a problem that remains unanswered.  When a death from suicide occurs it has a knock-on effect on at least a minimum of ten other people.  We have seen in some rural areas a series of suicides, where a death from suicide triggers a number of others.  We need to be extremely careful in dealing with this topic, because like a falling deck of cards, discussion of the death can generate other problems.   For that reason we must be extremely careful in dealing with this topic.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister of State outlined the suicide incidence rates.  While there was a very slight reduction in 2010, it appears from the evidence available for 2011 that the reduction might have been temporary.  Unfortunately, the economic downturn is having knock-on effects, and the Minister of State mentioned that aspect.  The OECD produced a report which showed that out of 30 developed states, Ireland has the second highest rate of suicide among young people.  That is the challenge we must face.  It is a problem and we must deal with it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator MacSharry raised how we dealt with the road deaths issue.  We dealt with it in a comprehensive way, through changes in the law and taking a more serious view of drink driving and the road worthiness of vehicles.  We also took on the speeding issue.  In addition, we had a single person to lead that campaign and we conducted a major advertising campaign in the process.  We must look at the issue of suicide prevention in a more comprehensive way, through co-ordination of all the services both in the voluntary sector and under the HSE and the Department of Health.  We must see how we can develop a programme similar to the way we dealt with road deaths.  The Minister of State has outlined how she proposes to deal with that, but we must keep it under constant review as regards how to improve getting the information out to the public in order that we can ensure it is a case of prevention rather than dealing with families after the event has occurred.</P>
      <P>While it is not directly linked to this issue, it is interesting to note the report on child and adolescent mental health services for 2010-11 and the figures for the number of cases that come into those services.  The report shows, for example, that up to September 2011, there were 16,080 cases being dealt with.  That is 1.55% of the population under 18 years of age coming under the care of the child and adolescent mental health services.  There was a waiting list of <Col N="618" />1,897, which is a reduction compared to a year earlier.  In fairness to the services, they are giving priority to the urgent cases.</P>
      
      <P>It is also interesting to examine how the service has developed.  In the period from October 2010 to October 2011, over 7,700 of those cases were able to be referred back to their general practitioners, GPs, or other care providers.  They did not stay within the system.  The care was provided and after improvements in their well-being, the young people were able to be referred back to their GPs for further care.  This shows how well the matter is being dealt with.  However, these are people who are within the system.  The problem with suicide is that the vast majority are outside the loop, which is why we must conduct a comprehensive programme of education for young people.</P>
      <P>The recent Irish Association of Suicidology conference had four working groups.  The first dealt with how the statutory and voluntary organisations can work together to support positive mental health in their communities.  The second group dealt with how voluntary organisations can support families in the community and the third dealt with how GPs can support families in the community.  That is an important issue.  One of the issues relating to GPs is that their surgeries can sometimes be under a great deal of pressure due to numbers attending, especially in the winter months, and the time given to people might not always be sufficient.  When we talk about an education programme we must realise we are all involved in that programme, be it young people, adults or health care professionals, with regard to the need to be careful and to take on board the concerns people have when they want to talk.  That is very important.</P>
      <P>It is also important to examine how this issue is being tackled.  When conducting my research I examined the situation in Scotland and the issues on which the Scots are being proactive.  When journalists are reporting on suicide cases, the Scots insist that details about a help-line be published with every article.  If the article affects somebody or raises an issue for them, therefore, there is a help-line available.  It is very important that when an article deals with this issue, information is attached to the article for people who have concerns so they can make contact about it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There is a need for more co-ordination between all the statutory services and with the voluntary organisations.  The voluntary organisations are doing a huge job and they must be encouraged, supported and given every assistance possible to ensure we get the message across that there is somebody available to provide the help when it is necessary.  I again thank the Minister of State and wish her well with her programme in the next four years to deal with this matter.</P>

I will not get into the statistics other than to point out that it happens across the age groups, from ten to 14 years olds right up to those in their 80s and beyond.  Most shockingly, it is now the most common cause of death among 15 to 25 year olds.  The impact of suicide on those who are bereaved, and this is a range of people caught up in the aftermath of a suicide that includes the family, friends, neighbours, colleagues, health and other professionals and entire communities, is shattering and closure can be hard to find.  None of us has the answers or, perhaps, even the right questions as we struggle to confront the challenge of what must be done.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Suicide thrives only in places of taboos and terror.  It is incumbent on all of us to try to address the confusion and despair that underlies it.  We all place a great deal of emphasis, for ourselves and within our families, on intellectual and educational development and on sporting, <Col N="619" />recreational and social skills.  We try to look after our physical health and take care of our appearance in order that we look our best.  We should be encouraged to give equal importance to the development and awareness of our mental health.  This might not be easy to do.  It is easy to say, but the challenge is how to do it and how to explain to our young people what it means.</P>
      <P>In terms of prevention and early intervention, the area which might have the greatest impact is that of building mental health resilience.  It makes a great deal of sense to create the circumstances and the opportunity, particularly for young people, to build and develop their mental health resilience.  In this way they can grow to believe in their own resourcefulness to cope with life&rsquo;s challenges, rather than be overwhelmed by them.  When mental health resilience fails a person, he or she becomes vulnerable to slipping into a dark or black place.  Those of us who have not felt the despair of depression or suicidal thoughts can only imagine what is going through the anguished and tortured mind.  This must also include the inevitable fears about how family, friends and work colleagues would react to knowing the truth.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We all know the seanfhocal, &ldquo;ar sc&aacute;th a ch&eacute;ile a mhaireann na daoine&rdquo;.  It is normally used to demonstrate the reliance we place on one another but that most reassuring of phrases &mdash; we live in one another&rsquo;s shadow &mdash; may take on a darker and more sinister meaning for those grappling with the horrors of depression.  We can imagine their dread of telling others for fear they may react in such away that the vulnerable person might be regarded as letting the family down or being flawed in some way, as causing shame or embarrassment, as being weird or strange in the eyes of their friends, as being worthless or valueless or as being less reliable, less dependable and less trustworthy in the workplace.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Unfortunately, as long as a sense of stigma endures around mental illness, in some cases the answer to some of these questions may sadly be &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  To a person in emotional distress, it must feel like pieces of life built with such care and effort being taken away as though a life and a person are being dismantled slowly brick by brick.  Surely, there is an obligation on all of us to try to understand and educate ourselves in respect of the experience of emotional distress.</P>
      <P>When faced with a person suffering such pain, the risk is that those who do not understand may invoke a defence mechanism and appear detached or uncaring.  Those who listen and respond to vulnerable people need to be fully engaged, sympathetic, understanding and never judgmental.  They must not be afraid or give the impression that they would rather be anywhere else.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Like everyone else here, I do not pretend to have even a fraction of the full answer but I urge the Minister of State, when addressing this complex and difficult issue, to place special emphasis on three main areas, namely, preventive measures, in particular measures to assist young people to strengthen their mental health and believe in their innate resilience; finding ways to give those experiencing depression or suicidal tendencies the reassurance and comfort of knowing that whatever they need is available without stigma or suspicion; and perhaps most challenging of all, to start to change the culture in the country in order that we come to regard emotional distress and mental suffering as a very real part of many people&rsquo;s lives but equally to see that it is possible to come through those experiences and recover a good and full life for oneself.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I join Senator Burke in urging all those involved in suicide intervention and prevention &mdash; State agencies, health professionals, academics, support and advocacy groups and individuals &mdash; to work together on this issue.  Perhaps the National Office for Suicide Prevention should not only encourage but should incentivise creative and effective collaboration.  Pooling experience and expertise will mean that we are best placed to find at least some answers and to give hope not only to those who are vulnerable but, critically, to their families and communities.</P>
      <Col N="620" />
      <P>We have already had several remarkable awareness campaigns, about which we have heard, that have helped to begin to lift the stigma and shame surrounding mental ill health.  Now we need to step up these campaigns and encourage greater openness, honesty and understanding around the issues of mental ill health and suicide but as we do so, it is critical we find the right words to reduce fear and to give those who are vulnerable the confidence and the courage to come forward at an early stage to talk about their feelings rather than allow a crisis in their life to become a suicidal crisis.  This is no easy task but we all have a duty to do our absolute best to find the right questions and the right answers.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State well as she grapples with this difficult issue.  She should be assured that she has the support of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy">
      <NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, the group from Clondalkin and Deputy Derek Keating, who is doing tremendous work in this area.  As Senators, every day we hear about people dying by suicide &mdash; it is sometimes one person but it is sometimes several people.  It is very easy to feel helpless in the face of that but it is important that, as policymakers, we do not allow ourselves to be overwhelmed.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have worked in the mental health service for 27 years.  I was a psychiatric nurse and spent approximately six years working in the voluntary and community sector.  I claim no particular expertise in this area apart from the fact that I have seen at first hand the consequences of suicide and suicidal behaviour for families, individuals and communities.  Suicide is the greatest challenge facing Irish society.</P>
      <P>I have a great deal to say about suicide but I will confine myself to making one or two points.  I have been appointed rapporteur on suicide prevention to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and I will bring a report to the committee in due course.  As part of this, I have spent the past six months meeting stakeholders from the voluntary, community and statutory sectors as well as individuals who believe they have something to say.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am rather critical about the way we are approaching this problem but before I give a critique, I must acknowledge the great work going on in many areas.  It is necessary for us to be clear in our prescriptions and analysis.  Our methodology of collecting information on suicide is rather unsatisfactory, so much so that the real levels of suicide are not clearly known or understood.  Garda Form 104 is the document used to collect data.  As far back as 2007, questions were raised about whether it was the most appropriate way to gather information.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I will not give a lot of statistics except to note that in the five years before the publication of our national policy, Reach Out, on average, 493 deaths by suicide were recorded each year.  In the five years since the publication of the policy, on average, 461 deaths by suicide were recorded each year.  When we consider the population growth since, there seems to be some evidence to suggest our policy is working.  However, there are many ways to read statistics and if we are to include deaths recorded as being of undetermined intent, the statistical difference in the numbers before and after the publication of the document is very small.  Therefore, we must ask whether our policy is working.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The figure for 2009 of 527 people dying by suicide is the highest on record and we must ask what is going on.  Can we say the rise in the number of deaths is due to some dynamic associated with the economic recession?  We might be able to answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; but then again, we might well answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; because we just do not know.  There is no research in this area.</P>
      <P Just="Left">When we have a suspicion something might not be doing what we hoped it would do, it is prudent and necessary to review it.  The one omission from the policy is the lack of a review date.  It is a ten-year policy and it seems strange there is no provision at all for any type of <Col N="621" />review.  I understand the policy has been under-resourced and perhaps it is unfair to say it is not working when we have not provided the resources to make it work.  This might be another good reason a review is due, that is, to ensure the same circumstances pertain now as in 2005.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Reach Out contains 96 recommendations for action on a broad range of prescriptions.  However, of the 96 recommendations, 41 require some sort of a review &mdash; a survey, a determination, a revision, a evaluation or an audit.  They are fairly standard desk top research operations which could be done fairly quickly at minimal expense, yet they have not been done almost six years after the publication of the policy.</P>
      <P>One reason for this failure is a lack of clearly identified roles and functions and the failure to assign responsibility for these functions inevitably means that the work will not be done.  As has been said by many commentators, when there is a conflict between political convenience and evidence-based initiatives, political convenience always wins.  I hope that will not be the case with this policy.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty with the policy is the manner in which some of the objectives relate to the proposed outcomes.  I will choose one objective to illustrate the point but I could choose any number.  I refer to objective 18 in the policy which is to support the development of services and programmes for unemployed people and to help increase resilience and reduce the risk of engaging in suicidal behaviour.  There is evidence that there is an increased risk of suicide associated with unemployment but the vagueness of objective 18 and its lack of specificity makes it very difficult to see how we can realise its aims.  The untargeted approach of the policy renders the policy objective and many other objectives unworkable.</P>
      <P Just="Left">While I do not wish to appear excessively critical or to voice criticism for the sake of it &mdash; none of the criticism I make is directed at the Minister of State whose commitment on this issue is not in doubt &mdash; I must make some critical observations.  In 2007, it was recommended that the National Suicide Research Foundation develop a model to obtain detailed information on suicide and possible suicide deaths.  In consultation with the Coroners Society of Ireland the suicide support and information system, SSIS, was developed and piloted in Cork.  The service identified deaths at an early stage and offered to support families and friends of people whom it was suspected had died by suicide.  The scheme, which was internationally recognised as a proven life saver, identified an emerging cluster of 18 young men in one part of Cork who had died by suicide in a period of two years and introduced the necessary supports for families and communities affected by the cluster.  Without the SSIS, the cluster would have remained unidentified.  Despite this, funding for the service ceased in January 2010 and the service is no longer in operation.  This is a case of decisions being made in one policy area which have a direct and contradictory effect on decisions in other areas.</P>
      <P>I also query whether the document contains a publication bias by over-emphasising the biomedical model at the expense of the psycho-social model.  This question needs to be asked and while I do not have an answer, I suspect there is such a bias.  A major study by 80 suicidologists across the world found more research and a better understanding of the pathways that lead to suicide and suicidal behaviour were required.  It is clear from the literature that there is a lack of an evidence base on which policy in Ireland and across the developed world is built.  A great deal appears to be based on observed experience and intuition, which is not to say the various initiatives are not working.  While some clearly are working, the manner in which they work needs to be better understood.  One strategy that has been shown to work because it is an intervention that can be directly related to a positive outcome is the training of general practitioners.  Studies have shown that GP recognition of the earliest symptoms of depressive illness, which may include sleep disturbances and an early diagnosis and treatment plan, has reduced the number of suicides in some countries, most notably, Sweden.</P>
      <Col N="622" />
      <P Just="Left">Other research has found that depressive illness, diagnosed and undiagnosed, may account for up to 90% of deaths.  If one takes the broadest definition of depression, one can see how this could be the case.  Under this definition, depression is viewed as more than just being low in mood.  Instead, feeling low in mood is considered a symptom of depression.  The essence of depression may well be feelings of low self-esteem and self-worth.  If this is the case, we can see another dimension of depression which may not be considered an illness but is something that arises from life experience.  If this theory is correct, we must combine the biomedical model with the psycho-social model to achieve a comprehensive policy response grounded in strategies which help people cope with life&rsquo;s adverse advents.  Such a strategy must be introduced in primary school or even earlier.  Coping skills, building resilience and dealing with loss and failure must be viewed in the context of normal living.</P>
      <P>As this is a vastly complex area which is not fully understood, I hope the Minster of State will continue to make funds available for research as well as actions.  I ask her to instigate a review of the position we have taken on the policy response.  I am aware of her personal commitment to addressing the issue of suicide and wish her well in her work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett">
      <NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, as I always do when she attends the House.  I have a few thoughts on the issue before us.  On the first quarter numbers for 2011, while I do not know what role seasonality plays in the incidence of suicide, the figures from January to March 2011 indicate some improvement.  During this period, the number of recorded suicides stood at 95, which would produce an annual incidence of 380 for 2011, which is lower than the figure cited by the Minister.  Perhaps some of the issues on which the Minister of State has been working are starting to have effect.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The figures also show that of those who died by suicide in the first quarter of 2011, none was aged up to 14 years, 17 were in the 15 to 24 years age group, 20 were in the 25 to 34 years age group, 20 were in the 35 to 44 years age group and 22 were in the 45 to 54 years age group.  The incidence of suicide then slackens off in subsequent age groups.  It appears, therefore, that the main factors are those to which the Minister of State referred, namely, unemployment, poverty and the impact of the recession, especially on men.  As Senator Gilroy noted, substantial research is needed on suicide to identify what approaches work and which measures could help the Minister of State achieve her laudable ambitions.  I support his call for more research in this area.  A targeted programme studying all the suicides that occur each year should report back to medical researchers and the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I, too, welcome Deputy Keating and the group accompanying him to the House.  I note also that Deputy Dan Neville has acquired a considerable reputation for his work in the area of suicide over a long period.</P>
      <P>We have a history of massive institutionalisation of those with mental illness.  This approach, which have since learned did not work, dates back to before independence when large mental hospitals were constructed in Ballinasloe, Killarney, Portrane, Grangegorman, Mullingar and elsewhere.  The query that academic colleagues have put to me is whether building smaller units amounts to nothing more than moving to another form of institutionalisation.  Whereas under British rule, large institutions were built on the edge of towns, we are building smaller units as part of a policy that almost amounts to another form of locking people up.  Should the more psychological approach discussed by Senator McAleese be invoked?</P>
      <P>In the past when we tackled mental or psychological problems by building large mental hospitals a psychological approach was taken.  One must ask whether the wrong medication featured as a cause in some suicides?  Electric shock treatment has always seemed controversial to me.  As we attempt to come to grips with the problem of suicide, should the Minister of <Col N="623" />State&rsquo;s office examine the consequences of locking people up, giving them electrical shock treatment and treating their condition as a pharmaceutical problem?  How best can we help?  Are we taking the correct approach?  As the Minister of State will have gathered from this debate, the issue of suicide has generated considerable interest, a surge of good will and a desire among all Senators to assist in any way we can.  This must involve asking serious questions of some of the policies we have inherited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    
    <Speaker pid="CatherineNoone">
      <NameTxt>Senator Catherine Noone</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, my party colleague, Deputy Derek Keating, and the group from Clondalkin which is accompanying him.  Their interest in this matter has been recognised by numerous speakers.  This is a welcome debate because the issue of suicide needs to be discussed in general and specific terms in the Houses and community at large.  We need to be aware of the importance of simply talking to someone who has a difficulty that may lead to mental illness.  This is a cultural and societal issue.  The difficulties that people suffer daily can develop into a very serious problem.  The stresses in society, including as a result of unemployment and financial issues, are causing major problems for families which can culminate in suicide.  Practically every family has been touched by suicide in some way.  The problem of suicide has gone unreported for many years, although I am aware the issue is being addressed. </P>
      <P>One major issue I have raised before in the House is that in the media suicide is not glamorised &mdash; that may be the wrong word &mdash; but on many occasions, especially recently when a high-profile footballer took his own life, the media coverage is somewhat inappropriate.  Other speakers have spoken about how it can be contagious.  The over-glamorisation of suicide is a real difficulty.  Media guidelines state that every time something is mentioned in the media contact details for adequate support services should be placed at the end of a story, something which has not been done.  It should be re-emphasised to the media by the Minister of State and her Department.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I would like to make two main points on suicide.  I was very interested in the statistics provided by Senator McAleese.  The idea of ten to 14 year olds committing suicide is incredibly sad because they have yet to become the people that they are and the idea of that has resonated with me today.  The fact that 40% of suicide victims are young men between the ages of 18 and 28 is a stark proportion and shows that suicide is the biggest killer of young men in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have a particular bugbear about alcohol.  Studies have shown that the consumption of alcohol seriously increases the risk of mental illness.  If the risk of mental illness is increased the risk of suicide is also increased.  There is another cultural problem in the country we need to address very carefully.  We need to realise that the consumption of alcohol at the level we in this country consume it is very dangerous.  It is something which is being worked on and we had a Private Members&rsquo; motion on it in this House recently.  The debate was very constructive but it will take a lot more than increasing the cost of alcohol in supermarkets to address the prevalence of alcohol in society.  Not just the potential of suicide but many other problems are linked to that and it should not go unmentioned today.</P>
      <P>Suicide and unemployment is an issue, as other speakers have mentioned.  International studies have shown that for every 1% rise in unemployment there is an 0.79% increase in suicide rates, which is something we must be very concerned about.  There is no doubt that the Minister of State is addressing this in her Department.  The recession has left more young men out of work then any other demographic.  They are doubly at risk in this country.</P>
      
      <P Just="Left">Employment offers people a sense of purpose and improves their self-esteem.  Other speakers have spoken about self-esteem and its link with depression.  I agree with Senator Barrett.  The <Col N="624" />result of a lack of self-esteem and self-worth has to be depression.  In 2007 President McAleese hit on a particularly prescient point.  She pointed out that a sizeable proportion of victims of suicide had been dealing with problems of sexuality.  It is something that, along with depression, is not discussed in this country.  It is a huge issue.  It is a fact that for young gay teenagers, particularly those from rural backgrounds, adequate supports are not available, despite huge efforts by certain organisations.  It is another area that has a taboo attached to it and we must include it in any discussion on suicide in this country.</P>
      <P>The way suicide is treated, spoken about and reported has to be done carefully.  The contagious effect of suicide has been documented.  In a place called Micronesia the suicide rate in the 1970s soared from virtually 0% to 800%, which is an extreme example.  I have touched on the contagious nature of suicide before and it needs to be addressed.  This does not mean that we should be afraid to speak about it.  We should consider our words and make sure support is available for people.  Every one of us needs to be willing to embrace the subject.  It is a difficult one to talk about but in our daily lives we must be very aware of it.  I wish the Minister of State well with her work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AverilPower">
      <NameTxt>Senator Averil Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many other speakers, including Senators Noone and McAleese, I would like to focus on youth mental health, something we as a society have not given nearly enough attention to.  HSE services are still very underdeveloped, as the Minister of State will be aware, yet all the statistics show that unfortunately, the high rate of suicide among young people, particularly young men, means people are being let down. </P>
      <P Just="Left">From the point of view of long-term prevention, positive mental health amongst young people needs to be promoted to give people the coping skills they need.  There needs to be awareness of how important it is to look after one&rsquo;s mental health, be aware of signs of distress in others, realise that everybody will come up against obstacles and that there is nothing to be ashamed of.  People should be able to put their hands up and ask for help, whether one is a primary schoolchild or a teenager.  Often of course people do not need to ask for help unless, for example, they lose their job in their forties or fifties.  Giving children a level of awareness is important.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As spokesperson on education, I would like to focus on the role of schools in that respect.  We have had excellent debates in this House on social, personal and health education, SPHE.  While some schools are doing an excellent job there is a lot of inconsistency and I would like the Minister of State to work with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, particularly at the current time.  It is an area on which we need to place a much greater focus.  Schools are under a lot of pressure.  Young people want to get points to go to college but personal development is as important if not more so than acquiring academic skills and passing tests.  We need to give people the personal skills they will need for the rest of their lives to be able to face whatever challenges they encounter, whether in their personal lives, workplace or anywhere else.  There needs to be a lot more focus on promoting SPHE in schools.</P>
      <P>Senator Noone referred to the difficulties among certain groups of young people, particularly lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual young people.  The statistics are scary.  While one in four young people in general report that they have suffered from extreme forms of bullying, the figures amongst lesbian and gay teenagers are much higher.  Those who have reported bullying have said they considered suicide or have already harmed themselves.  Groups like BeLonG To and others are doing amazing work.</P>
      <P>As a Senator rightly pointed out, not nearly enough is being done and as a society we need to be more aware of the issue.  Schools have a particular role.  One of the particularly alarming facts in the research BeLonG To did last year was that some of those who have made inap<Col N="625" />propriate comments which made young people uncomfortable are their peers and teachers.  Such comments may not be made out of malice but people may not be aware of what is or is not appropriate.  A quick remark might wound someone to the core and it is important that we make sure teachers have the skills to support young people, particularly those who are at special risk of bullying.</P>
      <P>Focusing on schools, I would like to raise the issue of guidance counsellors.  I am not sure if the Minister of State was consulted by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, before the decision in that regard was made but I hope it is something she has discussed with him since.  Guidance counsellors are the one group of staff in our schools who have a special role in supporting young people.  Often the job is seen as helping people to fill in the CAO form and know abouttheir career options and what courses they should be picking, but as we are all aware,that is a minor part of the job in many respects.  A guidance counsellor is the person a student can go to if there is a problem at home such as parents breaking up, or if something else is causing him or her distress.  They are there to help students.  I thought it was a particularly cruel cut in the budget, especially in a recession when so many families are going through difficulties.  I hope the Minister of State will discuss this with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and highlight the importance of that role from the point of view of her own portfolio.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am aware of excellent services provided by local groups such as the Sphere 17 youth service in Darndale.  Such groups are now also facing cuts, which is a shame.  I appreciate the budgetary constraints, but survey after survey shows that rates of mental health problems are much higher in areas such as Priorswood, Darndale and Bonnybrook in Dublin 17.  Much progress has been made in recent years with all the extra resources that were provided to establish services.  Such informal supports, if they get kids out of a house where there are difficulties and allow them to play football or get involved in youth projects, are just as important as any of the formal services provided in schools or through the HSE.  We need to be careful to ensure that by making short-term cuts we are not creating long-term problems for ourselves.</P>
      <P>I will finish by raising one more issue which I have mentioned in the House previously and written to the Minister of State about.  Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate among mental health disorders, but this is an area that has been totally neglected, and services are poor.  There is a centre in Sutton, as the Minister of State is aware, that provides an excellent private service but cannot get support from the HSE, which has been slow to avail of the service.  This is an area in which a lot more work needs to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney">
      <NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the group from Clondalkin, although they have probably left the room.  I know many people are listening in on the Internet and I am delighted they have taken the time to do so.</P>
      <P>I extend my sincere sympathy to any family in this country that has been affected by suicide.  I know exactly the traumatic and devastating effect it has on families and I can guarantee I know exactly how they are feeling.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Rural isolation has a major impact on the number of suicides, especially among older people, particularly older men.  I am taking a slightly different line from other speakers, who talked about younger men, but the statistics from rural areas vary somewhat from others.  The coroner in south Kerry has stated that tougher drink-driving laws are leading to more suicides among older men who are already suffering from isolation in rural areas.  This same coroner previously highlighted a growing incidence of suicide among elderly males and said that while new road safety legislation might be reducing the number of deaths on the roads, it was leading to more suicides.  These people are often widowed or single and living alone.  They cannot go the local pub for a pint because they are afraid they will be caught drink-driving.  They are used to going <Col N="626" />out for one or two pints a night and meeting their friends, but they are not doing that any more.  While I do not condone drink-driving, there is no doubt that in some cases the law is leading to rural isolation.</P>
      <P>I help deliver meals on wheels in Killarney to the elderly and disabled and I know for a fact that in some cases we are the only people they will see during the day.  While they would love us to spend a bit of time chatting with them, we cannot do so because the meals for other recipients are going cold in the car.  It just goes to show that people are lonely and isolated.  With the closure of post offices, shops and creameries, there is a major gap in social contact in rural Ireland.  I will speak about south Kerry because that is the area I know best, but of course this applies to every area of the country.  There were 67 suicides in south Kerry in the period from 2005 to 2011; of the victims, 41 were over 40 years of age.  There were 11 cases of suicide in the area in 2011.  Of the 11 people who took their own lives, two were aged between 22 and 30, two between 31 and 40, three between 41 and 50 and four over 60.  The overwhelming majority were men.</P>
      <P>Isolation can come in many forms.  I know a young girl who was attending secondary school but was very unhappy because she felt isolated.  She fell in with the wrong group when she started school and over the years, the group, while they did not bully her, cut her off.  She would go into school on a Monday morning and hear that the group had been at the pictures on Saturday night but that she had not been told.  She was always hanging on the edge of the group, only spoken to if she asked a question.  She noticed them whispering and became paranoid, thinking they were whispering about her.  This girl had a very good relationship with her parents, and when they heard what was happening they immediately removed her from the school and put her in a new school, where she blossomed.  She made steadfast friends there who are still her friends to this day.  Who knows what would have happened had that girl not been able to speak to her parents.  Perhaps she would have gone for counselling; I do not know.  She did go to her parents and, thank God, they rectified the situation, because she was in a bad state when she came to them.</P>
      <P>There should be a media campaign to highlight the services available to help prevent suicide, along the lines of the campaign to reduce road deaths.  I was delighted to read in the Minister of State&rsquo;s report &mdash; I was listening on the monitor when she came in first &mdash; that the advertising campaign is being ramped up.  That is welcome news.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In south Kerry the only organisation that offers counselling to children and adolescents is the Southwest Counselling Centre.  It receives funding from the HSE for children and adolescents, but this is not particularly for suicide prevention.  However, it does provide an emergency counselling service for people who may have attempted or who are actively contemplating suicide.  It also provides affordable counselling for a range of issues such as depression, anxiety, abuse, bereavement and separation, self-harm and relationship or family problems.  We all know that nearly every one of those can lead to suicide.  Most of the funding for this counselling centre, which offers a fantastic service to the people of south Kerry, comes from fundraising and donations.  I understand that Console, the national organisation for suicide prevention, is to provide free services in Killarney town from next month.  This is thanks to a local businesswoman and former nurse who led a project to create greater suicide awareness in Kerry.  The clinical director of the counselling centre has advised me that its members are meeting and dealing with more and more people in distress.  They have witnessed an increase in the number of people experiencing financial strain and struggling to cope, which can take a serious toll on mental health.</P>
      <P>International research shows that the current economic conditions are a factor in increased suicide rates.  It is now time for a co-ordinated approach to suicide prevention.  It is time for all <Col N="627" />individuals and groups with significant and varied experience in suicide prevention, education and awareness, research, support and intervention to work together to maintain community-wide suicide awareness and work towards prevention.  This is the approach taken by counselling centres such as the Southwest Counselling Centre.  If we are really serious about suicide prevention, especially during a time of recession, we will have to consider serious funding for centres such as the Southwest Counselling Centre and all the other centres and organisations throughout the country that are actively working on the ground, day in, day out, doing their best to save lives and give people the confidence and the will to live.  They are making life a little brighter for people who are constantly in a dark place.  I commend all these organisations that are literally taking people&rsquo;s lives into their hands and that may be the last port of call for people who are in a desperate state.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Reilly, to do all in their power to ensure the HSE and the voluntary organisations receive adequate funding to enable them carry out the invaluable lifesaving work.</P>

      <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I commence my contribution with the words of a gentleman in his late 20s, reflecting on his youth.  These words appear in a research study commissioned by the Health Service Executive in 2009, entitled, Supporting LBGT- lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender lives. It reads:</P>
      <P LI="1">It was not the being gay that made me feel suicidal, it was all the bullying, the name calling, the negative ideas about being gay that I was full of from growing up in a homophobic society and the fact that I never heard one person say, in all my childhood and adolescence, that being gay was okay or even good.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">These negative ideas about being gay also match my experience several years ago in the US, although I did not experience any over-bullying.  I often felt shame.  I felt shame for my feelings, my actions and who I was discovering myself to be.  What I know now is that shame is never generated from within, it develops as others who are not like us suspect that one is different and, therefore, treat one as inferior.  It also develops when somone comes in contact with laws and systems fashioned by state or religious leaders who keep a person outside the mainstream of human worth or worthiness.  Sometimes such a sense of shame can lead to attempts to end one&rsquo;s life brought on by the conditions or the culture or ethos within which a person grows up or as a result of bullying and name calling in a homophobic society. Such a society is still alive and well in 2012 in 21st century Ireland. The previous President, Mary McAleese, in one of her final speeches in office, spoke about the need to dismantle the noxious apparatus of homophobia.</P>
      <P>One of the prime questions we are here to address is why people commit suicide.  My comments will focus on one specific dimension, namely, the link between people with minority sexual and gender identities and suicide.  I am grateful to Senators Noone and Power who have already raised this issue.  Senator Power referred to a couple of statistics.  LGBT youth, in particular, are at an elevated risk of suicide.  Some 50% of these young people under 25 years of age have seriously considered ending their lives and 20% have attempted to, at least once.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Research suggests negative reactions to or portrayals of these young people&rsquo;s lives impact on their ability to form a positive self-identity.  Different sexual and gender identities are perceived as deviant, not normal, and, therefore, not good.  Senator Power referred to the BeLonG To youth service which is at the forefront of work in this arena, especially with young people.  It was recognised as best practice at the recent United Nations conference in Brazil on homophobic bullying in education, on which I congratulate it.  The national strategy for action on <Col N="628" />suicide prevention also identifies LGBT people as a marginalised group who experience discrimination and as being vulnerable to self-harming behaviour.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">Last year, the Minister for Education and Skills launched guidelines for principals on including LGBT students in school policies, as developed by the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and BeLonG To.  Therefore, we have the guidelines to prevent homophobic bullying but will they be implemented?  Within these questions is the issue of ethos within educational settings.  I believe the ethos issue is critical for a number of reasons but in this instance the issue of ethos is crucial for suicide prevention.  As we are all aware, there is a dominance of the Catholic Church in the education system.  Its approach, especially at primary level, is to integrate its ethos within the whole curriculum, as well as the overall school.  There is a need to raise some critical questions as we look at the link between minority sexual and gender identity and suicide.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Members may be aware that Catholic doctrine, thus the Catholic ethos, is that homosexual practices are deviant, not normal, not good.  While Catholicism teaches that the homosexual person is good, homosexual practices are effectively evil.  In outlining this belief, the Pope is on record, in a document entitled, Unions Between Homosexual Persons, as writing that those who move from tolerance to the legitimisation of specific rights for cohabiting homosexual persons need to be reminded that the legitimisation of evil is far different from the toleration of evil.  Those are his words, outlining explicitly the Roman Catholic doctrine that intimate love expressed between homosexuals is evil.  It is rational to conclude that there is a blatant contradiction in efforts to implement guidelines to prevent bullying of LGBT young people in schools with a Roman Catholic ethos.</P>
      <P Just="Left">What can we do about this?  That is a question we need to raise in our debate on suicide prevention.  In June 2011, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, said he proposed considering establishing a working group, comprising all relevant sections of his Department, NGOs in the arena, education partners to help draft a roadmap towards the elimination of homophobic bullying in schools.  My office has been checking to ascertain if that group has been established. It appears as if nothing has happened. I recommend that the Minister of State bring to the attention of the Minister, the urgent need to establish the working group. As part of its terms of reference it should consider square on, the relationship between homophobic bullying and religious ethos. In light of the evidence this could be a critical step towards moving towards the prevention of suicide for LGBT persons. LGBT people are beautiful young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">The Clondalkin community action on suicide group, from my area, which has left was welcome.  It has done massive work, as have Deputy Derek Keating and Deputy Dan Neville who spearheaded the issue, when people were not as vocal.  I mention, in particular, Mr. John Quinn from Clondalkin, who was awarded the equivalent of the Dragons&rsquo; Den in the business section, which was shown on RT&Eacute; television recently.  He spoke out recently at his son&rsquo;s funeral as nine people in Clondalkin had committed suicide in 2005.  He just said, &ldquo;I am here, if there is anybody who wants to talk to me.&rdquo;  His service in a voluntary capacity has mushroomed and has been recognised in the media since.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister has heard of groups such as Clondalkin community action on suicide group and Mr. John Quinn who are giving massive support and should be given support.  All speakers mentioned the voluntary groups which get up and go and do something.  The Minister of State <Col N="629" />listed all the supports that are available in a national capacity but some are only available in pilot project areas.  The voluntary groups must be supported.</P>
      <P>I welcome the work done in the primary care area of moving people out of institutions into care in the community.  A Vision for Change, introduced in 2006, contains many excellent recommendations but implementation is slow.  The Minister of State said she had reactivated a group which is trying to put an implementation strategy in place.  Much is being done and much has been done.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The stigma associated with suicide must be recognised.  The stigma is being lifted by the debate but some of the media coverage of the debate may not be helpful.  We have heard about copycat suicides and how they are being dealt with.  How we lift the stigma on suicide is important.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I spoke about the importance of education, including physical education.  Education on suicide prevention is most important.  Not everybody is happy all the time.  I am sure everybody in this room has days on which he or she feels down.  It is a question of learning how to cope with not feeling 100%.  If the message on how to cope got out to young people in particular, it would be beneficial.  One cannot be happy all the time.  It is a question of being resilient and having the tools to deal with feeling down.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senators mentioned the economic circumstances and stated a 1% increase in the rate of unemployment leads to a 0.79% increase in the suicide rate.  Senator Gilroy mentioned the lack of serious statistics.  The recommendation in this regard must be taken seriously.  Statistics are one thing but it is a matter of how they are interpreted.  Those who try to commit suicide and do not succeed should be included in the statistics but they comprise a separate body.  The independent directorate for mental health about which the Minister, Deputy Reilly spoke, ought to be welcomed because it will participate in focused implementation.</P>
      <P>Most Senators referred to loneliness.  The buddy system in place in some areas should be considered in this regard.  I refer to the old days when people were more supportive of one another.  When there was visiting and card playing and when society was less formally organised, people were socially interconnected.  This must be considered.  We must ask what people can do for themselves and their communities and not ask all the time what the Government can do for them.  This could involve dropping in on people and chatting with them, as Senator Moloney said.  I refer specifically to young people because we see the trend in respect thereof.</P>
      <P>When the Minister is examining this matter, the difference between the biomedical and psychosocial models must be examined.  As I stated, community care and working on the ground are the way to go.  There should be places where young people can drop in.  Some have been opened.  Local councils in various areas have what are called coffee bars for young people.  There is somebody to whom one can turn.</P>
      <P>The old church view that suicide was a mortal sin did nothing at all for suicide prevention.  This led to the great stigma.  People did not admit that individuals committed suicide and claimed they died for some other reason.  I am thankful the stigma in this regard is gone.  The modern approach of the church to suicide is similar to that proposed by St. Augustine in the fourth century in that it involves responding with compassion, love and pastoral care.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We could have a debate on the ethos in schools and the separation of church and state.  Religious belief is important to some in dealing with suicide and should not be discounted at all.  People find it important but it should not be interlinked with education.  Religious belief, whether it involves meditation or religion, is a separate, personal issue.  I heard Mary McEvoy state on television how Buddhism had brought her back from depression.  Our ambit should be broader than a medical one; it is the psychosocial model that we should be looking at.  I recommend it to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane">
      <NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State  to the House.  I am very pleased this is one of the debates we were able to secure in the early stages of this year.  I know it is very difficult for the Leader to arrange statements and debates on the first week of the term but our achieving it on this important issue shows the sense of purpose and interest across all parties and among Independents in doing more about suicide prevention.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Gilroy stated there is cross-party support to ensure investment in education, prevention and intervention such that awareness will be raised not only of suicide but also of depression, with a view to dealing with many of the stigmas that are unfortunately associated with them.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Suicide, as Senators have said, has touched us all.  Just before Christmas, somebody with whom I had a very close relationship died by suicide and left three young children behind.  She was a single mother.  We can all give examples of the trauma and hurt caused among affected families and communities.  Senator Keane referred to all the unanswered questions.  We need to ensure that we raise awareness of suicide.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the issue of depression because I have experience of it in my family and among other sufferers.  I have done a lot of work with a number of pioneering general practitioners in Waterford who have done considerable research in this area.  One wrote a book about depression and spoke about the need for proper awareness raising in regard to the issues associated with depression.  This leads me to a number of key points.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is important that we highlight the context and the figures.  It has been said that the CSO figures for 2009 show the number of suicides was 527.  I appreciate that for each individual victim, there is a grieving family.  We need to be cognisant of the human element but the figures are important for us to understand that suicide comprises a very emotive and important issue.  Unfortunately, more people die from suicide than on the roads.  That is a very difficult reality for us to accept.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In January 2010 the CSO stated there had been 127 deaths by suicide registered in the second quarter of 2010.  Of those, 102 were male and 25 were female.  In the same period in 2009, 122 deaths were registered, 94 of which were male and 28 female.  Geoff Day, the director of the National Office for Suicide Prevention states in his office&rsquo;s annual report for 2009 that international research indicates that during an economic downturn, the number of suicides increases.  He states the size of the increase, based on the provisional figures, is extremely worrying and that the the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 in Ireland and across Europe has led to substantial increases in both self-harm and suicide numbers.  It is a fact that when one loses a job and faces all the concomitant difficulties, including the pressure of trying to pay bills, there is an impact on one&rsquo;s mental health.  Even if we do not have national research results to prove there is a correlation &mdash; there is international research to prove it &ndash; we can accept that the downturn leads to an increase in the rate of depression.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I thank Mr. Hanafin of Amnesty International for providing me with some information on what is happening in Greece.  In that country in 2010, there was a 40% increase in the suicide rate.  There was a 400% increase in the number of individuals calling support lines and call centres.  We do not have the same increase in Ireland, for which I am thankful, but Samaritans has put on record that there was a 9% increase in the number contacting the organisation in 2011.  One in eight of those calls was related to the economic recession.  We can accept this is a problem.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The WHO states collaboration with the employment sector on mental health policy is vital.  It has suggested that we implement measures, in co-operation with employers, to safeguard the mental health of employees.</P>
      <Col N="631" />
      <P Just="Left">Let me talk about employment and unemployment because a number of Senators have focused on a number of other issues and some of the target groups, including lesbians, gays, the transgender community and young people, including young males.  A disproportionate number of young male Travellers die by suicide. The focus can be on unemployment and all the pressures associated therewith.</P>
      <P>Many people in employment suffer from employment-related stress.  In 2007, the health and well-being employment strategy was put in place under the auspices of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office.  It called for awareness raising and worked with employers to ensure an employee suffering from stress or depression would be given the supports he or she may require.  Unfortunately, the stigma associated with depression lends itself to those individuals not seeking the support they may need.  Awareness must also be raised among the general population as the families of people suffering from depression need support too.</P>
      <P>Suicide prevention needs to be made an area of co-operation under the North-South Ministerial Council to give the issue the strategic co-ordination it requires.  We need to frame and implement a fully resourced, comprehensive all-island suicide prevention strategy including actions to promote mental health among the general population delivered through schools, youth services, workplaces and the media.  Mental health promotion actions need to be targeted at specific sections of the population while incorporating their diverse needs into tailored suicide prevention sub-strategies.  We need mental health promotion and suicide prevention actions targeting groups identified as higher risk and assist those bereaved through suicide.</P>
      <P>While I support the Government&rsquo;s efforts in suicide prevention, I hope we will move away from coming up with but not implementing good policies, such as A Vision for Change and the health and well-being employment strategy.  If there is a need for a reorientation of resources in the health services for suicide prevention, I hope it will be achieved.  I also hope the Minister will take on board some of the constructive proposals I outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKelly">
      <NameTxt>Senator John Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on her efforts in tackling this important issue.  I agree with Senator Moloney on the role of rural isolation, a real bugbear of mine, in suicide.  I have worked in my community for 28 years and have much evidence that this is a real issue.  While drink-driving laws are welcome in bringing down road deaths, they can have a negative impact on the social lives of single men in rural areas, leading to further isolation.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I greatly dispute the accuracy of the official figure of 527 deaths by suicide recorded last year.  Everyday, we read newspaper reports of fatal single car accidents involving an individual male passenger.  We have no idea whether it was suicide or an accident.  Conscientious coroners may want to protect a young person&rsquo;s family by declaring their death to be through misadventure rather than being more specific.</P>
      <P>The Road Safety Authority has gone as far as it can possibly go.  It has reduced road deaths to an all-time low and it will probably not get better.  The move by the authority to award penalty points for a dirty windscreen is not positive.  It is interesting that as road deaths are coming down, suicides in rural areas are going up.  A balance needs to be struck but I believe we have gone past finding it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Recently, when I visited my local community development office I noted the sheer number of advertisements on the wall from organisations such as Headstrong, Living Links, Samaritans, One Light, Console, the National Office for Suicide Prevention, Aware, Grow, Childline, Teenline, and many more involved in mental health and suicide prevention.  What is needed is one authority which will take on suicide prevention in the same way Mr.  Noel Brett and the Road Safety Authority tackled road deaths head on.  Mr. Brett could branch into this area.  I know <Col N="632" />his father was a community psychiatric nurse, therefore, he would have the expertise and backup.  The Minister of State should consider establishing a dedicated authority to deal with suicide prevention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite">
      <NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on her valiant efforts to keep social inequality on the Government&rsquo;s radar.  As she is aware, in 2008 I published <i>What We Can Do About Suicide In The New Ireland</i>.  It is available for download on my website.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Much of the focus is on suicide and mental health problems caused by unemployment.  It is important we keep cool heads at this time.  Of those who lose their jobs, 99% will not die by suicide.  There is a responsibility on employers and the trade unions, however, to support those who lose their jobs, particularly those in their 50s who may have problems getting future employment.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We have all seen the problems Greece has with its austerity programme.  Until last year it had one of the lowest rates of suicide.  Between January and July 2011, according to the Greek health Ministry, there was a 40% increase in suicides there.  We must remain calm and give backup to people who lose their jobs.  As the economic recession continues, along with the austerity programmes, there will be an increase in the numbers suffering from mental health problems, self-harming and suicide.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The National Suicide Research Foundation, based in Cork, indicated there has been an increase in self-harming rates in the past four years.  It is now estimated 60,000 people self-harm with 12,000 such cases presenting at accident and emergency departments every year.  Alcohol also plays a leading role in self-harming.  Dr. Ella Arensman, based in the National Suicide Research Foundation in Cork, before Christmas in <i>The Irish Times</i>, sent a message that people should be more careful about what they drank and how they drank following the publication of figures from her organisations that indicated a link between alcohol consumption and self-harm.   Some 70% of those who self-harm do it by overdosing on medication, with the remainder self-cutting.</P>
      <P>It is all very fine before Christmas in that the holidays are coming, it is fun and people are inclined to take alcohol if they feel like drinking, but binge-drinking is the problem.  In the Bible, Jesus Christ converted water into wine.  I have no problem with alcohol, but each one of us has a serious responsibility to treat it very carefully.  It is all right for most of the people who can drink&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite">
      <NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I draw attention to figures for self-harm.  Over 40% of the 12,000 who turned up in the accident and emergency departments after self-harming had alcohol in their system.  If a person is feeling depressed or vulnerable, or has problems, as SenatorZappone stated, such as sexual orientation problems or is worried about losing his or her job, and if he or she drinks alcohol to excess, he or she will feel worse and will not be able to get himself or herself out of this depressing situation.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As has been stated by colleagues, four or five times more people die by suicide than in road accidents.  It is on the political radar.  We have got the number of road deaths down.  I would put much of that down, along with Mr. Brett, to Mr. Gay Byrne as a leader in society who demanded money for road safety to improve the figures of those surviving road accidents.  We <Col N="633" />have developed the awareness that one should not drink and drive because of how dangerous it is.  We must get the message out that one may enjoy alcohol but one should treat it carefully.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is a serious issue.  In my document, I drew attention to three areas that had been internationally proven as indicators of a reduction in suicides.  The first was reducing alcohol consumption.  The second was training general practitioners, GPs, in identifying depression when they met cases of it.  The other was restricting access to lethal means.  On the point about GPs, when I was doing my research I met families who told me that they had brought family members with mental problems who were feeling depressed, particularly young men, to GPs and the doctors said they would be all right, and they subsequently died by suicide.  General practitioners are not up to scratch in identifying serious potential suicide or self-harming, or they are not up to date on adequate treatment.</P>
      <P>I would make a final point on the issue of social exclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I was drawing attention to the cuts in the programme for DEIS schools, particularly in west Tallaght.  If a person is well off and his or her child has emotional problems, the person can pay for the medical or counselling help but if one does not have the money, one does not get it.  Even in this issue of self-harm, those who are less well off have not got the resources to help their children who may have problems.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, continued success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames">
      <NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  This is a broad-ranging debate on the issue of suicide prevention and I thought I would confine my remarks to a few basic points based on some practice.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is a difficult area.  Despite so much being done in this area, we know we are still not managing to nip it in the bud.  There are really, as yet, no definitive answers but I suppose what we do know is what we should not do.  In the past few weeks, there has been an emotive debate on the issue of career guidance in the country given that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, stated that the career guidance counsellor is a teacher like every other teacher and he or she will be within the teacher allocation.  It has driven the career guidance organisation to an emotive level and some of its spokespersons, in particular, an eminent spokesperson who is sound in the area of career guidance, have made inflammatory comments on the issue of suicide.  The spokesperson to whom I refer, who is a former president of the career guidance counsellor organisation, has stated that reducing career guidance provision will increase the incidence of suicide among young people.  There is no evidence of that.  In fact, the contrary is the case.  In the past 30 years, there have been significant increases in the number of career guidance counsellors but yet there has been a considerable increase in the incidence of suicide.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames">
      <NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">There are many other factors.  That is how complex it is.  It is to do with societal change, societal pressure, etc.  I condemn the remarks of Mr. Brian Mooney in that regard. I really admire the man on other fronts. He is an eminent speaker and commentator in <i>The Irish Times</i>, but this is not professional. It is not fitting for this man because he is too good to be using that type of language and it is not the way to deal with it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In this regard, I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to ask the Minister, Deputy Quinn to issue a directive to all second level schools to ensure that the suicide prevention module in SPHE is taught to all students.  Social, personal and health education, SPHE, is <Col N="634" />mandatory up to junior certificate, but I have been speaking to principals in second level schools in the past few days arising from these inflammatory comments and they stated that they have the wherewithal within subjects such as religion and SPHE to teach a module on suicide prevention.  That would be a healthy move.  The time to teach is when children are healthy, not when they are at risk.  When they are at risk, one never knows what works.  Everybody should be getting this information, and in each school year.  I taught religion in New York state for a number of years very early in my career and suicide prevention was one of my topics.  I also taught history.  I started the day sometimes with religion and ended, depending on where it was timetabled, with history, and the kids were still coming to me during history to talk about suicide.  This should not be the job only of a career guidance teacher.  Mental health and positive well-being are so important that they should be the business of all teachers.  The Minister can give a lead by issuing that directive to all schools.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I support what Senator Zappone stated.  It must be part of the caring ethos of all schools and, to give schools their due, it largely is.  Many schools have a care team, with year heads and tutors.  Some schools, for example, have a letter box whereby a person can anonymously drop in the name of someone about whom he or she is concerned.  These are positive measures.  In many schools, there is also a pastoral care team.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is not fitting for those comments to be made by the former president of the guidance counsellors&rsquo; association.  They are not fair and not accurate.  I condemn them but I also ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister to intervene positively stating that this should be the business of all teachers and that the issue of suicide prevention must be part of the core curriculum.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Zappone is correct that homophobia has caused some young people to have suicidal tendencies.  As part of an early school leaving study last year, we interviewed young members of the lesbian, gay and bisexual community on this issue and they told us that they had contemplated suicide as a result of homophobia being perpetrated in schools.  Therefore, it is important that those guidelines are implemented.</P>
      <P>My third point concerns the courts.  Several years ago a young man who had bipolar disorder committed suicide in a neighbourhood close to where I grew up.  He had committed an offence and was brought before the judge but his medical records were not allowed to be presented in court.  His family were adamant that they should have been taken into consideration because they believed they would have persuaded the judge to commit him to a psychiatric ward.  He had stopped taking his medication.  He committed suicide that night.  I wrote to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, but he responded that he would not take those comments into account.  This is an example of a direct causal link.  As I do not know the current position I would be grateful if the Minister of State could indicate whether medical records are now being taken into account by the courts, particularly where psychiatric illnesses are involved.</P>
      <P>My final point pertains to rural isolation.  The drink driving limits have reduced the number of accidents on our roads, which is brilliant, but they also contribute to the problem of rural isolation among older men living alone.  I have asked myself how I could support the non-implementation of drink driving limits.  However, the statistics indicate that most drink driving related accidents involve younger men.  Should we introduce different limits for older people based on these statistics?  We could set the limits according to age brackets of, for example, ten or 15 years.  We do not know for certain about causal factors but we should not contribute to concerns that can cause deaths in other ways.</P>
      <Col N="635" />
      <P>I would be delighted if the Minister of State was able to follow up on the four issues I raised, namely, schools, courts, homophobic guidelines and rural isolation.  It is a big job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCrown">
      <NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for turning her attention and considerable skills to this troubling area.  I am 54 years old and personally knew 14 people who committed suicide, including nine health care professionals and people who in some cases were known to suffer from mental illness.  This is clearly a major problem and anybody who does this sad calculation will realise a considerable proportion of the people they know have been touched by this issue.</P>
      <P>While I completely understand the problem of rural isolation, we should not in any way try to make the case for reducing the burden of suicide by increasing access to alcohol.  Alcohol is an addictive cancer causing toxin which can depress people and lead them to suicide ideation.  It is not a solution.  I do not suggest my colleagues were arguing such a case and I understand they are trying to disconnect the notion of alcohol from social isolation.  Perhaps we need to consider creative ways of increasing connectivity for older people in isolated rural areas while avoiding the impression that we condone increased alcohol consumption.</P>
      <P>These are excellent initiatives but another issue lies at the heart of them.  We need to find out how we compare to other jurisdictions in terms of the number of consultant psychiatrists employed in this country per head of population.  The numbers are not as bad in respect of psychiatry compared with other specialties.  We tend to have dismal and appalling ratios of specialists per head of population but we are merely bad in the area of psychiatry.  We are at the bottom of the scale but a bit of effort would bring us to international norms.</P>
      <P>We also need to critically examine medical school funding and resources to decide whether our six medical schools, which equate to one per 700,000 people, or twice the European average and three times the American average, are sufficiently resourced with full-time researchers and consultant level academic university employees who are conducting psychiatric research into the unique context of suicide in Ireland and can offer a critical educational grounding not only for young psychiatrists but also for GPs and other health care professionals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LorraineHiggins">
      <NameTxt>Senator Lorraine Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for the hard work she has done in the area of mental health.  In particular I commend her for her commitment to addressing the issue of suicide, which has blighted communities throughout Ireland in recent years.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this emotive debate.  My own community has been affected many times by the issue in recent years and it would have been remiss of me not to elicit and share the views of local people.</P>
      <P>It is a sad reflection on modern reality that more than 500 people chose to commit suicide in 2011.  However, I acknowledge that Ireland is by no means unique in this regard.  The Minister of State indicated that the figure for Ireland is akin to the population of a small village.  The worldwide figure is almost equivalent to the population of Dublin because 900,000 people worldwide died by committing suicide.  This represents one death every 40 seconds.  On a global scale suicide ranks among the three leading causes of death for those aged between 15 and 44.  In the past 45 years suicide rates have increased by 60% internationally.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It would be foolhardy to suggest that all suicides can be prevented but we must be mindful that the majority of them can.  A number of measures should be considered to ameliorate this societal scourge.  We must ask what we can do to prevent people from believing suicide is the only option.  People have to cope with myriad pressures in this economic climate.  The increase in the provisional figures for 2011 is not a fluke because financial pressures have led to mental illness and, in many cases, suicide since the Celtic tiger&rsquo;s demise.  A considerable number of people speculated or purchased property at grossly inflated prices, while others took on credit <Col N="636" />cards, store cars or bought second cars at the height of the boom.  The American dream became quintessentially Irish and Ireland became a monetary utopia facilitated by easy money and aggressive marketing from the banks, a lack of Government intervention and blatant disregard for regulations.  In 2012 these same people are now bearing the brunt of failed banking policies.  They are in negative equity and some of them are unemployed while they fight to save their family homes and their families.  These people cannot deal with the doom and gloom that have been foisted on them and they certainly cannot handle the increasing pressure from the banks and their debt collection departments.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have been contacted by several individuals who are in despair over their treatment and the fact that they have no hope or light at the end of the tunnel.  These people are on the edge and they believe they have no support.  While I recognise that the corporate sector works on an entirely different basis to most others, we must seek higher standards from those who are tasked with debt collection.  We must remind them they have a duty of care to their customers which extends beyond the contractual.  In particular, I draw their attention to section 11 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 which provides that a person who makes a demand for payment of a debt shall be guilty of an offence if, &ldquo;the demands by reason of their frequency are calculated to subject the debtor or a member of the family of the debtor to alarm, distress or humiliation&rdquo;.  We should be more active in securing convictions against those who breach this criminal code.  Debt collectors must strive to be as compassionate as possible and for that reason I urge the Minister of State to liaise with her ministerial colleagues to investigate the possibility of introducing a suicide training programme for bank employees who work in the area of debt collection.  This is important in light of the number of repossessions that have occurred for several years and the increasing number of people who are in default on their mortgages.</P>
      <P>We also need to deal with suicide prevention issues at an early stage.  Let us start at secondary school and ensure every teacher is trained in suicide awareness and prevention before our term in government concludes.  It is imperative that teachers are assisted to identify early warning signs and to ensure our young people are educated that suicide is very much a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  As part of this, schools should have an integrated programme with activities to help those with low self-esteem and social complacency.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As a Government, we must be mindful of the repercussions of cutbacks to essential services and reliefs available in schools.  For that reason, we need more joined-up thinking between the various Departments to ensure decisions made in the education sector, in particular, give due regard to this issue.  We also need to be more proactive with suicide prevention initiatives.  We need to examine the implementation of a new communications policy whereby we liaise with the various mobile phone operators and ensure that, along with general customer care numbers, numbers for groups such as Console, Pieta House and Samaritans are also automatically stored on telephones sold in Ireland.  Suicide spots also need to be identified.  We all know where they are and perhaps signposts should be erected at these locations warning of the consequences of adverse action.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Our focus should be on a bringing about a lasting reduction in the number of suicides and suicide attempts.  Factors that may result in young people taking their own lives need to be identified, assessed and eliminated at an early stage.  We also need to raise general awareness of suicide and provide psycho-social support for people with suicidal thoughts or experiences of attempted suicide.  We must be mindful that everybody is not happy or confident 365 days a year and most suicides do not happen without warning.  We must listen for that noise and we must be sufficiently engaged with the services on offer in order that people can be diverted as required because one suicide is one too many.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly">
      <NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for attending.  Senator White referred to money and resources.  I am speaking from personal experience.  A 24 year old approached me last weekend and said, &ldquo;I wish I had money so that I can get my boyfriend treatment.&rdquo;  She did not want money not to go out, travel or buy clothes.  No 24 year old should have to say that.  I will speak about a person close to me and her direct engagement with the health services.  I commend Sosad Ireland because its voluntary contributions and services have kept this person alive.  Senator Keane mentioned a buddy system.  Such a system is inadequate.  In my case, one 24 year old is supporting another 24 year old.  The HSE need to provide that service; a young person should not to have to rely on herself to do that.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The boyfriend of the person to whom I refer is depressed and every day he battles to stay alive because he wants to die.  That is the unfortunate reality.  As an elected representative, I do not want to talk about statistics or rehearse the issues raised by previous speakers.  I will read a written statement by this girl about her boyfriend and her experience of public services.  It states:</P>
      <P LI="1">I may not know all the statistics but I know depression and all the other forms it takes.  I see depression every day.  I see the man I love wake up every day in tears wanting to die, wanting to get away from the unbearable pain.  I see his mental health deteriorate.  I see his physical health deteriorate.  I tell this 24 year old man that things will get better.  I ask him to just hold on, one more day, one more week.  I tell him that the help he needs will eventually come, that the doctors do care.</P>
      <P LI="1">He has suffered from depression and anxiety for years and years.  He has moved from doctor to doctor seeking help, each one pawning him off on another.  Medication for depression and anxiety disorders is supposedly a short-term answer, yet medication is the only consistent treatment that he has gotten in four years.  His psychiatrist is nothing but dismissive.  When he tells his psychiatrist that he still feels suicidal on the pills, his psychiatrist does not reassess the situation; he just ups his dosage, up, up and up until it can&rsquo;t go any higher.</P>
      <P LI="1">This man that I love had a breakdown seven months ago.  There is no other way to describe someone collapsing so severely in themselves mentally and physically.  After this breakdown, his first port of call was to his GP where he was told that everyone gets a little down sometimes.  The dosage of his medication was upped and, within ten minutes, he was out the door.  The sad reality is that even now when we know all about mental illness and suicide, people are still walking into their GP telling them that they&rsquo;re feeling suicidal and, within ten minutes, that person who has high chance of killing themselves is walking out the door with a prescription stopping them from taking that step.</P>
      <P LI="1">Fortunately, he changed doctors and now he has a very caring, compassionate and proactive GP.  Since his breakdown, he has seen his psychiatrist four times.  He was referred to a psychologist and occupational therapist also and has seen her twice.  This is a man waking up every day wanting to die, a man working out a suicide plan just waiting on the day to come when he will have to kill himself, a man pleading for help telling doctor after doctor that he&rsquo;s so depressed, that he wants help, that he wants to get better, that he doesn&rsquo;t want to die but the pain is so bad that it seems like the only way out.</P>
      <P LI="1">In many suicide debates in this country, we hear about the people that have taken their lives and that didn&rsquo;t ask for help.  Well here is a man that is pleading for help, proper help, not to be packed out the door with more medication that won&rsquo;t change his life.  Here&rsquo;s a man that wants to be able to live his life like his friends, wants to be able to travel, to be able to <Col N="638" />get out of bed in the mornings and to be fit to work, a man who just wants to live his life and not feel like he is a burden to his doctors, to the very people who are supposed to be helping him.  To them, he is a 15-minute appointment, 45 minutes if he&rsquo;s lucky.</P>
      <P LI="1">I want my boyfriend to get the help he deserves so that he can be the amazing, talented and happy person I know he can be.  I want us to be able to wake up and know that instead of having to reassure the man I love that adequate help will eventually come that we can get up and live a day with normal worries about money, the price of petrol, the amount of tax we are paying.  I would trade anyone for their money debts if they could help him get better.  I want to wake up in the mornings not having to worry if I&rsquo;m going to call from someone to say that he&rsquo;s dead.  I want to be able to wake up and know that I won&rsquo;t have to find his body somewhere.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That is her story and I want everyone to remember that.  I would like the Minister of State to take it away with her.</P>

      <P Just="Left">All over the country, men, women and children face the most harrowing reality on a daily basis that a loved one has died by suicide.  Somehow they have to find the energy to face this reality every day and to carry on into the future, a future very different from the one they once hoped for.  The intensity of their grief is unimaginable.  Their loss and the loneliness is often beyond words and it is awful that none of us, no matter how deep our compassion, can ever understand their grief in the same way they can never understand what drove someone they loved to a point of such sadness and despair that he or she could not carry on.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">It is good that there are many volunteer agencies such as Samaritans, Console, Aware and others that do much to help them.  Waterford County Council under the mayor, Mr. Liam Brazil, will hold a conference on mental health and suicide awareness next month in Dungarvan and its members are to be commended for their efforts in this regard.  Speakers from Living Links, Suicide or Survive, Mind Your Mind, the Irish Society of Suicidology, the HSE and others will address the conference.  Many organisations and individuals deal with this issue.  More important, they do outstanding work to reduce the incidence of suicide in order that fewer individuals and families will be beset by this awful grief.</P>
      <P>Suicide was a taboo subject in Ireland for many years.  I fear that the problem was neglected by the State and, therefore, our understanding of suicide has only begun to grow in recent years.  However, we need to do much more to bring public attention to the issues that lead to suicide.</P>
      <P>There are things we can do as individuals, families and communities, but in this Chamber we can also play a role in bringing together all the strands of care, treatment and support for those who feel suicidal as well as the support systems for those whose lives have been traumatised by suicide.</P>
      <P>To this end, like other speakers, I favour a co-ordinated national approach to this growing problem.  The growth in the incidence of suicide in Ireland has seen the establishment of a number of organisations dedicated to the issue of suicide in one way or another.  Many people have called for a strategy similar to the one on road safety.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane">
        <NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.  We had a short discussion on this issue in the context of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill last year but I tabled this matter on the Adjournment to discuss the impact of the community employment scheme cuts and specifically the impact the cut in the material and training allowance will have on a number of community employment schemes in Waterford.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister is aware, there has been a 66% cut to the material and training allowance for each course participant.  That has an impact on the ability of some of the schemes to deliver services.  These schemes depend on this money to pay for training, insurance, rent, equipment, tools, telephone and everything other than wages.  It goes towards paying for how the course operates and ensures participants get the training and education they need.  It is vital that training facilitates genuine pathways from training and education in these courses into employment.  The ultimate goal of community employment schemes is to get people back to work.  If the schemes are unable to provide the training and education people need, it will seriously curtail the ability of many course participants to get back into employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This cut also poses a potential threat to the ability of a number of existing schemes to continue to function.  If they cannot provide the funding for insurance, rent or equipment, for example, how will they function and from where will the money come?  I can offer the Minister two examples from Waterford city.  One is the Saor programme which has 18 community employment scheme workers, ten in Waterford city and eight in Clonmel.  It provides training, upskilling and educational opportunities for people who are recovering from substance misuse.  It does a great deal of good work in the community, linking with drugs awareness and community-based drug projects.  The programme&rsquo;s grant for each of the participants will be reduced for &euro;1,500 to &euro;500.  The supervisors tell me it will be very hard for them to continue to provide the service this year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Compact community scheme in Waterford city operates from Lady Lane House.  It has 19 community employment scheme workers and provides meals-on-wheels, maintenance work for people who live in sheltered housing and in housing for older people and caretaking work in the community.  The scheme is sponsored by the Simon Community and Enable Ireland.  The scheme will find it difficult to continue the same level of service this year if these cuts are implemented.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware of this issue and I accept that she has called for a review to assess the impact these cuts will have on the operation of each community employment scheme.  I have given her two examples from Waterford city but I am sure she has been given other examples from throughout the country.  I hope that, as with the issue of DEIS schools, we will not simply see a review but a complete reversal of the cuts.  When one considers that we have massive unemployment, with 445,000 people out of work, and that it is very difficult for people to get into employment in the first place, these schemes are a bridge for many people who have no wish to be unemployed and doing nothing.  They want to be able to do something and to contribute.</P>
        <P>The Minister will also be aware of what will happen if some of these community employment schemes are unable to provide services such as caretaking, child care, meals on wheels and so forth in the community.  Somebody else will have to provide them and potentially at a greater <Col N="640" />cost to the State.  I contend that it makes economic sense and certainly social sense for the Minister to review and, ultimately, reverse this cut and to ensure that every community employment scheme in the country is able to continue.  My party advocates that we build on the success of the community employment schemes and ensure we have a greater number of people on the schemes and greater opportunities for people who, unfortunately, because of the jobs crisis in this country, are not able to gain full-time or even part-time employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB">
        <TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt>
        <NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
        <P Just="Left">I am delighted the Senator has raised this very important issue.  Community employment schemes make a very important and valued contribution to social employment, training and progression for unemployed people.  Furthermore, many community employment schemes provide vital community services not only in Waterford but throughout the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are 1,143 community employment schemes in operation nationally with 23,300 participants.  The overall estimated budget stands at &euro;315 million for 2012.  In my constituency, for example, I am very familiar with the great work done by the Centre for Independent Living and by Blanchardstown community employment scheme.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware, the Department of Social Protection has recently taken over full responsibility for community employment schemes as the previous F&Aacute;S employment services division joined the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January.  I am delighted to have responsibility for these schemes which, like the Senator, I have a lot of personal experience of and which play such an important role in our communities, in particular by providing services which have of intrinsic social value like helping the disabled to live independently, like the example used by the Senator of Compact in Waterford city and like delivering meals on wheels, in particular to our older citizens.</P>
        <P>This point that tends to get lost in some of the purely economic analysis of community employment schemes which views them as not delivering sufficient progression into the labour market.  While it is true that many community employment schemes need to improve the manner in which they provide labour activation services, there will always be a role for schemes that are primarily directed towards the provision of crucial social services, often for disadvantaged communities which are in dire need of services like child care, elderly care and drug treatment programmes. The intrinsic social value of these schemes is not captured by conventional economic models but this is more a failing of conventional economics than of the schemes themselves.  The IMF should please take note.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Social Protection, I am determined to ensure that the contribution of such schemes is recognised in any future decisions on the future operation, funding and role of community employment.  Given that this area was coming over to the Department of Social Protection for the first time, I asked for an initial review of the financial resources of all schemes to be completed in March 2012.  As I said, there is a total spend on this area of &euro;315 million.  Standard templates have been developed and issued to the employment officers involved.  These are the former F&Aacute;S staff who are now employment officers and civil servants in my Department.  The review will be carried out between local community employment sponsors and the departmental employment officer responsible for the scheme under local management.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The discussion that will be undertaken with schemes will be conducted in a constructive manner and all support possible will be provided to help the schemes to remain viable.  As I speak, employment officers are making initial contact with schemes.  In addition to these local discussions, discussion and consultation with the main representative bodies and stakeholders involved in schemes will take place in the coming weeks in regard to funding.</P>
        <Col N="641" />
        <P Just="Left">Separately, the former F&Aacute;S research unit has been asked to complete a strategic value for money review of a number of schemes administered by the Department.  Community employment will be reviewed as part of this exercise.  The outcome of this review will guide future policy development and is also expected to be completed by the end of March.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am also planning a stakeholder consultation event in order that I can better understand the role that community employment schemes play throughout the country and obtain the views and feedback of scheme sponsors, supervisors and participants.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The outcome of these reviews will inform the overall approach to be taken by my Department in regard to how to secure the best outcomes for the schemes and their participants, taking account of the large amount of money we spend on community employment schemes and the valuable contribution that many of them make to their communities.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the reviews is to examine the income and funding of sponsoring organisations in terms of their ability to continue deliver the programme.  It is also being carried out in the context that there are community and voluntary sponsoring organisations that receive funding from a multiplicity of State agencies.  Alternative sources of support will be examined, particularly with reference to funding from other State agencies to avoid duplication.  The review will also seek to establish if income is generated by scheme activity and the potential for utilisation of these funds to cover project costs.</P>
        <P>This is a listening Government and I have been listening carefully to the concerns raised by the community and voluntary sector about the impact that changes to the training and material grant could have on community employment schemes pending the outcome of the review.  Following on from changes to the training and materials grant for community employment schemes announced in budget 2012, I made a commitment that no community employment scheme would close pending the completion of this review.</P>
        <P>Let me be very clear about this.  In the event that the changes in the training and material grant announced in the budget create financial difficulties for schemes, my Department will continue to provide funding for those schemes.  In this context, I want to confirm that the funding is available in my Department to make this commitment a reality.</P>
        <P>I would like to stress also that community employment participants can continue to avail of education and training programmes that are available to them free of charge from existing State-funded providers.  This facility will also form part of the arrangements that will be developed as part of the establishment of SOLAS under the Department of Education and Skills.  It was formerly the education and training wing of F&Aacute;S, which is now gone.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I welcome the stakeholder consultation review and the fact the sponsors, participants and supervisors will form part of it.  I also welcome the commitment that no scheme will close but there is a fear that some schemes may have to curtail their services.  I am not all that hung up on where the money comes from to ensure schemes can operate, whether support from the Minister&rsquo;s Department or through the grant which courses were getting for each participant, but I want to ensure that those schemes which are in operation and provide the services, about which the Minister and I spoke, continue in communities.  I hope the outcome of the review, about which the Minister spoke, will lend itself to that and we will see not only continued but improved services from community employment schemes in the State.</P>

        <P Just="Left">As I said, the former F&Aacute;S employment officials joined the Department on 1 January.  They started work as civil servants in the Department of Social Protection last Wednesday.  We are in a new era and I believe it is an era of opportunity, even though as the <Col N="642" />Senator is aware, the financial constraints are very difficult.  This is an opportunity to do something very positive in regard to community employment.</P>
        <P>As I said, there are three things in which I am particularly interested: the service being delivered, about which the Senator spoke; the quality of the experience the person participating in the scheme gets; and value for money because there is no point pretending that money is not very tight.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Community employment makes a valuable contribution.  I recognise that, as does the Government which has affirmed it.  It is a new era and a new Department but it would be remiss of me, in taking on such a large budget, the approximately 700 staff who formerly worked in F&Aacute;S and 1,100 community employment schemes, not to use the opportunity to examine what community, social and public assets the Department is acquiring and how we can best use the service capacity and so forth available to us to create a good experience for those who join community employment schemes.</P>
        <P>Since my appointment in March 2011, I have got two schemes off the ground.  More than 3,500 people have joined JobBridge and more than 2,000 are participating in T&uacute;s.  As a result, more than 5,000 people have obtained, in the main, good opportunities and the feedback from the schemes has been good.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I stated, there are 23,000 people participating in community employment schemes.  My objective, given the terrible level of unemployment, is to reform the system in a manner that increases numbers and gives more people a good experience, while maintaining the vital services which, as the Senator noted, form a key element of community employment.</P>

The reduction in patient numbers in recent years arose from the implementation of HIQA standards which include the provision of patient care in one and two bedroom units as opposed to the previous system of wards.  HIQA officials visited Lifford Community Hospital and produced a report showing that the facility met all standards.  The hospital received the best report of all community hospitals on which HIQA reported in County Donegal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before Christmas I attended a public meeting on Lifford Community Hospital attended by up to 1,000 members of the local community.  This was a massive, unified show of support by the local community for retention of the community hospital.  County Donegal has 11 public community hospitals run by the Health Service Executive, all of which face difficulties for a variety of reasons.  While HIQA standards present a problem, staffing problems are causing greater difficulties.  The moratorium on recruitment in the HSE and other public bodies has resulted in the closure of beds in many community hospitals.  Staffing reductions and declining resources mean the community hospital network in County Donegal is operating at only approximately 70% capacity.  One often hears the Minister for Health state it is not cost efficient for the State to have people staying in public hospitals.  However, comparing the cost of a private bed with that of a bed in a community hospital that is operating at 70% capacity is not comparing like with like.  I invite the Minister, Deputy Reilly, or the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to visit some of the community hospitals in County Donegal, including Lifford Community Hospital, to see at first hand the invaluable care being provided by health <Col N="643" />care professionals for local people.  It is incorrect to claim the care provided in a community hospital is not efficient and I challenge the Minister in that regard, particularly in light of the position in County Donegal.</P>
        
        <P>Community hospitals must be upgraded.  HIQA standards are setting the bar in that respect.  Anecdotal information from HSE officials suggest the overall cost of upgrading all 11 community hospitals in County Donegal to meet the new HIQA standards would be approximately &euro;40 million.  While this is a substantial sum, capital investment in community nursing homes would be money well spent.  The State must be judged on the basis of how it deals with its elderly population.  If we choose not to provide publicly funded community nursing units for the elderly by withdrawing services, it will be a step too far.</P>
        <P>On decision making, the HSE is carrying out a review of community nursing units.  I understand the exercise commenced at local level and is feeding into a national review.  The findings will be submitted to the Minister for Health who will make the final decision on closing community nursing units.  My message to the Government is to keep its hands off Lifford Community Hospital and other community hospitals in County Donegal.  The hospitals in question are operating at only 70% capacity.  People require the services they provide, especially in County Donegal which has one of the highest populations of people aged over 65 years in the country.  Elderly people require public nursing units or, if they so wish, private units.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am sure this issue has been examined in the HSE.  Does the Department have a table prepared on the cost of upgrading all public nursing units in the country?  Will capital expenditure be found to invest in these units?  Upgrading them could act as an economic stimulus, not to speak of the benefits such facilities provide for elderly populations and local communities.  I hope the Minister of State has some good news for me on Lifford Community Hospital.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to update the House on this matter and outline the background to the current position and the action taken by the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Government policy on older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  We continue to develop and improve health services in all regions to ensure quality and patient safety.  The Health Service Executive has sole operational responsibility for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as Lifford Community Hospital, County Donegal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Lifford Community Hospital is one of 11 community hospitals in County Donegal.  Established in 1799, the hospital has 20 beds, 11 of which are for long-term residents while the remainder provide convalescent, step-down and intermediate care for patients discharged from Letterkenny General Hospital.  Both the moratorium on recruitment and compliance with national quality standards are impacting on the community hospital system in County Donegal.  These pressures are mirrored across the country and are well documented.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I acknowledge there is considerable concern about the future of our community nursing units.  There is no doubt we are facing challenges in this sector due to staffing, funding and the age and structure of existing units.  However, I confirm that no decision will be made to close a public nursing home without a full consultation having taken place with all stakeholders.  It is clear that on a business as usual basis, the Health Service Executive would have to close further beds across a range of public community nursing units in 2012.  In the absence of reform, <Col N="644" />this would increase the cost of caring for older persons within the public system.  Consequently, this would undermine the viability of public community nursing units and reduce the overall number of older persons that can be supported within the budget available for the fair deal scheme.  This is not a sustainable way forward and would not meet the needs of older persons, local communities, the taxpayer or those working in the public service.  Instead, we need a more proactive approach to the provision of community nursing home units which seeks to protect the viability of as many units as possible within the funding and staffing resources available.  This includes smaller units where challenges of scale may require more innovative approaches to service delivery.  This is likely to require a combination of actions such as consolidation of services and changes in staffing, skill mix and work practices.  Consequently this will require consideration of the different types of services required &mdash; such as long-stay and transitional &mdash; and the respective strengths of public and private community nursing units in that regard, the public and private capacity available within an area, the age and structure of public units, the wider needs of the local community and alternative options for providing a viable community nursing service, including a possible role for local communities or other voluntary providers. The HSE is already examining issues in this regard and will be working closely with the Department to develop an overall set of proposals for consideration. All developments have to be addressed in light of the current economic and budgetary pressures and any decisions taken by the HSE must have regard to this and the current moratorium. I trust the House will agree that we need to ensure that the highest standard of care will continue to be provided for all residents in a safe and secure environment.  Providing quality and safe care will always remain at the heart of any considerations.</P>

        <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  She said she could confirm that no decision will be made to close a public nursing home without a full consultation having taken place with all stakeholders. I understand that has come about as a result of the court case taken by the elderly people in Abbeyleix where the High Court ruled that before a nursing home would be closed there would have to be wider consultation.  Will the Minster of State advise as to what that consultation means?  Will it mean contacting every individual within the catchment area because everyone will be old at some stage and may avail of the local community hospital?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hate to see words such as &ldquo;viable community nursing services&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, everything has to be viable.  The elderly who worked hard, paid their taxes and did all the right things in the past and whether it is viable they require a home if they cannot live in their own home.  While home care packages are available there are people who cannot live at home, even with that care and attention.  Those people should not be judged on viability, even though there is a cost implication for the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill">
        <NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
        <P>There should be some other way of dealing with the issue.  Where a nursing home is working efficiently and HIQA is satisfied it is meeting the required standards, pristine condition, providing great health care for the patients, that nursing home should not be on the agenda for closure.  I appeal to the Minister of State to take those factors into consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch">
        <NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
        <P>On the issue of consultation, not every single person in the greater community will be contacted.  That would be impossible and would be so time consuming that one would never get a result.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
        <P>When it comes to consulting all stakeholders, those who live in the home, their family, the GP and the nursing staff in the community must be consulted.  Irrespective of a court case, that is the approach that should be taken because one is intruding into people&rsquo;s lives.  I am not certain that units of 50 beds must be the criteria.  That is not where we should be going.</P>

        <NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
        <P>Viability is key and there would be variations.  One has to consider various skill mixes for people who are frail and incapacitated but not sick.  Most people in community nursing homes are in that category.  They do not need intensive medical nursing care but supervised living.  Changing of the skill mix will make most of those units viable and enable us get around the moratorium.  There will have to be a change of thinking in how they deal with us.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue.  I wish him, the staff and the Minister of State a happy new year, especially to the Minister of State in her important role and all the battles she will face.</P>
        <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of Eureka secondary school in Kells, County Meath.  The community of Kells have waited a long time for the construction of a new school and are eager to have it completed as soon as possible.  There is a great deal of controversy and many complications concerning the school not with the Government but the local authority which has delayed progression of the school.</P>
        <P>However, I ask the Government to follow on from the announcement made last year by the previous Government and allow the school to proceed to architectural planning and construction at an early stage.  There has been speculation at recent meetings of Kells Town Council and Meath County Council that the school would be part of the next tranche of schools to be progressed by the Department of Education and Skills.  This would be a positive development for the community and the prospective students of one of the best secondary schools in the north east.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I recall an LMFM schools quiz and being defeated by Eureka secondary school in Kells.  It has a great record in a number of academic areas, including the Young Scientist competition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If this school project is not to be progressed, it will be a matter of grave concern to the people.  Despite heated debate in Kells in regard to the issue, which was not the responsibility of the Government, the new building for Eureka secondary school has progressed significantly but any slowdown in its provision will be opposed by me, my party and local residents.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to confirm the school&rsquo;s current position in the overall programme, what stage it is at and what priority is being attached to it by the Government.  Clarity for the people and young women of Kells is a necessity.  I urge the Minister of State to respond to these questions as fully as possible.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  I thank the Senator for raising it as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position on the application for a new school for Eureka secondary school, Kells, County Meath. </P>
        <Col N="646" />
        <P Just="Left">The Senator will be aware that a major project for the school was included in the list of projects in the work programme for 2011 where school accommodation project briefs were to be formulated and the process of appointing a design team was to commence.  In the context of that announcement, the Department acquired a site of about 11.5 acres in Kells under the terms of the redress scheme for the new school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The architectural planning process was progressed during 2011 and a schedule of accommodation prepared on the basis of a long-term enrolment of 750 pupils.  The school authority subsequently wrote to the Department requesting that the long-term enrolment be increased to 800 pupils.  The Department considered the request and agreed to this revision.  This warranted the completion of a revised educational worksheet by the school.  The project can be progressed further and a revised schedule of accommodation can be drawn up as soon as this information is provided by the school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current status of all projects in the school building programme, including this project, may be viewed on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i> which will be updated regularly throughout the year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator will be aware that the Government&rsquo;s medium-term infrastructure and capital investment framework which was published on 10 November 2011 sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years.  Given the need to ensure every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects and smaller projects devolved to schools to meet the demographic demands nationally, as well as the demands in Kells, will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  The Minister has previously committed to publishing shortly a five-year plan outlining the school building projects to be constructed in that time.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>
