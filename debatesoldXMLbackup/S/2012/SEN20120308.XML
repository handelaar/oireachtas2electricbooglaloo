	<P>I have received notice from Senator Marie Moloney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Social Protection to consider extending the period of the formal medical review of domiciliary care allowance.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Thomas Byrne of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to outline his views on the decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to refuse permission for the N2-Slane bypass and to outline the measures the Government intends to take to deal with this rejection in light of the urgent need for this project, especially with regard to the safety of motorists and pedestrians.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>I notice the Labour Party is rather thin on the ground this morning in the Chamber.  The cancellation of this afternoon&rsquo;s Government party shows it is certainly the party pooper and that finally it has had one achievement in government.  It is beginning to show its true strength in the Fine Gael-dominated Government.  I congratulate the Labour Party on that.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Last night we learned 2,500 jobs are to go at AIB.  This comes on top of losses of 750 at Bank of Ireland and 900 at Aviva.  There has been significant destruction in employment in the financial services sector.  We already know the problems that have been caused in the sector.  However, those getting the sack are not the ones who caused them.  They are the ordinary tellers and managers who kept society and the economy moving.  They are also the ones who probably gave some people hope in their darkest hours when they went looking for a loan from the bank.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Blank"><NameTxt></NameTxt>
	
        <P>Normally, when there are major job losses in any sector, the Government will say the usual words of sympathy and that something must be done.  In this case, something must be done because the Government owns the banks and, as an employer, it has a direct responsibility to the staff.  What will the Government do to ensure this jobs cull does not take place or is alleviated to the greatest extent possible?  The staff affected will find it difficult to get other employment in the financial services sector.  What will the Government do to ensure they are retrained for alternative employment?</P>
        <P Just="Left">This morning a party was cancelled.  Yesterday, however, we had another party at Government Buildings where the Government boasted about the implementation of a new structure for the Irish banking system, the creation of pillar banks and the mergers of AIB, EBS, IBRC and INBS.  Not only is the Government standing over the job losses at AIB, it is boasting about them on page nine of this morning&rsquo;s newspapers as a crowning achievement of its first year in office.  That is a shame.  The report goes on to state the Government is ahead of schedule in its efforts to shrink the size of the covered banks.  Not only is the Government not doing anything to stop the job losses, it is actually congratulating itself on it.  This is a shameful day.  The banking sector&rsquo;s problems are difficult, maybe intractable, but it is not good enough to boast about significant job losses in the sector.  Accordingly, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the Minister for Finance be brought into the House to discuss these job losses, his response to them and any alleviation measure--</P>

He might reflect on the legacy of his own party in government for 14 years.

	<P>My question is on the household charge.  Now that we are nearly half way through March, will the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government attend the House to outline the other methods of payment that will be available to people?  It has been suggested in the House that An Post be used.  During our preliminary discussions, I suggested to the Minister that all local authority offices be used as locations at which people could pay.  In my constituency office, I provide a service through which people can pay via the Internet.  Many people still do not have the Internet.  People in my area must travel 14 miles to Clonmel to pay the charge.  This is unfair.  This month will see an improvement if the Minister expands the range of locations at which people can pay by including local authority offices and An Post.  Will the Leader raise this issue with the Minister?</P>

	<P>Today is international women&rsquo;s day.  On 2 February, this House started a journey with the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to consider the Independent group&rsquo;s amendments on political donations and gender quotas?  I encourage the House to play a strong role next week in giving the amendments full consideration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At noon in the Mansion House, Women for Election will be launching its programmes, which I am delighted have the support of all political parties, to inspire and equip women to run.  In the Abbey Theatre this morning, Ms Nora Owen noted that, before she was asked to run in a local election in 1979, she did not even know that the election was taking place.  Imagine if someone of her esteem had not become involved in politics.  The idea is to ask and encourage women to run for election.  Here is something to remember for today.  Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did.  She just did it backwards and in high heels.</P>

	<P Just="Left">If the Cathaoirleach is calling me, I am grateful.  I congratulate Mr. Se&aacute;n Gallagher on the decision he received from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  It was appropriate.  I listened to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, on every radio station.  He consistently described the situation as a mistake, but I do not believe that to have been the case.  I will not single out a particular programme, but the entire context in which the election was fought was poisoned.  Inappropriately, all candidates and the very office of the President were treated with a lack of respect and courtesy.  I deplore that conduct.  The entire process was turned into a circus, the presenters on radio and television were the ring masters and their colleagues in the media universally awarded the ring masters the prize at the end of every debate.  This is not right.  We should have been discussing issues.  That said, there is no question whatsoever that the election itself should be impugned.  Everyone would agree with me that Michael D. Higgins is the duly, properly and legally elected President of Ireland, full stop.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not discuss in the House the level of respect for the President.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I spoke of him with great respect and in the highest terms, as I am sure the Cathaoirleach will agree.  I was simply confirming that the election was appropriate, but that its context needed to be considered.  Every party committed to a review of the electoral process.  When it was reviewed by an all-party committee in 1996, three principal recommendations were made to make it easier for independents to enter the race.  In last year's race, not a single real independent who passed the stringent test of just entering the race met the quota.  Consequently, severe financial burdens were placed on them.  This was inappropriate.  The matter must be referred to the constitutional review committee, but I am sure that it will also take into account the fact that the representative of the largest party in government and in the State failed to reach the quota as well.  Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the matter?  The recommendations for reform, which were agreed by all parties in 1996, were provided for in a Bill introduced by then Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  The Bill was presented to the D&aacute;il a few weeks ago and voted down by the Government parties that agreed to it originally.  Obviously, they want to stall it.  In a democracy, the constitutional review committee should examine the matter.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMulcahy"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Byrne regarding senior managers in the organisations in question.  They should be removed.  In the past three or four years, every business has needed to contract and tighten up its activities.  Unfortunately, I have needed to lay off many staff.  The days of underwriting and subsidising loss-making businesses and organisations are long gone.  I include the banks in this.  It is regrettable, but we would have a more efficient banking system if we tackled large issues like this head on.  I am prepared to support that initiative.</P>
        <P>The issue I wish to raise relates to the Minister for Social Protection.  Rent supplement has been set at a rate at which people can no longer afford to avail of housing, particularly in urban areas.  Setting a rate of &euro;475 for a house in a small rural parish in County Clare might work, but one would not get a house for two adults and two children for &euro;475 per month in the towns of Shannon and Ennis.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to review the rent subsidies payable in urban areas?  We will not be building new council houses and the supply of social housing is scarce across the country.  At times like this, we need to do everything in our power to facilitate young couples.  A rate of &euro;475 is ridiculous.  I could cite a list of counties.  I am sure the situation in County Waterford is the same, as Senator Cullinane would agree.  We must review the rate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s comments on International Women&rsquo;s Day.  In the Leader&rsquo;s reply, I encourage him to send the message that the political system would value and welcome greater participation by women.  In this context, I commend the large number of young, articulate, committed, political women who attended last weekend&rsquo;s Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis and are actively involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of Senators have spoken about getting women to run for election and I commend them on their work in that respect.  To quote a speech:</P>
        <P LI="1">It has been my experience that the style of leadership usually pursued by women makes them particularly effective in getting the job done.  There is accumulating evidence that women bring a set of communication and interpersonal skills to the workplace which, while often ignored in the past, are better suited to the team-oriented leadership of the 21st Century ... While we have made progress in relation to gender equality, there are still many barriers to be broken.  Despite high standards of education, women still have not been afforded the opportunity to fill many key decision-making roles.  It is not only women but society as a whole that suffers a loss from such exclusion.  In many instances, women are not enabled and empowered to bring their expertise to the table to ensure that our decision-making is based on the balanced views and experiences of both genders.  It is a matter of regret to me that patriarchy and its related authoritarianism still prevails in many fields and that it conspires to self-perpetuate, despite all the evidence in support of the value of diversified decision-making.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader for a debate on United Nations Security Resolution 1325.  The Government launched its national action plan on this two months ago.  This ground-breaking resolution calls on all nation states to implement policies at home and abroad that reflect women&rsquo;s experience of conflict and enable them to access formal peace-building processes.  I acknowledge the work of Hanna&rsquo;s House Alliance which is bringing this resolution to the fore.  We should have a debate on the matter in the House with the Minister.  It is important that we advance the resolution as quickly as possible.  I commend the Government&rsquo;s initiative on a minimum of 30% of candidates in general elections being women.  We have not yet given up on having the same quota for local elections.  I would like a debate on United Nations Security Resolution 1325 in order to put the advancement of women&rsquo;s experience of conflict on the agenda of this House.  Women have been written out of history on this island for far too long and we want to ensure their experience of conflict is written into history.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Arising from the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la that the Slane bypass and extra bridge over the River Boyne should not be built, I ask the Leader to take up with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport the prospect of a heavy vehicle ban in that village.  In the neighbourhood of this House, the environment has been greatly improved by the diversion of trucks through the port tunnel and the M50.  The data for how safe Dublin city now is confirm that.  There is also the experience of a smaller HGV ban in Maynooth and I am sure Deputies representing the Kildare North constituency will be able to help the Minister in that regard.  There is capacity to the east of Slane on the M1, which is designed to motorway standard, to take heavy goods vehicles and there is a link to Ardee, north of Slane.  The N3 is also designed to a standard to take heavy goods vehicles north of Kells.  The solution is to preserve the Georgian village, which includes a unique set of four magnificent houses, and Newgrange.  Slane, like many other towns such as Naas and Abbeyleix, would improve greatly if it were bypassed by heavy goods vehicles, which is the solution.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la did us all a favour by refusing the construction of an extra, expensive bridge across the Boyne when there is capacity on two existing motorways to which trucks could be diverted.  That requires the Minister to discuss with the National Roads Authority the level of tolls and to discuss with Meath County Council other diversionary measures.  A low-cost solution that would benefit the environment, economy and heritage of Slane is available.</P>

	<P Just="Left">This morning&rsquo;s newspaper headline that 2,500 people will be asked to leave one banking institution either by voluntary or forced redundancy is frightening.  Who decides?  I hope nothing is happening without proper consultation.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has been very clear about a proper clearout, which may not be fully completed, at board and senior management level in all the banks.  We must remind ourselves that there is a necessary fitness and probity test for all the people concerned.  I do not believe that exercise is yet complete.  I do not want see a single person forced to leave a banking institution.  As the acting leader of the Opposition said, none of these 2,500 people got us into the mess in which we find ourselves.</P>

	<P>In this instance it is necessary to proceed with caution.  We need to grow business in the banks.  We have all heard of the many complaints of small businesses and others who are starved of credit and necessary working capital.  The credit function is mostly centralised and the people working in that function in head office are vital to the future of growing the banking business here.  I recommend caution now with less speed on this issue.  Until there is proper consultation and this is sorted out, no one should be allowed to leave.  As I have done previously, I call for an urgent debate on banking which I hope the Leader can arrange in early course.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Yesterday the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste published a report, which reviewed the Government&rsquo;s first year in office.  It is only fair that we judge the Government fairly in the past year.  I would benchmark the Government&rsquo;s performance against what its parties promised they would do in their pre-election manifestos.  They promised not to put one red cent into the banks and not to pay back bondholders unless aggressive burden sharing was agreed.  In November 2011 some &euro;700 million was paid back to bondholders, &euro;1.1 billion was paid back in January and &euro;3.1 billion will be paid back at the end of this month.  They promised to reduce the live register by 100,000 in their first two years in office.  We have as many people out of work now as we had when the Government came into office and we now hear about proposed job losses in AIB.  I come from the south east whose unemployment rate of 18% is the highest in the country.  My city, Waterford, took very heavy hits with job losses and those jobs have not been replaced.  The Government promised to deal with upward-only rents and mortgage distress.  There were red-line issues coming from the Labour Party on child benefit and college fees.  In its first budget, it caved in on those two promises.  Across the board on the big issues of unemployment, emigration, and what is happening in the banks and the public services with money taken from health, education and local authorities, the Government has not delivered.  I am not judging it on what I want it to do but on what its parties promised to do in their pre-election manifestos.  They have failed and we are getting more of the same from the Government.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that a senior Minister attend the House today in order that we can discuss what the Government has done and failed to do in the past 12 months.</P>

	<P>Senators Byrne and Cullinane have made reasonable proposals to have debates on banking and the implementation of the programme for Government.  It is also reasonable for me to say that it is most unlikely that the Leader could produce the Minister for Finance or Taoiseach today.  I ask the Leader to try to ensure that at the earliest possible stage &mdash; I believe Senator Paul Coghlan concurs &mdash; we should have a debate on banking.  It would also be helpful to have debate on the progress of the Government to date at the earliest possible stage.  If we want the House to be taken seriously and with some degree of relevance and respect, we cannot expect to produce Ministers out of a hat instantaneously.  I appeal to the Senators who moved the amendments to await the Leader&rsquo;s reply.  I hope he will be able to outline that those &mdash; admittedly urgent &mdash; debates will take place in the very near future.  I concur with what Senator Paul Coghlan said about the banking crisis.  It is deeply regrettable to hear of such substantial proposed job losses and every possible angle must be pursued.  However, let us not be hypocritical in these Houses.  In recent years we have called for a more efficient and effective banking system and presumably some degree of rationalisation is necessary, but 2,500 sounds draconian.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with the general sentiments of Senator Norris on the presidential election campaign.  We had a debate on media and media standards some weeks ago.  We should revisit the debate arising from yesterday's statement from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland on the Se&aacute;n Gallagher matter.  It is regrettable that the "Frontline" programme produced a distorted view of reality.  One cannot replay a presidential election or any election once it is over.  It is too little too late to apologise or say "sorry" to Se&aacute;n Gallagher.  However, we must learn from the way in which the presidential election was conducted from a media perspective.  A revisiting of the role of the media in politics and the reporting and presentation of politics could be useful in the long run.</P>

This was in the context of Ministers travelling abroad for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  Some of the kudos may have been tarnished this morning.  It seems each time we discuss jobs, it is like pressing a button and we go into the mode of name blaming and scapegoating straightaway.</P>

	<P Just="Left">If the thousands of young people queueing up to leave the country saw a replay of the debate this morning, would they consider our concern and support to be real?  Their attitude could be summed up by: &ldquo;A plague o&rsquo; both your houses!&rdquo;  We have said many times that some issues should be set apart from political expediency and the issue of jobs should be one of these.</P>
        <P>There were opportunities in the past which we did not take.  We are well into the recession at this stage and we are suffering the results of that recession.  We are all lucky to be public representatives, well paid with expenses.  We should get off the hobby horses once and for all when it comes to issues such as jobs.  That would do the House the world of good.  It would also serve as an argument in favour of its retention.  If we do not get into positive mode, we will leave a great many angry young people abroad and a great many angry young people will leave the county.  We are all mature and we are all committed public representatives.  However, some issues should be beyond the realm of point-scoring.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s comments to the extent that yesterday we discussed a motion on the issue of rare diseases and the need for a proactive Government policy to deal with it.  There was broad agreement across the House on how the issue should be approached.  Likewise with the jobs issue, everyone in the House regardless of party affiliation has one aim, that is, to get people back to work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Decisions must be made about creating efficiencies in respect of the banks.  Let us consider the workload in the banks now compared to four or five years ago when more than 90,000 houses were being sold per annum and an equivalent number of mortgages was issued.  This has all changed and, therefore, the same workload is no longer in place.  I know of several young people who have commenced employment with Allied Irish Banks, AIB, in the past three months.  The information I am getting from them is to the effect that a significant number of young people are working in the banking sector and are keen to face up to the challenge and to deal with the issues facing the banks and the country.  On the other hand, there are many people in the banking structure who believe they have made their contribution and who wish to take a break from the type of work they have been involved in.  Such people are looking for an opportunity and the banks are approaching this in a constructive way.  They must deal with it.  We should remember that we are no longer dealing with shareholders&rsquo; money, we are now dealing with taxpayers&rsquo; money.  This is being approached in a constructive way and in the best interests of the banking sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we are to debate this issue &mdash; we should do so &mdash; I wish to raise one concern.  During the good times bank employees contacted customers and offered them money to buy shares in that bank.  I know of one case where a person was given &euro;1.5 million from AIB to buy AIB shares.  Another young man came to me in recent weeks and informed me that he was given &euro;50,000 to buy AIB shares.  He was invited to come in and sign the forms to enable him to buy the shares.  This offer came from AIB and was to buy AIB shares.  We should bring in amending legislation to outlaw the practice of a bank giving money to people to borrow to buy the same bank&rsquo;s shares.  It should be outlawed because it was wrong.  It should not have been done and it should be made illegal now.  This is one of the issues I want on the agenda if we are to debate the banking issue.  The sooner it is on the agenda, the better for everyone in the country.  I call for a debate on the issue at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

	<P>As a result of the many crises facing us, whether financial, banking or jobs-related, there is a danger that we do not allocate sufficient time to discuss some of the other things in our lives.  I hope we can find time to discuss the environment at some stage.  I have in mind particularly the diversity of our birdlife.  We are experiencing a serious threat to our birdlife, especially migrating birds, at this time of year.  Ireland is important in this area.  There is a birds directive but in spite of it certain species, including the partridge, the quail and the corncrake, are seriously threatened.  I do not suggest it should be immediately and I realise there are other important issues to be discussed, but it would be a shame if we do not allocate time to such a debate at some stage.</P>
        <P>The plight of the conservation of 19 species is the subject of much concern in Ireland.  Ten of these are under serious threat.  In recent times the Minister has introduced several steps, in particular, the birds directive.  We are keen to ensure that farming is possible and continues to be profitable.  At the same time, through good farming practices, we can maintain the diversity of our birdlife.  It is possible to achieve this balance.  Although I do not suggest it is urgent at the moment, we should allocate some time to discuss it whether it involves the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</P>
        <P>It is fascinating to take an interest in birdlife.  Next month, some of the birds that come from Canada, especially the Brent geese, will leave again and, hopefully, they will return in October.  This year, there has been quite a change.  Several of the birds that normally go to northern Africa at this time of year have not gone either because of climate change or perhaps for some other reason.  Let us ensure that we recognise the importance of this issue as part of our tradition and heritage and let us ensure we allocate some time to it in the coming months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinConway"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Conway</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I note that 2,500 AIB staff have been asked to subscribe to a voluntary redundancy package.  I agree with the sentiments expressed to the effect that there are many within AIB who cannot wait to get out the door because of what has taken place in recent years.  I am pleased that finally the nightmare will be over for the people concerned and they can take a package and go.</P>
        <P>I note there has been some recruitment in AIB in recent months as well.  This sends out a bad message.  On the one hand, the bank is seeking to get rid of 2,500 staff and, on the other, it is recruiting people.  The messages are unclear.  The reality is that the 2,500 figure is the headline figure.  The ordinary decent people in the banking system are being scapegoated for what occurred in the past whereas the delinquents who were running AIB at the top, including the board of directors and the senior management who are still in place and who continue to receive vast salaries, have not been held to account.  What are the public interest directors in AIB doing?  They should come before the House.  There are people on the board of directors of the major banks of the country representing the people.  Let them come in and account for themselves and let them give us a report on exactly what they are doing to serve the public interest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Every day of the week we hear of people struggling to get credit, overdrafts and mortgages.  That is not the kind of banking system I want to see in my country.  We urgently require a constructive debate on banking to examine what occurred in the past.  This House must lead the fight to ensure that we have the best regulated banking system to drive job creation instead of hindering it, as it is doing.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I second the amendment to the Order of Business.  I also want to condemn the Government for its self-congratulation for downsizing banks and bank staff.  The Government would be better advised to tax the bonuses and pensions of bankers who walked out the door with big pay-offs, which was done in the United States.</P>
        <P>As my colleagues did yesterday, I welcome the fact that Ministers are travelling abroad for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  The media has often taken it as part of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day fun festival to condemn Ministers for going abroad.  Every year, Irish Ministers travel to South Africa, Australia, Argentina, Spain, the United States and elsewhere to meet with Heads of Government.  Other countries envy our position and if they had such an opportunity they would send more ministers.  Some people may say that at this time we cannot be spending money on such trips, but the connections made and opportunities opened up by our Ministers abroad is what it is all about, as well as strengthening those international relationships.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know that Members will join me in extending sympathy to the family of US Congressman Donald Payne, who has passed away.  This 77-year-old African American once held the distinction of being the most pro-Irish member of the US Congress.  He led the fight against apartheid in South Africa from the floor of the US House of Representatives.  He also led the fight to ban the use of plastic bullets in Northern Ireland.  He was a great friend of Ireland and will be sadly missed.</P>

However, no group is entitled to put businesses at risk, obstruct them, or breach planning or health and safety laws.  As St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day approaches, I hope we will welcome many visitors to our country.  I hope the unauthorised development in Eyre Square in Galway will also be dismantled peacefully before next weekend.  It is certainly causing problems and issues for many people, and is not the image of the city we want to project.  I hope the protestors will see sense and remove it in good time before the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations.</P>

        <P>There has been much discussion about export-led growth in various press releases.  Yesterday, in the audio-visual room, we had a tale of export-led growth from the newly qualified teachers&rsquo; action group, representing student teachers from the country&rsquo;s four teacher training colleges.  They are concerned about the pay and conditions they will be asked to accept when they qualify.  They told us their personal stories and many of them who graduated in other disciplines went back to gain primary teaching degrees as mature students.  They will, however, be asked to work for less than the minimum wage in some cases if the new regime is put in place.  They put a good case and there was cross-party support for them.  They were not scare-mongering or over the top with their claims, and the INTO is backing their cause.  I thank those who came to the briefing yesterday.  I call for the Minister for Education and Skills to attend the House so that we can have a discussion not so much on the broad area of education but on the situation facing newly qualified teachers.  We must not be preparing those students currently in teacher training colleges for export.</P>

	<P>I compliment Dublin City Council on the peaceful removal of protestors from Dame Street.  It was inappropriate that they were allowed to reside there for so long.  With the approach of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, the city needs to look its best.  While we all agree that protesting should be allowed and is an important function of democracy, that one was inappropriate for our city.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also compliment Dublin City Council on its plans for Grafton Street.  It is our main shopping street and up to 12,000 people visit it each Saturday alone.  The paving was never done properly.  As regards liability, I can only imagine how many claims have been made as a result of people slipping and falling on that street, especially on the white tiles which were unsuitable.</P>
        <P>Greater measures are needed to ensure that we have the proper type of businesses onGrafton Street.

Earlier, Senator Coghlan mentioned the fact that 2,500 bank workers &mdash; junior staff for the most part &mdash; might be losing their jobs.

	<P Just="Left">As this is International Women&rsquo;s Day, I would like to take a moment to remember all those women who were affected by the thalidomide tragedy.  Thalidomide must surely have been one of the world&rsquo;s worst crimes against women, and the Irish State played a role in this.  Only 32 women had their children acknowledged and accepted as thalidomide survivors back in the mid-1970s.  Not many of the thalidomide mothers are still alive and those who are, still wait for a proper apology.  Today we should remember the forgotten women &mdash; those who lost their babies through miscarriage or who had to deal with the heartache of their babies dying in infancy because of thalidomide.  I salute those mothers, and the survivors of thalidomide themselves, for their courage.  I draw the attention of the House to an outstanding article in <i>The Star</i> newspaper detailing the thalidomide battle fought by Finola Cassidy who is secretary of the Irish Thalidomide Association.  It is a very moving newspaper article and she is an inspirational human being.</P><P />

I have been made aware of a family who were quoted a much cheaper premium from Aviva health insurance when changing from VHI.  Naturally, they took up the offer, on the presumption that they would receive the same benefits as they had from VHI.  All went fine and they were paying over &euro;3,000 a year for this health insurance.  However, a month ago, one of the children was hospitalised.  The nearest hospital they could access for the required treatment was in Dublin even though they live in Dundalk.  When they were advised to go to a specific hospital in Dublin, they discovered that despite having been promised last August that they had the same cover, they did not in fact have the same level of insurance cover, which in my view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I issued a statement last evening outlining that 30 teaching posts will be lost in Donegal schools but, in fact, it will be much worse.

The reversal regarding the DEIS band one and band two schools, or the U-turn, only applies to urban schools because that is where the Labour Party gets its votes.  Let us face it &mdash; this is about votes and it is not about children.  While the decisions on the legacy posts are being reversed, there will still be 320 posts removed from DEIS band one and band two schools as a result of the changes to the staffing schedule.  According to the Minister, a total of 73 rural schools will lose posts this year.  In addition, administrative principal posts will go and other legacy posts in DEIS rural schools will also go, a total of approximately 200 posts.  When this is all added together, it makes a total of 800 teaching posts being removed from schools this year.</P>

The findings were as minimalist as they could have been.  However, I find illogical the conclusion that the incident was not of sufficient consequence to merit an investigation.  This would seem to be an abrogation of the authority&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure proper standards in public service broadcasting.  I ask the Leader if this debate could also include the issue of the licence fee which I think generates in the order of &euro;160 million.  I wonder if today we need the paraphernalia of television stations and radio stations to be under the remit of the national broadcaster.  Perhaps this situation should be rationalised.  I would much prefer to see a situation in which Radio One or TG4 would become our national broadcaster and that the remainder of RTE would be privatised.  This arrangement would require far less funding by the licence fee and the balance could be used on a programme by programme basis in the private sector.  I have seen some excellent documentary programmes on the private television channel, TV3.  In the case of independent radio, South East Radio is campaigning strongly on the unemployment situation in County Wexford and this is a commendable initiative.  Such independent stations should be in a position to source funding to make good public service programmes which would facilitate and enhance public service broadcasting.</P>
        <P>I have criticised in the past the fact that the BAI is constituted of former senior people in RTE and also people from the private sector, private production companies, who are dependent on RTE for revenue streams for their own companies.  I look forward to seeing the BAI&rsquo;s findings regarding the Fr. Reynolds case.  It will be as anaemic a report as we have seen in regard to the last episode, the findings on the Se&aacute;n Gallagher case.</P>

        <P Just="Left">We are nearing the time of year for students to apply for third level grants.  This year those applications are being centralised and the last thing we need is a repeat of the fiasco with the centralisation of medical card applications.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Skills to attend the House for a question and answer session on this issue?  He could also answer questions from Senators on other issues.  He should tell us everything is in order for the applications to proceed because we must not have a repeat of what happened with the medical cards.  I would like the message to go out to parents that now is the time to apply for the P21, not when one is making the application.  At that stage the whole country will be applying and there will be an enormous backlog in the Revenue offices.  If they apply immediately or during the coming weeks they will be ready to send the P21 with their application and will not have to be contacted.  For years I have been helping people fill application forms for a third level grant.  They are quite detailed, require a great deal of information and can be daunting for parents.  Finding out what is needed can cause much confusion.  People are in and out of their local offices asking the local officer questions but that will not happen this year if the application process is centralised.  The Leader might ask the Minister to attend at his earliest convenience so that every Member can be assured, along with parents and students, that everything is ready to roll in the centralisation of these applications.</P>

It will be a very important Bill and I would like to have as much advance notice as possible about it.

	<P Just="Left">Senator Byrne, rightly, raised the loss of jobs in the financial services sector, which is regrettable.  These job losses were flagged a long time ago.  It is an inevitable but unfortunate consequence of the reorganisation of the banking sector that there will be reductions in jobs at the covered institutions.  In response to this, the Government is committed to making available the services of the State, including the employment support services, to provide direct or indirect assistance for the employees taking up this offer in order to increase their chances of re-entering the workforce.  A response group has been established in the Department of Social Protection to devise a co-ordinated strategy on the supports required.  This strategy will take into account the numbers being made redundant, the locations and phasing in of those redundancies.  The Department of Social Protection will ensure the needs of the employees concerned are met through proactive and timely access to a range of income maintenance, money advice and employment support services.  We hope many of them will get back into the financial services workforce and that many jobs will be created in the coming years in the sector.</P>
       <P>I do not accept the amendment to the Order of Business.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, will be in the Chamber immediately after the Order of Business to discuss legislation to come before the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Landy mentioned the household charge and the need for local authorities to be more proactive in its collection.  An Post needs to be more competitive in its response.  I understand that what it suggested for the collection of the charge was not very competitive.  Those concerned in the local authorities should be more proactive.  We may ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, back to the House to explain further mechanisms in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Keane spoke about women in politics.  I agree that society suffers greatly from the lack of participation by women in politics and other areas of society.  I will try to arrange a debate on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 that the Senator mentioned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Barrett mentioned the possibility of banning HGVs in the town of Slane.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Senator mentioned there was capacity on existing motorways in the area.  I am sure that is something the Minister will consider in conjunction with Meath County Council.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Paul Coghlan, Conway and others spoke about a debate on banking.  I will try to arrange a wide-ranging debate on this subject.  A number of Members mentioned some valid points on banking and it would be appropriate to have such a debate.</P>
        <P>We had a predictable analysis of the Government&rsquo;s first year from Senator Cullinane and I am sure we will have another.  I am very grateful to Senator O&rsquo;Brien for the coming motion on the Government&rsquo;s first year in office.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the issue of job creation.  This House has played a very responsible role in terms of ideas for job creation.  When the Minister, Deputy Bruton, came into the House on Tuesday he mentioned that a number of the ideas suggested in the jobs ideas debate we had here had been incorporated in the jobs action plan.  This House should be complimented as a result of that, as should all the Members who contributed to that debate.  I am glad the Minister acknowledged that when he was here on Tuesday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn asked for a debate on the environment and spoke about the threat to our bird population.  Regardless of what Minister is involved, the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, has introduced a bounty to cull the mink population to protect our many birds species.  That is to be welcomed but perhaps we should have a debate at some stage on that entire area.  I compliment Senator Quinn for raising the matter.</P>
         <P>Senator Conway raised a question on banking and the role of the public interest directors.  That is an issue that can be discussed in the debate.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about the turf cutters.  I agree with him that the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, should be complimented on his efforts in that regard.  It is to be welcomed that the Government is prepared to engage with organisations to solve those problems.  That will be accepted by most people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator White rightly raised again the plight of the people affected by thalidomide, which happened here many years ago, and praised the people involved.  I agree with the Senator in that regard.  I am glad she has achieved her presidency at last, on which I compliment her.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Moran raised the question of private health insurance, people getting what they are entitled to and making sure the buyer beware principle is examined at all times.  The Senator might raise the case in question as an Adjournment matter when she can get more information on it.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Sheahan&rsquo;s point about making the Shannon Energy project happen.  We will bring it to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Walsh&rsquo;s views on the use of the TV licence fee.  I am sure he raised that matter with the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, when he was in the House some weeks ago.  We will certainly bring it to his attention if it was not raised at that time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Moloney raised the issue of third level grants and rightly suggested that people should apply for them now.  I said yesterday on the Order of Business that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, would be in the House on 19 April for a wide-ranging debate on education and any Member who wishes to raise those points with him can do so on that day.</P>
        <P>I will try to find out for Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien the position on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  I express my gratitude that Fianna F&aacute;il will debate the progress the Government has made in the past year in its Private Members&rsquo; motion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I outline the purpose and content of the Bill, I thank the Senators for agreeing to discuss and consider all Stages of the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2012 today at short notice.  Although it is a fairly technical Bill, it is critical to the public finances and our economy.  Enactment of the Bill is required to allow Ireland to ratify the changes to the Greek loan facility.  The changes agreed, reviewed by the Government and the other euro area member states, are essential to ensuring financial stability within the euro area.</P>
        <P>The crisis in Greece has been ongoing since 2009.  Senators will be aware that Greece entered its first programme of financial support in May 2010 following an intergovernmental agreement to provide bilateral loans totalling &euro;80 billion to Greece from the euro area member states, together with the IMF assistance of &euro;30 billion, over a three-year period to mid-2013.  In late 2010, Ireland entered its own programme of assistance and consequently stepped out of the Greek loan facility.  However, as one of the original signatories to the Greek loan facility, Ireland is required to give its consent in order to implement any amendment to that facility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In June 2011, the Heads of State and Government agreed to revise the Greek loan facility.  The changes agreed were to extend the grace period between draw-down and commencement of repayment from three to four and a half years, to increase the maturity period for loans from five to ten years, and to reduce the margin applying to loans to Greece under the Greek loan facility by 100 basis points.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This amendment to the loan facility agreement with Greece was signed by the Commission on behalf of the euro area member states on 14 June 2011, subject to ratification by all euro area member states.  Ireland ratified the first amendment through the European Financial Stability and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2011.  On 23 September 2011, we notified the relevant authorities of our formal confirmation of our commitment to this amendment.  However, these amendments have proved insufficient; hence, there is now a need for further amendments.  On 20 February 2012, the euro group Finance Ministers approved the new programme of assistance for Greece which includes approval of the second amendment to the Greek loan facility.  This amendment includes three elements: a further increase of the grace period, of up to ten years, for paying back the loan principal; a further lengthening of the loan maturity to a minimum of 15 years; and a further reduction in the margin to 150 basis points to apply from the three-month interest period that ended on 15 June 2011.  The Bill provides for the ratification of these amendments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The completion of the amendment, by way of signature by the European Commission on behalf of member states and by Greece, was not in place until 27 February 2012.  This Bill is thus being presented at the earliest possible date following this completion.</P>
        <P>All signatories to the Greek loan facility agreement have been asked to provide their acceptance to the second amendment to the chairman of the euro working group no later than 13 March 2012.  This is to ensure that the next phase of the Greek loan facility can proceed as planned for that date.  It has therefore been necessary to bring forward this Bill as a matter of urgency to ensure Ireland can confirm acceptance by that date.  I have also brought forward an earlier signature motion for the President to sign the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The aforementioned changes to the Greek loan facility are proposed at a time when there have been many other changes to the Greek programme, most notably the &euro;130 billion in additional funding that has been provided in conjunction with changed private sector involvement, PSI.    As I have mentioned, the Bill provides for amendments to the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010, as amended by the European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2011.  The amendment Bill has four sections with the amendment of March 2012 to the loan facility agreement set out in the Schedule.  The first section of the Bill provides the definitions to the legislation.  Section 2 provides for the second amendment of February 2012 to be included in the references to the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010, as amended by the European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2011.  Section 3 provides for the second amendment to the loan facility agreement to be inserted as Schedule 3 to European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2011.  Section 4 sets out the Short Title to the Act.  Annexe 1 contains the form of legal opinion.  Annexe 2 contains the amended scheduled principal repayments.  Annexe 3 contains the list of contacts.  The Schedule contains the amendment of February 2012 to the loan facility agreement.  This amendment includes the three elements I have already outlined, namely, a longer grace period a lengthening of the loan maturity, and a further reduction in the margin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland provided &euro;345.7 million for Greece under the Greek loan facility before entering our EU-IMF programme, when we stepped out of the facility.  Quarterly interest payments are being made by Greece on this.  The reduction in the interest rate chargeable on the loan under the second amendmentwill reduce the interest we receive each year by &euro;5.2 million, or roughly one third at current rates of interest.  We expect that this will be offset by the provision for the distribution of profits from the ECB&rsquo;s secondary market programme for Greek bonds.  A further result of this amendment is that the grace period before Greece begins to repay the principal of this loan will be extended from four and a half years to ten years.  The maturity of the loan will be extended from seven and a half years to 15 years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to show solidarity with Greece.  However, we should also recognise the reality that there is a significant contrast between our condition and that of Greece.  The underlying strength of our economy and thus our capacity to recover, is well recognised.  This of course depends on the right mix of policies at home and internationally.  Latest estimates show that economic growth resumed last year and the growth outlook for this year remains positive.  Our export sector is robust, with the well known companies of the multinational element performing well together with a less heralded strengthening in the indigenous sector.  Foreign direct investment is recovering, pointing to the continued presence of many of the established strengths of our economy, including a well educated workforce, favourable demographics, an open and flexible economy and a pro-enterprise environment.  Moreover, the labour market is showing welcome signs of stabilisation.  It is particularly encouraging that CSO figures show an increase of 10,000 in the number in employment in fourth quarter of last year on a seasonally adjusted basis, the first such increase in four years.  In addition, our record on programme implementation to date has been second to none &mdash; something the troika team frequently acknowledges.  We are meeting all of our targets.  This performance is bringing benefits in terms of a falling bond yield and the recent successful re-engagement with the markets by the NTMA.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As our programme is working it is only right that we should show solidarity and unity with Greece and the broader euro area.  I therefore look forward to a constructive discussion of this Bill.  The Bill aims to facilitate the stability of the European Union and to safeguard the euro area as a whole.  Ireland must play its part and stand in solidarity with its fellow euro area member states.  This will be in both our own interest and that of the euro area and the EU as a whole.  Therefore, I urge Senators to support the changes to the Greek loan facility.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is a technical Bill, which the Fianna F&aacute;il Party will support.  The Seanad deals swiftly with EU related legislation, similar to the way we dealt with the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill 2011.  It is important that this Bill is dealt with swiftly.  When the group leaders discussed this Bill last week we agreed on the importance of sending out a clear message.  The Minister has outlined clearly that Ireland is meeting the stringent targets set under the memorandum of understanding and the revised memorandum of understanding to which the new Government has signed up.  We all recognise how difficult it is for our citizens to adhere to the changes in our economic climate and in the standard of living.  It is very tough, but regardless of political party affiliations or none, we want to see light at the end of the tunnel.  We want Ireland to do well and we want people to have opportunities.  We want people who are out of work to be given the opportunity to work.</P>
        <P>I have a number of questions which the Minister may be able to answer.  It is important that we show solidarity with Greece.  We should show solidarity with our European neighbours.  The upcoming referendum on the EU fiscal compact is very important and I state unequivocally that Fianna F&aacute;il will be strongly supporting a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum and will campaign for it also.  I wish to convey my concern and that of my colleagues that the waters might be muddied, by linking the treaty to the write down of debt.  I do not think the treaty should be discussed in conjunction with future write downs in debt or deals on the promissory notes.  It should be clear that we debate what the EU fiscal compact is, what it does, and what it does not do.  The Minister for Finance must send a clear message that the referendum is about the EU fiscal compact and not about our promissory notes.  Has the Minister an update on how the negotiations are going?  The Government seems to be confident that some deal will be done, which is welcome, but we must see the outcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister highlighted the positives of the economy.  For the 2,500 staff in AIB, today was a very difficult day.  In his update on the programme for Government, the implementation of the new structure for Irish banking is mentioned.  At the time, I was quite critical of the two pillar banks approach.  In light of the discussion on the European banking situation, how can we ensure that we do not create a situation where we have a very strong AIB and Bank of Ireland that are larger than the Irish economy?  Difficulties arose due to the size of Anglo Irish Bank and the other Irish banks because they were of absolute systemic importance to the economy.  It was a mistake not to let EBS stand on its own two feet and allow US investment in EBS, in order that it would be another banking force, a fourth banking force, if we take Ulster Bank into account.  While we recognise that we are in a very different situation from Greece, as we have diversified into other markets over the decades, the financial services sector in Ireland has taken a hammering.  We have seen that with Aviva, Bank of Ireland and AIB.   What is the position with the EBS and its staff?  I also want to ask about credit in the commercial sector, an issue that will not go away.</P>
        <P>Colleagues across the House have been critical of our two main banks and how they suport businesses.  I do not mean to hijack the Minister about it but my party will support the Bill and I hope it will be quickly passed today.  Can the Minister update the House on the Government&rsquo;s stance and how it will ensure that AIB and Bank of Ireland meet its targets?  We are all aware that some of the new business was based on roll-over commercial loans but written down as new business and overdrafts have been turned into term loans.</P>
        <P>We all hope the economy will grow this year and that there will be further growth in the economy.  Sustained growth cannot happen without our banks providing financial support to the indigenous business people who will create and sustain jobs.  Our multinationals have access to finance but our small business sector does not.</P>
        <P>I welcome the announcement of a partial loan guarantee scheme.  It will not go far enough but one cannot fix everything overnight.  The reality is that our two banks are not lending and stop people applying, as Senator Whelan mentioned yesterday.  It is true.  They are telling people not to bother submitting their applications for loans so they cannot go to the Credit Review Office, its chief Mr. Trethowan, or the internal appeals office in the banks.  This issue is the elephant in the room.  We are doing right by Greece today but this is a technical Bill and there is a broader issue at stake.</P>
        <P>There will be growth in the economy of less than 1% this year but at least it is going in the right direction.  We will not see the economy growing without business and the indigenous business sector being supported in this country.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that my party supports the Bill and will swiftly pass it through all Stages today.  I wish the Minister the best in his ongoing negotiations with the troika on our loan facility and promissory notes.  I have another issue to raise but I will leave it until another day.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>The big issue for people to realise is the legality of funding and how it works for countries in a bailout programme, including ourselves.  Ireland paid &euro;357 million to Greece prior to our entering our own programme.  I do not have a lot to say and will not repeat what the Minister said earlier.  The Bill shows the difference.  It struck me that when we entered our programme we were satisfied we would meet our targets and we are doing that.  At every occasion we were at pains to state that Ireland is doing what it needs to do and we are not the Greeks.  I hope I do not sound condescending.  That is why the private sector is involved today, and over the next few days.  They will ensure that we have an agreed programme for a reduction in national debt and that it is done in a staged and agreed manner.</P>
        <P>It is important to show where the &euro;80 billion for the Greek economy comes from and it is stated in the Schedule if people care to look.  It is important and the details are all there, including the dates for when the moneys must be repaid.  The legislation shows the solidarity that exists between our partners in the European Union and the other people that will fund the Greek nation.  I do not want to diminish the pain that the Greek people are experiencing.  To date salaries for Greek public sector employees have decreased by about 50%.  Salaries have been decreased at a time when taxes have been increased so their take home pay will be reduced by even more.  That will not be easy to bear for the hundreds of thousands of employees of the Greek state along with the structural deficits that the Greek nation has operated over the past number of decades.</P>
        <P>We cannot forget that it is people that are affected when we talk figures.  Far too often, some people in the body politic say the bondholders will get their money back and the easy stuff is being thrown out.  The reality is, as shown by the negotiations taking place today, it is not the bondholders that benefit because they are surrendering between 50% and 60% of what they should be repaid.  I have not a lot more to say on the issue and I will not do like Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien by giving a broad financial speech.  It is important to get the Bill moving and, as the Minister said, I hope it is concluded by the middle of March in order for the funds to flow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and echo the Leas-Chathaoirleach&rsquo;s condolences to him at this sad time for him and his family.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday there was support in the House for the Minister&rsquo;s efforts on the promissory notes and I hope that reassures him and Governor Honohan.  I welcome the 10,000 jobs the Minister mentioned   It is a sign that we are turning the corner and we did so because we have an export to GDP ratio of 100%.  My misgiving about the Bill is that Greece is down at 25% and I cannot see how it can recover from the kind of measures before the House today.  As has been referred to, we will see a Greek repayment of &euro;52.9 billion, scheduled for between 2020 and 2026 as outlined in the annexe to the Bill.  However, it is a small country that has a low ratio of exports to GDP.  How do we get more Greek wine on our shelves and persuade people from northern Europe to holiday there?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The policy instrument that Greece needs is an exchange rate but that is a step too far.  Greece is locked into the fixed exchange rate regime of the euro even though it has faults.  We are not helping Greece today.  I accept that the Minister wishes to show solidarity with it but does solidarity depend on a fixed exchange rate?  I argue that it does not.  Some EU countries, such as Sweden and the UK, do not use the euro.  There is a Swedish delegation visiting us at present.  Relations between the two parts of Ireland have never been better thanks to the efforts of the Government and its predecessor and different exchange rates operate in both jurisdictions.  We have hung ourselves up on the euro and missed out on the misery that adherence to a rigid exchange rate regime brought to Greece, in particular.  The revival of the Greek economy &mdash; I share that goal with the Minister &mdash; is not served by imposing a huge repayments burden and not addressing the euro&rsquo;s design faults that have been referred to in the House.  The absence of an exit mechanism and for fiscal transfers are not enough to make up for differences in competitiveness, a one size fits all interest policy, and a lack of protection for small countries.  The latter happened to Ireland because a tsunami of credit came from Germany and France that destroyed our banking system and undermined the public finances.</P>
        <P>Devaluation changes one price.  We have had some success with an internal devaluation to change all prices because of our large export sector which the Minister referred to.  The same cannot happen in Greece because of its small export sector.  We do not have a single labour market.  The theory is that Greek people should migrate to Germany and Irish people should migrate to Germany but we are more likely to leave the EU altogether.  Irish people are queuing outside the Australian, Canadian and United States embassies.  They are not queueing outside EU embassies.</P>
        <P>After this crisis we must address the huge design faults in the euro that people like Milton Friedman drew attention to when the euro was put together.   There is a certain irony that the gentleman who signed the first annexe was a legal adviser in the areas of justice, transparency and human rights.  Many Greek people would feel their human rights have been infringed for the euro currency&rsquo;s goal.  It was said of a former Chancellor of the Exchequer in the past that he crucified the UK economy on the cross of gold.  Frankfurt must be asked how far a single currency can be pushed with such design faults while imposing misery on Greece with Portugal and Spain to follow.  This has to be introduced into the wider debate.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for Finance for his contribution.  However, there must be alternatives to every economic policy.  The current euro one has been pursued relentlessly by the European Central Bank, ECB, and Germany without regard to what is happening to the peripheral countries.  Accordingly, a contrary view must be stated and noted on occasion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Finance to the House.  It is a great pleasure to have him here with us and I hope we will see more of him again in the future.</P>
        <P>Like other Members, I have no difficulty with this technical Bill.  We should all express our heartfelt sorrow to the Greek people as we are only well aware of the pain they are going through.  However, it is a wider issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Reading the excellent documentation on this legislation furnished to us by the Oireachtas Library and wider commentary, there is no doubt this bailout package is a bitter pill for the Greek people.  I note much of the commentary is quite derogatory of the Greeks, littered with statements such as the Greeks cannot be trusted, they have been fooling us for years, they are spending other people&rsquo;s money funding an unsustainable economy and have a significant black market.  The bailout package does not even give them control over the funds.  Instead, as they will be placed in a separate account, they will not even get to touch them.</P>
        <P>As the Minister said, Ireland is not Greece.  Our political leaders understandably point out that Ireland has a vibrant export-led economy very unlike the Greek economy.  However, it remains that both our wider difficulties relate to the eurozone.  The most recent EUROSTAT figures and statements by the EU Commissioner, Olli Rehn, make it clear that Europe is in recession.  There is a link between that recession and our failure to deal with the euro crisis.  Not to put too fine a point on it but Europe has failed miserably to support the euro.  There have been repeated failures and, on every single occasion, Europe has been brought kicking and screaming to the table.  I am reminded of similar political failures going back several years to the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.  I do not need to remind Senators about the atrocities that took place in Srebrenica and elsewhere.  There can be a high cost to failure.</P>
        <P>The IMF has recently put it up to EU leaders that its contribution to the Greek bailout package will depend on European leaders putting up a decent firewall.  The IMF will only decide its contribution after the second week of March at the next EU summit.  This crisis is far from over.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I stated, there is a certain amount of moralising about the Greek position.  Other people&rsquo;s failings seem not to get mentioned such as the French penchant for protecting its own industries or the Italian micro-economy that is largely untaxed.  The bottom line is Ireland should be less willing to distance itself from Greece.  Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal are peripheral nations in Europe.  In the 1980s and 1990s, that element enabled us to build a useful alliance with these countries around the restructuring of EU funds away from the Common Agricultural Policy and towards Structural Funds and the Social Development Fund.  We benefited significantly from that change in policy.  We should consider a new sort of <i>entente</i> with our peripheral neighbours for a more formal strategic alliance to re-establish some balance between the interests of the periphery and the centre.  After all, one of the premises of the EU is balanced regional growth.</P>
        <P>Will this bailout be enough?  From what I have read, the chances are it probably will not be.  The chances in fact are that Greece will be voluntarily forced out of the EU.  The reality remains, however, that this is the best package.  To be honest, Ireland is hoping to benefit from this Greek tragedy.  We cannot refer to it specifically due to media commentary in recent days but it is an opportunity for us to renegotiate our own position.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by citing the Zarnowitz rule, which Senator Barrett knows, that deep recessions are typically followed by steep recoveries.  On International Women&rsquo;s Day, we should conclude this debate with that thought.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Every Member knows how I will vote on this legislation.  The Minister has already debated this Bill with my colleague in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to European solidarity, rescue funds and the Greek economy.  However, not enough emphasis was put on the plight of the Greek people who have had crippling austerity measures imposed on them.  Neither did we hear that by the end of 2011, 21% of Greek people were out of work, of which 50% of them are young people.  Homelessness has increased by 25% and poverty by 28%.  One in five Greek people living in poverty can only afford meals with meat every second day.  The Athens suicide hotline reports the number of calls it receives doubled to 5,000 in 2011.  All this is as a result of austerity, cutbacks and economic contraction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Now we are asked to support this second bailout which will cause further hardship for ordinary Greek people and impose further influence and vetoes over their democratic processes.  The first bailout was not successful by any means.  Greece still remains locked out of the bond markets and its government debt continues to spiral out of control.  According to many of the social and economic indicators, the first bailout did not work.  This new deal will force Greece to slash its minimum wage, sell off state assets and put generations in hock to foreign moneylenders.  This is not right.  The Greeks and the wider eurozone needs a change in direction with a new approach to investment in economic growth, a proper cleansing of the European banking system and real debt write-downs across the European Union.  Investment in job creation is urgently required especially in those countries that are on the periphery.  This can be achieved by combining the resources of member states such as in our case using the &euro;5.4 billion in the discretionary portfolio of the National Pensions Reserve Fund with an enlarged investment from the European Investment Bank.  The existing funds of that bank should be supplemented by a once-off investment in members states on a proportional basis.  Rather than doing this through fiscal transfers between states, this could be done in the form of sound investments with sound returns.  As Einstein said, we cannot continue to doing the same thing expecting different results.  He also said: "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex and more violent.  It takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction."</P>
        
        <P>Greece and Ireland need to have a portion of their debts written down.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this could be done by writing down debts that were originally banking debts while continuing to honour sovereign debt.  That continuity is the critical point.  In the first instance, this would require lifting the obligation on the State and the taxpayer imposed by Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s promissory notes.  This could be achieved with the agreement of the European Central Bank, ECB, and reduce our debt to GDP ratio by as much as 20%.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in will oppose the Bill.  Contrary to the Minister&rsquo;s comments, it is not in the spirit of solidarity.  Rather, it is about punishing and, to some extent, scapegoating people.  It will inflict untold further pain on the Greek people without enacting real reforms at the wider level or cleansing the banking system.  Until we have such reforms and start questioning the role of banks in the eurozone crisis, Sinn F&eacute;in will oppose the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  The detail of this amended Bill is interesting, in that the language could be transposed to the Irish situation in terms of a debt reduction or a rescheduling of the bank loans.  I have every confidence that the Minister and the Government are working might and main to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s unsustainable long-term debt will be addressed.</P>
        <P>We must show solidarity with the Greek people.  We are in no position to lecture anyone.  There is great empathy with the suffering of the Greek people, as many of our people are suffering as well.  Thankfully, our suffering is not as bad.  My main concern and that of many people is that the Greek debt might not be sustainable, regardless of how often it is rescheduled or the maturities are extended.  Will Greece be able to get out of the debts that have been imposed on it?  Sadly, the evidence to date suggests that it will not, even with the best will in the world.</P>
        <P>As the Minister well knows, governments can propose austerity measures, but their implementation and the basic restructuring of the Greek economy, in particular its fiscal policies, remain to be seen.  There does not seem to be the same level of solidarity among civil society in Greece as there is in this country.  This is despite the efforts of a number of fringe elements from across our society who have attempted and continue to attempt to whip the people into a frenzy.  As Dr. Colm McCarthy put it succinctly a couple of years ago, anger is not a policy.  The majority of Irish people understand that the Government must work rationally and gradually towards extricating us from our difficulties.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Barrett in that the basic problem is that the euro is a flawed concept.  At the time, it was clear that the currency was being introduced as a political decision minus any of the dimensions that one would attach to a fiscal union.  These issues must be addressed.  I share the opinion of some economists to the effect that Germany will need to accept that issuing euro bonds is one way to extricate countries, particularly those on the periphery, from this mountain of debt.  Effectively, this will mean printing money.  People can call it quantitative easing or anything they like.  It is ironic that the Central Bank printed the &euro;31 billion for the so-called promissory notes.  Germany is the key but, judging from what one reads, Angela Merkel is focusing on domestic political priorities at the expense of peripheral countries such as Ireland.  Perhaps this is a political reality with which the Government must live, but I hope that pressure will continue to be brought to bear.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Irish debt is unsustainable, irrespective of what colour one places on it.  An attempt must be made to reduce it.  Peripheral countries such as Ireland have been made to pay for the reckless nature of the German banks primarily &mdash; they gave free money away &mdash; and for a general environment of light touch regulation since the euro&rsquo;s introduction that has landed us in this situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A book entitled, <i>This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly</i>, was published last year by two academics involved in the financial services sector.  They traced the economic cycles of boom and bust, recession and recovery over eight centuries.  The good news is that recession was followed by recovery in each economic cycle, albeit the recovery was long and painful.</P>
        <P>I wish the Bill well.  I also wish the Minister well in his continuing efforts to ensure that, for the prosperity of our people, Irish debt is reduced to sustainable levels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and his delivery of Second Stage of this short but important legislation.  As he correctly stated, it is important that we show solidarity with Greece.  We must also show solidarity with the euro, which is the currency of Ireland, Greece and many other EU countries.</P>
        <P>We could debate Greece, Ireland and our relationship at some length, but we do not have the time.  As several Senators stated, it is important to highlight without any kind of negative connotation the fact that there is a difference between Greece and Ireland.  The current phase of economic recovery in Ireland following 12 months of cautious management is progressive and charts a new way forward to help people return to work.  Any facility, be it this one or another, that allows the Greek people to move in the same direction must be welcomed.</P>
        <P>We must maintain the aspiration for a politically and, in so far as is possible, economically united Europe in which countries help one another.  There have been many glib comments about the Greek situation, burning bondholders and being macho.  We heard the same comments in respect of Argentina approximately ten years ago.  One of my Oireachtas colleagues, Deputy Creed, happened to be in Argentina at the time.  Speaking with him about it is interesting.  He will remind one of being on the streets of Buenos Aires when middle class people were selling their furniture on the street outside their front doors.  That is what all of this talk of burning bondholders, ignoring debts and being macho and brave meant for Argentina.  It could mean the same for Greece and would mean the same for Ireland.  The commonsensical economics and politics that Ireland now enjoys are necessary.</P>
        <P>A programme was put in place for Greece and is being adjusted.  We must support it and encourage the Greek Government and people to turn their economic affairs around.  After Ireland&rsquo;s decade-long mismanagement, we cannot lecture any country on how to do its business, but the taxation and revenue collection systems in Greece need to be addressed.</P>
        <P>A sense of solidarity is required.  Senator Mooney referred to Chancellor Merkel and the possibility of German politics intervening.  We must take into account the fact that there are German and French elections on the horizon.  The message from the Seanad is that we support the Bill and that we want Greece to survive and remain within the euro.  The euro is not just a concept, but a currency that we use every day of the week.  It needs to be strong and its member states must return to economic sanity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for his comments.  Obviously, I wish him well in his quiet but effective ongoing work in tackling Ireland&rsquo;s financial obligations on the international stage.  Results will be achieved.  It is not a matter for megaphone diplomacy but for quiet work and I do not doubt that the Minister will succeed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators who participated in this important debate.  The Bill is technical and looks complex on first reading.  However, the bottom line is simple enough.  If Ireland and the other partner countries in Europe fail to legislate to amend the Greek programme to allow a second bailout, the &euro;130 billion that Greece needs during March to avoid default cannot be paid.  Senator Reilly is very compassionate about Greece and obviously understands the Greek situation &mdash; rising poverty, 50% unemployment among young people and a very high incidence of suicide.  We know that Greece is in a bad state, but the solution is not to refuse to give it &euro;130 billion which it absolutely needs.  If she wants to show compassion for Greece, she should vote them the money so that the schools and hospitals do not shut and the social welfare programmes are not turned off in the middle of the month.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bradford described what happened in Argentina, which was as a result of a default.  There are witness accounts from Argentina of savings being wiped out completely, people selling their personal possessions on the street and the poor searching the dustbins to try to feed their families over almost a year.  There was a similar default in Russia.  Elderly people died in the first winter after the default in Russia because they could not heat their homes and could not buy food.  The only way to manage such a situation is to make the adjustments gradually.  The European partners have provided money to Greece to allow it to make the necessary adjustments over time.  If the adjustment needs to be made suddenly overnight or in a month, chaos results.  Of course, this &euro;130 billion is being provided for Greece under conditions.  One might object to those conditions if one were a Greek citizen.  It is &euro;130 billion coming in addition to the &euro;110 billion it got in the first programme.  That gives it time to adjust and it is adjusting.  There is considerable criticism of Greece but when one considers the fundamentals of what it has done, it has taken action and has made progress, and I hope it continues to make progress.  I am not sure where it might end up, but the essential thing for Greece is to give it time and provide it with the money to allow it to run its services.</P>
        <P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien had some extraneous questions.  AIB is managed by AIB management with David Duffy as the new CEO.  The target figure is 2,500, split between early retirements and voluntary redundancies.  Some 1,000 &mdash; mainly management grades &mdash; will be by way of early retirement.  The 1,500 will be on a voluntary basis and it is hard to know where they will be, but they will probably be more junior people.  The bank expects those redundancies to be voluntary and it is offering three weeks plus two weeks statutory payment per year of service, which seems to be a reasonable package.  I wish it every success.  It is part of the downsizing of AIB, which became too big and was involved in projects throughout the world that were of no benefit to the Irish economy.  As it reduces its loan to deposit ratios and lends less internationally, it needs fewer staff.  It is a normal enough process and I hope it will be completed successfully and without too much aggravation.  I appreciate the unions&rsquo; help and co-operation on this.  However, it is a matter for the bank management and obviously we are monitoring it to see what is happening.</P>
        <P>The Senator asked about the promissory note, which is a medium-term project and nobody should be expecting sudden results.  There will be much negotiation before it concludes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Michael D&rsquo;Arcy spoke about the Greek situation in general and expressed his strong views.  Senator Barrett expressed doubts about whether it would be effective at the end of the day.  There is a big international debate in both Europe and the United States on how best to deal with the recession.  As it is a presidential election year in the United States, the issue is up in lights as part of the debate.  On the one hand, the Democratic Presidency and the people surrounding the president favour demand stimulus through quantitative easing and investment in capital projects &mdash; that is the Democratic tradition going back to the New Deal &mdash; while, on the other, the Republicans do not believe in it at all and believe it would cause inflation and make the situation worse.  They have a different take on what should be done.  The lines are drawn fairly clearly along ideological lines.  However, Keynes has gone out of fashion in Europe and austerity programmes are dominant in Europe now.  However, there is a real debate and one can argue on either side of it, with considerable economic theory to support one&rsquo;s arguments and we will see how it works out.  It would be helpful to have more demand stimulus in Europe.  Obviously the European Central Bank does not have the legal authority to get involved in quantitative easing, but under the new director, Mr. Draghi, more imaginative approaches seem to be taken and there are elements of demand stimulus now in Europe also.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Some Senators raised the issue of euro bonds.  While, when viewed on a week-to-week basis, one might think that little is happening, in the past 12 months a series of initiatives have been taken in Europe.  Taken together, it is quite an interesting restructuring of the policy instruments available to defend the currency.  It will not end when the fiscal compact treaty comes into effect.  This is a process that is ongoing and at some stage in the future I believe there will be euro bonds.  I believe it is something that will develop as the currency develops across Europe.  We are part of it and we need to do our best in negotiating our own positions.  Certainly, there is a policy development that has been developing strongly for the past 12 months or so.  I do not expect it all to end next week &mdash; the policy development will continue.  This was an interesting debate and I do not disagree with much of what the Senators said.</P>
        <P>The PSI in Greece should come to a conclusion this evening.  It has been made very clear from the <i>communiqu&eacute;s</i> from the Heads of State and Government that this is specific for Greece and it is not permissible in any other euro country.

        <P>Our position is that our debt is sustainable, which is confirmed by the markets which are marking down our bond rates now.  Yesterday they were below 7% for nine-year bonds &mdash; I believe it was approximately 6.9%.  While we would not go back to the markets at that rate, we are moving in the right direction.  The interest rate charged on the secondary market is a reasonable measure of how the markets view the sustainability of our position and we are measuring up in that respect.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of this Bill is to strengthen the enforcement of competition law in Ireland.  A breach of competition law is a white collar crime and, as with all other forms of crime, those who commit it must be punished accordingly.  This legislation will provide a more effective deterrent and an improved sanctions regime for those who engage in price fixing, cartels, abuse of dominant position and other anti-competitive practices.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland, the Government was required to bring forward legislation to strengthen the enforcement of competition law by the end of quarter three of 2011.  The publication of this Bill last September met this commitment.  Since then, my officials have engaged with officials of the troika on developing amendments which have further strengthened the enforcement capability of the Competition Authority.</P>
        <P>In terms of competition law enforcement, we are not starting from scratch.  The introduction of the measures I propose builds on what I believe is already a strong enforcement regime.  Ireland is unique in Europe in having criminalised anti-competitive behaviour and since the introduction of the Competition Act in 2002, the Competition Authority has a good, indeed enviable, criminal enforcement record, seen from the viewpoint of other member states.  A total of 32 criminal convictions have been secured since 2002 in respect of cartel behaviour in the form of price fixing by home heating oil companies in the west and by car dealerships in Leinster and countrywide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Crimes under competition law are often viewed as victimless but where the operation of the free market is restricted by collusion or other nefarious practices, the result is that consumers, whether in heating their home or buying a car, pay more than should be the case.  We are all the victims of such crimes.  The State, and Senators and I as taxpayers, are the victims if companies engage in bid-rigging in respect of public procurement contracts or any of the services purchased by the State.  In 2007, Mr. Justice McKechnie referred to price fixing as &ldquo;particularly pernicious as it was against consumers in general and not just one or two individuals&rdquo;.  The activities in question had, in the view of the judge, done a shocking disservice to the public at large.  I share Mr. Justice McKechnie&rsquo;s view that &ldquo;there are good reasons as to why courts should consider the imposition of custodial sentences in such cases&rdquo;.  The courts can impose fines up to the greater of &euro;4 million or 10% of turnover, and a custodial sentence of up to five years.  These are significant penalties that make our enforcement regime one of the strongest there is and I look forward to the day when the full rigours of the law are fully applied.  It is interesting to note that during the sentencing in the price fixing case referred to, Mr. Justice McKechnie commented that he could see no room for a lengthy lead-in period before jailing convicted persons becomes commonplace under this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I turn now to the provisions of this Bill, as passed by the D&aacute;il, and will explain what each is designed to achieve.  Sections 1, definition, and 10, Short Title, commencement and collective citation and construction, are standard legislative provisions while the core provisions of the Bill are contained in sections 2 to 9.</P>
        <P>Section 2 amends the penalties set out in section 8 of the 2002 Competition Act and provides for larger increases in fines for competition offences across the board.  I propose increasing the fine for criminal conviction of hard-core offences from &euro;4 million to &euro;5 million and doubling from five to ten years the maximum prison sentence for such a conviction.  Fines for summary convictions are increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 and the daily fine for a continuing contravention is also increased in respect of both summary and indictable offences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a further indication of how seriously I view these crimes, I propose that the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 will no longer be capable of applying to competition law offences.  That Act allows a judge to dismiss a proven case based on the trivial nature of the offence, with the result that in such cases a conviction is not incurred against the defendant.  I see nothing trivial about price fixing, bid rigging, or an abuse of dominant position.  These practices act to the detriment of competitors and consumers alike.  Judges will no longer have the option to apply the Probation of Offenders Act where the Competition Authority or the Director of Public Prosecutions has proved a case.  The conviction will be recorded and the guilty party punished in accordance with the enhanced enforcement regime.</P>
        <P>From detection to investigation to prosecution, bringing an offender to justice can be a long, complex and expensive process.  Investigations can span years as evidence is gathered and examined in a forensic manner.  Witnesses must be questioned and their statements scrutinised in detail in order, first, to determine if the behaviour breaches the Act and, second, to build a case for the prosecution.  This work is carried out by specialist investigators, economists and legal experts within the Competition Authority, in association with members of the Garda, including the bureau of fraud investigation.  The cost to the State in undertaking such painstaking investigation can be sizeable.  I am, therefore, providing that the court shall order a person convicted of an offence under the 2002 Act to pay to the Competition Authority or ComReg, where the anti-competitive practices are in the electronic communications sector, the cost of undertaking the detection, investigation and prosecution of the offence.  The court shall measure the costs and expenses.  However, where there are special and substantial reasons for not doing so, I am proposing that the court may decide not to order the payment of such costs.</P>
        <P>Sections 3 and 4 result in the separation of the public and private enforcement regimes which currently are contained in a single section, section 14, of the 2002 Act.  Section 3 strips the public enforcement right of action from this section 14, leaving it to provide for a right of private action for aggrieved persons, while section 4 recreates the public right of action for the Competition Authority and ComReg.</P>
        <P>In so far as section 3 amends section 14, an aggrieved person may bring an action in the Circuit Court or High Court for relief by way of injunction, declaration and-or damages, including exemplary damages, where he or she shows loss as a result of anti-competitive behaviour prohibited by sections 4 or 5 of the 2002 Act or by Article 101 or 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Where, on foot of a private action under section 14 of the 2002 Act, as amended by this section 3, a court finds that an undertaking has abused a dominant position, the court may require the undertaking to discontinue the abuse or to adopt measures for the purpose of ceasing or adjusting the dominant position by, for example, requiring the sale of assets of the undertaking.  Clarity is also provided that the term &ldquo;injunction&rdquo; includes an interim injunction, an interlocutory injunction or an injunction of definite or indefinite duration.</P>
        <P>Section 4 inserts a new section 14A into the 2002 Act, which gives the competent authority, which is either the Competition Authority or ComReg, a right to pursue civil enforcement measures for infringements.  Mirroring the amended private enforcement regime I have just described, the Competition Authority or ComReg also have a right to apply to the Circuit Court or High Court in respect of any agreement, decision, concerted practices or abuse that is prohibited under sections 4 and 5 of the 2002 Act and Articles 101 and 102 of the treaty.  Where a case is proven, the court may order an interim or interlocutory injunction, an injunction of definite or indefinite duration or give a declaration that the behaviour in question is in breach of section 4 or 5 of the Act or Articles 101 or 102 of the treaty.  The court may also require the discontinuance of an abuse of a dominant position or require corrective measures to be taken by the undertaking.</P>
        <P>Section 5, introduced as an amendment to the Bill in the D&aacute;il, provides that the High Court can make a court order in respect of an agreement entered into by the Competition Authority and an undertaking.  This will go a long way towards further strengthening competition law.</P>
        <P>Where the authority carries out an investigation into an alleged breach of the Competition Act, it can and does enter into commitments or agreements with the undertaking under investigation.  This undertaking, without an admission of liability, will agree to either cease and desist from certain behaviour or agree to act in a particular manner.  In return for this agreement, the authority agrees not to initiate proceedings under this Competition Act, thus avoiding the significant legal fees and the deployment of huge resources that a criminal or civil prosecution entails.  Such agreements are enforceable as a matter of contract law.  However, should the undertaking renege on its agreement, the authority is required to go to court to ensure the undertaking complies with the terms of his or her agreement.  This involves an examination of the alleged anti-competitive behaviour which can involve complex economic evidence.</P>
        <P>What the Bill now provides is a statutory mechanism which will permit the authority apply to the High Court for an order to give court backing or support to the agreement.  If the undertaking breaches the order, such breach would be a contempt of court.  In these circumstances the authority could apply to court to have the undertaking penalised for the breach.  Breach of a court order can ultimately be punished as a contempt of court with remedies such as committal and attachment for persons or sequestration for assets.  Rather than being a hearing on the merits of the competition and economic aspects, a contempt hearing would relate to the breach of the terms of the court order.</P>
        <P>The section also provides guidance to the High Court on the factors it must take into consideration when deciding on an application.  It provides for third party rights to have the order varied or annulled where the third party is affected by the order, and it contains a seven year sunset clause for a court order with the possibility of renewal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sections 6 and 7, which were also introduced to the original Bill as amendments in the D&aacute;il, both contain a cross reference amendment arising from the introduction of separate civil enforcement regimes &mdash; section 14 for private rights of action and section 14A for public enforcement.  Section 6 also extends from 14 to 35 days the time limit within which the Competition Authority is required to provide a copy of any of the books, documents or records seized by the authority during a search carried out during an investigation.  When the authority carries out an investigation into alleged breaches of the Competition Act, its authorised officers, on foot of a District Court warrant, are entitled to seize and retain books, documents and records, including records that are held electronically.  Since the introduction of the 2002 Act, there have been significant developments in the area of technology and computing.</P>
        
        
        <P Just="Left">The authority has found it increasingly difficult to make and return copies of electronically stored records within the 14 day deadline contained in that Act.  The problem is made worse when the authority has to conduct multiple simultaneous searches at different sites.  Given the exponential development in computing and the fact that the authority is increasingly having to seize ever larger and more complicated computer systems during its investigations, this issue is likely to grow in the future.  This has led to a number of searches that were planned to be put on hold while alternatives can be looked at.  Extending the deadline provided for in section 45(7) to a period of 35 days is a practical solution and will also help to strengthen the enforcement of competition law in Ireland in keeping with the commitment to the EU-IMF.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Europe-wide there are well recognised difficulties in pursuing private litigation for damages in respect of competition law breaches.  I want to make it easier for people to take such private actions in this jurisdiction.  I am providing that where, following proceedings under Part 2 of the 2002 Act for a breach of section 4 or 5 or Articles 101 or 102 of the treaty, a private litigant taking a follow-on action in respect of the same breach shall, by virtue of section 8 of this Bill, be able to rely on the court&rsquo;s finding of a breach and it shall not be necessary for the second litigant to also prove that the conduct was prohibited.  By easing an element of the burden of proof facing a private litigant, I am seeking to facilitate an increased number of private actions, thus to some extent easing the burden on the State resources in pursuing public enforcement but also ensuring that the State is a facilitator for subsequent private actions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A person convicted on indictment of a breach of competition law is automatically disqualified under section 160 of the Companies Act 1990 from being a company director or from being in any manner involved in the promotion, formation or management of a company.  That section also provides for a discretionary disqualification for summary company law offences.  In section 9 of this Bill I am proposing that this discretionary disqualification provision be extended to all contraventions of sections 4 or 5 of the 2002 Act and Articles 101 or 102 of the treaty.  In keeping with the discretionary disqualification provisions set out in section 160 of the 1990 Companies Act, the High Court may decide itself or may decide on foot of an application by the Competition Authority or ComReg to make a disqualification order for such period as the court sees fit.  This additional sanction will act as a deterrent for those engaging in or contemplating engaging in anti-competitive practices and ties in with the overall thrust of this Bill.</P>
        <P>I want to send a clear and unequivocal message to business people and consumers alike that anti-competitive practices will not be tolerated.  Offenders will be prosecuted and feel the full brunt of the law.  These new deterrents should give further pause to would-be and current cartelists and I strongly urge the courts to follow, where appropriate, the words of Mr. Justice McKechnie and apply the full rigours of the law.</P>
        <P>The concept of civil fines was debated at some length both before the publication of the Bill and during the various Stages in the D&aacute;il.  By way of background, the memorandum of understanding with the EU-IMF contains a number of structural reforms, of which legislation to strengthen competition law is just one.  The purpose of these structural reforms is to open up competition in all areas of the economy and to increase the deterrents for anti-competitive practices.  The initial intent of the European Commission in seeking a commitment derived from its desire to see the introduction of civil fines in respect of competition law.</P>
        <P>Breaches of competition law are criminal offences, prosecuted to the high standard of beyond reasonable doubt with substantial monetary and custodial penalties available to the courts where a defendant is found guilty.  Elsewhere in Europe, the national courts or the national competition authority can impose punitive fines in respect of breaches of competition law.  Such a regime is in keeping with their civil law systems.  I am advised by the Attorney General that the concept of civil fines is not in keeping with the Constitution and common law system.  Therefore, in order to comply with the spirit of the EU and IMF commitment, a suite of alternative enforcement measures was drawn up to strengthen the effective enforcement of Irish competition law.  These are in the Bill before the House.</P>
        <P>The Attorney General has advised introducing legislation to decriminalise sections 4(1)(<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) and section 5 of the Competition Act 2002, otherwise known as non-hardcore offences, and to introduce civil fines to lower the burden of proof from beyond all reasonable doubt to the civil test of on the balance of probability would pose constitutional difficulties having regard to the protections afforded by Article 38.1 of the Constitution.  The Competition Authority and troika have acknowledged that there are constitutional problems with civil fines.</P>
        <P>On the wider competition arena, following enactment of this Bill my next legislative priority in this area will be the consumer and competition Bill to give effect to the amalgamation of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  As both bodies were established under statute, it is necessary to give effect to the newly merged body by way of primary legislation.  The Government approved the drafting of the Bill in July 2011.  Since being announced as part of the rationalisation plan for State agencies during the 2009 budget speech, my Department has continued to work with both bodies to ensure a smooth transition from the two separate entities to a single dual functioning body responsible for competition and consumer protection.</P>
        <P>The Bill will also update existing competition law on foot of a review of the operation and implementation of the 2002 Act, strengthen the public interest test in respect of media mergers in line with the report of the advisory group on media mergers, make some minor amendments to consumer protection legislation and provide for a practice for doing business in the grocery goods sector.  While this all-encompassing approach to draft legislation has, to some extent, delayed legislation for the rationalisation of the two agencies, we will be better served in the long run by a single legislative measure that establishes the new agency and provides for the combined and updated consumer competition code.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know Senators are awaiting publication of the Bill and may avail of the opportunity of the Bill before us to progress issues contained in the other Bill.  However, I urge them to wait.  The matters to be included in the comprehensive consumer and competition Bill will be considered and debated in due course and, no doubt, in great detail, as is appropriate.  I look forward to working with Senators on the Bill before the House and will be happy to reply to questions that arise.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the Bill.  However, we cannot support it because it does not go far enough.  Many aspects of the Bill, including changes to fines and penalties, are more about generating headlines than protecting consumers or improving competition.  A comprehensive consumer and competition Bill is needed, as previously promised by the Minister. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill provides for new and additional sanctions and penalties for breaches of competition law in Ireland.  The IMF and EU programme for July 2011 contains the following commitment: &ldquo;Government will introduce legislation to strengthen competition law enforcement in Ireland by ensuring the availability of effective sanctions for infringements of Irish competition law.&rdquo;  Articles 101 and 102 of the treaty on the functioning of the EU, as well as ensuring the effective functioning of the Competition Authority, which will be merged with the National Consumer Agency, would address this.  However, Ms Noreen Mackey, a legal adviser to the Competition Authority, states: "It is crucial that this agency is properly equipped with powers that enable it to be both effective and efficient in carrying out its statutory mandate."  However, the reality is that this Bill does little to address the requirements of the memorandum of understanding of the EU and IMF and Ms Mackey's concerns.  The key problem in competition law enforcement in Ireland lies not in the maximum possible level of penalties, but in the low likelihood of detection and punishment, something the Bill does not address.  It is the same old story.  We have a lot of regulation but are not good with enforcement.</P>
        
        <P>There are no provisions in the Bill for civil fines.  The Competition Authority has no remedy available to it, other than declaratory and injunctive reliefs, and there is no provision in the 2002 Act for civil fines and penalties for breach of competition law.  The advantage of the civil route is that the burden of proof is lower than that required in criminal law.  The problem of having juries in criminal trials understand the complexities and nuances of competition law are removed.  However, the Bill has no provision for civil fines or pecuniary penalties.  The amendments will have little or no meaningful effect on strengthening enforcement. The one area the Competition Authority has specifically identified as being seriously lacking has not been addressed in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to the Fine Gael manifesto.  It refers to a new consumer and competition commission and states: &ldquo;To save taxpayers money and to strengthen and streamline resources, Fine Gael will merge the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the Commission for Communications Regulation and the Commission for Energy Regulation into a single, more powerful, competition, consumer and utilities commission.&rdquo;  The Minister seems to be intent on doing that.  We want to know why today's Bill has been published separately to a comprehensive consumer and competition Bill.  Why does the Government believe a penalty of &euro;5 million rather than &euro;4 million will have an impact on hard-core offences?  Why is the prison term being increased?  It serves no practical purpose and is more window dressing.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">In all cases to date, not one person convicted of an offence under the relevant subsection of the 2002 Act has seen the inside of a prison cell.  Any sentences that have been imposed have been suspended and none lasted more than 12 months.  It is unlikely that the amendment introducing a ten year sentence would have any teeth in strengthening competition law enforcement in any real or meaningful way.  The Competition Authority stated on a number of occasions it will not bring criminal  prosecutions for non-hard core offences.  Any increases in penalties introduced by the amendment are effectively meaningless because no proceedings will ever be brought.</P>
        <P>As I said, the Bill makes no provision for civil fines due to constitutional considerations.  Will the Government hold a referendum to amend this, as Fine Gail promised in its manifesto?  The Competition Authority is concerned about this.  Will the Government allow authorised officers of the Competition Authority to be present at and participate in the questioning of suspects detained by the garda&iacute; in regard to alleged competition offences as requested by Ms Mackey?</P>
        <P Just="Left">People want to see people pay the price for breaking the law, such as being put in jail.  Let us get our act together on enforcing the regulations.  As the previous Government was not great at enforcing the regulations I am not picking on the Minister.  We are very bad in comparison with Germany.  I do not want to go into the cases where companies have had to pay large fines.  Ireland is very poor at it and we need to improve and get our act together on this aspect of our competitiveness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Senator Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill which is another step towards ensuring the nation and the economy become more competitive.  The EU-IMF agreement requires a number of structural reforms and strengthening our competition law and enforcement will form part of these changes.</P>
        <P>The Bill deals with white collar crime and such offences must be prosecuted.  This type of crime affects consumers and anti-competitive practices also have an effect on the economy and businesses through price fixing, cartels or abuse of a dominant position.  In its annual reports the National Competitiveness Council points to the need to tackle anti-competitive practices, including sheltered professions.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Bill strengthen the 2002 Act and introduce new measures.  The Competition Act 2002 provides for sanctions and the Bill will strengthen these.  The maximum prison sentence on conviction of an offence will be increased from five years to ten years.  As the Minister stated, a body convicted of competition offences will pay some of the costs associated with the very lengthy and costly investigations that can occur.  The Minister outlined how it will be easier for individuals to take a case against anti-competitive practices and this will go some way towards tackling non-hardcore offences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many people have contacted us with regard to the content of the Bill.  We are aware of headline offences such as cartel practices and price fixing and the Competition Authority has had some success in tackling these.  This is the body responsible for implementing the legislation and ensuring anti-competitive offences are tackled.  Non-hard core offences such as abuse of a dominant position or an agreement between competitors to share commercially sensitive information must also be tackled.  Other such offences include trying to influence a company&rsquo;s behaviour through dictating the price of products to a retailer, predatory pricing, exclusive dealing, making the sale of one good conditional on the sale of another and refusal to supply an order to eliminate a trader or retailer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Competition Authority report was published two weeks ago and outlined a number of cases brought to its attention.  It becomes aware of cases through its investigations or through people making complaints to it.  Last year it dealt with 212 cases, of which 99 were resolved at source and 113 continue to be assessed.  Many complaints were made about petrol and diesel prices with allegations of price fixing.  However, when the Competition Authority investigated the matter, it found that it came down to competitors in an area checking each other&rsquo;s prices and matching or bettering them.  As this is probably a good thing for consumers, not all cases are anti-competitive.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Bill deal with non-hardcore offences and will make it easier to ensure convictions.  Many non-hardcore offences are resolved voluntarily, although cases can go to court.  The difficult cases involve cartels and price fixing and these do go to court and can end up in criminal convictions.  These cases are very difficult to investigate as much secrecy can be involved and they require time, expense and expertise as the burden of proof in criminal cases is beyond reasonable doubt.</P>
        <P>The Competition Authority held a conference last autumn on its perception of the need for civil fines because there is a gap in this area.  The Minister clarified this in his contribution.  On the advice of the Attorney General it would not be in keeping with Article 38.1 of the Constitution.</P>
        <P>This House recently debated the Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Bill 2011 and we expect the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 to come before the House shortly.  These Bills represent steps to ensure competition in the medical and legal services areas.  We are beginning to tackle the sheltered professions which are always the target of the Competition Authority to ensure consumers, businesses and the economy can benefit from these competitive measures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is the second time he has been here this week.  With the support of the IMF, the Minister is tackling a deep-seated problem in the economy, which is that it suffers from too much lobbying and too many cartels.  The typical reaction around the Cabinet table is to ask how competition can be prevented rather than promoted.  The Competition Authority must gain the powers to impose competition on Ministers who protect their sectors.  There has been a rash of such incidents.</P>
        <P>I will take the example of the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 which substituted direct award contracts for competition.  It is a public service contract without a competitive tendering procedure and this is totally anti-competitive.  The former Minister, Noel Dempsey, brought the Bill before the house and the then Senator, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, opposed it very strongly.  Worse than this, the Competition Authority did not speak out during the screening regulatory impact analysis and all other Departments either said nothing or were broadly in favour of the Bill.  It is not good enough that individual Ministers can opt out.</P>
        <P>We were supposed to have competition at airports.  The former Minister, the late Seamus Brennan, wanted competing terminals at Dublin Airport.  A total of 13 or 14 applications were received but the competition was cancelled and strangely enough the State awarded itself the monopoly contract and nobody disagreed.  We used to defend the indefensible in terms of airline competition.  In the 1980s, there was a parliamentary revolt against legislation that put people in jail for two years and fined them &pound;100,000 for charging travellers less than Aer Lingus did.  I am delighted that the Parliament intervened.</P>
        <P>One wonders about the degree of what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, calls the regulatory capture of Departments, particularly by companies that are owned by those Departments.  I deplore what Aer Lingus exercised in the past and what CIE and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, do now.  I also deplore the health insurance situation.  We are in breach of regulations and European court rules on competition.  Even the Supreme Court decided against it.  The reason is that successive health Ministers believed they needed to justify firms within their bailiwick.  VHI, which has a monopolistic power and protection, is keeping people in hospital beds for 10.6 days while the Milliman report claimed that 3.7 days would be enough.</P>
        <P>Monopolies are grossly inefficient, produce too little, charge too much and create excess rents for the people being protected.  In Ireland, we are far too keen to listen to lobbyists and offer protection.  This has damaged the competitiveness of the economy.  Like Senator Clune, I welcome our intervention in the GP medical card list issue as well as the small measures on veterinary deregulation.</P>
        <P>That the school bus contract was not put out to tender led to a court case.  The failure of the energy regulator to examine the considerable earnings at management and worker level in the ESB reduces the economy&rsquo;s competitiveness.  Is the regulator captured?  Is the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, a captured regulator?  Someone who has been refused health insurance by a competitor on the grounds that he or she is too old has never been produced as a witness, yet the policy assumes it is the case.  The same situation obtains in the transport sector.  Sometimes people look back nostalgically on when we had a telecommunications monopoly.  The Culliton report found that, as a share of GDP, telephone charges were approximately twice what they were in the rest of Europe.  They are now in or around the average.  One gains from competition.</P>
        <P>We must examine those regulators who are not delivering.  If they have been captured by the producers in their respective sectors, they should be absorbed by the Competition Authority.  The incumbents will always be against new entrants.  We need a public service tradition in Ireland similar to that espoused by Professor Alfred Kahn in the US, where one takes on the established airlines and allows in newcomers to discipline the incumbents.  Otherwise, one is charged too much and overall economic competitiveness is reduced.  I have cited some examples &mdash; I will send them to the Minister via the internal mail &mdash; of companies in our construction industry that were hopelessly uncompetitive when bidding for tenders at Enniskillen Airport.  According to the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, problems are posed by excessive costs.  For example, our business premises are twice as expensive as those in the UK.</P>
        <P>There is a tradition of protectionism in Ireland.  For example, it used to be that one could speak with a major solicitor, he or she would approach the then Department of Industry and Commerce on one&rsquo;s behalf and one would immediately be given a quota and a high tariff would be placed against imports.  This tradition of clientelism should have been jettisoned a long time ago.  The unsheltered sectors of the economy can bear no more.  The IMF is correct in advising us in that respect.  There are many restrictive practices.</P>
        <P>The first place that competition policy should be introduced in Ireland is at the Cabinet table.  Ministers should put more business out for competitive tendering and open up to the markets.  Ireland&rsquo;s bureaucratic tradition is deeply hostile to competition.  In the Swords Express case, Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon stated that the company attempting to run buses between Swords and Dublin was doubly discriminated against by the Department of Transport in the exercise of its functions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us open up to the markets.  We will support the Minister.  Increasing a fine from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 will not deter people much.  If the Minister wants a higher number than &euro;5,000, I would support him.  Let us take this matter seriously.  There should be an all-of-Cabinet approach to halting restrictive practices, protectionism and regulatory capture.  The IMF is right &mdash; it is an in-built feature of the economy.  For example, when there was a monopoly, there was one bus per day between Dublin and Galway.  There are 45 services now.  This entails 44 more bus drivers, 44 more buses full of happier customers and so on.  We addressed aviation first.  Ryanair will carry approximately 85 million passengers this year, which is 2.5 times more than British Airways, the largest airline in Europe.  Ryanair had first mover advantage because the Houses decided not to continue the policy of protecting Aer Lingus from competition.  That policy existed even before Aer Lingus was founded.  A man called Crilly wanted to fly into Ireland, but he was told it was not going to be because we were going to have a national airline.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Sectors must be opened up to competition.  This is how a small island economy that is trading on a world scale and into the Brazil, Russia, India and China, BRIC, countries will survive.  However, the culture of lobbying is ingrained in our political system.  I hope that the Government will quickly introduce its measures to control lobbying.  The lobbying on 29 and 30 September 2008 on behalf of the banks was the greatest ever instance of lobbying in terms of its effect on GDP <i>per capita</i>, yet it did nothing for the rest of the economy.  We have found out that 60% of the rescued banks' current lending is to the construction industry.</P>
        <P>The type of dynamic economy that the Minister wants to build requires an end to this kind of clientelism.  I commend him on any radical measure he wishes to take in this regard.  The IMF is correct in that we have been lax to date.  We need a stronger competition policy and stronger Competition Authority than we have had heretofore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesHeffernan"><NameTxt>Senator James Heffernan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  He has been busy in the Seanad this week and it is good to have him back.</P>
        <P>I broadly welcome the Bill, the purpose of which is to strengthen competition law and enforcement through increased sanctions.  I hope that the Bill will prove an effective deterrent to white collar crime such as price fixing and cartels, which are not of much benefit to the State or the consumer.  Providing conditions in which businesses can continue to thrive through fair competition practices is an imperative, given the situation in which we find ourselves.  Fair competition gives businesses an incentive to improve their standards and ensures that the consumer gets the best bang for his or her buck.  Any measure that improves services and increases value for money must be welcomed.</P>
        <P>As the Minister stated, section 2 of the Bill provides for a significant increase &mdash; from &euro;4 million to &euro;5 million &mdash; in the fines that can be imposed for hardcore offences.  The maximum prison sentence that can be imposed following conviction is to be doubled from five to ten years.  I welcome these measures.  I also welcome the increase in the level of fines following summary convictions for certain competition offences and the increase in the maximum daily fine that will apply should the offender continue in contravention of the law.  These measures will cause people who are considering chancing their arm by engaging in anti-competitive practices to think twice.</P>
        <P>As we all know, investigations take time and cost the State a significant amount of money.  The Minister cited a good example of this.  I welcome the measure whereby, following a conviction, an offender must pay for the cost of the investigation and prosecution.  I also welcome the provision whereby, should a small business wish to pursue follow-up action in respect of a proven breach of the competition legislation, it would not need to prove that breach again.  This measure will save on costs and time.  Most importantly, these changes to the legislation will make it easier for ordinary people and small businesses to make claims against companies that are found guilty of price fixing.</P>
        <P>Section 5, which relates to the course of action following an investigation that has found a person or business to have been acting against the law, provides significant deterrents.  It also allows for agreements between the Competition Authority and the people or businesses under investigation, subject to a High Court order.  Any person or business breaching the High Court order will be held in contempt of court.  This is a welcome provision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having said that, I have a number of issues with the Bill.  Some of these matters were raised by Senators on the opposite side and addressed by the Minister.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that we are not allowing for the imposition of fines by the courts.  The Competition Authority advocated for the provision of civil fines in non-hard core cases.  Currently, a person or business found guilty of committing a non-hard core offence cannot be fined.  This means that while they may be given a slap on the wrist and instructed to discontinue their anti-competitive practices, no financial sanction can be imposed upon them.  The Minister has stated that there is constitutional reason for this.  However, the non-imposition of financial sanctions in this regard is unfortunate.  Perhaps the Minister will re-examine this during the passage of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Another proposal worthy of consideration is that proposed by the Irish Small Business Alliance in its submission on the Bill prior to it coming before this House, namely, the introduction of financial reward for information, such as is provided for in the whistleblower legislation, which would assist in the detection of and investigation into cartels, leading, perhaps, to convictions.  I take this opportunity to inform the Minister that I will be unable to attend the meeting in Limerick tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Certain parties in this House have for many years lived off the spectre of former T&aacute;naiste and esteemed former Member of this House, Mary Harney.  They have time and again criticised her for what they perceived to be right wing economics and dreadful health policy.  It is, therefore, hilarious to hear Labour Party and Fine Gael Members of this House support what is essentially a tinkering around the edges of a Bill introduced ten years ago by her on foot of legislation in which the former Progressive Democrats Party was involved ten years previous to that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reality is that this legislation has in the meantime failed completely because no one has been imprisoned for breach of competition law.  Cartels, price fixing, sharing of markets and bid rigging is wrong.  While everyone pays the price for this, the matter is not taken seriously in this country.  People should be imprisoned and know they will be imprisoned for breaches of competition law but that is not happening in this country.  This is not happening because we have adopted what is civil law in Brussels as criminal law in Ireland, which is unsuitable.</P>
        <P>There is complete confusion in regard to what offences will or will not be prosecuted.  We should in this regard be setting out in legislation a range of simple offences which can be easily understood by the public and criminals involved in price fixing.  Price fixing is going on all around the country and the Minister must be aware of it.  However, nothing is being done about it.  Not enough effort is being made to educate the members of the public about this to enable them report it and the Competition Authority does not have sufficient resources.  Legislation in this area is much too complicated and this Bill does nothing to clarify and simplify it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As stated by my colleague, Senator Mary White, this is mere window dressing.  What difference does it make if the maximum fine in respect of hard core offences is &euro;4 million or &euro;5 million?  It will make no difference.  We can fine the ordinary people of this country &euro;20 for non-payment of the household charge but we cannot introduce fines in respect of price fixing or civil offences under competition law.  I accept that civil fines would not be suitable in respect of price fixing.  It is frustrating that it is always possible to introduce fines by way of legislation in respect of breaches of law by ordinary citizens but it is not possible to do likewise in respect of people who are robbing us left, right and centre.  A way is always found to get money from, say, the widow in Roscommon to whom Senator Leyden often refers.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Blank"><NameTxt></NameTxt>
	
        <P>This Bill is only window dressing.  No one has yet been imprisoned for breaches of competition law and no one is likely to be imprisoned under this legislation because it is far too complicated.  The legislation is much too complex in terms of its provisions in respect of economic analysis and exemptions.  We need to agree to fix prices, a breach of which, if big enough, will be considered anti-competitive and in breach of Irish and European law.  It should be as simple as that.  However, it is not that simple.  We need more education of garda&iacute; in this area.  As this is criminal law, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be much more apprised of it than it is and should be able to take criminal prosecutions without reference to the Competition Authority.</P>
        <P>The American Sherman Act, introduced more than 100 years ago by former President Roosevelt, has been very successful.  Local police forces and the FBI have taken restraint of trade or monopolisation cases under that legislation, in respect of which many people have received lengthy prison terms.  This has not happened in Europe because Europe is not concerned with criminal law.  It also has not happened here because we have adopted civil law in Europe as criminal law here, which has not proven effective.  The policy introduced by former T&aacute;naiste and Minister, Mary Harney, was well intentioned.  She was always criticised for this by Fine Gael and Labour Party members and it is wrong for those parties to now tinker around the edges of her policy.  It is time for more radical policy change.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with the decision of my party spokesperson to oppose this legislation, not to send the message that Fianna F&aacute;il is pro-cartels or pro-price fixing but that we are more opposed to them than are the Government parties and that we believe people should be greatly penalised in that regard.  The Government should be providing the Competition Authority with more resources in order that it, along with Government and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, can stamp out this practise.  Fianna F&aacute;il is opposing this legislation on the basis that we want to see a tougher approach taken to this practice which is doing terrible damage to society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the IMF is listening to this debate.  I do not believe it is appropriate that we are introducing legislation which is mere window dressing.  The Government has missed the opportunity to introduce legislation which could be easily understood by offenders and juries and which would have made a difference to the economy.  Senator Barrett has outlined the benefits of competition to the economy, which we wholeheartedly support.  We do not believe this legislation goes far enough and are calling for the introduction of much more radical action in this area. </P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome this Bill.  The Minister gave a comprehensive overview of the legislation in his opening statement.  I agree with Senator Thomas Byrne that former T&aacute;naiste and Minister, Mary Harney, made a valuable contribution in this area.  </P>
        <P>On competition, I was fortunate enough to be apprentice to the solicitor who took one of the first anti-competitive cases to the European Court in 1974.  The case involved the Irish Sugar Company, which had decided it was no longer going to sell sugar to wholesale distributors but would sell it directly to retailer, which the European Court held was anti-competitive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the provisions set out in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill which empower ordinary individuals to take action if necessary.  The only difficulty I have in this regard is the cost to the individual of taking such an action and, in the event of a case being lost, him or her being liable for the cost of taking the action.  I recently filed a complaint with the Competition Authority in respect of another State agency, VHI.  A new private hospital is for the first time in 95 years to open in Cork.  While two health insurance companies have agreed to cover use of facilities at that hospital by their customers, VHI has refused to do so, which I believe is anti-competitive.  The Competition Authority is dealing with the detailed complaint which I filed with it on this matter.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">This is where the Competition Authority can play a very important role in ensuring that one or two businesses or enterprises do not control what happens in an area.  There is a lack of competition in the private health care area in Cork, and it is important that this new facility is allowed to open.  The only way that can happen is if VHI customers are allowed to use that facility.  I look forward to the investigation by the Competition Authority on the issue as it is important to bring down the cost of health care in the country.  I understand that as part of the process, VHI is revisiting the issue and the company that wants to open a hospital has brought down its prices.  This proves that where there is competition, prices are forced down, and in the health care area we must bring down the costs.</P>
        <P>With regard to anti-competitive practices, one or two issues are arising which cause their own problems.  There is the question of the HSE negotiating with GPs, and I understand there are some limitations as it would be seen as anti-competitive if the Irish Medical Organisation negotiated directly with the HSE with a view to an overall contract.  That is causing some difficulties but I am not sure how this will be approached in future.  The Department of Education and Skills can negotiate directly with teachers and agree a salary scale but there is a problem because the HSE cannot negotiate with doctors because they are employed under contracts.  That causes a problem in moving the negotiations forward.</P>
        <P>This is a welcome change in legislation and it is required.  The Minister has already outlined the constitutional problems with regard to the civil arena and a constitutional amendment might be required if we took on board the concerns of Senators White and Byrne.  That is not available now, unfortunately.  This legislation is welcome and gives the opportunity for the ordinary individual to take his or her own action.  It would also give far more power to the Competition Authority, and that is long overdue.  I thank the Minister for bringing forward the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a believer in competition and have been all my life.  In general the Minister has got the balance right in this and it is not easy to achieve what he set out to do.  In 1936, my father opened a grocery business and fell out with his father, who was also in the grocery business, as my grandfather thought it unethical to cut the price of groceries; he believed people should compete only on service and not on price.  When I opened in business that was the law in Ireland, and resale price maintenance meant that one could not sell below a legitimate price established by a supplier.  We have a tradition in Ireland of avoiding competition, which has not always been to our benefit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On one occasion in Dundalk I remember selling below cost, in which I was a great believer, and causing a war between the trades in the town.  As other retailers went below cost and we went lower again, it was a chain reaction.  All of the people in that part of the world came to shop in Dundalk and it benefited the whole town as we found a way to compete with each other.  The difficulty now is getting the balance right for what is in the public good.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Reilly recently held a function in the audio-visual room and spoke about the danger to our main streets and high streets and the devastation caused by small shops having to compete with the big supermarkets on the outskirts of town.  I understand her point and why she was concerned as I have visited the main streets in towns.  They are a desert in many cases, with many empty shops.  This is because large stores have been built on the outskirts of town.  What can be done about that?  Should we hinder the competition that benefits the community, consumers and families who wish to buy food at a lower price?  That is not the right answer but we should not encourage the development of stores outside towns.  If we continue to do so we will demolish town centres and create retail deserts.  The same idea applies with the new order on the size of supermarkets, and slightly larger supermarkets are now permitted.  In most parts of Europe there is no such control on the size of supermarkets, leading to great increases in their power.  That does not help the small trader, people without a car or those who cannot shop anywhere except locally.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">In Ireland there is a tradition of the State supporting anti-competitive practices, and Senator Barrett provided some great examples.  He touched on the example I remember most, which is the airlines.  Between Dublin and London the air fare was always over &pound;200, with only two state-owned airlines &mdash; Aer Lingus and British Airways &mdash; running the service.  No other airline was allowed to compete in what was an accepted practice.  We thought we understood the practice but it was not until Peter Sutherland in the European arena decided to release competitive forces that the likes of Ryanair were given permission to enter the market.  We can now see what has happened in the business, and there is a similar scenario in the telephone business.  The State owned the telephone company and we had the worst service in Europe.  It was not until competition was developed that we saw change.</P>
        <P>How do we get the balance right?  Although we are unwilling to do it enthusiastically, if we allow full competition in postal services, as decreed by Europe, the companies set up to compete with An Post will deliver at a low price but only in the cities.  They will not deliver half way up a mountain and there will not be a postal service in the rest of the country.  There is a balance to be struck and we should consider how to achieve competition that is of benefit to everybody.</P>
        <P>There is one aspect of competitiveness I will speak to, which relates to the European Union and our system.  We must examine the work of rating agencies, as the European Union is not doing enough in this area.  There should be regulation of bond rating agencies and strict penalties should be imposed for fraudulent ratings.  One ratings agency has stated that our upcoming referendum is &ldquo;credit-negative&rdquo; in spite of the fact that it is a purely democratic act.  If the European Union is imposing the legislation before us today as part of our obligations, it should address even more damaging issues, such as the rating agencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In another amazing development, Iceland&rsquo;s former Prime Minister Haarde became the world&rsquo;s first leader to be put on trial on charges of negligence over the 2008 financial crisis.  He was Prime Minister from 2006 to 2009 and is accused of gross negligence and failing to prevent the collapse of Iceland&rsquo;s top three banks, which were heavily involved in risky investments in the US.  I do not know if that is a question of competition but we should have stronger legislation.</P>
        <P>Returning to the legislation, one could question if the current penalties of up to five years imprisonment have enough dissuasive effect.  Ms Claire Waterson of William Fry made an interesting observation, stating that the proposed provisions on follow-up cases &mdash; actions for damages where breach has already been established &mdash; are to be welcomed from the private litigants&rsquo; perspective.  She indicates, however, that the provision will primarily apply where there have been prior enforcement proceedings by the Competition Authority or the Director of Public Prosecutions.  As public enforcement is infrequent in Ireland &mdash; we have heard enough about that today &mdash; private litigants will continue to face significant evidential difficulties in cases where there is no court case decision.  Will the Minister comment on that?</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes legislation which will promote national competitiveness, tackle corruption, hold business leaders to account and reduce costs to people and businesses.  However, we believe there are parts of this legislation which are weak and lacking in a couple of key areas.  In that respect, we will table amendments to strengthen the legislation in certain areas.  We will probably table amendments in regard to civil fines as an option for the Competition Authority, the lack of obligation on the Government to respond adequately to issues raised by the Competition Authority, the failure to properly resource the Competition Authority and the stand alone nature of this legislation.</P>
        <P>We support the measures in this Bill to tackle corrupt practices but we do not believe it does enough to tackle these practices and it will not necessarily result in a fairer and more competitive environment.  We welcome the tougher criminal penalties available to those engaging in corrupt practices because they undermine our economy and penalise ordinary workers and consumers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The intent behind this legislation is to strengthen competition law enforcement by ensuring the availability of effective sanctions to deal with infringements of competition law, but the major flaw in this Bill, which critically undermines it, is the lack of provision of civil fines as requested by the Competition Authority which sought the provision of civil fines to deal with the so-called non-hard core infringement.  Central to this is the abuse of dominant market share, including refusal to supply, predatory pricing and exclusivity agreements.  We remain concerned that the absence of a provision for civil fines will impact on the ability to deal with these types of abuses.  The development and implementation of a civil fines mechanism would deal with the abuse of dominant position and it would strengthen the provisions of the Bill and further safeguard consumer and local business.  The role of civil fines is to punish corrupt practices where the burden of proof is too onerous to reach.  They are a medium-strength provision which should be utilised and I hope the Minister will look at this again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are concerned the Bill does not oblige the Government to respond to the issues raised by the Competition Authority.  Issues that impede competitiveness may require Government action and/or legislation.  Best practice across Europe places responsibility on a government to respond to a report by the relevant competition authority within a specified timescale and the relevant competition authority has the ability to table legislation for consideration.  In this state, there is no obligation to consider let alone act on the recommendations of the authority.  If the Government is serious about dealing with corrupt practices, it should consider including a clause on the obligation to respond to recommendations of the authority with a response which must outline the Government&rsquo;s proposed actions with regard to each recommendation.  Again, we see no reason this gaping hole cannot be amended in the legislation.</P>
        <P>This legislation places much responsibility on the Competition Authority but the question must be asked: is it fit for purpose?  Is the Government committed to supporting it with adequate resources and responding to the issues it raises?  Like other speakers, we support this legislation but we do not believe it goes far enough.  If the Minister could consider that along with our amendments on Committee Stage, it would be much appreciated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister who referred to the EU-IMF programme of 28 July 2011 which contained the commitment that the Government would introduce legislation to strengthen competition law enforcement in Ireland by ensuring the availability of effective sanctions for infringements of Irish competition law and articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as well as ensuring the effective functioning of the Competition Authority which will be merged with the National Consumer Agency.</P>
        <P>The Bill does very little to address the requirements of the memorandum of understanding to which the Government agreed on 28 July 2011.  The key problem in competition law enforcement in Ireland lies not in the maximum possible level of penalties, but in the low likelihood of detection and punishment, which this Bill does not address.  We all agree competition is critical in the marketplace and the prevention of cartels and collusion in business allows new entrants into the economy and we all know new entrants which survive will create employment.</P>
        <P>Senators Barrett, White and Byrne referred to the opening up of sectors to competition. It is not too many years ago when I, as a young person in Cavan, wanted to travel to Dublin but the only transport available was CIE which later became Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It cost an arm and a leg to get to Dublin until that route was opened up to the private sector.  That reduced dramatically the cost of travelling to Dublin and increased the number of buses provided by CIE.  Aer Lingus had a monopoly but when that sector was opened to competition, Ryanair dramatically reduced the cost of travelling, in particular travelling between here and Britain, for which Aer Lingus was charging an arm and a leg.  Others sectors were mentioned by other Senators.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all agree markets must be opened up but we must look at our planning laws.  Senator Quinn referred to the delegation from the chamber of commerce in Cavan that my colleague, Senator Reilly, invited here a number of weeks ago which was concerned about out of town shopping and these multinationals providing huge shopping centres which are drawing people out of the town.  Eventually, shops in the town will have to close and when that happens, we will be left with a monopoly.  We have all seen what has happened in England where people living in some country towns must travel up to 40 miles to shop because the small shops in the towns have closed, in particular as a result of Tesco.  Tesco is trying to build huge shopping centres on the outskirts of our relatively small towns which will result in the shops in the towns closing because they will not be able to compete.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation but, as our spokesperson Senator White pointed out, we do not believe it goes far enough.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  I am glad I heard the last remarks of my distinguished colleague, Senator Wilson, which I endorse wholeheartedly.  It grieves me that we have these chains, many of them from Britain, which have an aggressive policy of undercutting the competition.  They have loss-leading brands, they create hypermarkets and they drain the life out of small towns and even out of the centre of cities.  I am lucky there is still a corner shop in my neighbourhood but it is extremely rare.  That devalues our community.  It is not directly related to competition but an allied issue is the question of below cost alcohol selling on a mass scale which is absolutely appalling and has led to casualties and death.</P>
        
        <P>I heard most of the Minister&rsquo;s speech and I gather substantial amendments were made during the passage of the Bill through the D&aacute;il in regard to private litigants and so on.  I have been briefed by a group called the Irish Small Business Alliance.  The title of its submission, a submission on the Government&rsquo;s abysmal failure to enforce Irish competition law 1991-2012, is a trifle undiplomatic.  I am not an idolatrous follower of competition.  I think there are circumstances in which it is absolutely disastrous.  I do not think we should make a little tin god of it.  Sometimes it is appropriate but it must be recognised that it is not always in the interests of the consumer.  I remember speaking on the competition Bill when it was originally introduced by the then Minister, Mary Harney.  What struck me was that there was free range for everybody else, but missing from the Bill was a suggestion there had to be a competition for the position of chairman.  The position was not to be publicly advertised but I managed to get it amended to ensure the Competition Authority satisfied its own regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It was recently filled by public advertisement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done.  I thank the Minister for making that point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the first people to chair the Competition Authority was Dr. John Fingleton, whom I knew from Trinity College followed by William Pratifka.  Dr. Fingleton indicated that advancing better practices cost about &euro;4 billion a year, and that was in 2004.  The point that this group makes, however undiplomaticly, is that it is very difficult to enforce competition legislation, unless the mechanism of enforcement is properly financed.  The Irish Small Business Alliance suggests this does not happen, in other words, that the office of the Competition Authority is inadequately resourced.  Will the Minister comment on that, unless he has already done so while I was engaged with people from the US?  The director in the year 2000, Mr. Patrick Masterson, resigned saying he could no longer continue as director of competition enforcement due to the failure to provide adequate resources to enable him to do his job properly.  The OECD report in April 2001 stated that strengthening competition law in institutions had been compromised by lack of resources, unclear independence and inconsistent leadership.  Mr. Declan Purcell, the then Competition Authority chairman said in October 2010 the authority&rsquo;s ability to carry out its statutory and other functions &ldquo;... is seriously and regrettably compromised ... I simply feel that some facts need to be recognised and acknowledged.  With the current level of resources we have ... we are no longer in a position to investigate and assist the DPP ... We will be doing well if we can conclude one major investigation in the non-criminal enforcement.&rdquo;  I understand that only two detective Garda are seconded to assist them in this latter role.</P>
        <P>On the introduction of civil fines, I have been briefed that the Minister is resistant and unyielding and has not given any reasons, but if I have understood his speech correctly, he has introduced them.  The Minister quoted legal advice from the Attorney General that there would be a constitutional problem and as I understand it he has placed at least a section of the advice received from the Attorney General on the record.  I know there is a tradition of not releasing information, but I ask that the broad outlines could be made clear to the Irish Small Business Alliance.  I know it is related to the burden of proof.  In other laws, there is the possibility of private prosecution, for example in acts of terrorism there has been a number of cases, for example the Omagh bombing, where it proved impossible to meet the test, the people who were brought before the courts failed, but then the people who could demonstrate injury could go before a civil court.  I wonder if it is possible to resolve this situation and introduce some similar measure?  It has happened in other areas as well where civil suits have been brought, following the collapse of a trial in the criminal court which requires a higher level of proof.  Will the Minister consider this suggestion?</P>
        <P>I hesitate to suggest that we encourage informers, who do not have a good reputation, but we are using them for income tax.  How about a reward for those who reveal uncompetitive practices?  Mr. George Stigler states that regulatory capture is endemic and many corporations regularly breach regulatory laws, confident that they will not be caught or if they are, the financial benefits derived from the breach will exceed the cost of the fines and so on.  That shows the power of the major corporations as against the individual.  I have always stood for the individual and there is no conflict between that and being a good businessman.  If you do not believe me, look to my righthand side, this is Senator Feargal Quinn, who ran an extremely successful business on the basis that the customer is king.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is appropriate to discuss the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2011 at a time when competition is the word on everybody&rsquo;s lips and we are a little more competitive than we have been for many years.  We need to continue to remain competitive in all aspects of business if we are to bring about economic recovery in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>The Bill is designed to strengthen the enforcement of competition law in Ireland.  Breaching competition law is a white collar crime and the punishment should fit the crime.  It is regrettable that we have seen many examples of white collar crime in the past decade, with very few people ending up behind bars.  Contrast that with what happens in America.  Very shortly after the Lehman Brothers debacle, we saw several high ranking banking officials behind bars.  We experienced a similar situation and to date we have seen nobody brought to book or made to pay the price for reckless decisions which have devastated the lives of so many in this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill will provide a deterrent for cartel price fixing, through abuse of the dominant position and other anti-competitive practices.  I am astounded that since 2002 there have been only 32 criminal convictions for price fixing.  These high profile cases were in the home heating oil business and car dealerships in Leinster.  The victims of price fixing are the ordinary people of Ireland, the people who are trying to heat their homes during a period of escalating oil prices or people who drive cars.  We need to take a tough approach.  I agree with Members on the other side of the House that we are not taking a tough enough approach.  I hope that when the Bill is passed, the Minister will keep the enacted legislation under constant review to ensure it remains fit for purpose as time goes by.  We have seen examples where competition works well, the airline industry is one example.  If it were not for Ryanair, we would still be required to pay what people regarded as a small mortgage to go to see their relatives in England.  The private bus operators were mentioned also and they operate very efficiently and effectively in County Galway.  Let me contrast that service with the dominant position, where there is no competition, of Irish Rail.  It costs twice or two and a half times as much to make any journey from Galway by train as it does by bus.  Senator Burke referred earlier to the situation in the health insurance market.  We must stamp out uncompetitive practices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Minister for the actions he has taken to date.    People who are indulging in uncompetitive practices and are in breach of the law will take heed that the Government is serious about stamping out such practices.  I implore the Minister not to leave this Bill as a finished product.  We need to keep this under constant review and continue to focus on where there are breaches and where we need to strengthen the legislation.  I commend the Minister for the work he has done to date.  He has honoured a commitment that was made in the programme for Government and, while it might fall short of what some people on the other side of the House are looking for, I have no doubt it will go a long way in addressing this major issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and his senior officials.  It is excellent that he has taken time out from his very busy schedule.  I realise how busy his schedule is because I was in that Department for a while.  Senators would say that having the Minister present is useful.  In fact, it is great to have him here to say a few words and listen to this excellent debate on competition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What I find regrettable is that we are being forced to introduce this Bill.  It surprises me that Ireland, as an independent State, did not have strong enough competition laws up to now, so that the troika had to insist on new legislation.  Nonetheless, we are introducing the required legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view on below-cost selling, which has been mentioned by many speakers.  The provisions in this regard were revoked by a previous Government.  The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, chaired by former Deputy Donie Cassidy, of which I was a member, came out strongly against revoking that legislation.  The motive behind it was to create more competition, which is reasonable, but there is no doubt that alcohol is being sold below cost in most supermarkets, to the extent that publicans in most small towns have to get their drink from the supermarket.  It is not really a practical proposition for a publican, who would buy wholesale, to buy it cheaper from Tesco, Dunnes, Aldi or Lidl.  I do not expect a response on this but I ask the Minister at least to examine the possibilities for dealing with it.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt in my mind that the cost of drink increases the consumption of alcohol, and not just among young people.  Drinking at home has become the norm, and sales of wine have become very high.  I have no objection whatsoever to any adult drinking &mdash; it can be very pleasant &mdash; but the Minister should consider the point that younger people have access to alcohol.  I know the Minister&rsquo;s colleague in Government has proposals in this area.</P>
        <P>Very low prices can undermine the viability of a service.  This happened on the Dublin-Galway bus route.  It is the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that licences the buses, but the prices were undermined so much that a company was nearly put out of business.  Competition is fine but, as Senator Norris said, it is not the most important thing, and it can result in people being deprived of a service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I carried out work in a previous Seanad which I called a name and shame campaign.  I went around and rang different places to find out the prices of diesel and petrol in various towns, and I found that different towns consistently had the same prices for diesel and petrol.  There was little competition, by accident or design.  It is hard to prove these things and hard to obtain prosecutions under competition law because these matters are conducted over the telephone, not at meetings.</P>
        <P>With regard to airline prices, large airlines such as Air France or Aer Lingus can be dominant in a certain market, such as flights to Paris.  Thanks to Michael O&rsquo;Leary and Ryanair there is competition to some extent, but not to the extent of having a comprehensive services such as those of the two major airlines.  I realise this is not the Minister&rsquo;s area, but competition does come under his remit.  He will find the prices are practically equal, and they go up at the same rate when demand increases.  I believe there is some sort of collaboration between those major airlines with regard to access to cities such as Dublin, London and Paris, and particularly the Paris route.  Michael O&rsquo;Leary deserves great credit, as he has revolutionised the whole airline industry.  There is no doubt about it.  We should be proud of his work.  The Government would be well advised to utilise his talents in some Department or in some other way, because he would be a breath of fresh air.  In fact, if someone would vacate his or her Seanad seat, I would recommend him strongly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I thank the Senators for a very good debate.  The original debate on this was probably in 1776, when Adam Smith published <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, in which he said it was to not the virtue of the butcher, the baker or the candlestick maker that we owed our dinner, but to the invisible hand of competition.  He also commented that business people never come together but to collude against the public interest.  He had a fairly jaundiced view of the way in which competition can be manipulated.  It may be 236 years later, but the debate here has also shown up the double standard that we sometimes apply on this subject.  Some Senators were calling for rigid enforcement of competition law and jail for those in breach, while others were saying they were not so sure free competition should be allowed with regard to planning laws or in the grocery trade.  When it came to below-cost selling, which is effectively State-enforced fixing of prices at a certain level, everyone was raising doubts.  The double standard that we apply in this debate is very real.  I take Senator Norris&rsquo;s point that we cannot set up competition law as the tin soldier that governs everything, but, to be fair to Senator Barrett, that tin soldier has been remarkably silent over the years in this country, and we have a lot of ground to make up.  This is a tricky area.  Senator Quinn put his finger on it: we all like competition when it does not visit our particular door, but when it is in an area in which we feel we are entitled to behave in a certain way, we are not so sure about the level of competition we want to see.  That is true in so many walks of life, and it is a challenge for those of us in public life who are trying to act as an arbiter between the different forces in our community.  That is what makes this an important debate.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the points made by Senator White, who wants to see civil fines but also wants to see people in jail, which would happen if these were criminal offences.  The difficulty with wanting these two things is that it undermines the case for civil laws.  As Senator Byrne said, a former Minister, Mary Harney, introduced criminal sanctions for breaches of competition law, but that implies that such behaviour is a criminal offence.  We cannot then slip in the back door and say we are going to apply a different standard of proof than in other criminal cases.  We cannot ride the two horses together.  That is the point the Attorney General has been making.</P>

	<P>Sorry; it is part of the excitement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the difficulty.  It was not just this Attorney General but the Attorney General who advised the Senator&rsquo;s party in Government who took this view.  We cannot decide that a certain behaviour is criminal and then say we are going to pursue it in a different way.  That is the ultimate difficulty with the case for civil fines.  Several people have quoted the EU and the IMF elements of the troika as suggesting that they are keen to see civil fines.  Their more recent submissions have acknowledged not only that civil fines are not possible but that they endorse what is contained in the Bill.  As we have developed the Bill we have included comments from the troika.</P>
        <P>Senators Clune and Barrett raised the wider issue of competition policy as opposed to competition law.  Both Senators credibly pointed to the fact that much of the anti-competitive provisions have to do with public policy rather than collusion or price-fixing or any other issue.  Rules govern behaviour in certain sectors whether transport or otherwise.  To take up a point made by Senator Leyden, we have not been too good at enforcing these changes.  The momentum for implementing the Competition Authority&rsquo;s recommendations only gathered when the EU and the IMF came along.  Reform in the legal and medical areas has gathered momentum and there are proposals in respect of the planning guidelines.  We are examining the waste sector now and the need to have better competition rules there.  There is still a mix of local authorities as both regulator and service provider at same time.  This completely breaches the principles of competition law.  We are mending our hand and it is more than a critique of our political system that our hand has been forced on this matter.  To be fair, the late former Deputy and Minister, Seamus Brennan, was probably the odd man out because he leaned against the consensus in this area.  However, he did not always get the greatest recognition for his efforts.</P>
        <P>Several people have highlighted the need for more investigation of sheltered sectors and the issue of the resources of the Competition Authority.  The recently published action plan for jobs includes an action for the Competition Authority identify areas in sheltered sectors of the economy where there are problems and to commission studies on them.  New recommendations will be produced.  While people rightly point out that there have not been many actions, in its recent annual report the Competition Authority commented on some of the investigations.  Seven active investigations into criminal breaches of competition law are under way.  Two of these include investigations into anti-competitive activities in the liquid milk markets and in the concrete and cement industries.  People have concerns in these areas and the Competition Authority is investigating them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Others raised the point that while it was well and good and a good feature of this legislation that on the back of injunctions or actions taken by the Competition Authority civil actions can be pursued without having to establish proof in one&rsquo;s case, this will open up the door to more civil cases being taken whereby people can get compensation for the damage done to them.  In a related matter, in many cases the Competition Authority settles before going the final step of prosecuting in the courts.  We are creating a situation whereby if there is an agreement or settlement outside the courts, breach of that is, of itself subject to prosecution not as a breach of the Competition Act but rather as a contempt of court.  This strengthens our ability and the ability of others to take follow-on actions in this territory.  These changes will make a difference.  I realise others, including Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, believe there should be a great deal more but they have failed to acknowledge the steps being taken in this legislation.  Fianna F&aacute;il Senators have called for the creation of simple offences.  Senator Byrne has called for this in particular.  However, if he wishes to come forward with proposals there will be other competition legislation shortly.</P>
        <P>I do not pretend to be an expert on this matter but in my experience it is not that the offence of price-fixing is complicated but rather, as Senator Terry Leyden suggested, it is difficult to prove collusion simply because prices are the same.  These are different things.  The act of collusion is the offence, not having the same price and a mere similarity of price does not constitute an offence.  People should come forward with proposals by all means.  We are developing a second competition Bill which will be before the House in due course and we are open to listening to suggestions.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke raised several issues, including the effects of competition law.  This is an area where the law is biting the tail of some people, in particular by preventing open negotiations on prices by an association of self-employed people.  It represents a breach of the rules to come together to negotiate on prices.  I understand that the former director of the Competition Authority came up with a formula by which certain negotiations could still proceed.  It has been possible to continue to hold negotiations in this area without breaching the principles of the Competition Act.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to hear Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s comments on the ethics between the generations and people&rsquo;s expectations about the role of price and resale price maintenance.  I remember when that became part of the legislation.  This underpins that there are two sides to these stories and we are trying to pick a way between them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will welcome Senator Reilly&rsquo;s amendments.  We can debate in more detail the issue of civil fines and the reason they have not been possible in Irish law.  They have not been possible in many other areas as well.  I understand that revenue is the only field in which civil fines have been deemed acceptable.  The Senator raised the issue of whether there should be a greater obligation to observe the recommendations of the Competition Authority.  I agree that should be an obligation to respond and this should be done in a timely manner.  However, as in the discussion on planning guidelines, people take other issues into account.  Senator Reilly also remarked on the difficulty of town centre locations being damaged by larger out-of-town malls and supermarkets.  Under the strict law of competition that is what should take place.  However, other public policy issues must be taken into account.  Senator Wilson commented on this issue as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Michael Mullins raised the issue of the lack of convictions.  I hope there will be more.  Senator Mary White argued that the low probability of being caught is a problem.  That is true.  It is difficult to take a successful prosecution in this field.  These are not easy cases to prove, of that there is no doubt.  However, it is simplistic to dismiss increasing the penalties as if this will make no difference.  Generally, when one is calculating the effectiveness of measures in this area one multiplies the probability by the penalty and the result represents the deterrent.  If we increase the penalty, even if we do not greatly improve the probability, we certainly increase the deterrent.  Therefore, there is a benefit to increasing the fines.  Their presence underpins the Senator&rsquo;s view and that of many others that we wish to see people in jail for these offences.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Leyden raised the issue of below-cost selling.  It was right to remove the ban because it was a restriction on competition.  When the State says something written on an invoice becomes the price that must be paid, it is like the resale price maintenance espoused by the grandfather of Senator Quinn.  I would not support reintroducing it on a general basis.  Alcohol is a different issue for a different public policy reason than competition.  Difficulties remain in enforcement because people produce different products at different cost levels.  A measure cannot interfere with the ability of people who can produce something more cheaply being able to take advantage of their superior competitive ability in the marketplace.  There will be tricky issues to be negotiated in putting that together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We will return to the civil issue on Committee Stage.  Senator Byrne held the former Minister, Mary Harneym up to criticism for introducing criminal sanctions based on European civil offences.  Ironically, many EU member states are looking to Ireland as an exemplar of introducing criminal sanctions in the competition area and regard it as something of a path breaker in how it has addressed the issue.  There are two views on that issue.</P>
        <P>I do not know who raised the issue of authorised officers from the Competition Authority attending the questioning of suspects.  It is being considered in the context of the second Bill.</P>
        <P>The debate was very good and showed the full range of views.  It is an area in which Ireland has been lax.  We need to create a culture of compliance.  This will not always involve penalties and fines.  Senator Leyden referred to naming and shaming when companies fail to play fair with consumers.  Such measures are just as important as the terms of criminal acts.</P>
        <P>We can create an environment in which people are much more conscious of the need to be competitive and fair, which does have barriers to entry and which does not assume that professions can regulate the numbers of people entering their codes or just because they are wonderful people should not know what prices are charged for services.  The notion of being able to see transparently what prices are charged for a service is an entitlement of any patron, whether one is a plumber or a barrister.  We need to create an expectation that the same rules prevail for everyone.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for the debate and look forward to Committee Stage to discuss some issues in greater detail.  There is no doubt that with the second competition Bill we will be able to address some of the other issues about which Senators are concerned.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, for coming to the House to take this matter.  As she will be aware, parents who have children with special needs are extremely anxious with regard to the reviews taking place in respect of domiciliary care allowance.  The current state of the nation has driven fear into the hearts of those who are dependent on the income they obtain in the form of this allowance, which assists them in caring for their children.  In 2011, 402 cases were reviewed and the allowance was cut in respect of 198 of these.  The Minister will appreciate that when parents receive a letter relating to the review, it is a cause of some concern.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Applications for domiciliary care allowance are reviewed without the medical assessors involved meeting the relevant children or their parents.  An assessment is based on the medical evidence submitted by a doctor and it does not take account of the additional care and attention parents must give their children on a daily basis.  Will the Minister indicate why medical reviews are required in respect of children with lifelong illnesses such as Down&rsquo;s syndrome, cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy, to name but a few, particularly as these conditions are not going to improve?  In the carer&rsquo;s allowance section, files are marked &ldquo;Not for medical review&rdquo;.  Perhaps this could also apply in respect of children who have lifelong illnesses and diseases and who are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.</P>
        <P>It is very disappointing to see so many children with autism being reassessed and being considered so improved that their needs are no greater than those of any other child.  I have met many parents with children who are autistic and my heart goes out to them.  I have great admiration for those parents because while their children may look perfect, their behaviour is not.  These parents have difficulty even finding people to mind their children because many babysitters do not want to take on the problem.  It is a vicious circle for the parents to whom I refer, who are obliged to fight the system at every turn in order to ensure the best care and education for their children.  They are again fighting the State and trying to get it to accept that their children require additional special care.</P>
        <P>I am sure the parents of children with autism would be absolutely delighted if their children&rsquo;s needs were not any greater than those of other children of the same age.  They would accept such a development any day in place of the domiciliary care allowance.  Unfortunately, that is not how things are for them.  Any child with autism, regardless of how mild it might be, needs extra care.  I have dealt with people whose appeals have been turned down and I am aware that if substantial medical evidence had been submitted at the outset, they would not have been obliged to undergo the appeals process.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to extend the review period for the domiciliary care allowance in order to give parents time to obtain proper medical evidence from consultants, psychologists, therapists or others who are responsible for continually monitoring their children&rsquo;s progress.  If this happened, medical assessors might not be so quick to discontinue people&rsquo;s allowances.  Each day the newspapers carry stories about parents who are suffering because their children, as a result of autism and other illnesses, are causing problems.  These people are being informed that their children do not require extra care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I request that the Minister exercise her good nature and review the position on the domiciliary care allowance.  At the very least she might consider extending the period in which medical evidence can be submitted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Moloney.  As the Senator pointed out, large numbers of people have lost their domiciliary care allowance this year.  It is difficult for the parents of children with special needs to complete and return a form which requires the provision of extremely detailed information in just 21 days.  Most of these parents&rsquo; days are taken up in caring for their children.  This is particularly the case if they have jobs and if they are also obliged to care for their other children.  The current timeframe within which people are expected to return the forms to which I refer is not adequate and, like Senator Moloney, I ask that the Minister consider extending it.</P>
        <P>Parents whose domiciliary care allowance has been cut in the past year have been left floundering.  I spoke to a number of people who lost the &euro;309 per month they received in the form of the allowance and discovered that their children cannot go swimming or access some of the services previously available to them.  As Senator Moloney pointed out, many of the conditions with which the children in question are suffering will never improve.  It can be extremely upsetting for parents if they and their children are obliged to undergo the trauma of the review process and if they then have their allowances discontinued.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I welcome the comments made by Senators Moloney and Moran in respect of this important issue.  In the first instance I understand the concerns that parents and guardians have been expressing in recent months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Domiciliary care allowance is paid to over 24,000 parents and guardians in respect of 26,000 children.  The approximate cost in this regard in 2011 was &euro;100 million, with the accompanying respite care grant costing a further &euro;45 million.  As the Senators will be aware, some parents are also in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance in respect of their children.  In addition, the Department makes an extensive range of payments to support families with children.  In 2011, some &euro;2.08 billion was paid out in the form of child benefit in respect of 1.13 million children.  Qualified child increases were also paid to people on social welfare payments in respect of some 495,000 children.</P>
        <P>Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment to the parent or guardian of a child with a disability so severe that he or she requires care and attention and-or supervision substantially in excess of that which would be given to another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be provided to allow the child to deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.  Domiciliary care allowance cases are routinely reviewed to ensure that the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.  Cases are reviewed based on either, one, a scheduled review based on the recommendation of the medical assessor when the claim is initially processed &mdash; I emphasise that assessments in respect of domiciliary care allowance are medically based on the advice available from the child&rsquo;s and parents&rsquo; medical doctors and experts and on the medical experts in the Department of Social Protection who then review medical evidence that has been put forward &mdash; or, two, on the basis of information received about a change of circumstances which potentially affects the continued entitlement of a case already in payment.</P>
        <P>Scheduled reviews, on the recommendation of the medical assessor, are based on the prognosis of the child&rsquo;s disability and how his or her condition may improve over time.  The review interval will vary from 12 months in cases where the child&rsquo;s disability is likely to improve significantly in the short term to a five or ten-year review date if the child&rsquo;s condition is likely to remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.  In circumstances where a child has a lifelong disability that is unlikely to improve by any significant degree, a &ldquo;do not review again&rdquo; status may be used.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Domiciliary care allowance reviews are initiated with the parent-guardian being asked to complete a &ldquo;review of medical criteria form&rdquo;, which I want to emphasise, which also requires medical input from the child&rsquo;s GP.   The parent returns this form together with any additional recent reports of ongoing medical or therapeutic services the child may be receiving.  This information is then sent for review by one of the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors who will provide an opinion to the deciding officer on whether the child still meets the medical criteria for receipt of the payment.  The decision of the deciding officer is communicated to the customer in writing and he or she is given the option to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.  Any new or additional information received after the issue of the revised decision and before the appeal is heard is further assessed by a medical assessor.  In this way the review process affords parents-guardians every opportunity to provide additional information and to have this information assessed at an early stage with payment restored, where necessary, in advance of an appeal hearing.</P>
        
        <P>I very much welcome this topic being raised.  I have heard the concerns of parents and guardians in recent months regarding the domiciliary care allowance review process.  Up to now 21 days has been allowed for the return of the completed review form and supporting documentation, with flexibility allowed where some additional time is needed to obtain specific reports.  However, following a review of the 21-day timescale, it has been decided to extend this to 60 days and also to inform the parents-guardians when their payment is initially awarded of the review date that will apply to their child&rsquo;s case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is very important that parents understand and that they are communicated with as early as possible about conditionality, reviews and so on.  This will I hope address the concerns of parents and guardians regarding the timeframe allowed and will provide them with additional time to gather supporting documentation or medical reports they may wish to submit in advance of the review date.</P>
        <P>In addition to this, the Department will now write to claimants two to three months in advance of the formal review date and then give them 60 days in which to submit relevant additional information.  That should provide for a much better system of communication and knowledge for the parents of the process.  At present when domiciliary care allowance is being awarded, there is no indication given as to when the claim will be reviewed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department took over the domiciliary care allowance from the HSE in 2009.  Like many issues in the Department of Social Protection, there is a huge changeover taking place in the system.  From now on, the Department will include a line in the awarding letter that the claim will be reviewed in, say, two, three or five years time and that the Department will be in touch closer to that time regarding information that will be required.</P>
        
        <P>I hope that parents and guardians can be assured that the Department is committed to ensuring that those children who meet the conditions for the scheme will continue to receive the payment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  It is welcome news that she is willing to extend the timeframe for the return of the review form by up to 60 days.  I know from working with people that it takes quite a while to get a letter from a consultant.  If one contacts a consultant&rsquo;s secretary it can take that length of time to get the required letter.</P>
        <P>Under the appeals process, can people go for a  physical medical examination and meet the medical referee, as applies in the case of disability appeals in the Department?  I am not aware of anyone who was granted such a medical.  It would do no harm for the medical assessors to meet the child and his or her parents and listen to what they have to say because sometimes what is noted on paper does not give a true reading of what is happening.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that children with autism are being severely hit in this respect.  I hope that the medical assessors in the Minister&rsquo;s Department will take on board how difficult it is for parents to cope with a child with autism, regardless of how mild or severe it is.  I hope the Minister will revert to the medical assessors on the points we have raised on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the suggestion by some of the advocacy groups that children with autism have a lower rate of success than children with other disabilities, this is not the case.  I am aware there may be such a perception among some of the advocacy groups that children with mild intellectual disabilities are unfairly assessed in the domiciliary allowance care process and that they are more likely to have their claim disallowed.  The statistics indicate that this is not true.  Overall the success rate for claims relating to intellectual versus physical disability is very similar.</P>
        <P>I stress that eligibility for the allowance is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.  In addition, the person claiming allowance for the child must be providing for the care of the child and must be considered habitually resident in the State.  Overall approximately 46% of all claims are awarded the allowance and the success rate does not vary to any significant degree between claims relating to an intellectual or physical disability.</P>
        <P>I have heard the suggestion made by some individuals that the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors should carry out the assessment personally in regard to the child.  People would need to think long and hard about that.  There would need to be consultation with the groups.  I remind Members that responsibility for disability payments was transferred from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection because it was seen very much as an income support.  The number of people who have been awarded disability invalidity and children&rsquo;s domiciliary care allowance has grown very significantly since responsibility for those payments were transferred.</P>
        <P>If the Senator is suggesting that rather than the child&rsquo;s medical advisers, medical attendants, consultants and other advisers presenting the reports on the child who is their patient, all that work would be, as it were, done again by the Department, she would be probably be suggesting a model where one would go back to the HSE because the Department would not be resourced to do that.  The Senator is talking about a very profound change.     One presumes children as well would be more comfortable with their own medical experts, their own GP, and the various experts who work with the child and who then make a professional report.  The Department has a stakeholders group involving disability organisations and parents of children with a disability.  The subject would need to be given extremely detailed consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might have misunderstood me.  I said that the medical assessor could meet the children during the appeal process.  The claim would not have been turned down and the case would not be appealed if all of the forms submitted by psychologists, consultants and GPs were considered good enough.  I meant that the medical assessor would meet with the child during the appeal process, not during the application process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a brief observation.  Many defective applications are being made to the Department, through no fault of the applicants.  They just do not know the criteria the Minister has set out and the complications of the system.  The Minister indicated that it is not a medical test for the domiciliary care allowance in full, it is a functional one.  That is a problem across Departments.  Most people that have come to my office who have been refused the allowance have defective applications.  There is no way they would have got approval even though they deserve it because of what is contained in the form.  I do not know that can be done about that because it is a resource issue.  Education for Members initially on the various benefits and the criteria for them would be a help.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We must move to a model which emphasises the delivery of services because that is where the gap is, as so many parents require specialist services which is what they have difficulty in accessing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il I welcome what the Minister outlined today.  I must refer to the Slane bypass, another issue of life and death.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  She is a most respected Minister.  However, while I respect her I would prefer to see her constituency colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, DeputyVaradkar.  He is obviously not available.  That is no disrespect to the Minister, Deputy Burton.  I am disappointed that he is not present because he said this morning on the radio that he is not prepared to meet residents in Slane either.</P>
        <P>We all know what happened yesterday.  Following on from the decision on the children&rsquo;s hospital, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has turned down an application by the State to build a bypass of Slane in County Meath.  It has generally been agreed by people in the area, their elected representatives and successive Governments, that a bypass is required as an urgent matter of health and safety, life and death for the people of Slane village.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, An Bord Plean&aacute;la turned down the application on a number of grounds.  I urge the Minister, the National Roads Authority, NRA, and Meath County Council to at the very least obtain legal advice on the pursuance of a judicial review into the decision.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has taken over the role of the Minister and the NRA on roads policy in terms of deciding whether a road is needed.  It has taken into account aspects of the county development plan on Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne while ignoring specific objectives of said plan on the bypass of Slane.  It allowed a bridge &mdash; a Senator suggested it should be the Mary McAleese bridge &mdash; to run right through the Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne site over where the battle of the Boyne took place and there was not a word about that, but now when health and safety is an issue at Slane, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has seen things differently.</P>
        <P>It does not give confidence in the planning process when public projects are turned down while other private projects and various atrocities over the years have been approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I urge the Minister to at least consider that.  It is important that he does.  He referred to a 90-day, three-month consultation period between the NRA and the various parties.  If he waits three months it will be too late for a judicial review due to the tight timelines.</P>
        <P>A number of other measures must be implemented as a matter of severe urgency.  I call on the Minister to contact the Garda Commissioner about traffic in Slane.  Last night on the news at 9 p.m. one could see lorry after lorry clearly breaching the speed limit in the village of Slane.  It was outrageous to see that on television; multiple lorries breaching the speed limit and making a mockery of the 30 km/h speed limit that had been put in place in Slane to protect the safety and lives of people.  I urge the Garda to take the issue seriously and to install speed cameras.  I urge the Government to use whatever powers of persuasion it has over the Garda to ask it to prioritise enforcement.  I also call for the introduction of measures from funds at the Minister&rsquo;s disposal to further alleviate traffic in Slane.  The Minister must not waste the momentum and the money that has been spent in recent years on the planning application by simply abandoning the project.  I am concerned by today&rsquo;s comments from the NRA that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has suggested a bypass might never be built.  The NRA is correct in its interpretation but it added that we must accept the decision.  I do not accept the decision.  The Government must consider a judicial review in this case.  I ask the Minister to at the very least consider it within the time limits that apply.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all behaving because the Senator is Acting Chairman.  I thank Senator Byrne for giving me with the opportunity to explain the circumstances surrounding the recent decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the proposal to bypass Slane village.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, who regrets that he is unable to attend.  He asked me to express his regrets to Senator Byrne.</P>
        <P>I understand the extreme disappointment of residents from the Slane area because of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision.  I acknowledge that the current situation is dangerous and that there is heavy congestion.  I know the road and the area well and at times it is terrifying.  This scheme was intended to divert traffic away from Slane&rsquo;s original stone bridge and the steep approaches to it from both sides, which has been a factor in a number of road traffic accidents.  In particular, there are road safety concerns about the use of this route by heavy goods vehicles.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for overall policy and funding on the national roads programme.  The planning and design of individual national primary and secondary roads is a statutory function of the NRA under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007.  The NRA works closely with the local authority in whose administrative area the road is to be constructed, in this case Meath County Council.</P>
        <P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused the scheme on a number of grounds, including that it was not satisfied that the alternatives to the bypass were properly considered, given that the bypass would be near Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne &mdash; a UNESCO world heritage site.  In particular, it did not believe that a HGV ban in Slane was adequately considered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has asked the NRA, in conjunction with Meath County Council and the relevant stakeholders, to examine the detail of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision and how to respond to it.  As the decision was only released by An Bord Plean&aacute;la yesterday, it will take time for a detailed considered response to emerge from either organisation.  The Minister has requested this is to be done within 90 days.  However, it is not a case of selecting a new route at this stage.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la did not reject the route chosen or suggest that another route would have received permission, instead the priority is to address the traffic safety concerns in Slane.  Returning to An Bord Plean&aacute;la would only be possible if it could be clearly shown that traffic management in Slane was not possible and there was no alternative to the bypass.</P>
        
        <P>A ban on HGV&rsquo;s through Slane is an issue for Meath County Council to address.  Much work has been carried out on safety upgrades and traffic calming on the approaches to the bridge and, thankfully, traffic accidents have significantly reduced.  Everyone who uses the route is aware of the issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Minister described the road as &ldquo;terrifying&rdquo;, which is the case.  It is gratifying that this has been acknowledged.  Everyone knows that.  I am astounded by the volume of comments on my Facebook page in recent days.  People referred to their fear on the road and how they must constantly look through the rear-view mirror.  I wondered why I did not experience that myself.  The reason is because I avoid the road as much as possible.  I use alternative routes if I can avoid the road.  I hardly ever drive down the hill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am disappointed at the response.  It appears that the NRA and the Minister are putting up their hands and accepting the defeat.  If the shoe were on the other foot and the road were approved, one could bet one&rsquo;s life that the objectors would go straight down to the High Court.  In looking for a response from the council and the NRA within 90 days, the Minister is, in effect, ruling out a High Court challenge because there is an eight week time limit on planning cases.  That is most unfortunate.  I urge the Minister to reconsider.  At the very least he should consider going to the High Court.  I do not say we should drop everything and run down there now but at least get the legal advice and do it within the time because there are serious issues with this judgment and if I were a Minister I would not want An Bord Plean&aacute;la deciding roads policy.  That is not its function.  The function of the board is planning and it has raised some planning issues, but it has also raised issues to do with roads policy in stating that a bypass should not be built unless all of the alternative options are examined.  As someone said, a precedent appears to have been set in this regard in that if a tolled road is located parallel to a village it will not get approval for a bypass from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That is not a planning matter.  It is a matter for democratic decision making.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">I am trying to highlight to the Garda the necessity for enforcement in this regard and would like the National Roads Authority to do that also.  We will keep up the pressure from this side of the House.  Everybody is agreed on the need for this bypass.  I accept the Minister will issue a response soon but I would like to see even more urgency on this issue.</P>
