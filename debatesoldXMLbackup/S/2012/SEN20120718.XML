	<P>I have received notice from Senator David Cullinane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss the post-primary transport scheme and the difficulties being experienced by students in Dunmore East and Portlaw in County Waterford, as large volumes of students have had applications to the scheme refused as they have been deemed not to be attending their nearest education centre.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Colm Burke of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to outline if it is proposed to provide sufficient funding to the Life Centre in Winter&rsquo;s Hill, Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Whelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to clarify the new arrangements pertaining to the school transport scheme currently being implemented for new applicants which will come into effect from September and to ensure that there is a fair and easily-accessible appeals process which will take into account existing and historical school enrolments by families throughout rural Ireland, as the scheme as currently being implemented is leading to an unforeseen level of hardship and dividing siblings attending primary schools.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Thomas Byrne of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to outline the steps to be taken by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to protect and secure the Adtech factory in Baile Ghib, County Meath and find replacement jobs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to clarify that the future of the Malin Head Coast Guard station is secure, in light of the Fisher report recommendations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Cullinane, Burke, Whelan and Byrne and their matters will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on developments in the European Union and Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Council from January to June 2013, to be taken at 12 p.m. and to conclude no later than 1.30 p.m., with the contribution of group spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes, which can be shared, the contribution from one Sinn F&eacute;in Senator not to exceed three minutes and the Taoiseach to be called on to reply no later than 1.25 p.m.; No. 2, the Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 1.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 3.30 p.m.; No. 3, European Arrest Warrant (Application to Third Countries and Amendment) and Extradition (Amendment) Bill 2012 &mdash; Committee and remaining Stages to be taken at 3.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 4.30 p.m.; and No. 22, motion No. 10, Private Members&rsquo; business, to be taken at 4.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Today the long-awaited report on pyrite will be made public, which I welcome.  I have not seen the report yet but I thank the Leader of the House for continually following up on the issue.  The House will see on tomorrow&rsquo;s Order Paper that I published a Bill which is designed to extend the Statute of Limitations for individuals who are in difficulty because of pyrite.  I will move that Bill in September, subject to seeing what is contained in the report.  Perhaps a recommendation for such an extension is already there.  I ask the Leader to ensure in early September, when the House reconvenes, that sufficient time is set aside to examine the report and its recommendations.  As I have stated in this House before, over 70,000 households, predominantly in Dublin and on the east coast of the country, are affected.  I would be grateful if the Leader could organise a debate for the new session.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I tabled an amendment to the Order of Business.  I am not proposing to table any amendments today because the Taoiseach is expected in the House at 12 noon and not because of Senator Zappone&rsquo;s little slap yesterday.</P>

	<P>The HSE overspend currently stands at &euro;281 million and I note today that its chief executive is stepping down.  I would like to know why that is the case.  Was he requested to do so by the Government or did Mr. Magee feel that he could not continue to serve in the HSE?  I believe all Members are concerned that we have had a &euro;281 million overspend in five months, which is projected to be more than half a billion by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Tomorrow, on the last sitting day of the House this session, we will be taking Second Stage of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is six or seven months late.  The Government has already projected savings on the HSE budget on the basis of reductions in the price of medical supplies.  When will these savings be implemented?  Yesterday I pointed out that nearly 40% of the beds in Thurles community hospital are being closed because the Minister for Health and his Department are not managing the health budget.  It has already been proven that they are not up to the job.  What is the timeframe for the passing of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 and when does the Government intend to make savings in this area?  Will we have to wait until next year?  I ask the Leader to clarify with the Minister for Health that he made a promise on 9 November 2011 to the community group from Thurles that the beds would be reopened in January 2012 and to confirm whether he made the promise in front of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Alan Kelly, and other Deputies from the constituency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in our next session on reform of the structure of the courts following from the Cabinet announcement yesterday in this regard.  Reform of the courts is long overdue.  The Courts Service pointed out in its annual report that 500 cases are now being heard by the Supreme Court annually, which is beyond the court&rsquo;s capacity.  Some 18% of those cases involve lay litigants, who take up particular time, and it is clear that a court of appeal is needed.  We should debate the issue in this House, however, because the proposal agreed by the Cabinet was for a court of civil appeal.  It is equally, if not more, pressing that we establish a permanently constituted court of criminal appeal.  Such a court was envisaged in legislation as far back as 1995 but has not yet been established.  As a result concerns have arisen about inconsistencies in appeal court judgments and these are contributing to a lengthy case list and delays in the Supreme Court.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that the Minister for Justice and Equality has also proposed to change the nature of the judicial oath to enable individuals to make secular declarations as well as religious oaths.  We should also consider changing the presidential oath to allow incumbents the choice of making a secular declaration if they so wish.  A number of interesting and positive recommendations have been tabled and it would be worthwhile to debate them in this House before we see the shape of the referendum so that we can influence the changes.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on prisons in the next session, including in particular the report on penal reform which the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will publish by the end of the year.  We paid a stimulating and informative visit to Wheatfield Prison yesterday, where we heard about the Samaritans listener service.  This is an innovative suicide and self-harm prevention programme run within the prison community.  I pay tribute to the prisoners trained as peer listeners who provide an important service in almost half of the State&rsquo;s prisons.  We should support the roll-out of the service by the Samaritans across other prisons.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who was with us on the visit, was very supportive of the service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik referred to the proposals for constitutional change, many of which I support.  There has also been considerable discussion of the constitutional convention.  However, we seem to have forgotten the need for a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  I thank the large number of my colleagues who attended the briefing this morning by the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance on why we need an amendment to strengthen children&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution, which I organised.  The Kilkenny incest report of 1993 and all the subsequent reports elicited phrases such as horror and shock but they also signposted the need to strengthen children&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution.  Without a constitutional framework it will not be possible to make consistent judgments to uphold the best interests of children, hear their voices and treat them equally.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to come before the House without delay.  The clock is ticking.  It is easy to say it will be done in the autumn but referendums take time to prepare.  This is a referendum which has received all-party support but in order to maintain that support the Minister needs to show us her plans for the referendum, including the precise timeline, so that we can coalesce around it.</P>
        <P>A particular issue arises for the approximately 2,000 children in long-term foster care who are not eligible for adoption at present because of the Constitution.  When these children turn 18 and blow out their birthday candles, they blow out any right to be adopted.  We can speak about theory and waiting to deal with a complex issue but children&rsquo;s lives are directly affected.  It is a call to action and I ask the Minister to discuss it in this House.  Over the past five years we have held five referendums.  I fear that all the talk of new referendums will mean that children are once again being told to sit in the corner and wait their turn.  That is no longer acceptable.  On several occasions in recent months I have called for the Minister to come to the House  to deal with a variety of issues.  However, I put this issue at the top of my list and I ask that a date be arranged for a debate on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Justice and Equality on a proposed referendum on the structure of the courts.  It would be excellent if a debate was arranged in this House on what is being proposed.  Some of the constitutional changes would be very welcome and I also welcome the despatch with which the Minister has proceeded on the recommendation of the Chief Justice only a few weeks ago regarding a referendum to establish a court of appeal.  I agree with Senator Bacik on the provision of choice in making a judicial oath.  This is one of the areas in which it is legitimate to speak about choice.  I would support such a change, as I would in respect of the presidential oath.</P>
        <P>I am concerned, however, about the suggestion that the Supreme Court could be put in the position whereby it may reject a referral from the President.  The power to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court to determine its constitutionality is one of the two absolutely discretionary powers vested in the President.  It is not something that Presidents do lightly.  They do not often refer Bills and when they do so they make the decision only after consulting the Council of State.  It is somewhat insulting to the institution of the President and the deliberative approach we expect to be taken in these matters to suggest that the Supreme Court could reject such a solemn exercise of its functions by saying there is no basis for the referral.  That is not something which should be in the Supreme Court&rsquo;s power.  We must take the Office of the President, the Council of State and the consultative process seriously and if a President deems that an issue arises in respect of a Bill and wants to refers it to Supreme Court either to put the public&rsquo;s mind at ease or to clarify genuine doubts about the direction that the Oireachtas has taken it is entirely appropriate that he or she should have that discretion.  The Supreme Court should act accordingly and that should be the end of the matter.  I do not understand why it is suggested that the Supreme Court should be put in the position of rejecting such referrals.</P>
        <P><i>The Irish Times</i> does not go so far as to say so but it portrays the constitutional convention as a bit of a joke.  While I will co-operate with the convention and I welcome the element of public consultation involved, it is not realistic to expect a serious and considered analysis of important aspects of the Constitution in the framework established for it.  We now see that the Government is not serious about it because it is proceeding with the separate task of proposing constitutional changes.  Some of those constitutional changes involve the Executive arrogating too much power to itself.  That is another day&rsquo;s debate, however.  One certainly sees the lack of seriousness with which the Government regards the constitutional convention, which is a pity in hindsight.  I hope there will be time to have a debate on the convention before we reconvene in September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of Senators indicated yesterday but did not get to contribute, so I am taking them first this morning.  I now call Senator Keane.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the previous Senator who spoke about the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights, everybody in the House has mentioned that subject.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has made a commitment that the referendum will be held as a stand-alone one.  She also said that political parties and other interested groups will be consulted.  It takes time to get the wording right, but the commitment is definitely there for the autumn.  Knowing the Minister, I know that I will not have to eat my words because she has said it repeatedly.  She has made it her priority since taking office.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to raise again the issue of the junior pilots&rsquo; training college in Waterford, the PTC, which has folded.  I wish to welcome two of the trainee pilots concerned who are in the Visitors Gallery.  There is a picket outside Leinster House today and they are seeking a meeting with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  I understand he is abroad but I ask the Leader to arrange a meeting between the Minister and the pilots with the Irish Aviation Authority also.  The authority has overall power in this matter, so it is important that both the Minister and the IAA should meet the students.  It is the least they deserve after putting so much money into the course.  Some people are &euro;80,000 out of pocket having taken out loans.</P>
        <P>I understand that some of the students were advised by the IAA to continue their studies in Florida.  Now, however, the IAA has said the expiry date for getting flights refunded is 31 July.  Therefore those who were advised by the IAA to stay on and continue their course may not have their flights refunded.  I want to ensure that all those students get their flights refunded and get their education costs reimbursed or else continue the course with some other college.</P>
        <P>Pilot training is so important because we put our lives in their hands when travelling by air.  The same applies to doctors.  Look at all the money we put into training medical students.  These student pilots are not seeking hand-outs, they want a leg up but have been denied it.  Perhaps the Leader could meet the two pilot representatives here later if he has anything to tell them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>As I was travelling up on the M9 yesterday, I had an opportunity to listen to the radio.  The first thing that came to mind was the beautiful highway which has added significantly to the competitiveness of our economy.  It is a tribute to the vision which was invested in road infrastructure, particularly over the last 15, 16 or 17 years.  Part of the news bulletin identified the &euro;2.25 billion capital injection which the Government is now undertaking.  It struck me that in the last budget, of which I was very critical, the soft option of removing &euro;750 million from the capital programme, in addition to what the previous Government had already set out in the four-year programme, was a significant factor in reducing investment and competitiveness, as well as failing to create jobs in the short term.</P>
        <P>I welcome what is being done, although the timeframe is too long.  We will still be down hundreds of millions in investment in infrastructure this year and in 2013 and 2014, due to the decision to cut capital expenditure in the last budget.  It is important for reality to bite home in that regard.</P>
        <P>The second issue I wish to refer to came up next on the radio.  It dealt with a report by Senator Marie-Louise O&rsquo;Donnell who has spent some days on the streets of our capital city, including O&rsquo;Connell Street and adjoining streets.  Her report was an appalling portrayal of lawlessness in the capital.  She spoke about drug abuse and drug pushing, and how they interfere with citizens.  She also talked about the level of drunkenness and the interference with tourists in the capital from whom property was stolen.  It begged the question as to what garda&iacute; are doing.  The management of garda&iacute; within the system must be held to account.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to attend the House for a debate on this matter.  There may well be a need for a municipal police force here.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator O&rsquo;Donnell for a very incisive report.  Nonetheless it was a very sad reflection on our capital city.  We should not tolerate this situation or allow it to continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, the time allocated for the Order of Business expired before I had an opportunity to contribute.  With your permission, a Chathaoirligh, I will return to a topic that Senator Whelan and others have raised, which is this country&rsquo;s policy on alcohol.  I support the proposals by the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, to address the unhealthy relationship we have with alcohol.</P>
        <P>Senator Barrett raised an interesting point yesterday in stating that in recent years, sales of alcohol have decreased and presumably alcohol consumption along with that.  Yet alcohol remains associated with a range of social ills, including suicide, according to the report that was published earlier this week.  We have also seen alcohol linked to street violence, public disorder, anti-social behaviour, domestic abuse and a range of other issues.  The element of the debate that Senator Barrett raised points to the complexities and nuances which a debate on alcohol misuse presents to us as a society.  I therefore call on the Leader to consider arranging an urgent debate when we come back in September to discuss this matter in all its complexity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I rise again to ask the Leader to make time available, today if possible, for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, to attend the House for a debate on the trainee pilot debacle.  We must address the issues that have confronted these students who would prefer to be doing their pilot training in Florida or elsewhere rather than picketing Leinster House today with their families.  It is a disgrace.  Has the Minister discussed the matter with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, if so, has he considered bringing in the fraud squad?  I have heard from reliable sources that a month before the situation became impossible in Florida, and when the Florida Institute of Technology called off the training programme because it was owed over $1.5 million, sums of money were accepted by the company concerned.  Where is the corporate governance involved here?</P>
        <P>As the Leader said yesterday, the Minister did respond to me but his response was like a Cesc F&agrave;bregas pass &mdash; the ball went a long way.  I raised 15 questions and with all due respect, most of the Minister&rsquo;s response was to defend the role of Enterprise Ireland.  I have no problem with its role but the stark reality is that when I raised this matter twice last week and called for a vote, my colleagues on the Government benches decided to obey the Whip and vote down my proposals for an emergency debate.</P>
        <P>These young people want to complete their training at no extra cost to them or their families.  I am deeply concerned that there has been deception and fraudulent conversion of money that was paid over in good faith in recent months.  The IAA should have known there were problems and even if it did, its light-touch regulation let it down and not for the first time.  The Taoiseach is attending the House later today but I am appealing for a debate on the trainee pilot situation.  I am therefore proposing, for the third time, an amendment to the Order of Business to invite the Minister, Deputy Varadkar &mdash; or if he is not available then another senior Minister, perhaps the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn &mdash; to explain what has gone wrong.</P>
        <P>It is a shameful state of affairs that our own students have been forced to picket Leinster House having lost substantial sums of money.  It is a disgrace and is a shame on our heads.  We should have an emergency debate on it today.  I have been seeking this for almost three weeks and have been given the push-off or the long pass like Cesc F&agrave;bregas, the great Spanish midfielder.  I have been getting no answers but these students deserve answers today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to examine the plight of workers in some call centres.  We have made great play of attracting foreign direct investment and creating employment in call centres.  However, the stark reality is that some employees are being very badly treated.  The health and safety guidelines that pertain to employees in call centres are not being implemented.  People are being denied the basic right to use the toilet during their working time.  They are being confined to their desks for periods of time that are considerably longer than those specified in the guidelines.  People in many call centres are suffering from back strain, repetitive strain injury, stress, etc.  Workers in this area have a basic right to be treated properly, and the health and safety guidelines should be adhered to.  I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, examine the guidelines set out in this area which pertain to office work in general and not specifically to call centres which is the big problem.  Having examined them, he should replace them with guidelines that reflect the type of working conditions experienced by these people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>This week Social Justice Ireland published figures indicating that budget 2012 imposed the greatest income reduction on people who already had the lowest incomes.  The poorest households experienced a reduction of 2% to 2.5%, while the wealthiest lost less than 1%.  Regressive indirect taxes such as the increase in VAT, against which I argued in this House, along with cuts in welfare supports have disproportionately impacted the people who could bear it least.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Later today I look forward to welcoming the Taoiseach to the Chamber, as I know all of us do, and debating EU matters with him.  One of the issues I wish to raise with him is Europe 2020, the European Commission&rsquo;s growth strategy.  Many Members will be aware that one of the main objectives of the strategy is to reduce the number people living in poverty in Europe by 20 million by 2020.  The Commission&rsquo;s social protection committee has highlighted that this poverty reduction target is not on track.  The European Anti-Poverty Network stated this week that current approaches to economic governance are undermining this strategy.  The Government here has recently revised downwards its poverty-target commitments under the programme.  A change of approach is needed at EU and national level.  We have had seven years of fiscal adjustment in successive budgets in which choices were made.  Different choices within the confines of the fiscal discipline with which we are faced could have better protected those who are at most risk of poverty.  Inclusive growth not only encourages employment, but also aims to achieve social cohesion, a phrase we have not heard often enough recently.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Finance to the House for a debate in the autumn on the Government&rsquo;s anti-poverty measures and targets in the run-up to Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency and also budget 2013.</P>

	<P>While I know I said it last week, I again offer my sympathy to the trainee pilots who have been landed in a dreadful situation through no fault of their own.  Last night I spoke to the mother of one of the trainee pilots affected.  She related to me harrowing tales of the sacrifices they had made for their children in terms of money, investments, remortgaging the house, etc.  They will demonstrate outside the gates of Leinster House today and on a cross-party basis we should support them.</P>

Last week, it was reported that there were 190 deaths by suicide in County Cork between September 2008 and March 2011.  I refer to just one aspect of the report which could be echoed throughout the country.  It discovered that in the year before their death more than 80% of the people studied had been in contact with their GP and the majority had contacted their GP four or more times in the year before their death.  This highlights a major issue that needs to be investigated.  This disturbing statistic demonstrates the need for more awareness among GPs and health officials to recognise the signs that people may be in danger of showing suicide tendencies.  I welcome the initiative by the National Office for Suicide Prevention, which is in the process of implementing training for GPs.  However, people who are known to suffer from depression or who have attempted suicide should have greater access to aftercare.  I recently spoke to a person who spent 11 weeks under the care of a consultant who then discharged him into the care of a registrar on leaving hospital with no follow-up treatment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMoran"><NameTxt>Senator Mary Moran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to my question.  I am concerned that people who suffer from depression may not seek the care or have the confidence to seek the care they need and bring up the subject with their GP.  Greater training in the skills of recognising the signs of depression could go a long way towards saving the lives of vulnerable people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to pass on to the Minister for Education and Skills my congratulations on the decision to develop the Grangegorman site for the Dublin Institute of Technology.  It is important that this important educational institution should be brought together and concentrated on a very fine campus on which there is room for expansion.  That decision has certain implications.  A number of the buildings are out of date and not in good condition.  However, at least one is a significant building, which is the school of catering in Cathal Brugha Street.  It is one of three extraordinarily fine art deco buildings in Dublin and I hope it will be preserved as has the former Gas Company headquarters, which is now the school of nursing for Trinity College, and the building housing the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation across the road from this building, which is a superb building.  We have three very fine art deco buildings and I hope the third one will be preserved following the move.</P>
        <P>There is another implication.  Regrettably, but I suppose understandably, the Minister for Health has again had to postpone a decision on the site of the new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  This is a very urgent issue.  I regret that both Houses will have risen when this decision will be announced.  I have been lobbied by a number of groups, all of which present good cases for particular sites.  There is a suggestion that the Mater hospital site is still in play.  If this is the one that is chosen, taking that in conjunction with Grangegorman, it will mean considerable location of new developments on the north side of the city, which will have implication for possible reconsideration of the metro project given that the Government has committed itself to capital projects in so far as it is able to get the finance.  Finance is &mdash; or at least was &mdash; partially available through the European Union and at one stage the Japanese Mitsui Corporation was lined up to take a considerable amount of that charge.  If in addition to these two projects we could get more people back to work on this project, it would be very welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome yesterday&rsquo;s Cabinet approval for the proposals of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on the reorganising of the court structure and in particular the provision of a court of civil appeal and a unified family court system which should make the process less costly and bureaucratic for families in dispute.  There was reference to the power of the President to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court and the possibility that the need for EU treaty referendums could be avoided.  There is obviously considerable room for manoeuvre in this regard.  This matter could lead to a useful debate and I recommend the Leader provides for that debate early in the new session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of the student pilots left stranded in Florida after their training was suspended.  A number of issues in this regard need to be discussed, including the Irish Aviation Authority and the light touch regulation mentioned earlier, the company involved in pilot training and its funding.  There is also an issue with regard to the fact that Enterprise Ireland has invested significant amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money in the company.  There is no issue with regard to investing, but the problem is that now that the company has gone belly-up and the pilots have been left stranded, there is an added responsibility on the State to ensure that the pilots get proper compensation and are permitted to finish their courses, which is most important.  I support the call for a debate on this issue.  It would be wrong for these Houses to rise for the summer recess without any debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>The immediate and most pressing issue concerns what practical supports can be given to the trainee pilots over the coming weeks and months.  It will be too late if we return in September for a discussion on this issue.  It must be dealt with now as it is an urgent priority.  The pressing priority for the trainee pilots is that they be permitted to finish their courses.  I welcome the fact that the Irish Aviation Authority has offered to pay for flights home for them, but with the caveats already mentioned by Senator Keane.  These pilots simply want to finish their courses and that is the issue that needs to be resolved.  It is there that the main responsibility of the State lies.  There are also wider issues concerning the regulation of this area, the light touch regulation and issues such as the financing of the company.  These issues need to be addressed in the medium to long term, but the short-term priority for the Government must be to do what it can to support the trainee pilots and ensure they can finish their courses.  I ask for a debate on this in the next number of days, before the recess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, share the concerns of Senators O&rsquo;Donovan, Keane and Cullinane with regard to the trainee pilots.  I would like to welcome to the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery two young neighbours of mine from Laois who are caught up in this debacle, Cathal Simpson from Stradbally and Mark Ryan from Portlaoise.  There is no point in playing games or politics here or in pretending that having a debate here and dragging the Minister to the House will help anybody.  There is no need for a debate.  There is nothing to debate.  Everyone is agreed on what needs to be done.  We need the Minister to meet the families and the trainee pilots and to resolve the issue.  So, let us stop show-boating and let us stop pretending that by dragging him in here we are helping anyone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not show-boating.  Has the Minister agreed to a meeting?  Get a commitment from the Minister on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, there is nobody stranded in Florida.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>To give credit where it is due, the Irish Aviation Authority intervened this week and flew the last of the cadets home.  I have been told by the cadets they were well treated and that Aer Lingus could not have been more co-operative or courteous, and it is important to acknowledge that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>It did nothing for four weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The trainee pilots are seriously out of pocket and some of them are within touching distance, some by days or weeks, of completing their training.  This is the issue the Minister must tackle.  He has a responsibility in the matter because the Irish Aviation Authority endorsed the training college.  We have a responsibility to the students and that is the problem that needs to be resolved.  There is no point in pretending that anything else will help.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that the families and the trainee pilots have to be dragged up to Dublin today to protest in order to get justice and a fair response.  That is the situation and I ask the Leader to intervene and appeal to the Minister to meet the families on his return to the country to resolve this problem once and for all.  It is a manageable problem as there are only 40 trainee pilots affected.  Therefore, the cost would not be exorbitant or open-ended.  It is an issue that can be solved.  Where there is a will, there is a way.  Therefore, the Minister can do this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business.  It is an indictment of the way we do business and of the two Chambers of the Oireachtas that the young trainee pilots and their families find it necessary to come to the gates of parliament to highlight a plight not of their making.  These young people could just as easily have wallowed in the demoralisation which comes with recession and high unemployment, but instead they showed ambition, vision and courage to pursue a difficult career.  It is important that bureaucracy, demarcation of duties or responsibilities or passing the buck should not become an obstacle to these people receiving fair play and justice.  This should be a given for them.  These young people are role models for all the young people who find things difficult at this time.  I am thinking of the thousands of young people who have had to emigrate from Ireland.</P>
        <P>The families of the young trainee pilots have had to invest heavily in their training and have had to borrow to do so.  These families must be absolutely disillusioned and frustrated at this stage.  There have been some great contributions to the debate since it was initiated by Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan and I am delighted the issue is being kept alive.  The problem is that this issue will go below the radar very quickly and these families will have to go back and face what may be ruination.   Then these young people will feel that they do not really matter to their government, to us as legislators or to the general public.  If we do the right thing in this case, that will impact on other issues facing us and some positivity will come out with regard to how we respond to problems.  I plead with the House not to ignore young people of the calibre of these trainee pilots.  If we ignore them, we are not doing what is right and are doing further damage to the morale of the nation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMullins"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Mullins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for every effort to be made to resolve the trainee pilot situation.  However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the Government did not cause this problem.  I have no doubt but that the Minister will meet the trainee pilots and I hope a satisfactory solution can be found.  What the cadets require is the facility to complete their training, but the issue of the moneys lost is another part of the problem.  I join the call to the Leader to ask the Minister to meet the trainee pilots and deal with the issue as a matter of urgency.  I do not doubt he will as he is approachable and I am sure he understands the difficulties.  He will be encouraged by the all-party support for the plight of the young trainee pilots.</P>
        <P>I welcome all the good work the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is doing, in particular, the announcement he made yesterday with regard to the senior appointments he has made within the management ranks of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Previous speakers have spoken about the difficulties we have in this country and the high levels of crime in our cities and throughout the country.  It is imperative the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is well structured and that a management structure is in place to ensure citizens get the best security they deserve.  I support the call made by my colleagues for a debate on lawlessness and on alcohol related crime.  I am sure the Minister would like this House to participate in that debate and that we work together to improve the justice system, now that he has put in place a strong and robust management structure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Senators who have intervened on behalf of the trainee pilots.  The State has a duty to pursue where the money has gone in this case and to consider some kind of loan finance so that they can complete their training for their careers and pay off their debts.  I rose, in fact, to ask the Leader about No. 17 on the Order Paper.  The Fiscal Responsibility (Statement) Bill 2011 was debated in the Seanad in December last and supported on all sides of the House.  I thank all Senators for that.  The Department of Finance has failed to come up with its version of the Bill.  As a term when strong debates in Irish took place comes to an end, my question about the Department of Finance&rsquo;s fiscal responsibility Bill is, c&aacute; bhfuil s&eacute;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonnCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Eamonn Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the &euro;2.25 billion stimulus package announced yesterday by the Government and agree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s observation on the centralisation of the Dublin Institute of Technology in Grangegorman and the number of jobs that will create.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris also mentioned the new paediatric hospital.  The children&rsquo;s hospital in Crumlin was designed in 1936 and eventually opened 20 years later in 1956.  Tallaght Hospital took 18 years from design until it opened.  Over the past ten years or so, acrimonious debates on the new national paediatric hospital have taken place on the airwaves, in newspapers and in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  A number of months ago, An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused planning permission for the new children&rsquo;s hospital in the area of the Mater Hospital, for obvious reasons.</P>
        <P>It was encouraging that the Minister for Health initiated a new task force to find a solution to this problem.  I understood the task force was to report to the Cabinet by 25 May, which is almost two months ago, but so far no report has been made.  I understand the task force received approximately 40 submissions and heard approximately 20 interest groups.  Today, I learned it will be September before the task force reports to the Cabinet.  If history repeats itself, it will be 2020 before we have a new national paediatric hospital.</P>
        <P>Every year, 120,000 children go through Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Crumlin and approximately 60,000 children go through Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  Children&rsquo;s hospitals now have waiting lists.  I think it would be appropriate to call on the Minister for Health, not to tell us the location of the new children&rsquo;s hospital but to explain the delay in presenting the report to the Cabinet.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach will come to the House this afternoon.  I thank the Leader for arranging that debate and I look forward to hearing the Taoiseach&rsquo;s contribution.</P>
        <P>Last March, the Government took a decision to close Army barracks in Clonmel, Mullingar and Castlebar, as well as D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Barracks in Cavan town.  We were told these were cost saving measures.  This morning, I renew my call, which I have made on many occasions, for D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Barracks, the most modern barracks in Europe, to be reopened, in light of the significant threat from dissidents located just seven miles up the road.  The threat is not only to the Border region but to the security of the State.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality, and Defence, to the House to outline the cost savings that have been made to date by the closure of barracks in Clonmel, Mullingar, Castlebar and Cavan and his proposals for the disposal of the properties.  I qualify my request by saying I would object to the Minister&rsquo;s disposing of D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Barracks.  I want it reopened.  Nevertheless, what proposals does the Minister have for the disposal of the other barracks?  Could the Minister, at least, send someone to Cavan to cut the grass and weeds which are now six feet high.  This modern barracks which was well maintained until it was closed is now an eyesore at the approach to Cavan town.  What are the Minister and the Department of Defence planning to do about these barracks?</P>

	<P>Other Senators have mentioned the Government&rsquo;s stimulus package but I will touch on it also.  We now know more detail of the &euro;2.25 billion that will span until 2018.  I have reservations about the package.  I see Senator Gilroy is shocked by that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is against job creation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in is having a great recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The package is a fudge.  The capital budget will be cut by &euro;755 million in 2012, and the Government has already announced its intention to cut the capital spend by &euro;560 million in 2013 and by &euro;120 million in 2014.  We are told the package will create 13,000 jobs.  In the programme for Government, the Government undertook to have 100,000 more people in work by 2016.</P>
        <P>The projects announced are worthy and there are many others throughout the State that have not made the list.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>Did Sinn F&eacute;in welcome the package?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a need for a real stimulus package with more funds behind it that would go further toward filling the gaps in health, education, energy and vital infrastructure.  Nearly 200,000 people are long-term unemployed.  This announcement is too late for people who are on the dole or who have already left the State, as mentioned by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.</P>
        <P>Will there be social and labour clauses within the public procurement contracts, giving some assurance that thousands of people will be taken off the live register as a result of this stimulus package?  Even if the package creates only a minor stimulus, will it include clauses to ensure that social and labour standards are upheld by contractors?</P>
        <P>I could not talk about unemployment without mentioning youth unemployment.  Can the Leader guarantee the House that the Minister for Jobs, Innovation and Enterprise will come to the Seanad as soon as we resume after the summer recess to talk about youth unemployment and emigration?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Like others, I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the issue of pilot training.  How did the Irish Aviation Authority give a clean bill of health to the company concerned a few months ago?</P>
        <P>I renew my call for a debate on repairing the democratic deficit.  Last week, we saw the democratically elected &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta being abolished.  We hear town councils are to be got rid of and county councillors throughout the country will see their numbers reduced.  The number of D&aacute;il Deputies is to be reduced and the future of the Seanad is in doubt.  When, under the Lisbon treaty, 139 pieces of proposed legislation were sent to the parliaments of member states, 428 submissions were made by those parliaments but Ireland only managed to make one submission.  The former Joint Committee on European Scrutiny estimated that 75% of Irish legislation is made by Ministers signing statutory instruments to give effect to EU legislation and is not debated here, in the D&aacute;il or in committees.</P>
        <P>For example, we have had four years in which to bring the EU organ transplantation regulation into Irish law.  The four years will be up in August.  The Minister will sign this into Irish law as he heads out the door for the summer.  Organ transplantation is a serious issue but no one in this House or in the D&aacute;il can even get a draft of the legislation.  When the Minister signs the document it will become law and we will not see it.</P>
        <P>How many times does that happen in a given year?  It happens about 150 times.  The Seanad passes 50 Bills a year but there is no mechanism to debate this measure or other such issues.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to organise a debate on repairing the democratic deficit.  It is clear to anyone that the system is not working if a law on such an important matter as organ transplantation can be passed without a word of debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Daly said about organ transplantation.  A Private Members&rsquo; Bill on the matter was adjourned.  I am amazed that we are going ahead without any discussion of the issue.  We have looked for the opportunity to discuss it yet new legislation on organ transplants is being imposed without this opportunity for discussion.  </P>
        <P>I add my words of congratulations regarding yesterday&rsquo;s decision to develop a campus for the Dublin Institute of Technology at Grangegorman and to which Senator Norris referred.  This is a very welcome decision and I am pleased that it will go ahead as this move has been announced about six times over recent years.  I have a concern about the length of time it takes to get things done in this State.  It is very frustrating.  The students in the Dublin Institute of Technology have never had the opportunity to vote in the Seanad elections and neither do those in the University of Limerick nor in DCU.  It is good news that DCU is now co-operating with the Dundalk Institute of Technology in order to grant degrees.  Some very good developments are happening in third level education.  However, a referendum was held in 1979 to enable graduates of those institutions to vote in the Seanad elections but it has never happened.  I hope the Seanad will not be abolished but if we manage to convince the Government that the Seanad should not be abolished, let us make sure that at least those third level graduates who have been disenfranchised will be given the vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien rightly raised the issue of pyrite and the report.  I understand the report will be published today. I will endeavour to have the Minister come to the House for a debate on the recommendations of the report early in the new term.  The Minister will speak about the report&rsquo;s recommendations today but I hope he will come to the House for a debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the news that the chief executive officer of the HSE is stepping down.  I am not aware of the circumstances so I will not comment.  Senators Bacik, Mullen and Coghlan asked about the reform of the courts structures announced by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We can have a debate on this matter in the new term.  Senator Bacik referred to the report of the justice committee on penal reform.  I hope the House will keep the Minister for Justice and Equality very busy in the new term.  Senator van Turnhout and others asked about the children&rsquo;s rights referendum.  To the best of my knowledge, the Government is totally committed that this referendum will definitely go ahead this year and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, will be in the House in September and there will be an opportunity for Senator van Turnhout to raise the many points she has raised on several occasions on the Order of Business over recent weeks.</P>
        <P>Senators Keane, O&rsquo;Donovan, Cullinane, Whelan, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Mullins, Barrett and others, asked about the pilot training college.  I fully understand the frustration of the students and their parents as they face uncertainty.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, has been working with the Irish Aviation Authority and he has focused on securing the training records of all students so that all flight and ground training carried out to date in Florida will be credited towards the students&rsquo; final qualifications, where possible.  He is ensuring that the IAA works with other flight training centres to explore ways of facilitating the students to complete their training elsewhere either in Florida or in Ireland and that every effort is made to ensure as reasonable a cost as possible.  The Minister and the chief executive officer of the IAA are agreeable to meeting representatives of the pilots and their families on Friday morning.  I hope this will allow for the withdrawal of the amendment to the Order of Business.  It is hoped an amicable solution will be possible.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh asked about the budget and the capital programme.  The &euro;17 billion capital programme plan was based on what the country could afford and this was announced in the budget for 2012.  The additional stimulus of more than &euro;2 billion is welcomed by everyone.  Obviously the Government would like to pump in more money but the money is not available.  However, we are still committed to &euro;17 billion in addition to the &euro;2.5 billion of a stimulus package which it is hoped will get people off the live register and back to work.  This Government&rsquo;s first priority is job creation and getting people back to work.  The stimulus programme will help in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Gilroy and other Senators asked that the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall come to the House to discuss the problem of alcohol abuse, the question of the sale of alcohol and the problems over recent weeks.  The Minister of State will be in the House before the end of September.</P>
        <P>Senator Landy asked about health and safety matters and the working conditions in call centres.  I am surprised that Senator Landy did not raise this question when we were discussing the Industrial Relations Bill recently as this issue should have been raised&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisLandy"><NameTxt>Senator Denis Landy</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the matter came to my attention in the last few days by way of constituents of mine and I thought it important to raise it before the House rose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order.  Please resume your seat, Senator.</P>

	<P>It is a point of order.</P>

	<P>It is not a point of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take on board what Senator Landy has stated.  I acknowledge he only learned about this situation in recent days but it is a pity that the points could not have been made during discussion of the Industrial Relations Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Zappone&rsquo;s point about poverty was also raised yesterday by Senator Cullinane.  The Minister for Social Protection will be in the House on 11 October to address these points.  The Government is taxing wealth but people argue that this Government is not taxing wealth.  I refer to some of the key measures for the taxation of wealth in last year&rsquo;s budget.  Taxes were all increased to 30% including capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and the deposit interest retention tax.  The tax-free thresholds for capital acquisition tax have been reduced to take account of the fall in asset values over the past number of years.  This Government is applying a balanced approach.   We will have a debate with the Minister for Social Protection for two and a half hours on 11 October next.</P>
        <P>Senator Moran asked for a debate on the Cork report on suicide deaths and we can have a debate early in the new term.  Senator Norris and other Senators welcomed the development of the Grangegorman site.  It looks like it will go ahead at this stage.  He also asked about the preservation of the Art Deco buildings.  Senator Norris also asked about linking up the national children&rsquo;s hospital and the metro project so that more jobs could be created.  The aim of the Government is to promote joined-up thinking in the creation of jobs.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullins welcomed the promotions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the improvement in the management structures as a result.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, will come to the House to discuss law and order, penal reform and the other issues mentioned by Senators.</P>
        <P>In response to Senator Barrett, I will find out about the status of the fiscal responsibility Bill and revert to him.</P>
        <P>Senator Eamon Coghlan also raised the question of the national children&rsquo;s hospital and the delay with the report.  I will raise that matter with the Minister for Health.  It is unacceptable to have further delays with this.  Work must commence on the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  The process has been dragging on for far too long and I agree it is unacceptable to have further delays with this report.</P>
        <P>Senator Wilson raised the issue of Cavan barracks, which he has raised on many previous occasions, and the threat of dissidents.  That threat always remains, especially in the Border area, and I will ascertain from the Minister the situation regarding the sale of that barracks.</P>
        <P>Senator Reilly referred to the stimulus package and youth unemployment.  I am told that youth unemployment is under the remit of the Minister for Social Protection so we will be able to address that point when the Minister comes to the House.  It is a matter the Senator has raised on several occasions.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly spoke about the scrutiny of EU legislation.  I totally agree with the Senator in that regard and I intend to address the matter in my few words to the Taoiseach when he is in the House later.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to the delays in making things happen.  We all get frustrated in that regard but, hopefully, the Senator will have the opportunity to mention that to the Taoiseach also.</P>

	<P>No, in view of the commitment given by the Leader that the Minister will meet with the trainee pilots on Friday morning.  I have no wish to be political on this issue as it is a very sad affair.  I respect what the Leader has said and I hope there will be a positive outcome.  However, perhaps the Leader could find out where the $15 million went.  It is something I would like to know.</P>

    <Title>Developments in the European Union and Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Council: Statements with An Taoiseach</Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach from Derrycoosh, Islandeady, and Hawthorn Avenue, Castlebar, to the Chamber.  I congratulate him and wish him well as Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as ucht an cuireadh a thabhairt dom an tseachtain seo.  I am actually pleased to come to the Seanad today to reflect a little on recent developments at European level and to consider what lies ahead, including during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Council, which, as Senators know, will be from 1 January to the end of June next year.  I am also here to listen.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to enhancing the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the conduct of EU business.  I have made it my business to brief the D&aacute;il ahead of each meeting of the European Council and to return to report the outcome afterwards.  I know the Minister of State for European Affairs has appeared regularly in this House and that Senators have made a significant contribution to the work of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, which is doing excellent work.  It is absolutely right and necessary that this should be the case.  There is no longer any meaningful distinction to be made between domestic policy and European policy; European policy and law are domestic policy and law.  Given the circumstances in which the country finds itself, it is all the more important that our policies and instruments at national and European level pull in the same direction.</P>
        <P>It is absolutely clear that the Government&rsquo;s highest priority, leading this country into recovery and out of our programme, can be achieved only if the right policies are pursued, both here and across the Union.  Put simply, Irish recovery needs European recovery.  Last week, we saw the troika confirm again that Ireland is delivering on all of its programme commitments.  As it observed, &ldquo;implementation remains strong in a challenging environment&rdquo;.  That challenging environment remains a major risk to our continuing progress.  We are small, and domestic demand was never going to be sufficient to lift us back up to where we want to be.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our ability to restore growth depends on our capacity to export, which means finding partners willing and able to buy what we produce.  We have done what we can to drive this, including through improving our competitiveness.  Members will be aware that Ireland is among the top 20 globally in terms of competitiveness.  However, as the troika acknowledged, weak trading partner growth is damaging export demand.</P>
        <P>Ireland needs stability and an end to the euro drama and crisis.  We need strong leadership and a credible growth agenda at European level, an agenda that is implemented in deed as well as word.  That is what the Government has been working towards.  That is what will be right at the heart of our Presidency when we take over at the tiller next year.</P>
        <P>Since taking office last year, I have attended nine meetings of the European Council, or meetings of Heads of Government, including some informal ones, and six meetings of the euro summit.  Whereas people looking in from outside might sometimes criticise what they regard as the slow pace and lack of progress, I see a process in which ideas that began on the fringe have come to occupy the centre ground.</P>
        <P>We have not always been as quick or decisive as some, including me, might have liked but we are charting new territory &mdash; the Union had no emergency tools available to it when the crisis began &mdash; and people approach the table with very different perspectives.  It is not an easy task to reconcile the very different views and interests to hammer out a compromise.  Senators are well aware that, with 27 member states, 27 Prime Ministers, 27 governments whose tenures of office are of widely varying stability, and very different perspectives, it is often difficult to reach an agreement on what the strategy should be.  This is also the case in the eurozone, where there are 17 Prime Ministers and 17 governments, in addition to one bank whose governors have very independent views.</P>
        <P>We should never underestimate the extent and importance of what has been achieved, including at the most recent meeting of the European Council and summit at the end of June.  I approached that meeting with two particular goals and I set these out in the letter I wrote to all other Heads of State or Government on 7 June.  I wanted to see agreement reached on a growth pact for Europe and I wanted to see agreement on a solution to the banking crisis in Europe that broke the link between banking and sovereign debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Significant progress was made on both fronts.  The European Council agreed a compact for growth and jobs and the summit agreed a number of important steps aimed at addressing the immediate crisis in the euro area, including the imperative need to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.  As I said at the time, if these decisions are to have an impact in the markets, we must now show commitment and resolve in implementing them in good faith and in good time.  We also looked to the longer term, with President Van Rompuy presenting his report, Towards Genuine Economic and Monetary Union, laying the groundwork for a strong and credible Union and currency into the future.</P>
        <P>I have argued for some time that the first step in finding a cure to the problems facing Europe is to apply the right diagnosis.  This seems like an obvious and straightforward proposition, but it has not always been applied.  Despite the objective fact that Europe, as a whole, does not have the same difficulties that face other parts of the world, it has been treated more harshly in the judgment of the markets.  Why should this be?  I believe that the markets have been adding in what I would term an &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo; premium, based on doubts about the depth and irreversibility of Europe&rsquo;s currency union.</P>
        <P>Leaders have stated many times that they stood ready to take whatever steps are necessary to defend the currency but they have not always been believed.  Words have not been sufficiently backed up by deeds and credibility has been damaged as a result.  New tools were needed to give greater substance and credibility to our efforts.  The fiscal treaty was an important step, building on the six pack of legislation adopted last year.  It sent a signal that we are serious about achieving the type of budgetary discipline necessary to secure a currency union.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At its heart, the treaty is about establishing the trust necessary to deliver solidarity and the steps taken by euro area leaders at the end of June build on this in a very significant way.  The statement issued after the meeting contains a number of vital undertakings, most importantly the imperative need to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.  This interaction has been at the heart of the euro crisis.  I have long argued that it would not be possible for Europe to move beyond crisis and towards recovery for as long as banking and sovereign debt remained entangled.  We now have an agreement to separate them and we have a process under way to bring this about.  The Commission will shortly present proposals for a single supervisory mechanism and the Council has been asked to consider them urgently by the end of 2012.</P>
        <P>The euro group, the forum for finance Ministers, has agreed that technical discussions on future European Stability Mechanism direct recapitalisation of banks will also start in September so that the ESM could be in a position to decide to recapitalise banks directly once an effective single supervisory mechanism is established.  That is a very important decision.  I also made it very clear in my contacts with partners, both before and at the meeting, that the principle of equal treatment had to apply.  I simply could not accept a position whereby Ireland would be at a disadvantage for having taken the steps necessary to secure our banking system, both in the interests of our economy but also in the wider European interest, before new arrangements applied.  Where possibilities were being offered to others, Ireland had to stand to benefit also.  I insisted on this, and it was agreed; the statement, in undertaking to examine the position in our financial sector in the interests of improving the sustainability of our programme, states clearly that &ldquo;similar cases will be treated equally&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance has already moved forward with his colleagues, securing their commitment to return to the matter at their meeting in September, following technical discussions among the troika.  I remain hopeful of an early resolution, delivering a significant boost to our chances of recovery.  For obvious reasons I cannot go into any detail on what will be a complicated and sensitive negotiation but I can assure the Seanad that the Government will be working to ensure the best possible deal for Ireland and for Irish taxpayers.  I note in particular the comment of Mr. Mario Draghi yesterday following his meeting with the Minister for Finance that whatever deal may be done for Spain will also be reflected in the outcome for Ireland.  I very much welcome this statement.</P>
        <P>This issue has the potential to make a real difference for us.  The meeting also agreed to use available instruments more flexibly in support of countries in difficulties that are living up to their reform commitments.  This was seen as being of particular importance for Italy, which has a very large economy.  It opens up the possibility of the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and, once it comes into being, the ESM, intervening directly in the markets.  Since the meeting, the ECB and the EFSF have concluded an agency agreement under which the ECB would act on behalf of the facility in making bond purchases.</P>
        <P>The other real breakthrough at the end of June was agreement on a compact for jobs and growth.  For a long time the Government has argued that there was an urgent need to match our efforts at consolidation and reform with an equally strong focus on generating growth and creating jobs.  The approach to date at European level has been far too passive &mdash; with an expectation on the part of some that putting reform policies in place would be sufficient for growth to return.  It was never going to work.  We now have agreement on a much more active and ambitious approach.  There will be an immediate stimulus, with a &euro;120 billion investment package to be mobilised for fast-action growth measures.  The European Investment Bank will be an important player in this and it was agreed to increase its paid-in capital by &euro;10 billion to increase its lending capacity by &euro;60 billion.  This is intended to unlock approximately &euro;180 billion in additional investment in Europe.</P>
        <P>In follow up to this, I had a very positive and productive meeting with the ElB President, Werner Hoyer, when he visited Dublin on 6 July.  We agreed that our officials will work closely together to ensure that Ireland benefits to the maximum extent possible.  We will be pushing for these discussions to be advanced as rapidly as possible.  In the more medium term, the European Council agreed that deepening the Single Market, in particular in the digital area and for network industries, could make a real contribution to growth and job creation.  The Commission will be bringing forward its second round of proposals under the Single Market Act in the autumn.  These will not only be an important input, they will also help to shape the agenda for the Irish Presidency in the first half of next year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We also agreed that we need to improve our ability to translate high-level agreements into policy action on the ground, and we will not secure the results we are working for if implementation remains patchy or unfulfilled.  The Commission will now make an annual report on this as part of the European semester process.  There was a shared focus on the importance of external trade as a driver of growth.  I do not need to tell this House how vital this issue is for Ireland as we are a small and open trading economy and our future prospects depend heavily on our ability to export.</P>
        <P>We will now press forward with free trade agreements with a number of key partners.  The transatlantic dimension will be a particular focus of our Presidency, as I noted at the Council meeting.  The EU-US high-level working group on jobs and growth will bring forward its recommendations later this year.  As the nation holding the Presidency, we will be working to ensure that negotiations on a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment agreement get under way in 2013 and we will host an informal ministerial-level meeting in Dublin dedicated to the key EU-US trading relationships.  Although it will take some considerable time to bring the process to fruition, it holds enormous potential in the context of trade across the Atlantic in future years.  I have already stated my view that future prospects for Ireland and for Europe are inextricably linked.  For this country to recover and grow, we need Europe to recover and grow.  When we take the stage when we hold the Presidency next year, we will have a unique opportunity to put our stamp on this vital agenda.  During our term in office, from January to June, our absolute priority will be to stimulate sustainable economic growth and job creation.  We will manage the European semester process, the new system of economic and budgetary co-ordination within the Union, and we will co-ordinate efforts under Europe 2020, the process through which member states advance national reforms.  We will put our shoulders to the wheel to give real momentum to efforts to deepen the Single Market, including through the digital single market, helping to give Europe a real competitive edge.  As Senators are aware, the European Union has a market potential of 500 million people and on the fringes of this Union are a further 500 million to 600 million people, including in African countries which have grown at an average of between 5% and 7% in recent years and which will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>Strengthening the EU&rsquo;s research and development capacities is also essential and we will host a range of conferences in Ireland and events in Dublin on areas such as green innovation, key enabling technologies and medical technology, in which Ireland has scored highly in recent times.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the House is aware, this will be our seventh time to take the Presidency.  Each Presidency has brought its own challenges, but rarely have the stakes been higher.  During the six previous Presidencies, the Government of the day did a very effective job in managing the issues at European level.  While the Union may have been smaller, how those Presidencies were managed did a remarkable job for the reputation of our country.  Our Presidency next year offers an important opportunity for us to make a real contribution at European level, helping us to restore and rebuild the excellent reputation we have enjoyed in Europe through most of our four decades of membership.  While this may have been damaged in the past, this is our chance to bring back its shine.</P>
        <P>In chairing meetings in Brussels, from the most technical of working groups to the most politically-charged ministerial meetings, we will have a chance to demonstrate to our colleagues in Europe what Ireland can do.  I assure the Seanad we will make the most of these opportunities.  For the Government, the logistics of preparation for the Presidency are quite daunting and will involve intensive interaction by everybody.  Ministers are aware of the preparations that must be made and the details are being worked out as we speak.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We will strive to manage business as efficiently and effectively as possible and we will draw on the immense range of experience within our system to be an impartial and creative broker for agreement.  Fostering good relations with the European Parliament is an essential part of this work.  It will be a huge undertaking for the country, particularly at a time of reduced resources, and we will make every euro count.  We expect to host approximately 175 official events in Ireland, each with its own complicated set of logistical challenges and demands for translation, transport and press arrangements.  Senators are aware there are 23 official languages at European level which requires preparation and the detail must be right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Plans are already well advanced at political and official level, but I want the Presidency to be a whole<Delete> </Delete><Insert>-</Insert>of<Delete> </Delete><Insert>-</Insert>Ireland effort.  I want the Oireachtas and the people to be fully engaged.  This is a chance for the people to see their Union at work<Delete>,</Delete> and to see Ireland offering leadership and direction in a number of areas.  I want Irish businesses to make the most of the opportunities it presents, especially our small and medium enterprises.  We have been working closely with State agencies since last year to ensure we take advantage of every opportunity to promote Ireland and Irish goods and services abroad.  We want all of our visitors, the delegates, the press and the support staff,<Delete>-</Delete><Insert> </Insert>to leave the country having had a positive and welcoming experience during the course of the Presidency next year.  This is the time to put the best foot forward.</P>
        <P>As I stated, Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency comes at an important time for the development of the European Union.  We will follow Cyprus and precede Lithuania and Greece.  It may be that the multi-financial framework will be decided before the end of the year but it may have to be decided during the Irish Presidency; this is not clear at present.  It will be a time when we are not only looking to move beyond crisis and back to recovery, but also when we will lay the groundwork for the future of the European Union of which Ireland has been a central part since we joined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the European Council meeting at the end of June, President Van Rompuy set out some of his thoughts on how we can move towards a genuine economic and monetary union.  He sees this as moving along four complementary tracks, namely, banking union; greater fiscal and budgetary integration; greater economic co-ordination; and, alongside these, greater democratic legitimacy and accountability.  He will flesh out his ideas further between now and October and produce a final report before the end of the year.  This is a debate of great significance for the Union and for Ireland and it will be carried forward throughout next year.  It will give rise to very important and fundamental questions for us and for others.  It is a debate for which we will need to prepare and position ourselves well, having carefully thought out the issues that need to be dealt with.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas will, of course, have an important part to play.  However, I want to see the debate go further and open a discussion that engages people throughout the country.  The engagement of our people has been part of the process of Europe in the referenda we have held over the years.  The people&rsquo;s decision on the fiscal stability treaty was clear, decisive and strong and in its own way has led to the European perception of Ireland as a country that is serious in working with its people to deal with the serious challenge we face to retrieve our economic independence.</P>
        <P>Next year will be the 40th anniversary of our membership of the Union.  Despite the events of recent years, Ireland has done well in Europe.  We have developed our economy, we have brought opportunities to our businesses, and we have widened our horizons as a people.  Our future lies in remaining a fully committed participant in a renewed and robust European Union, with a strong and credible currency at its heart.  This is what the Government will continue to work for, before, during and beyond our Presidency.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to say these few words.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach.  A number of Senators have indicated they wish to share time.  The first three speakers with be Senators Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, Terry Leyden and Thomas Byrne.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Senator Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Ar son Ph&aacute;irt&iacute; Fhianna F&aacute;il, cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Taoiseach go dt&iacute; an Seanad.  Ba mhaith liom freisin comhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il leis as a phost mar Taoiseach.  I thank the Taoiseach for taking the time to come to the House today to set out in some detail how we are approaching the crisis in Europe and looking to the future as to how Ireland will deal with the EU Presidency.  We must look forward, but I would also like to look back with regard to a number of items raised by the Taoiseach.  Significantly, the Taoiseach mentioned the Union had no emergency tools available to it when the crisis began, and this was the biggest flaw in the EU.  This in itself leads me to state the previous Government stood alone in Europe when the banking crisis happened and it was very restricted in the options it had.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach also stated Ireland would be at a disadvantage for having taken the steps necessary to secure our banking system in the interests of our economy and in the wider European interests before new arrangements applied.  This is with regard to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s ongoing negotiations to secure a better deal.  I agree with the Taoiseach but it is a clear acknowledgement from him and the Government that it was in the interests of Ireland that very difficult decisions &mdash; which can be criticised now and rightly so and which can be discussed properly &mdash; were taken not only in the interests of Ireland but in the wider interests of Europe.  Ireland should be rewarded for doing this because, as the Taoiseach well knows, our unemployment rate is the highest it has been in 20 years, standing at 14.9%, and according to a recent report 1.8 million people in the country have less than &euro;100 a month in disposable income.  These are the challenges the Taoiseach, the Government and the Oireachtas face in trying to get a better deal for our citizens to ensure their quality of life improves.  The Taoiseach made two very significant statements.  I find it difficult to marry them with a comment he made that our reputation has been tarnished in recent years.  This canard about attendance at EU meetings and so on has been put to us on number of occasions.  Independent reports, such as the Gothenburg report, do not bear testament to that in terms of the attendance of Irish Ministers from the previous Administration.  That is in the past and we should leave it aside.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate the Taoiseach on the passing of the recent EU fiscal treaty referendum.  Again, I commend the people on making the right decision.  My party, as a pro-European party, and my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, tried to play a positive role in it, which the Taoiseach acknowledged.  I welcome very much that the Taoiseach is looking for input into the theme and the thrust of our EU Presidency and that he will look to both sides of the House, to members of my party and to Independent Members and, most important, to the wider community, on how we will frame our Presidency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach stated that he does not believe it is appropriate to go into the detail of his, and the Government&rsquo;s, negotiations on behalf of the Irish people.  I understand that to a certain degree but he should trust the people more.  We should be more open about what we are looking for in terms of this deal.  The Taoiseach stated in the other House that we would pay our way and pay all our debts and that we were not looking for a debt write-down.  I would like to know what we are looking for.  I welcome the announcement made at the recent July meeting but it behoves the Taoiseach and the Government, and it would be helpful to the people, to set more clearly our position and what we are looking for.</P>
        <P>On behalf of my party, I wish the Taoiseach well.  We will play a positive role in the Presidency and we would like to feed into it.  We look forward to seeing the Taoiseach in the House before he takes over the Presidency of the EU.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Taoiseach to the Seanad, the second House of the Oireachtas.  I am delighted he is here today.  It is his first visit as Taoiseach and I hope it will not be his last.  We are not too bad here really.  We have a Castlebar man as Cathaoirleach, so he is in good hands.</P>
        <P>We all fully support the Taoiseach as the President of the European Union from 1 January to the end of June 2013.  It is a great honour for the Taoiseach, for the Government and for Ireland.  We have a very proud record, with seven presidencies of the European Union.  In 1990, when I was a Minister of State, another Castlebar man, Charles J. Haughey, led us and Germany was reunified under the Irish Presidency.  That was some record and I wish the Taoiseach similar success in other fields in the next six months.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has a particular role and he outlined very well his aspirations and the policies he wishes to pursue during the Presidency.  I know he has the ability and ambition to achieve them.  As he knows, both of us were Ministers for trade and it is vitally important.  The Taoiseach, as President of the European Union, and his Ministers, as presidents of Councils, will have a particular role in leading trade missions not only throughout Europe but throughout the world, in particular to China and America.  His status not only as Taoiseach of this country but as the President of the European Union for this period has particular importance which cannot be bought.  By the way, we will not hold the Presidency again until 2027, which is a very long time away.  That is why the opportunity must be grabbed, which I know the Taoiseach will do.</P>
        <P>An area of international policy, about which most Members of this House are concerned, is the Middle East.  Great difficulties have arisen there again.  Hopefully, during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Presidency, he will have some influence in the Palestine-Israel situation.  He will have a busy schedule but it is vitally important he uses his position to try to bring about some sense of unity in that region.</P>
        <P>I would like to extend an invitation to the Taoiseach to address the plenary session of the Council of Europe, which represents 47 countries and 800 million people.  To go to the Council of Europe, as President of the European Union, would be of particular significance.  The Council of Europe extends into Russia and beyond.  It is a particular platform of which I believe the Taoiseach will avail.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach has tremendous support from the Civil Service, as has this Government and as Governments have had in the past.  The civil servants are preparing the way for this Presidency and they will not be found wanting in the work they will do for the Taoiseach and for Ireland.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day 2013 will be very significant in that the President of the European Union will meet the President of America and it will emphasise the great gathering which is planned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasByrne"><NameTxt>Senator Thomas Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Taoiseach as teacht isteach sa Seanad inniu agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas do mo cheannaire f&eacute;in as ucht am a roinnt liom.  T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och den Taoiseach gur admhaigh s&eacute; ina r&aacute;iteas inniu go ndearnamar sa ph&aacute;irt&iacute; seo gach rud maidir leis na bainc ar son eacnama&iacute;ocht na h&Eacute;ireann agus na hEorpa.

        <P>I welcome the opportunity for the Taoiseach and Ireland to host the Presidency of the European Union next year as it is a huge opportunity for him and for the country.  I was in college when John Bruton was President of the European Union and I was walking down O&rsquo;Connell Street when I saw the fleet of cars carrying the European Union leaders past the GPO, presumably on their way from Ar&aacute;s an Uachtar&aacute;in to Dublin Castle.  I thought how proud the leaders of that era would have been to see Ireland hosting all the leaders of European Union as an equal and Ireland directing European Union policy.  It is fair to say that during the presidencies of Charles J. Haughey and Bertie Ahern, significant progress was made on European issues.  The opportunity is there for the Taoiseach next year, with the support of the country, to do the same.</P>
        <P>A number of issues need to be addressed.  The Taoiseach could push forward the issue of European bank regulation.  The transaction tax should be applied on a global basis so that no country is at a disadvantage.  There is a huge opportunity in regard to the ratings agencies.  There were initiatives at European Union level but they have not been followed through.  That needs to be done so that the people can take control and have more power over these institutions.  We do not know what is going on behind closed doors in these ratings agencies which have such an influence on the global economy.</P>
        <P>There is widespread support for the Seanad having a role in the scrutiny of European Union legislation.  If we are going to bring the people with us on the European journey, which is a job the Taoiseach must do in terms of future referendums, we will have to devote much more time to the scrutiny of European Union legislation so that when issues such as bogs, habitats directives, sceptic tanks legislation, etc., come before us, a process will have been set out at a very early stage to explain where these proposals or court decisions have come from.  There is an attempt to do that at committee level in the Oireachtas but surely there is a role for the Seanad in that regard, and it is a role it would be willing to play.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am delighted the Taoiseach has been able to come to the House to address us and to keep us up to date on developments at European Union level and, more important, on the work he and his counterparts, as Heads of State and Government, are doing to stabilise the euro and bring confidence back to the market to encourage a return to economic growth and the restoration of our economy.  The European Council meeting last month was an important one for Ireland.  As the Taoiseach, stated the compact for growth and jobs, which was agreed on, was vitally needed and, more critically, the link between banking and sovereign debt, which has damaged us so badly over the past number of years, was broken decisively.  For Ireland, this vital step represents an important breakthrough which can help us to recover and return to the markets.  This outcome reflects the intensive efforts the Government has made since taking office to explain the situation regarding Ireland&rsquo;s legacy bank debt to our partners and to seek their support in engineering an outcome which can reduce the excessive burden on the Irish taxpayers.  There is much work still to be done to implement the agreements.  We should all, as politicians and citizens, be pleased with the significant progress that the Taoiseach has made on both fronts to date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I come from Waterford and know first-hand the benefits of targeted and focused investments and the unbelievable devastation caused by recession and unemployment. I know there will be many Waterfords across the European Union and that is why the Compact for Jobs and Growth adopted by the European Council last month with its immediate stimulus of a &euro;120 billion investment package; agreements on measures to deepen the Single Market, particularly in the digital arena; and agreements to work on enhancing external trade links are ambitious and, I hope, achievable goals.</P>
        <P>An issue that arises almost daily in the House is the crippling effect of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment.  I have seen the effects of unemployment in my city and that is why I am especially pleased that efforts to increase youth employment, with the objective that within a few months of leaving school young people should receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship, or a traineeship which can be supported by the ESF, was part of the agreement at the European Council.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is my sincere hope that by the time Ireland undertakes the six-month Presidency of the European Council on 1 January next year, the preparatory work on these efforts will be sufficiently advanced in order that we can bring our experience and skills to bear on driving them forward for our own good and that of our European partners.  The forthcoming Presidency will be crucial in demonstrating Ireland&rsquo;s ability to manage the agenda of the EU in the light of the current difficult times.  Some might call it the luck of the Irish or some might see it as Sod&rsquo;s law but in 2004 our Presidency of the Council coincided with the accession of ten new member states to the EU.  On this occasion it will coincide with the 40th Anniversary of Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the EU.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach and his staff in the Department of the Taoiseach will manage the official and celebratory aspects of the Presidency with their usual skill and expertise that always serves to showcase Ireland at its best when we are under the spotlight.  I am sure that I can speak for most, if not all, in the House when I say that I am sure that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will favourably consider a request by Government to assist in delivering a successful Presidency.  Last July this Chamber was addressed by the then President of the European Parliament, Mr. Jerzy Buzek.  His address was an enlightening and interesting one that brought the House closer to the European institutions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the most unfortunate things to happen in Ireland in recent years is a distrust between the Irish electorate and the European Union due to a disconnect between the two.  There is support in the House for us, as a group, to assist in the oversight of European-driven legislation that must be adopted into Irish law.  While new legislation proposals from the EU are dealt with by the Oireachtas joint committees there is a need for a more open debate on new proposals.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann could be better utilised by providing a forum to debate and scrutinise new legislative proposals that emanate from the European institutions.  Many legislative and non-legislative proposals emanate from the European Commission filter through the European Parliament, the Commission and the European Council.  Each national parliament has an eight-week window in which to file an objection or an observation on the draft proposal and that gives little opportunity for a national parliament to influence policy.</P>
        <P>Each November the European Commission sets out its agenda for the following year.  For example, in 2012 the Commission has 129 items for discussion and formulation of policy.  There is an ongoing discussion between the Commission and the member state Governments on legislative proposals but national parliaments only become involved at the end of the process.  There is a need in Ireland, more than ever, to make the electorate aware of the work done at European level.  An open debate on new proposals would help to make more information available to the general public.  The proposal from Members of the Seanad is for two days a month to be set aside to deal exclusively with European Union draft legislation.  In order to proceed with the proposal it would be necessary to allocate additional staff for a couple of days per month and I hope that the Taoiseach will support us in our efforts in that regard.</P>
        <P>I understand that 2013 may be designated as the European Year of Citizens.  It would present us with an opportunity to promote a discussion of Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the EU and its place in Europe, a debate that we need to have at national and local levels.  It also presents an opportunity to consider what it means to be a citizen of the European Union in the 21st century and to reflect on how best we can address the concerns of all of our citizens.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me not to raise another issue.  Recently, we passed a resolution calling for the future of the House to be discussed at the constitutional convention and I outlined the Government&rsquo;s position to the House at the time.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might clarify the situation.  We have had a good 14 months in the 24th Seanad.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Taoiseach to the House today.  I wish to raise two issues.  He will know that I am a former Member of the European Parliament where Members had one minute of speaking time, so I try to stick to that here.  Having listened to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s presentation I know that 175 events have or will be organised for our six-month Presidency.  My colleague, Senator C&aacute;it Keane, asked me to suggest that we co-host a conference on the issue of renewable energy, energy efficiency and the strategic energy technology plan.  She has just returned from a conference on it in Brussels organised by EUFORES, a group of people from the European Parliaments and all of the parliaments across Europe.  I ask that we co-host a conference on it during our Presidency in 2013.</P>
        <P>I join the Leader and Senator Thomas Byrne in their call to better utilise the Seanad by scrutinising European legislation.  I can confirm that there were 18,167 regulations and 750 directives issued by the European Commission over a six year period.  That is the volume of legislation and regulation at a European level.  Earlier the Leader identified that we only have an eight week window of opportunity to scrutinise it.  We will commence our holidays this Friday but what legislation will be processed during the eight weeks that we are on holidays?  Should we be involved at an early stage?  There are procedures in place.  Protocols 1 and 2 of the Lisbon treaty, in Articles 4 and 6, clearly sets out the role national parliaments have in dealing with European legislation.  We do not use that role effectively.</P>

Both issues should be taken on board.</P>

	<P>That is all right as I shall be as quick as ever.  I salute the Taoiseach&rsquo;s valuable work at European level despite difficult times and with the recession persisting.  I hope that the Irish Presidency in 2013 will bear further fruit.  In his address the Taoiseach stressed two important points, namely, the irreversibility of Europe&rsquo;s currency union and breaking the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.</P>
        <P>Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, banking practices have been totally suspect.  Does the Taoiseach envisage that we will have a banking inquiry?  Recent events involving Barclays Bank in Britain do nothing for our confidence in the system which needs further reform and greater transparency.  The fiddling and manipulation of the London interbank rate and business related to mortgages, personal lending and commercial lending was horrific.  God forbid that anything like that would happen in this country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Are there contingency plans for our currency should the euro come under further threat?  As the Taoiseach said, the difficulty is that the markets do not believe.  The Taoiseach believes, as I do, that the euro will survive.  The 17 member states have such a vested interest that one must always ensure that whatever it takes, the euro survives.  If the eurozone were to break up, if Italy and Spain could not afford to fund themselves, if their bond yields did not fall, what would the position be?</P>
        <P>We wish the Taoiseach every success.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With the agreement of the Chair I wish to share my time, allowing Senator Zappone two minutes and Senator O&rsquo;Donnell one minute.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the Independent Members whom the Taoiseach nominated to the Seanad, it is an honour for me to warmly welcome him to the Seanad.  There are many issues I would like to raise on the question of reform, but today I will limit my comments to No. 1.  I hope the Taoiseach will be able to join us in this Chamber in the near future to discuss other pressing issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Taoiseach said, January 2013 will mark several milestones in our relationship with the European Union.  It coincides with the 40th anniversary of Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the EU and it will be Ireland&rsquo;s seventh Presidency.  Ireland is considered an old hand with a very good track record.  We have a good reputation to maintain.  After our Presidency in 2013, the date of the next Presidency is unknown but it will be at least ten to 20 years before we assume the role again.  The rotating Presidency is always an advertisement for the country in question.  A good, able, competent<Insert>,</Insert> successful Presidency is what the Government should be aiming for and I believe the Taoiseach outlined that in his speech.  Coupled with our approach to host events on a cost<Delete> </Delete><Insert>-</Insert>effective basis, this will contribute to our reputation as a leader and negotiator.  I am involved in attracting and encouraging several conferences and events, particularly from the European economic and social committee.  As a former member of this committee<Insert>,</Insert> I am encouraging them to host some of their activities in Ireland during 2013.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe the introduction under the Treaty of Lisbon of a permanent President for the European Council was a welcome innovation.  I believe that Herman Van Rompuy has been doing an excellent job in very difficult circumstances.  However, the six-monthly rotating Presidency still matters, particularly with regard to the legislative rhythm of the Union and with a range of important policy areas remaining with the rotating Presidency.  Unemployment, especially youth unemployment, economic growth, debt restructuring, agriculture and fisheries and climate change negotiations are just some of the issues that I believe our Presidency can focus on to garner support at home.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency will be particularly significant because it will be the first of the new T5 Trio.  Lithuania will follow in the second half of 2013, and in first half of 2014, Greece will host the Presidency.  They have to agree a three Presidency programme.  It is good that an old hand such as Ireland will be getting the T5 Trio Presidency under way.  It is apt that this Presidency will bring together some of the smaller member states with some of the more troubled economies.  The Irish Presidency should therefore be putting its weight very firmly behind any and all initiatives that will foster growth and employment and, above all, push hard on the Europe 2020 strategy.  Coupled with growth, we need to put a strong focus on the wellbeing of citizens.</P>
        <P>The Irish Presidency as the Taoiseach said, may inherit some hot potatoes, if they rumble on beyond the Cypriot Presidency, for example, the negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework and the vexed issue of the reform of EU staff regulations.  I know we must deal with reform at home but this is a major issue at EU level.  It is also in the nature of rotating presidencies that there will be unknown unknowns.  I believe Ireland has the diplomatic and political machinery and long-standing experience to deal with such issues effectively.</P>
        <P>As the European Union continues to develop, we need to be absolutely clear when it is most appropriate to take decisions closer to the people affected, that is at national or local level and in other cases, when it is best to take action at EU or global level.  We need to examine further the balance of competencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our Presidency will also coincide with the European Year of Citizens 2013.  For citizens it should be seen as a chance for Ireland to have its voice heard.  Ireland&rsquo;s position as President of the Council can steer the EU&rsquo;s direction back on to the original path of the Community, where all voices, no matter how small, were heard equally, where understanding and promotion of diversity and culture and ideas is to the fore.  Popular sentiment has turned sour.  This is a result of the perceived shift of political power to the centre of Europe and to nations such as France and Germany, which are seen now as the drivers of the EU project.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish EU Council Presidency team must work hard to ensure that the 2013 agenda focuses on those issues that most affect the Irish people and EU citizens if it is to generate engagement and support for the EU, as I am sure it will.  I believe that some prime examples where Ireland should focus its attention are growth in jobs, advancing the digital agenda, strengthening EU-US trade and economic relations and promoting competitiveness through enhanced research and development and innovation.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight how we need to pay greater attention to the development of the 12 key actions identified to revive the Single Market.  These 12 drivers for growth, competitiveness and social progress include financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, consumer protection and the digital single market.  I believe they have the potential to give new momentum which will significantly benefit businesses, workers and consumers.  As the Leader, Senator Cummins, outlined, the role of this House could be to scrutinise some of those proposals that will come forward in October.  I strongly believe that Ireland can play a leading role around the digital agenda and use it to showcase globally our preparedness for innovation and our potential role as a trail blazer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I now hand over to my colleague, Senator Zappone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KatherineZappone"><NameTxt>Senator Katherine Zappone</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach.  Europe 2020 on a smart sustainable and inclusive European economy and society specifically calls for fresh thinking and social innovation as a way of revitalising our European social model.  I would like the Taoiseach to consider two options during our Presidency that would mark a very visible contribution to renewing the European social model into the future, thereby complementing our economic leadership as outlined in his speech.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My first suggestion relates to disability.  As the Taoiseach knows the EU in addition to its member states, has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  This is as unprecedented as it is welcome.  It calls for concerted action at EU level as well as member state level over the coming years.  One of the big problems in Europe today is the institutionalisation of people with disabilities, estimated at over 1.5 million.  We have done much to begin the transition away from institutions into community living.  The HSE commissioned a report on the living arrangements of those with disabilities entitled Time to Move On from Congregated Settings which has been lauded around the world.</P>
        <P>Our Presidency will coincide with finalising the EU regulations for the next programming period of the EU Structural Funds.  In the past these funds were often misused to construct new institutions, using our tax money across Europe.  This must end.  More importantly, innovative and positive ways have to be found to harness the Structural Funds to ease the process of transition to independent living and community engagement around Europe.  I urge the Taoiseach and his colleagues to give consideration to a high level ministerial meeting on achieving community living through the appropriate use of Structural Funds.  In doing so, Ireland would move a constructive agenda forward that will help achieve the goals of the UN disability treaty in Europe.  There may even be an opportunity to learn about and build on the establishment of the US federal administration for community living by the Obama Administration as a way of harnessing federal resources to achieve community living for disabled and older people in the US.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>My second suggestion is related but separate.  The Europe 2020 strategy mentions grand social change happening in Europe.  There can be no greater social change across Europe than the rapid ageing of our populations.  We in this House held a series of hearings on this topic through the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  We know that Ministers are planning a positive ageing strategy for Ireland, which is welcome.  We welcome the European Year of Active Ageing.  There is a need to anchor these positive steps in something more tangible.  The United Nations is currently considering a new treaty on the rights of older people.  There has, as yet, been no open and inclusive European-level debate on whether this would be a positive step and how this process might be supported.  I suggest an Irish Presidency event focusing on the added value of such an instrument.  It could be that Ireland would set in motion an unstoppable process of positive reform at European level and around the world.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the Upper House and am delighted to see him.  I feel I should speak because he gave me the privilege of having a voice, as one of his appointees.  However, in doing so, he might have a fight on his hands with regard to the closure of the Seanad because I do not think that is going to happen.</P>
        <P>I only have one minute but one minute with a powerful voice is worth a mile.</P>
        <P>As Ireland is about to take on the Presidency of the European Union, I ask that our capital city and, in particular, O&rsquo;Connell Street and its surrounds, be restored as a European city scape of which to be proud.  Throughout the Presidency, we will have reciprocal arrangements, meetings, procedures, travel and tourism between our countries, press, people and our capital cities.  In that context, I would like O&rsquo;Connell Street, in the great city that is Dublin, which boasts monuments to emancipation, liberation, literature, culture, music, art, drama, the workers and the great Father Matthew of the temperance movement, to be restored and remain thus and not become a monument to the menace that our city has become.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh an Taoiseach.  I am delighted to welcome the Taoiseach on behalf of the Labour Party in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is very timely that the Taoiseach is here during our last sitting week.  He is welcome to come again and indeed, we hope he will be a more regular visitor here.  We also thank the Taoiseach for his very comprehensive update on developments at EU level and, in particular, for informing us of the very positive recent developments at the European Council and summit meetings at the end of June, where we saw great progress being made, both on the growth and jobs package and also on steps to be taken to break what he rightly described as the vicious cycle between banks and sovereign debt.  We are all very glad to hear the Taoiseach say that he anticipates an early resolution to that vicious cycle.  Can the Taoiseach say when he expects that to happen?  I know that the autumn has been mentioned but we all very much hope that real progress will be made on that issue before we take up the Presidency on 1 January 2013.</P>
        <P>It has certainly been a hugely eventful year at EU level, as illustrated in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech.  It has also been an eventful year for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  As Deputy Leader, I must echo the comments of the Leader of the House, Senator Cummins, in saying that in this 24th Seanad, we have taken great steps to make substantive changes to our own internal procedures to make us a more effective and dynamic House.  We have achieved that through innovative measures like the public consultation committee and our distinguished speakers programme, under which the former President, Ms Mary Robinson, Mr. Maurice Manning and most recently, Mr. Drew Nelson of the Orange Order, addressed the House.  We have also seen, with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s appointment of a genuinely independent group of nominees, the emergence of a fifth group within the Seanad which has greatly enhanced the quality of our debate.  In keeping with the healthy tradition of the Seanad, we have seen debates on a range of issues, including humanist weddings, wind turbines, Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill, as well as Bills to ban smoking in cars and to change prostitution law.  Issues that are not being debated in D&aacute;il  &Eacute;ireann are being debated here on a regular basis.  We have also seen very high-quality debates in the House on Second and Committee Stages of various Bills such as the Electoral (Amendment) Bill and several criminal justice Bills.  We have become a dynamic and effective Upper House and have performed a really substantive role in the legislative process.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins and others have spoken of how we could play an enhanced role in the scrutiny of EU measures, a proposal I welcome.  We look forward to playing our part in the EU Presidency next year.  I was glad to hear the Taoiseach say that he hopes that both Houses will be fully engaged in that Presidency over the six months.</P>
        <P>I wish to turn briefly to what we anticipate will happen during that Presidency and to end the political broadcast on behalf of the Seanad for the moment, as I know we will be returning to that debate over the coming year.  As others have said, this will be our seventh time to take the helm at the EU.  It will give us a great opportunity to enhance our reputation because no matter what others might say, there is no doubt it was tarnished in recent years.  This Presidency will give us a chance to show ourselves off, at a time of great challenge for the EU generally.  As the Taoiseach has said, there will be no Irish recovery without an EU recovery and we must work with our EU partners to ensure that we see such a recovery.  We will not be holding the Presidency when the EU expands to 28 states, as Croatia is due to join on 1 July 2013 but we will certainly be working with the 28th state.  It is a time of immense challenge as the Union enlarges further and as the institutional changes anticipated by the Lisbon treaty are still being bedded down.</P>
        <P>It is very important that we have set out our priority for the Presidency, namely, to find ways to stimulate sustainable economic growth and create jobs.  We all welcome the &euro;2.25 billion Irish stimulus package announced yesterday by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and we also greatly welcome the compact for growth agreed at EU level.  We hope to see more detail on that compact being provided during the term of our Presidency.</P>
        <P>Our Presidency will mark the 40th anniversary of our own accession to the EEC, as it was then, and we should use the period to make positive changes and to make progress on issues in which the EU has already brought about great progress, including womens&rsquo; and workers&rsquo; rights and the environment.  We have spoken about the need to engage with people across Ireland on this and we also need to see tangible progress being made on those issues, while retaining our priority focus on jobs and growth. The introduction of climate change legislation, in keeping with the progress at EU level on climate change, would be a great benefit from our Presidency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SusanOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh an Taoiseach.  I echo the sentiment expressed by others regarding the remarkable disconnect between the politics of Europe and national politics.  I would proffer that a more informed public understanding of the European Union would be gained very quickly if a reformed Seanad took on scrutiny of European legislation.  This would ensure a more coherent dialogue and debate about European matters which in turn would bring Europe centre stage in our lives, where it undoubtedly belongs, as is evidenced in the work that the Taoiseach has been doing and in the work that has been done over the 40 years since we joined the union.</P>
        <P>We all look forward to Ireland taking the Presidency of the European Council and much hard work is being done in preparation for the role.  Our officials will have a key role to play in signing off on vital Common Agricultural Policy, CAP,  reform.  The Taoiseach will have a key role to play in ensuring that the new rural development programme under the CAP and this Government&rsquo;s allocation of the rural development funding will properly and fairly support all Irish farmers, whose role in our economic recovery is vital.  Strong farmers create a strong food industry and in that context, the Taoiseach has acknowledged today the importance of exports to our financial recovery.  That debate will take place over the next six to nine months and I trust the Taoiseach will be supporting the role of farmers and the role played by rural Ireland in enhancing all our lives.</P>
        <P>While we welcome the potential breaking of the link between sovereign and bank debt it ultimately must bring relief to ordinary workers who have been caught up in this crisis and it must bring support for the most vulnerable in our society and we must not lose sight of that when we talk about it in a rather abstract way.  That break surely has to bring, as quickly as possible, some relief to workers and support to the vulnerable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach spoke about restoring our reputation and bringing back its shine in Europe.  In that context, I ask him to ensure that our cultural institutions continue to operate at arm's length from Government as they seek ways to work more efficiently because our cultural heritage marks out our place in Europe.  It enhances our standing in the world and our cultural future is rooted in that strong heritage, whose independence must continue to be nurtured and cherished by this Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AideenHayden"><NameTxt>Senator Aideen Hayden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House.  He said that Europe had not been very decisive in recent times in dealing with the economic crisis, which is an understatement.  It is quite clear that Europe has been seen as being dragged kicking and screaming to the table.  Unfortunately, this is not without precedent and in this regard I am thinking of the foreign affairs crisis caused by the difficulties with the break-up of the former Yugoslavia.  Part of the price we have had to pay for this indecisiveness is that peripheral economies like Ireland have been picked off like lone dolphins surrounded by sharks by the international markets.  It is time for that to change.  I welcome what the Taoiseach has said about the strong measures being proposed.  The European system need to look beyond the current economic crisis to the next crisis, which could result from issues of ageing or technological sustainability.  </P>
        <P>The  Taoiseach asked for our suggestions.  Perhaps the most positive thing we can do during our Presidency is to build a bridge between the core and periphery of Europe.  We do not need a football match between Germany and Greece to tell us that distrust has grown between the core countries of France and Germany and the rest of us.  During the referendum campaign that distrust and fractured loyalty in our attitudes to Europe was clear on the doorsteps of Ireland.  There is a sense that the core countries do not take the interest of the periphery to heart.  In the past Ireland has benefited from being part of a strong peripheral consensus.  Examples of this included reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the growth of Structural Funds during the 1980s and 1990s.  As a peripheral country, Ireland could play a critical role in the Presidency in rebuilding the bridge between core and periphery.  If we are successful, perhaps Spain, Portugal, Greece, Italy and even Cyprus will vote for Ireland in the nextEurovision contest and we might win once again.</P>

	<P>Ba bhre&aacute; liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Taoiseach agus gach rath a ghu&iacute; air agus &aacute;r n-Uachtar&aacute;nacht ar an Aontas Eorpach faoina stiuradh.  In keeping with the best democratic and inclusive traditions of the Seanad, the Independent university Senators are sharing time equally.  I am glad to have an opportunity to welcome and congratulate the Taoiseach.  We would have liked the opportunity to congratulate him at an earlier date but we look forward to greeting him again.  The various contributions by Senators suggest that even on his own side of the House Members harbour the hope or expectation of greeting him again when he is re-elected as Taoiseach.  The Seanad does not mind being on probation but we do not like being on death row.  We recognise that while the checks and balances needed in a democracy often require serious reform, they rarely, if ever, require abolition.  That is a shared view across this House.</P>
        <P>In outlining his important agenda the Taoiseach hit all the key notes, particularly the idea that Ireland must not be given cause to regret going the extra mile.  It is inevitable that the economic crisis will drive much of the agenda of the upcoming Presidency.  Given President Van Rompuy&rsquo;s thoughts on greater fiscal and budgetary integration, many of us will expect the Taoiseach to press the importance of allowing Ireland to maintain its own corporation tax rates.  However, if the only focus is on economic matters that in itself will create crisis in the longer term because we need to return to a Europe of values and a focus on solidarity, respect for life and the dignity of every person.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday, I met a leprechaun who gave me a pot of gold and five wishes for the Irish Presidency.  The first wish, reputation, was mentioned by the Taoiseach in his opening statement.  I have been involved in European affairs in Brussels for years.  When we started we were highly regarded but our reputation has since become tarnished.  It is interesting to see how our reputation has improved again in recent times.  The Taoiseach is doing a wonderful job in maintaining our reputation and the contribution he made today will enhance it further.</P>
        <P>The second wish is speed.  Since I moved from the business world to the affairs of State I have been amazed at how long it takes to get things done, especially in Europe.  The Taoiseach spoke about good faith and good time.  That is what I would love to see at the end of our six month term.</P>
        <P>The third wish is competitiveness.  I believe we can be competitive in Europe but we must recognise that our competitors are the BRIC countries.  We must not hinder or damage ourselves in this regard.  Ireland is Chair of the OSCE but we do not have diplomatic links with wealthy countries like Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.  I hope that at the end of our Presidency people from these countries will know about Ireland and what we can do.</P>
        <P>The next wish is the Common Agricultural Policy, which will be renegotiated in two years&rsquo; time.  Ireland currently exports baby formula to one in seven children around the world.  We can do marvellous things if the CAP is reformed.</P>
        <P>My last wish is the Seanad.  I will not repeat what others have said.  I believe we can convince the Taoiseach that the Seanad is worth keeping.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCrown"><NameTxt>Senator John Crown</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This son of a Leitrim emigrant who became a taxi driver in New York is honoured to have the opportunity to address the Taoiseach in this House.  I ask him to put one big-picture item on his agenda for the Presidency, namely, a more fundamental investigation of the real nature of the current economic crisis.  It is frequently billed as a purely fiscal or financial crisis involving debt, currency policy or unwise decisions on the euro.  We are told that when we fix these problems normality will be restored and we will return to the markets.  However, returning the markets means creating more debt.  Collectively the western community of nations have become heavily addicted to debt.  Increasingly the debt is coming from external sources, including China, the Arab world and other asset-rich countries.  When we say we want to return to the normalcy of the bond markets, we are like a group of poor families who want to move from the normality of taking our food from St. Vincent de Paul and instead take it from big Vinny, the debt collector down the street.  It is important that we reform our economies in such a way that we do not put ourselves in debt to others and, more important, do not place our children and grandchildren in further debt.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not long ago that western countries were wholly independent in food, exported energy and made nearly all the world&rsquo;s manufactured goods.  That has dramatically changed and even economic powerhouses to which our destiny is linked, such as the United States, have seen their manufacturing sectors become devastated.  It is difficult to find an American<Delete> </Delete><Insert>-</Insert>made item in a Walmart store and the products in many shops in Europe are produced outside the EU.  It is no coincidence that the last country which has a strong and thriving economy is Germany.  I ask the Taoiseach to put protecting and developing industry at the top of his agenda.</P>
        <P>On a personal level, I wish to raise with him a radical idea that has been proposed in this House and at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, namely, that Ireland set the goal of banning all commerce in tobacco products by 2030.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Taoiseach every success when he becomes President of Europe on 1 January.  People from the west already occupy the post of Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, President and Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, and County Offaly barely managed to put its own man into the White House before the western wave of political talent took over.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach will take over a Europe suffering mass unemployment, with rates as high as 25% in some countries.  Youth unemployment in Greece is as high as 50%.  The Taoiseach addressed this in his contribution.  There is a euro crisis but there is no exit mechanism for countries and the bank regulations were hopeless.  One-size-fits-all interest rates may not be appropriate and the loss of exchange rate control was a serious impediment.  The Taoiseach may have to deflate some egos in Frankfurt and Brussels.  The euro was extremely badly designed because we were left without emergency tools to deal with the crisis.  I would caution about the Van Rompuy agenda.  Let us tidy up what has gone wrong first before embarking on another phase.  Europe needs a council of economic advisers, modelled on our own fiscal council, because the crisis has had such a drastic impact on mass unemployment in so many member states.  Go raibh maith agat, a Thaoisigh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As father of the House, it gives me great pleasure to welcome the Taoiseach to the Chamber.  He does us an honour by being with us today because he is the duly elected leader of our Parliament.  It is my earnest wish that after the next election he may be elevated to membership of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech was clear, concise and positive.  It was a tonic and the applause with which it was greeted showed that people appreciated it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to have had an opportunity to debate some things, such as the suggestion that Irish and European law and policy are co-terminous.  That is for another day, however, and although it is contentious, it is an interesting idea.  I would also like to hear from the Taoiseach whether the special arrangements on the brink of being made for Spain and Italy can be made retrospective for this country.  We certainly paid for it and that is unfair on taxpayers.</P>
        <P>What concerns me most, however, is that although there is a natural and inevitable emphasis on finance, that should not be exclusive.  I am concerned that in 18 pages there was not a single reference to human rights.  I say this because I am a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has been renamed the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  That is very important but we must not lose sight of human rights.  This country has punched above its weight in many areas, but none more so than human rights, including the European Declaration of Human Rights and the establishment of the European Court of Human Rights.  We can do it again, so I appeal to the Taoiseach not to lose sight of this.</P>
        <P>I have a couple of suggestions to make, including looking at the devastating effect of the ratings agencies and major international financial institutions.  They were responsible for this mess, not the Irish government.  During the Irish EU Presidency, can we consider the establishment of an international financial court?  Such a body could try individuals and organisations for economic crimes against humanity, including the deliberate precipitation of famine for financial profit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathrynReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Kathryn Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Taoiseach.  Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; n&aacute;r th&aacute;inig s&eacute; anseo n&iacute;os luaithe agus nach bhfuil n&iacute;os m&oacute; ama againn le labhairt leis, ach &uacute;s&aacute;idfidh m&eacute; an t-am at&aacute; agam.  F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an athr&uacute; treo at&aacute; ag teacht.</P>
        <P>It seems likely that a significant U-turn is happening with the European Central Bank&rsquo;s policy on senior bondholders.  This is something that Sinn F&eacute;in has argued for in Ireland and in Europe.  It seems the ECB is shifting its position closer to ours.  The logic of that position is that taxpayers should not have to bail out unsuccessful gamblers.  That is why we welcome the change in direction that seems to be under way at European level.</P>
        <P>What does the Taoiseach think of the significance of the statements being made by the ECB president, Mr. Draghi, especially concerning the Spanish banking crisis?  What exactly was the position articulated by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, when this issue was raised?  How much political resistance is there and from where is it emanating?  How likely is that resistance to be overcome?</P>
        <P>C&eacute;n bunt&aacute;iste a bhfeiceann an Taoiseach leis an athr&uacute; seo?  How does the Taoiseach see Ireland, in practice, benefiting from this shift?  How can the policy of equality of treatment be applied after the fact?</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs heard from the Cypriot ambassador regarding his country&rsquo;s EU Presidency and its admirable social agenda in particular.  Cyprus is focusing on youth unemployment as one of the pillars of its EU Presidency.  Will the Taoiseach commit Ireland to a similar socially-centred approach?</P>
        <P>Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute; adeirtear.  T&aacute; an &oacute;ige ag imeacht, na m&iacute;lte d&iacute;obh, ar an traein agus ar na h-eitle&aacute;in.  C&eacute;n todhca&iacute; an bhfeiceann an Taoiseach d&rsquo;&oacute;ige na h&Eacute;ireann i gcomhth&eacute;acs na hEorpa?  It is clear from the emigration and unemployment figures that the Government is failing to tackle youth unemployment nationally.  Does the Taoiseach have any idea how this might be tackled more successfully at European level?  Can he make available to Senators a progress report on the action team on youth unemployment, which was set up by President Barroso?  What has been Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with that team?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach said he wanted the EU Presidency to be a whole-of-Ireland effort.  Senator Leyden mentioned that the reunification of Germany occurred under a former Irish EU Presidency, so maybe we will move towards a reunification of Ireland under our forthcoming EU Presidency.</P>

	<P>If not, however, perhaps we could move towards the commissioning of a Green Paper.  In the interim, in what way is the Taoiseach planning to co-operate with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Assembly to ensure an all-Ireland dimension to the EU Presidency?  I know that staff will be seconded from the North, which is to be welcomed, but given the obvious mutual interests of, for example, farmers and fishermen North and South, what forums will there be to allow for maximum levels of discussion and input?</P>
        <P>An bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist ag an Taoiseach an Uachtar&aacute;nacht a &uacute;s&aacute;id chun st&aacute;das na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach a chur chun cinn?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members of the Seanad for their contributions.  Let me start by saying that I feel I am in a chamber of the condemned here.  The position about the future of the Seanad is very clear; its fate lies in the hands of the people.  The Government, comprising two parties, was elected with a specific mandate.  Part of that mandate was to put a referendum to the people on the abolition of the Seanad and that will happen.  Obviously, once that process starts, the fate of the Seanad is in the hands of the people.  I note the comments that have been made by various Senators in respect of changes to work practices and structures, as well as the analysis they would like to carry out in respect of European legislation.  Senators are clearly aware of the steps that President Van Rompuy has set out in respect of fiscal, economic and monetary union.  In conducting its own business, the Seanad is quite entitled to reflect on these steps and give its views.</P>
        <P>I was interested in Senator O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s comments.  The problem we found on entering Government was that there was confusion abroad about where Ireland was heading.  Business and investment interests like clarity, decisiveness and a horizon against which they can plan.  With respect to all involved, the problem was that there were so many indications or statements of having turned corners and that the garden was in full bloom again, which were not actually true, and they knew that internationally.  It caused a sense of confusion which is why, for instance, in the United States people said, &ldquo;What is your corporation tax rate?  Is this going to change?&rdquo;  That obviously arose from the interest of some of our European colleagues at the time in saying that Ireland must increase its corporation tax rate.  While foreign direct investment is an essential part and a cornerstone of what we have and what we offer, it was very important to make business understand that it was our decision and that the corporation tax rate was not changing.  It takes a while, however, to build up that sense of understanding that there will be no change in that rate.</P>
        <P>What I meant by the reputation being damaged was because of confusion about where we were headed.  It required me to see to it that Ministers attend all their meetings.  They must look at the comprehensive package of who they have to meet on the fringes of the European Parliament and so on.  As regards what we are looking for in any negotiations like these, one is not going to set out a figure.  What we want for the country is the best possible deal that we can get.  As I said in the D&aacute;il, there is no bottom line here, but there is a top line which is the best that can be achieved.</P>
        <P>The discussions that were going on with the troika in respect of the promissory notes and the restructuring or re-engineering of our debt were very complex and tortuous.  The decision made by the Council to break the link between a sovereign and the banks has added a different dimension to this.  That has been clarified by the comment of Commissioner Rehn who said he would like to see this concluded by October.  We have had the support of Commissioner Michel Barnier and the IMF&rsquo;s managing director, Ms Christine Lagarde.  Yesterday&rsquo;s statement by ECB President, Mario Draghi, following a meeting with the Minister for Finance was significant.</P>
        <P>I do not want to tell the Seanad that we have achieved this and that the deal has been concluded.  It is very far from it because we are dealing with different perspectives from different governments.  It is important, however, that the head of the ECB said, in respect of any deal done for Spain and whether it can apply to Ireland in exactly the same way, that it would be reflected in the outcome of the programme for Ireland that will be concluded.  While there has been talk about burning senior bondholders and there was talk of it at the eurogroup meeting, there certainly was not agreement on it.  That position is still evolving.  The Council meeting I attended only referred to two specific countries in the eurozone &mdash; Spain and Ireland.  The sentence about equality of treatment was fundamentally important.  We are seeking the very best deal for our taxpayers.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden was a former Minister of State with responsibility for trade.  I knew the late Mr. Haughey had a direct hand in the winning of the Tour de France, but I was not aware that he had also reunited Germany, which is not a bad legacy to leave behind.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand, of course.  I thank the Senator for his time when he had responsibility for trade.  I agree with him that trade missions are critical.  We have had a number of them in the past 12 months, notably in the area of technology, medical devices, agriculture and so on.</P>
        <P>When I responded to the invitation from Vice President Xi Jinping to go to China, some 90 companies signed agreements and contracts for more than &euro;35 million.  Such a visit has a great impact and pays dividends.  Premier Wen Jiabao was in a position to say that the scientific personnel from China would work with our personnel here on opening the enormous market for Irish beef.  We would be the first country from Europe to have access to the Chinese market which would give us an enormous advantage and an alternative to markets we have at the moment.  That has been followed by a relaxing of the restrictions in the US also.  Our 2020 strategy has clear targets to increase the impact of the agricultural trade in which we are involved and these hold great potential.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I travel the country and visit various firms involved in engineering, technology and software and meet the young people developing our future in the biotech area, genetics, the Internet, robotics, nanotechnology and nano-medicine.  This is happening before our eyes and we have the capacity to be involved in the creation of that future.  When President Clinton spoke at the investment conference he organised in New York in January, he said that the demographics of this country are the best in Europe and will remain so for 25 years, given our birth rate and the young people coming through.  When that is allied to the package on offer here, including tax, talent, track record and technology, it is virtually unbeatable.  It is a matter for companies to make decisions as to where they want to invest.  Given the creativity of our people we proposed a scheme last October which has now become a reality.  Members of the Irish diaspora, which comprises 70 million people, who are involved in businesses considering investing in Europe, are being encouraged to think about Ireland.  If there is a change of direction made in that regard, the initiator is rewarded by a direct payment from the State, provided that jobs result.  The first of those has arrived with 30 or 40 jobs coming to County Carlow, I believe.  The backup in the pipeline of smaller companies from other countries wanting to invest here now runs to more than 100, showing a serious interest in investing in what we have to do here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The answer to the Senator&rsquo;s questions is that there will be a series of ministerial Council meetings here and also trade missions abroad.  I often believe these open doors and can complement what business does.  I meet representatives of the America Chamber of Commerce Ireland on a regular basis.  When chief executives travel we want them to have access to the evolving decisions taken by the Government to improve and open the doors for business.  One of the issues that arose from the Global Irish Economic Forum last October was that we should be far more co-ordinated from a business perspective in the way we view other countries.  For years we treated the Asia-Pacific region as a single homogenous region when clearly it is not.  China and Japan are as different as Antarctica and Saudi Arabia.  While we might have a template for co-ordinating business opportunities, it is important to understand the culture, thinking and tradition of these diverse peoples and to be able to deal with that.  We intend to co-ordinate the activities in the different countries through a co-ordinating role for business which will be done on a <i>pro bono</i> basis and will pay its own dividends.  I will consider the request to address the plenary session.</P>
        <P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Broin as ucht Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  T&aacute; l&iacute;ofacht aige.  I understand the importance of the Presidency.  It has changed in the sense that we no longer have the fleets of limousines because it is all centred in Brussels.  However, the nature of the change since the Lisbon treaty makes it somewhat easier for governments not to need to do a raft of these.  Up to 12 ministerial meetings will be held here in Dublin because of the cost factor &mdash; we do not have the money other countries have to spend on the Presidency.</P>
        <P>The question of ratings agencies was raised on a number of occasions.  We have been very clear on the issue of a transaction tax.  If it is applied globally, it would not put us at a disadvantage when compared with London, Paris or Frankfurt.  We have made that point clearly at a number of different meetings.  We have difficulties with a number of Commissioners with regard to the transposition of directives into legislation here.  I have asked the Ministers in the lead-up to our Presidency to engage with the relevant Commissioners on issues such as habitats, bogs, etc.  Some of these have dragged on for a long time and can be quite complex.  However, there is no reason Ministers on behalf of Government cannot negotiate and see if solutions can be put in place.  They will need to interact with the Parliament during our Presidency in any event.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins raised the issue of youth unemployment.  The issue was discussed at the second last Council meeting and Structural Funds have been allocated in respect of it.  We have spent all our structural funds.  When they are allocated to different envelopes, they cannot be withdrawn from those countries.  However, at the end of the process some Structural Funds across the countries remain unspent.  It is a question of finding creative and imaginative ways of applying that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the issue of youth unemployment generally, it is sad to see people leave.  The point is that the JobBridge programme, Springboard or the use of opening the doors for business opportunities is the best way to create employment.  Many business people are unaware of the range of assistance available to business.  I recently spoke to a person who became unemployed and who by setting up a business and working full time in it can claim back the income tax paid over the previous six years to invest in that business.  That income tax could be as much as &euro;100,000 a year.  In this case it meant approximately &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 to invest in a new business where the person could work on a full-time basis.  Much assistance is available but not drawn down and the Government has a challenge in promoting that.</P>
        <P>Next year will see the 40th anniversary of our entry into the EEC.  There is mistrust between Europe and our people.  In the case of Ireland we are far more acquainted with the details of Europe than those in many other member states.  That is because many countries ratify treaties and other proposals by way of parliamentary majorities.  However, the Irish people are very well versed in those issues and understand the difference between the Council, Parliament and Commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Colm Burke spoke about renewable energy, an issue of considerable importance to us.  A few months ago I signed a strategic partnership agreement with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has been meeting with his counterpart, Charles Hendry, with a view to drawing up a memorandum of understanding providing that we will be able to sell electricity and energy directly to the British market.  The British Government has done an internal analysis on British needs for the foreseeable future, given the change in attitude towards its nuclear programme.  Clearly there is a great deal of private investment wealth to be pumped into the renewable energy market, but it is a case of having the capacity and compliance with the regulatory authorities to bring that about.  The use of these natural assets has major potential for our country for the next 50 years and is an area the Government is interested in developing.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan spoke about the irreversibility of the euro currency and that is the position.  Many doomsayers were suggesting that Greece would collapse and that people would leave or be forced out of the eurozone.  The situation is that European leaders have, at last, grasped the importance of making political decisions and moving on.  While we had decisions in the past, the markets did not believe in them and reflected that before meetings were even finished.  That attitude has now changed.  While there is a difficult road ahead, given the scale of the Spanish and Italian economies and the difficulties of a number of countries, Ireland is now seen as a small country in a very challenging position, but one which is making steady headway towards a point where it can retrieve economic independence.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Senator also asked about a bank inquiry.  I have read the report of the Committee of Public Accounts and we also have an Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Government also has the opportunity now to reflect on whether there is a need to set up another new committee.  I answered questions on this issue in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  I find it extraordinary that in the run-up to the point where the Government made its decision in respect of the bank guarantee, there is no evidence in my Department of any of the delegations that came to the Government or of what was said or the rationale applied to the decision.  I made the point in the D&aacute;il that if one met the community council from, for example, Clonakilty, people would be taking notes so that what was said would be on the record for the future.  The Government wants to reflect on the issue of an inquiry so that it does what is right.  While it is fundamentally important to understand what happened, we do not want a situation where we make a decision and go down the wrong road of interminable inquiries which lead nowhere.  I must respect the decision which the people made last year when asked the question about whistleblowers.  The question was rejected.  It would have made it easier for the Government or for any Government to have an inquiry of this nature.</P>
        <P>The point made about Van Rompuy&rsquo;s programme is important and this is an issue on which the Seanad could reflect.  We will push hard with regard to the 2020 strategy because there is no time to lose and in that sense it is a case of moving on constantly with difficult choices.  We have to make our way while at the same time having other leaders regard Ireland as a country that is not afraid to make political decisions and where its people are moving towards better opportunities and better days ahead.</P>
        <P>I refer to Senator Zappone&rsquo;s comments about the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  A deal of work is ongoing in this regard and I will provide the Senator with further information later.  I have already referred to the Structural Funds.  Ireland has used these funds wisely over the years.  Senator O&rsquo;Donnell spoke about O&rsquo;Connell Street.  I know that Senator Sheahan also commented on this matter recently.  A part of O&rsquo;Connnell Street, at the side of the GPO and down through Moore Street, is the subject of some discussion.  This area contains the houses in Moore Street which were occupied by the leaders of the 1916 Rising.  While the buildings in that locality are all part of a planning application, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is responsible for national monuments and the houses in the centre of Moore Street are designated as a national monument.  The decision about the overall development which impacts on O&rsquo;Connell Street has been referred to by the Senator.  I would like a situation where the principal street of the principal city is cherished by our people and is regarded internationally as being a place of perfect safety where our independence was achieved at the start of the 20th century.  Ireland was one of the first small countries to achieve independence at that time.</P>
        <P>I take the point made by Senator Bacik in respect of the progress being made on the deal.  On the question of when it will happen, Commissioner Rehn says he would like to see it concluded by October.  The IMF needs 12 months notice in cases where it provides financial assistance to countries in its programmes.  The work with the troika and the meetings with the Minister for Finance and Mr. Draghi will continue right through to September.  It is hoped a conclusion can be reached in October but I would like to see it before the end of the year so that arrangements can be made for 2013.</P>
        <P>I note comments about the role and the future role of the Seanad.  The climate change legislation will be dealt with by the climate change committee.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, presented his report on climate change.  This is a challenging area for us.  Yesterday the Cabinet committee heard presentations from the ESB on a range of programmes.  Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe asked about reform of the CAP which is a fundamental issue for Ireland.  We have a view about protection of the family farm concept and the rural development programme.  It is interesting to note that many countries in eastern Europe have a very different attitude in terms of the single farm payment based on acreage as distinct from productivity and this would have a serious impact in the case of Ireland.  However, there cannot be CAP reform without the multi-financial framework or the budget being in place.  This determines the amount in the fund.  The battle which Ireland must face will be to retain the elements of the CAP and reform it in a way that rewards productivity and work without destroying the fabric of the rural programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe also referred to the reform of the cultural institutions.  No institution should be above analysis. We respect the creative and imaginative work of our people in so many areas.  We expect to host a Davos forum for the creative arts, so to speak, in 2014 which will have extraordinary potential for expressing the personality of our people.  No institution should be above analysis with regard to effective expenditure and results.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht will present his programme to the Government shortly.  I refer to the suggestion about building the bridge between the core and the periphery and I appreciate that important point.  However, it is also a case of communicating Europe to the citizen.  We have been far more effective at doing this compared to many other countries where Europe is regarded as being very distant.  Our people clearly understand the relationship between Commission, Parliament and Council.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn mentioned a number of specific areas which are important and these relate to the speed of decision-making and the political follow-through.  I like his comment about competitiveness.  We have come back into the global top 20.  I will endeavour to arrange a ministerial Council meeting on competitiveness to be held in Dublin to be chaired by the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  This is a very important area in a European sense and is even more important for an exporting nation such as Ireland.  I have stated on many occasions that my ambition is for Ireland to be seen by 2016 to be the best small country in the world in which to do business.  We are number one for productivity and flexibility and for availability of skilled labour.  We have a number of other challenges, one of which is competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Senator Crown favours the banning of all commerce in tobacco products by 2030.  These issues are a matter of concern for the Minister for Health who is also a medical doctor.</P>
        <P>He recently put forward a Bill providing for the banning of smoking in cars which contain vulnerable children or anybody else who might be caught in that regard.  I am not sure who big Vinny is or about the reference to taking the food from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and going down the street to big Vinny.  In that regard, employment and business opportunities are the way forward and we have worked hard to try to open those doors and will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris made a point about human rights.  I understand his point and I will convey it to the T&aacute;naiste when I have the opportunity to speak to him.  I am not sure that there will be an international financial court to try persons in banking but if we could start with having a workable and credible facility here, in terms of finding out what happened, we might get to know more of the truth.  In so far as prosecutions of persons who might have been involved in criminal activities in financial circles or banks in Ireland are concerned, a great deal of information has been sent by the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda fraud squad to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The office of the DPP is utterly independent and is obviously assessing that information with a view to considering whether action will follow.</P>

	<P>Senator Reilly raised the issue of emigration.  Nobody likes to see young people leaving.  Up to 90% of young nurses go abroad.  The issue of agency workers and the changing of rosters is one I would like to see addressed so these young people do not have to leave.  Clearly, some leave to gain experience in their work and they return with enhanced experience.  The people I feel sorry for are those who feel hopeless and see no option but to leave.  It is those young people whom we must inspire and motivate and to whom we must prove, through political decisions, that things can be better for them here at home.</P>
        <P>In respect of Northern Ireland, we have appointed a person from Northern Ireland to the permanent representation in Brussels so there will be full acquaintance with the issues, trends and the discussions taking place about the Presidency and our place in Europe.  That is much more meaningful than what applied in the case of Northern Ireland in previous terms.  I do not think that facility was made available when Britain had the Presidency.  However, we want to keep people fully informed in an all-island sense and we are working very closely with the Executive and the Assembly on these matters.</P>

        <P FLI="0">We are proposing to delete the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  We had a lengthy discussion on this issue on Committee Stage and I do not intend to go further into it today.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view?</P>

	<P>Perhaps I can respond before the seconder arrives.  To be helpful on this, we will not accept amendment No. 4.  It relates to Part 3 which deals with animal welfare and the duty to protect it.  Keeping the terminology &ldquo;shall take all necessary steps&rdquo; to prevent cruelty must remain as it is.  With regard to amendment No. 1, it is not unreasonable to partially accept what the Senator is saying.  We will retain the term &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; but add &ldquo;and reasonable&rdquo; after it. It would therefore read &ldquo;take all necessary and reasonable measures&rdquo;.  This is about preventing animals from straying, in other words, issues to do with fencing, maintaining order in fields and so forth.  There may be instances of extreme weather conditions or if a dog has caused panic in a herd which subsequently knocks down a fence.  The phrase, &ldquo;taking all necessary measures&rdquo;, may be a bit to restrictive so I propose the introduction of the word, &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  In the case of amendment No. 4 we think it should remain as tight and as strong as it is.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot accept this amendment because it is almost an impossible task to prevent straying in the context of wind-borne diseases or the spread of disease by wildlife.  I am not convinced it is possible to meet that standard.  I understand the reason for the amendment as a measure for control of wind-borne disease spores but asking a farmer or a keeper of animals to take preventative measures such as the containment of animals against straying is probably a step too far.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment deals with the authorised officer who may for the purposes of subsection (3) issue a permit and may attach such terms and conditions to it as he or she considers appropriate.  Our amendment proposes to delete the words, &ldquo;he or she considers appropriate&rdquo; and substitute, &ldquo;set out by the Minister&rdquo;.  The authorised officer, for the purposes of subsection (3) could issue a permit and may attach such terms and conditions to it as would be set out by the Minister either in the legislation or by regulation.  The authorised officer is left with a very wide choice.  I ask the Minister to introduce a clearer instruction by way of regulation so that the authorised officer, the farming community and owners of animals would know exactly what issues would be dealt with in the permit.  This is the purpose of the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>To be clear, the purpose of this section of the Bill is to allow authorised officers to act quickly to prevent the spread of disease.  We want to empower authorised officers to make a decision to issue a permit if appropriate without having to seek sanction from the Minister&rsquo;s office.  I understand the Senator&rsquo;s request as being a belt and braces approach to ensure that permits are issued in line with Government policy or regulations but this should be the case anyway because authorised officers will be acting under a code of conduct.  I do not wish to reduce the flexibility or timeliness of issuing a permit or a notice in response to a certain situation.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment was discussed on Committee Stage.  The prohibition on animal cruelty is referred to in the legislation which states that a person shall not do or fail to do anything or cause to permit anything to be done to an animal that causes injury.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>My concern with this proposed wording is that it may provide an excuse for neglect.  Whether an action is deliberate or by mistake, if it causes unnecessary suffering there needs to be a consequence for such an action.  The definition of &ldquo;unnecessary suffering&rdquo; is noted in the third line of the paragraph which the Senator proposes to amend.  It is defined clearly on page 9 and this definition gives a judge in court an opportunity to make a judgment as to what is unnecessary suffering.  We do not want people in defence of their actions to say they did not intend to cause suffering, that the action was not intentional.  I do not wish to make light of it.  It is difficult enough to be successful in court cases dealing with unnecessary cruelty.  I want to have it clear that a person shall not do or fail to do anything that causes injury or unnecessary suffering to an animal.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 14, line 7, after &ldquo;terrified&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;unless accepted as a normal farming activity/method&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Amendments Nos. 7, 11 and 14 to 16, inclusive, relate to normal farming practices.  They provide for a distinction in the legislation between the owner of a budgerigar, fish tank, pet dog or cat and what would be described as normal farming practices for productive farming, that is, farmers who would be registered under a herd or flock number.  Under the legislation the Minister is proposing to put codes of practice, which are voluntary codes at present, on a statutory footing.  The Minister has said he will talk to the farming organisations about that.  However, given that he is doing this under the legislation, does he believe that the words &ldquo;normal farming or agricultural practices&rdquo; could be included in the legislation?  I am not sure if it can be done.  Is there a legal issue if that wording was added or would it be acceptable?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We have put a great deal of thought into this since Committee Stage.  One of the problems is that there is no definition for normal farm practice.  In fact, it changes all the time.  Last January, for example, a new set of animal welfare regulations relating to poultry was introduced by the EU, and next January there will be a new set of regulations relating to the pig industry and loose sow housing.  There is a set of animal welfare requirements under cross compliance which does and will change from time to time.  Therefore, I do not wish to tie our hands.  If we insert the phrase &ldquo;normal or necessary farm practices&rdquo;, we will have to try to define it at the start of the legislation because instantly there would be an issue about what the phrase means.  We are trying to deal with it, but we will do so at the end of section 15 when we bring the legislation to the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>One of the issues farming organisations raised with us was the presentation of bulls at marts, for example, when they are led around by a chain for the purposes of showing or presentation.  We are looking at inserting a new subsection (13) at the end of section 15 which would say something to the effect that nothing in subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) or (<i>e</i>) prevents the training of an animal by persons competent to train the animal on the premises where the animal is normally kept provided unnecessary suffering is not thereby caused to the animal, the public does not have access to the place where the training occurs and any activity involved in the training of the animal is not prohibited by animal health and welfare regulations.  There was a concern that the breaking in of horses or the training of bulls for presentation at shows and so forth would be considered unreasonable in terms of unnecessary suffering, and trying to clarify that was difficult.  We are proposing to insert a wording along those lines when the legislation is in the D&aacute;il.  That is about as far as we can go.  Otherwise, we will create all sorts of other problems around the definition of acceptable or normal farm practices.  To be honest, it would cause a headache that we will not be able to solve about a series of areas.</P>
        <P>All these amendments deal with the same issue.  We have tried to deal with the specific concern about bulls with a proposed amendment which we are considering introducing in the D&aacute;il.  Outside of that, however, we could create more problems than we would solve if we accepted these amendments.  Nevertheless, I understand the thinking behind them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and acknowledge the thinking he has put into this.  The example I gave on Committee Stage was trying to put a bull into a trailer, with the bull being tied or harnessed and getting excited and the farmer trying to keep the bull under control while protecting their own safety.  The same situation would occur in a show ring where there are many people around.  What the Minister said is practical and we support it.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 14, line 21, to delete &ldquo;or a code of practice&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This refers to the codes of practice relating to productive farming, which I mentioned a few minutes ago.  The codes are in place at present on a voluntary basis.  The difficulty is that when one speaks to a farmer about codes of practice they will say they have been doing this for years, they were reared on a farm and they know how to produce beef, herds of animals and flocks of sheep or lambs.  We will not oppose codes of practice.  There must be specific codes of practice, particularly for animals such as donkeys and horses, and I am sure this extends to horses and possibly racehorses in addition to pets.  The fact that there are existing voluntary codes of practice within the productive agricultural sector would suggest that hopefully they would not become more than that, but if the codes of practice are to be put on a statutory footing it would be important that the Minister consult with the farming organisations before doing that.  I am sure that is his intention, to try to arrive at some type of generic agreement on it rather than introducing a statutory code and getting farmers&rsquo; backs up and making them unduly concerned.  The inclusion of the codes of practice in the legislation give them a stronger legal footing which would mean that if one is in non-compliance with a code of practice, one would be in breach of the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Including the term &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; here is to allow a farmer to have a defence if they are accused of doing something that is unnecessarily cruel or whatever.  If they can show that their farming practice is consistent with the code of practice that has been agreed, it could be an argument in their defence.  Rather than it being a problem, the opposite might well be the case.  As I have said repeatedly, before we propose any new codes of practice or conduct regarding animal welfare we will have quite broad consultation.  I have consultation on a regular basis with the farming organisations on a series of matters and this would not be any different.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 14, line 30, to delete &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;evidence&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments seek to substitute &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; for &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo;.  I have tabled this amendment again although I accepted what the Minister said on Committee Stage, that the authorised officers need teeth and the wherewithal to be able to go into a premises without the necessity of having evidence.  They need the freedom to do that.  However, an authorised officer will be appointed by the Minister under the legislation, a local authority or an appointed organisation, which could potentially be an animal health or welfare organisation that has a service level agreement with the Department.</P>
        <P>The fear in farming circles is that an inspector could have an issue with one or two farmers and arrive at their farms unduly without evidence, citing reasonable grounds for inspection.  While this is not the intention of the legislation, it may be the interpretation of some officers.</P>
        <P>I accepted the position of the Minister on Committee Stage but resubmitted the amendment in order to have further discussion.  I am not sure whether the Minister will be willing to consider my proposal when he brings the legislation to the D&aacute;il in the autumn, thereby making the distinction again between pets and animals on productive farms.  Farmers fear they will receive an undue number of inspections from authorised officers claiming to be acting on reasonable grounds rather than on the basis of evidence.  I appreciate that an officer needs to have flexibility in regard to inspections.  My amendment may be a little too crude.  Is there a compromise that could be reached?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer lies in how we choose and train authorised officers and the code of standards by which they operate.  Consider the case of somebody using the animal welfare helpline to inform the Department he has seen real evidence of severe cruelty in a house or garden down the road and that he wants an inspector to investigate.  As far as I am concerned, this presents reasonable grounds for an inspector to knock on the householder&rsquo;s door, state there has been a complaint and request a discussion, as opposed to having to gather evidence whereby people with cameras would have to take photographs through hedges, for example.  That is not what we want, either for animal welfare organisations, concerned citizens or farmers.</P>
        <P>Some of the grouped amendments pertain to taking action to prevent disease outbreak.  If there are reasonable grounds, but no evidence <i>per se</i>, to suspect a significant disease problem on a farm is being covered up or that bodies are being buried to cover-up acts of cruelty or starvation, based on the report of a farm worker, it ought to be possible to take some action quickly to prevent the spread of disease or extreme cruelty, as in the case of malnutrition.  I want our officers to be able to make decisions early to deal with the problem.  If they make a mistake, there needs to be a code of practice to deal with it.  The decision-making process needs to be structured.  Ultimately, it is a question of getting really good authorised officers, maintaining standards and training the officers to behave in a professional way, be it on the farm or other private or commercial property.  This is what we will try to do.  We would weaken the thrust of the legislation if we required all action to be based on evidence.  The problem in the past was that one had to gather evidence before taking action, thus resulting in unnecessary and frustrating delays.  If we do give the proposed powers to authorised officers, it is important that they operate according to a pretty strict code of standards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s statement that the crux of the matter pertains to how authorised officers fulfil their duties.  It is a question of their appointment.  From my interpretation of the legislation, there are three ways in which an authorised officer can be appointed, namely, through the Minister, through the local authority structure or through a welfare organisation.  Which organisations does the Minister have in mind?  One could end up having authorised officers appointed all over the place by different organisations, such as local authorities and welfare organisations.  I would much prefer to see authorised officers appointed only by the Minister or Department.  Those who know something about agriculture and who are dealing with it daily are in the Department.  I propose that there be departmental or ministerial appointment rather than local authority autonomy in the appointment of authorised officers.  The fear is that the local authorities, given the financial constraints they are under, may use appointment as a money-raising exercise rather than a means of ensuring animal welfare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fair point.  I envisage that, from an agricultural perspective, there will not be any change to existing practice.  Departmental veterinarians who understand farming and agricultural practice will be involved.  Veterinarians have varying levels of experience and qualifications.  If one is to carry out a farm inspection, one needs to understand how farming, livestock management and husbandry work, and one must have an understanding of all the associated regulations.</P>
        <P>I would like to see veterinary nurses having a role with regard to animal cruelty outside the farm setting.  Legislation was finalised this year giving more recognition to the qualifications of veterinary nurses.  The standards applying to that category have been improved in recent years.  There is an opportunity to include some veterinary nurses.  In limited circumstances, we should consider service agreements with organisations that have a proven track record in animal welfare, including the ISPCA and, perhaps, the Dogs Trust.  We would need to sit down with these organisations and be absolutely satisfied that the kinds of people who will become authorised officers will have the necessary experience, qualifications and judgment to make consistent decisions, as opposed to decisions driven by ideology or what may be very well-meaning views.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, we must operate according to a code of standards consistent with the legislation we are now passing.  We require very consistent application of the law by all the authorised officers.  There are many very qualified and experienced staff already inspecting, acting upon and reporting on animal welfare cases.  It would be a waste to ignore the skill set of many of the experienced staff and not to have them as authorised officers working with us.  I assure the Senator I will be quite cautious in putting in place the service level agreements.  It is important that we do not undermine the credibility of authorised officers generally by employing one or two people who will give the whole service a name it does not deserve.  A balance must be struck but I assure the Senator I am very sensitive to it.</P>

	<P>This concerns the humane destruction of animals.  Section 23 indicates that an authorised officer or veterinary practitioner should carry out this action, setting out when it should be done if an animal is fatally or severely injured, where it would prevent the animal from further suffering.  We are raising the issue because of cost, as knackery personnel could be given the scope to do the act.</P>
        <P>Section 23(2) states, &ldquo;If an authorised officer, a veterinary practitioner acting as such or a person specified in animal health and welfare regulations&rdquo;, and knackery personnel are professionals.  They deal with the issue on a daily basis and they could be allowed to put down an animal and put it out of its suffering if an animal is fatally injured.  In west Connemara or west Donegal there may be very few vets on the ground.  If an animal became injured on a farm, a vet could be on the other side of the county and it could take him or her half a day to return.  An animal could be suffering unnecessarily in that time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to clarify a few issues.  This section was the subject of quite a bit of discussion on Second Stage.  Section 23(1) covers the concern that has been outlined and expressed to me by farming organisations, whereby if farmers cannot get a vet or cannot afford a vet, if it is a fairly straightforward case of an animal breaking a leg and suffering, and it is possible to get somebody from a knackery quickly who is more than competent in putting an animal down, it should be facilitated.  That is covered by &ldquo;Subject to this section, a person shall not kill a protected animal or cause or permit another person to kill a protected animal, unless the person killing the animal is competent to kill it in accordance with animal health and welfare regulations (if any) and does so in such manner as to inflict as little suffering as possible in the circumstances&rdquo;.  That includes knackery personnel as they are competent in such action.</P>
        <P>Subsection (2) includes the clause &ldquo;he or she may, without having to seek the consent of its owner or the person in control of it, kill the animal or cause the animal to be killed or destroyed in such manner as to inflict as little suffering as possible&rdquo;.  That concerns somebody who can make a decision to put down an animal without even talking to the owner or a person in charge.  In those circumstances we have indicated that an authorised officer, a veterinary practitioner acting as such or a person specified in animal health and welfare regulations with an opinion that an animal can be put down can do so.</P>
        <P>In other words, if somebody rings a vet saying there has been an accident on the road and a car has crashed into a bullock, with the animal lying on the road very badly injured, in much pain, and nobody can find the owner, the vet can put down the animal.  In essence, he or she can make the judgment call.  We have not specifically named knackery personnel as part of that list because it is a different category involving an authorised officer or vet.  We have the capacity to be able to put in knackery personnel as part of the animal welfare regulations at a later stage if we wish to do so.</P>
        <P>The main concern here is for farmers who have to put down an animal and do not want to have to go through the expense of calling a vet if it is a fairly straightforward procedure, as they can get somebody from the knackery yard to do it.  Alternatively, farmers can do it themselves if they are competent.  That is allowed for in the first subsection.  We may have confused matters and although I know what the Senator is proposing, we are dealing with a separate issue, and people do not have a problem with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the owner of an abattoir be covered under section 23(1) or 23(2)?  It would probably be section 23(1).</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see why they would not.  That is a case of humane destruction of an animal.  The Bill applies to all cases and not just the farmyard.  Such action may be required at a show, in an abattoir or a person&rsquo;s back yard.  There is no distinction made between farming and non-farming activity.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 23, line 36, after &ldquo;injured&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or diseased&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will not press the amendment but I understand the Minister will consider this matter again.  The various paragraphs in the section refer to &ldquo;severely injured or diseased&rdquo; animals but subsection (4) refers only to animals which are &ldquo;injured&rdquo; and there is no reference to an animal that is diseased.  This is a concern about consistency throughout the section.  I understand the Minister has a view and although we will withdraw the amendment, the Minister might suggest a compromise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelComiskey"><NameTxt>Senator Michael Comiskey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment but I am agreeable to what has been outlined.  We had discussions with the officials and there may be a compromise on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I can see what the Senators are saying.  The subsection states: &ldquo;Nothing in this section prevents the occasional killing by or on behalf of the owner of an individual protected animal that is injured.&rdquo;  There is a distinction between that and the subject of 23(2)(<i>b</i>), whereby, essentially, a person comes across an animal that is in a particularly bad way, either injured or diseased and dying.  The person would be putting the animal out of suffering.  Subsection (4) is essentially about occasional killing or making a decision to put down an animal.</P>
        <P>I do not want to allow a farmer to put down a diseased animal to try to hide the fact that there may be a disease outbreak in the herd.  If a farmer had an animal with BSE and did not want to declare it, he or she might put it down and bury it.  A farmer would be able to put down such an animal and bury it if it broke its leg, and that would be perfectly consistent with regulations.  However, it would not be consistent with regulations to put down an animal that had a disease.  The issue is trying to make a distinction between an injured animal that is dying and an animal that has a disease.  We do not want to put in place a charter for farmers to hide the fact that there is a disease outbreak in a herd.  That is the distinction between the two paragraphs.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Both of these amendments relate to the animal health levies.  What is being looked at here are additional charges on farmers, which is not welcome in the industry.  Without going into any great detail, will the Minister outline what levies are to be anticipated and what the additional costs would be?  These costs could potentially be set by regulations.  The Minister will know, particularly in the current climate, that farmers are finding it exceptionally difficult to survive.  In my county and along the west of Ireland many animals are housed inside because the land is so wet.  Perhaps the land is better in the east and in Cork but in the north west from where Senator Comiskey and I come and in Cavan from where Senator Wilson comes it is very wet and the animals are in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the rainfall has been higher in Cork than in Donegal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps, for a change.  The purpose of tabling these amendments relates to costs.  I am very concerned about a possible increase in costs for farmers as a result of animal health levies being introduced.  I am not sure what the costs will be, but according to section 26 they will include milk received for processing and animals slaughtered in an establishment registered or approved, or acquired to be registered or approved, for the purposes of an act adopted by an institution of the European Union.  I assume this means slaughter houses in the State.  It also includes live exports.  Charges on farmers already exist but the animal health levy is a new departure.  What will the increased cost be and how will it be borne out?  In the Minister&rsquo;s view how will it affect farmers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The sections are a reflection of the existing legislation, which is the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act 1979.  It gives the Minister or any future Minister the power to introduce a new levy should he or she deem it appropriate in new areas in animal health and disease control.  It also puts in place a number of requirements to be met by the Minister before he or she can do so.  Where a Minister proposes to make regulations under this section a draft of the regulations should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until the resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  It is also clear that any Minister who wants to introduce a new regulation to introduce a new levy will have to do so with the industry as otherwise a series of non-compliance issues will arise.</P>
        <P>Consider the process with regard to introducing a financing mechanism for the new dairy quality assurance scheme we intend to introduce over the next 12 to 18 months.  A huge amount of consultation has taken place with all of the stakeholders, including processors, the Irish Dairy Board, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society and farming organisations.  There is no question of this legislation when it is enacted resulting in increased costs for farmers.  It will give a Minister power at a future point in time to introduce a new levy under certain conditions and he or she will have to go through the necessary consultation to do so, certainly from a political point of view.</P>
        <P>Section 26 is about the levy itself and section 28, which Senator O&rsquo;Domhnaill also proposes to delete, is about the mechanism for payment and its implementation.  Quite frankly I think we would be mad not to give a Minister the power to introduce new levies if it was deemed appropriate to do so at some stage in the future.  To give an example, at present I am being asked to introduce a pig levy to fund research into pig breeding and efficiency in pig farming by Teagasc.  The industry is asking me to do this.  We must have the power to be able to introduce a statutory levy and a legal mechanism to do so.  This does not mean I will try to ask farmers to pay a lot more.  However, the mechanism must be there legally to allow me do so if it makes sense.  Sometimes the industry will not be overly happy about it but it may be necessary.  In other instances the industry may ask for it because it wants to see money being collected to be spent on developing new markets, quality control, disease control or research.  There must be some law and structure on the introduction of a statutory levy, and this is updated in the Bill given everything else that we are doing.  Politically if one wants to be unhelpful one can paint this as the Minister threatening to introduce a set of levies but most of us know it would be political suicide to do so without a consultation process.  It is not how the industry works in Ireland.  It is in other countries but not here.  We are putting in place a legal framework for future decisions that would be justified and laid before the Houses for comment and approval before they are introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomSheahan"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Tom Sheahan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, in the interests of being helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  I listened carefully to the Minister and I do not for one minute dispute what he said.  However, when any Minister of the day, even one from my party in the future, decides to introduce a levy and, after signing a regulation, lays it before the Houses of the Oireachtas and seeks the approval of the D&aacute;il and Seanad, the Members on the Government side will have to support the Minister.  I did not table any amendments to section 27 which states that a person shall not export an animal live from the State unless before export he or she pays the amount of outstanding animal health levy payable to the Minister.  I do not suggest that over the next 18 months or two years the Minister will do this, but his successors in the following years may decide on the basis of this legislation to blame a previous Minister and state he or she was afforded the function of tabling animal health levies under the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation is in place already.  We are merely updating it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>It is different.  The Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act 1979 did not place obligations with regard to the exportation of cattle as I understand it.  Is it possible to get clarification on this?  Perhaps this is the case.  I would like clarification on the exact fees in place at present and what are the anticipated increases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are no anticipated increases because we do not propose an increase.  We propose a legal framework to allow a Minister to make a decision in the area if he or she wishes to with regard to a disease levy.  To be clear, the receipts for 2011 for the bovine disease levy and compensation amounted to &euro;5.67 million.  On-farm market valuation compensation for 2011 amounted to &euro;13.781 million and add-on compensation schemes for 2011 amounted to &euro;2.873 million.  I need to check with regard to the figures for compensation but I would say it is compensation for farmers with disease outbreaks.</P>
        <P>A levy scheme is in place at present.  We have levies in factories with regard to the contribution to the work of Bord Bia for the meat industry.  There is also a series of levies in the dairy industry.  This is not a new concept.  The 1979 Act covers the issue raised by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill with regard to bovine slaughter and bovine export.  I would not like to mislead people.  This legislation modernises the 1979 Act and gives powers to the Minister to be able to introduce additional levies around animal health if he or she wants to do so.  The idea that we would not give a Minister the power to do that would be extraordinary.  It is a political call for a Minister to make that decision but to prevent a Minister from having the flexibility to introduce levies as a way to prevent levies from being introduced at some stage in the future goes against what we all stand for, which is to try to give the political system the power to be able to make decisions, as appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to press the amendment but I am not reassured.  I know what the Minister is saying and the clarification was helpful but it is a question of additional charges.  I will not press the amendment but I will have another look at it and get my colleague in the D&aacute;il to table an amendment because I know time is against us.  I would be very concerned that if additional charges were imposed on farmers, it would create difficulties.  I am not suggesting charges will come in by way of this legislation but a Minister, some time in the future, will have the power to use his or her discretion by way of regulation.  That is where the difficulty lies.  I will not press the amendment.  We will hold our counsel and re-word the amendment so that it can be tabled in the D&aacute;il.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to the destruction and disposal of animals.  It proposes to delete the word &ldquo;identified&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;possible to identify&rdquo;.  The section would then read that it is not possible to identify the animal in accordance with animal health and welfare regulations.  Amendment No. 22 proposes to delete the words &ldquo;is not accompanied by&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;it is not possible to provide&rdquo;.  That relates to the records.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept these amendments.  I do not know why the Senator is introducing this unnecessary level of doubt.  If an animal cannot be identified, then the Minister should have the power to destroy it rather than have the terminology proposed that if it is not possible to identify an animal, then the Minister may have the power.  One would have to have a discussion and argument about whether it is possible to identify the animal, which could involve taking DNA samples and blood tests and trying trace an animal back to where it may have come from in a previous herd.</P>
        <P>What we are talking about here is the smuggling of animals and animals which have had the tags taken out of their ears, in some cases deliberately while in others, not deliberately.  We have to be able to respond to the potential spread of disease if we do not know where an animal has come from and we cannot identity the owner rather than have to go through a rigmarole of trying to establish whether it is possible to identify the animal.  The Minister should be able to make a call on this.</P>
        <P>I to some extent understand what the Senator is saying, that there should be an onus to establish whether it is possible to identify an animal.  In case there is a concern here, this will not be a case of the Minister putting down a sheep in Sligo which has had the tag pulled out of its ear in a hedge and where nobody can identify it.  There needs to be a reason for these things.</P>
        <P>Section 30 states that the Minister may direct that an animal be killed or that a carcass, animal product, animal feed or other thing be destroyed or disposed of where, in the opinion of the Minister,  it is affected with a disease or a disease agent or it may be or is suspected of being affected with a disease or a disease agent.  This is about trying to stop the spread of disease in the case of an outbreak primarily.  If an animal is wandering down the road and nobody knows who owns it, we need to be able to destroy it, if that is appropriate.  The certainty in the language currently is much better than what is proposed.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 29, line 46, to delete &ldquo;one or more persons as valuers&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a panel of valuers&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to the panel of valuers.  We had a lengthy enough discussion on the independence of the valuation panel on Committee Stage.  We spoke about the need to give the applicant or the farmer the opportunity to select his or her own valuer from a wide and varied list from the Department rather than a list of two or three valuers.  I recall vividly the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I am not sure if it is an area which could be looked at.  The Minister suggested some tweaking at the time, so I am not sure if there is anything he can do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are trying to put in place a wording to reflect the conversation we had and to try to get the balance right between putting in place a fair system of valuation and assessment, which does not take a long time and ensures people get paid, but which is not a situation where the farmer chooses his or her valuer.  In the vast majority of cases, I am sure there would be no problem with that but we do not want to leave anybody open to the accusation that he or she is choosing a friend to value his or her animals.  Rather than trying to deal with these amendments one by one, I propose that we look at changing the section more fundamentally.  I have a proposed wording which is not perfect but explains what we are at.  It states that the Minister may, by regulation under this section, provide for the manner in which a valuer or an arbitrator is chosen to act in a particular case whether by lot, by agreement, by the applicant or by the Minister, or by another method the Minister may prescribe in a regulation; the time limits within which a valuation or part valuation process is to be completed; the consequences of failure to comply with the time limit provided for the regulations; and such incidental supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister to be necessary for the purposes of regulation.</P>
        <P>In other words, we are trying not to put a hard and fast structure in place.  What is proposed in the Bill is that the Minister chooses the panel of valuers and the person from the panel who values.  If there is an appeal, the Minister chooses the appeals officers and if it goes to arbitration, the Minister also chooses the arbitration officer.  There was a sense that farmers may feel hard done by if an officer or a valuer who is chosen happens to be somebody with whom they have a difficulty.  It may be more appropriate to deal with it under regulation than in hard and fast law.  We are looking at that with an open mind before the Bill comes to the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 39, line 42, to delete &ldquo;District Court&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">My amendment is on animal health and welfare notices and appeals and refers to section 42(2)(<i>b</i>) where an appeal notice can be lodged with the District Court.  The other Senators and I suggest that it can be made to the Minister instead of availing of the legal process.  We discussed the matter the other day.  We all know that the courts are jammed because so many people are taking cases, for example, against insurance companies.  If one talks to anyone in the legal profession they will say the same.  I do not have a legal background but we all know that the courts are clogged up.</P>
        <P>Making a provision where people must lodge their appeal with the District Court means they must deal with a logjam and a financial burden.  We propose, under sections 43(1) and 42(2)(<i>b</i>), that appeals should be lodged with the office of the Minister.  The other day we suggested that an independent appeals office could be established to deal with them but perhaps that would impose an unnecessary cost on the State.  For example, the social welfare appeals office is in free fall which is shameful because there are 35,000 appeals in its system.  I do not suggest that the same will happen in this instance.  If the criteria for a genuine case was laid down then a person could interpret that information and present his or her written appeal to the Minister&rsquo;s office where he or she could then make a determination.  We all hope that the Minister&rsquo;s office would not be left with thousands of appeals.  Obviously one or two of the Minister&rsquo;s officials would have to lead the section.  My suggestion is sensible and would also give the Minister an independent oversight when dealing with the legislation.</P>
        <P>I am not sure how the Minister views my suggestion.  An appeals unit in the Department is important and I am reluctant to support a District Court process because of its cost and heavy workload.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the debate on Committee Stage I have educated myself on the system.  On the last occasion I talked about the theory behind it but I had not realised that existing compliance notices are given to farmers by authorised officers in order to keep cases out of the courts.  The whole point of a welfare notice, or a compliance notice as they are currently called, is to keep people out of the courts and solve problems without imposing fines in a heavy handed manner.  At present farmers in receipt of a compliance notice can lodge an appeal with the District Court if they feel they have been unfairly treated.  There are only three or four appeals per year so the number involved is small.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">I propose to extend the provision beyond farms.  From a farmer&rsquo;s point of view the system will stay the same and compliance notices will become welfare notices when it is a welfare issue.  There are other issues around compliance that are not welfare related.  The idea of setting up a separate appeals body in my Department, even in my office, would mean that a second person would have to carry out an inspection and talk to farmers.  Every time a welfare notice is issued an appeal will be lodged in the majority of cases.  It will be almost on a routine basis.  If there is no cost incurred then people will automatically lodge an appeal when they feel slightly hard done by and the work involved will be doubled just for the same outcome.  The social welfare appeals system makes it so easy for people to lodge an appeal that they automatically avail of the option and is one of the reasons that the system is clogged.  Therefore, a large number of appeals are lodged leading to the system being clogged.  This creates a large amount of work and reassessment often for the same outcome.  I am anxious for that not to happen in this instance.</P>
        <P>The best way to deal with appeals is through a code of conduct adhered to by my Department&rsquo;s authorised officers.  It would outline their behaviour and how they should interact with farmers or anyone else that they must issue welfare notices to.  If people object strongly then it would start a conversation that would involve, potentially, a more senior district vet.  For example, if there was a real uncertainty about a welfare notice being fair, or resulted in questioning and protest, our authorised officers could try to reflect that in their behaviour or seek a second opinion.  To put in place a free formal appeals process that does not involve the District Court will mean that somebody somewhere, whether that is in my office, a local authority office or anywhere else, will have to reassess the entire case and start all over again.  A welfare notice is a short and sharp intervention.  I liken it to giving someone a yellow card and a warning.  It tells people that they should not do something, the corrections that must be made, that if they are carried out the notice will be forgotten but, if not, court proceedings will follow.  The idea of having a free appeals system would mean that people would shut their door in the face of an authorised officer and say that they will appeal the notice whatever it states.</P>
        <P>In most cases I would support a quick appeals process but creating one here would generate a lot of extra work for ourselves and undermine a welfare notice where its aim is to talk to somebody and correct animal welfare issues through discussion.  I have changed my mind on the issue having examined the compliance notice system and I am comfortable in my belief that we do not need a separate appeals system.  It would generate more delays and a lot more work.  If people feel hard done by then the authorised officers will reflect that in their own behaviour and perhaps seek a second opinion.  If there is a real disagreement then a person can resort to the District Court.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his explanation.  As I said the other week, the Department of Social Protection is probably a bad example.  Unfortunately, genuine applicants are being refused, even cancer patients.  In Donegal the other week I discovered that a cancer patient had been refused a disability allowance even though he is dying and is in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  He lodged an appeal but that will take six months.  Sadly, he may not be alive to hear the result of his appeal.  There is a difficulty with the case and it is not something that happened overnight.</P>
        <P>The thinking behind my amendment was that a District Court appeal may be beneficial but there are lots of negatives too.  Many people will apply and there are only seven days to lodge an appeal on receipt of a welfare notice.  Let us bear in mind that people will also apply for free legal aid.  The notices cover farm animals and domestic pets.  Some of these people will apply for free legal aid and unemployed people with animals may qualify for same.  Such measures will cost the State a lot more because people will lodge appeals when they know that they can receive free legal aid.  People have only seven days to lodge an appeal and the District Court hearing will involve a wait of between six to nine months.  It takes that length of time for an appeal to be heard in the northern District Court circuit.  People will use that delay as a defence in the meantime and that will also delay justice.  A simple, pragmatic straightforward appeals system operated by the Minister&rsquo;s office with results given within three or four weeks would mean a much faster process and cost a lot less to the Exchequer.  It might cost the Department more but overall it would cost a lot less.   The judge is already employed and staff are present.  The court will be sitting but will deal with additional cases.  The vast majority of farmers are in compliance because they want to produce the best quality stock they can.  The Bill has been extended to cover a multitude of pets and other animals, and rightly so.  In the past week a donkey was abused whose owner claims was not abused, but that person would be potentially eligible for free legal aid and could take a case in the District Court.  The legal costs would add up and I am afraid of adding to legal expenses.  I will not put my amendment to a vote, but I ask the Minister to reflect and take another look at this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Let us be clear.  If somebody appeals this decision to the Minister&rsquo;s office, in all likelihood we will have the same result if there is consistency.  They will appeal the decision to the District Court.  One could have a similar case to that outlined by the Senator, a difficult individual who should not be minding animals abusing a donkey.  An authorised officer may go in and issue a notice, outlining the need to change behaviour, and stating the person will be taken to court if the behaviour does not change.  In some cases, an authorised officer may confiscate the animal if he thinks the person or persons are not capable of changing their behaviour.  There have been cases of people with a mental illness who are not capable of minding animals.  One can issue welfare notices, but the behaviour will not change.  Authorised officers must be able to act and seize animals in those circumstances.  What we are discussing is whether the Minister must put in place a secondary round of assessment that is linked to his office and is accessed free of charge.  This would necessitate the Minister sending an official to places such as Caherciveen or up to Donegal to investigate what an authorised officer has been trained to inspect and make a judgment on.  It would be more practical to be able to discuss with an authorised officer how to deal with a case where people feel they are hard done by and perhaps get a second opinion locally before confirming the welfare notice.  Ultimately the likelihood of the Department overturning a decision from an authorised officer is low.  A person who feels he has been treated unfairly after making the second appeal will go to court.  It is unlikely that a person who is abusing animals will want to go to court.  That is the reason that we have so few appeals on the current compliance notices.  Farmers are delighted to take the compliance notice and implement it because they want the issue to go away.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A person would want to feel really hard done by to go to court.  I do not think an appeal system to the Minister will solve that, but we will create a significant headache and potential lobbying of the Minister on individual welfare incidents on farms or in commercial settings.  This would create an unnecessary layer of work and undermine the work of our authorised officers.  Where there is a strong protest or objection from a person who has been the subject of an inspection and welfare notice by an authorised officer, that can be dealt with through the code of conduct for authorised officers.  I think an official appeal mechanism that is free of charge will just delay justice.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for their interaction and co-operation.  This is a major Bill, with some complex elements.  The debate in the Seanad has exposed some weaknesses which I think we will improve on in the D&aacute;il.  It was very worthwhile to introduce it in the Seanad and we have had good interaction on a series of issues. I hope that my response to them was satisfactory.</P>
        <P>I thank my officials &mdash; Mark Winkelmann, Dermot Murphy and John Moloney &mdash; who are the architects of this legislation.  They have done a really good job.  I look forward to bringing it to the D&aacute;il.  I may return to the Seanad to discuss the changes made in the D&aacute;il.  I hope to have the legislation finalised before the end of the year.</P>

We approached all Stages of the debate in a constructive and engaging manner, bearing in mind that this is a very important Bill to protect pets and animals on the farm and in the home.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Minister and his officials Mark Winkelmann, Dermot Murphy and John Moloney on the work they have done on the Bill.  The Minister has shown a willingness to accept amendments where he saw fit to do so.  A number of issues remain to be teased out in the other House.  The general thrust of the Bill is important for the country as a whole.  We have seen evidence of the abuse of animals and the devastation caused by the negligence of individuals.  It is important to put animal welfare on a statutory footing.  It is also important that the welfare organisations that protect animals have a role.</P>

        <P>We are grateful to the Minister for bringing the Bill to the Seanad first.  It has been a fine example not just of how the Seanad can operate, but also of how the legislative process can be very a co-operative, open and transparent business.  The Minister has co-operated with all of us and we have tried to raise as many issues as possible with him.  His officials have been very much a public part of that process which is very welcome because often there is a feeling that officials are hidden.  We do not see the work they do or the effort they put in to the development of legislation and so we are particularly grateful to them.  I commend the Minister on his efforts and his personal commitment to this Bill as well as on his command of the brief.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 23</P>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 16, before section 23, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;23.&mdash;The following is substituted for section 44 of the Act of 2003&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;44.&mdash;(1) A person shall not be surrendered under this Act if:</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) the offence specified in the European arrest warrant issued in respect of him or her was committed or is alleged to have been committed in a place other than the issuing state, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) the act or omission of which the offence consists does not, by virtue of having been committed in a place other than the State, constitute an offence under the law of the State;</P>
        <P LI="2">(2) In deciding whether the act or omission of which the offence consists constitutes an offence under the law of the State, the Court shall not have regard to the nationality of the respondent or any other person nor to the particular basis upon which jurisdiction is asserted by the issuing state&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As I noted on Second Stage of the Bill, I welcome the acknowledgement by the Minister for Justice and Equality that the piecemeal approach to amending the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 is most unsatisfactory.  I also welcome his commitment to initiate a fundamental review of the legislation underpinning our arrest warrant procedures.  He acknowledged that certain specific issues arising out of the Supreme Court judgment in the Bailey case have implications for European arrest warrant legislation and stated these will be considered in the context of the overall review.  However, we have not been given an indication of the date or timeframe for this fundamental review.  Furthermore, the flaw I am endeavouring to address by means of amendment No. 1 is equally urgent to the procedural and technical amendments contained in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The ultimate goal of our extradition procedures is to establish a system of surrender based on mutual recognition and respect for the judicial processes and decisions of fellow EU member states, while also ensuring that Ireland is not a safe haven for fugitives from justice.  However, having considered the implications of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s interpretation of extra-territorial jurisdiction under section 44 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, I believe Ireland is exposed to that very risk.  In discussing the Supreme Court decision in Bailey I do not purport to express a view on the rightness or wrongness of the outcome.  The problem that arose in the Bailey case, and which is likely to arise again with the potential for real embarrassment on the part of the State, was that the Supreme Court was tasked with interpreting section 44 and the underlying provision of the framework decision with little or no guidance.  In identifying the specific test to be applied in the circumstances of Bailey, which the majority ultimately decided must be informed by the principle of reciprocity, dissenting Mr. Justice Hardiman and Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Donnell were candid in their criticism of the difficult and obscure drafting of section 44. </P>
        <P>As I stated on Second Stage, I do not purport to be an expert in international extradition law which, I am reliably informed, is conceptually the most difficult part of criminal law.  I have done a significant amount of research since Second Stage, however, and I understand there are four categories under which extra-territorial jurisdiction dealing with criminal cases generally fall.  They are dealt with in some detail in the submission I made to the Minister prior to the debate on Second Stage.  For the benefit of my colleagues in the House, I will summarise them as follows: First, the active personality principle whereby prosecution is based on the nationality of the accused; second, the passive personality principle whereby prosecution is based on the nationality of the victim; third, the protective principle whereby prosecution is based on the protection of national interests; and fourth, universal jurisdiction generally where the crime is considered as being one against the international community or international law.  Typically, this involves crimes against humanity and piracy on the high seas.</P>
        <P>Following the decision in the Bailey case, with a strict interpretation applied to section 44 and the specific statutory provisions that granted the power to prosecute on an extra-territorial basis, the decision to surrender by Ireland will be made solely on the basis of active personality.  Therefore when dealing with a requesting state that asserts jurisdiction on the basis of one of the other principles and where Ireland could not prosecute the crime in analogous factual circumstances, surrender would be refused.</P>
        <P>The danger therein in terms of Ireland offering a safe haven from justice, is possibly best demonstrated by following a hypothetical case that I put forward today to share with my colleagues.  The fugitive is a German national married to a Spanish woman.  They live in France and have a ten-year-old daughter who has Spanish citizenship.  While on holiday in South Africa, the fugitive sexually abuses his daughter and the offences come to light when the family return to France.  The mother takes the child and moves to Spain, while the fugitive then flees to Ireland.  Spain purports to exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction in any sexual offences against a minor.  This is on the basis of a universal jurisdiction set out in <i>Ley Org&aacute;nica del Poder Judicial</i>.  The Spanish authorities obviously have a legitimate interest in prosecuting the offence as it was committed against a Spanish citizen.  Moreover, there is no reality to the fugitive being extradited from Spain to South Africa to face trial as the prison conditions in the latter country fall well below the basic norms.  A European arrest warrant is issued by the Spanish authorities for the fugitive for the extra-territorial child sex offences that occurred in South Africa.  The fugitive is arrested in Ireland and contests his surrender.  In light of the decision in Bailey, the courts would have to refuse surrender.  The only basis upon which the Irish courts can exercise extra-territorial criminal jurisdiction is section 2(1) of the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act 1996 which bases jurisdiction on the suspect being either an Irish citizen or ordinarily resident here.  As Spain bases its jurisdiction on a form of universal jurisdiction and the fugitive is neither a Spanish citizen nor ordinarily resident in Spain, the highly abstract test of reciprocity contemplated by the Bailey case cannot be satisfied.</P>
        <P>I put it to the Minister, therefore, that it is open to the Oireachtas to take a view of the extra-territoriality exception other than one based on reciprocity.  I believe that the amendment tabled provides the appropriate legislative intervention to do so.  The amendment would give much needed guidance to the Supreme Court.  It would make the test simpler &mdash; one based on the underlying facts of the offence in question, rather than the jurisdiction upon which the extra-territorial jurisdiction is asserted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator van Turnhout for raising this issue.  It was also raised with me and both of us had canvassed for it on Second Stage.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  Both Senator van Turnhout and I welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s announcement on Second Stage of a comprehensive review of this highly complex area of law.  During the Second Stage debate, I asked the Minister when that review was envisaged and he pointed out that it would probably be in the second half of 2013.  I think I am right in saying that that was the timing involved.  It may be that this amendment should be considered as part of that comprehensive review with the merit of an amendment similar to this one.</P>
        <P>Senator Van Turnhout has raised an important point in terms of the effect of the Bailey decision.  She has given a helpful, practical example of the difficulty with the abstract test set forward by the Supreme Court in applying this strict view of reciprocity.  There is a question about whether the Oireachtas should now review that decision and seek to provide for a different test.</P>
        <P>The position as a result of Bailey, as Senator van Turnhout has illustrated, is that it is not open to this State to surrender a non-national to another EU member state for an extra-territorial offence simply because the requesting state asserts jurisdiction on a basis that is alien to Irish jurisprudence.  It is a relatively narrow test and one that will inevitably have consequences in other cases, as can easily be envisaged.</P>
        <P>The difficulty with its application begs the question as to whether an amendment should be introduced.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s view as to whether it will be in this Bill, which as we saw on Second Stage has a relatively limited remit, or as part of the more comprehensive reform that is envisaged.  In any case, it is important that it should be considered.  I thank Senator van Turnhout for raising it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to thank Senator van Turnhout for raising this matter, as well as thanking Senator Bacik for her comments.  I also wish to thank the solicitor, James Mac Guill, who presented a very interesting paper on this issue, a copy of which Senator Van Turnhout kindly gave to me.  I read it with great interest.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the proposal.  It may well be that this is a sound proposal with regard to addressing this issue.  Unfortunately, however, in the time available it is not possible for me to take the matter on board.  There are a number of reasons for that.</P>
        <P>Coming back to what I said on Second Stage, a series of amendments has been made to this legislation already.  As regards this legislation, which is a difficult and technical area, we have discovered on occasion that there are unintended consequences which result from addressing particular issues.  There has not been adequate time for the Attorney General&rsquo;s office to consider the amendment required.  More important, I am concerned that, in so far as we can, we meet our international obligations in this area as best we can at the present time.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that the D&aacute;il rises tomorrow and if we are to amend this Bill this afternoon and take on board this amendment, in practical terms, this legislation could not then be enacted until the autumn.  I think it is urgent that we get our house in order as best we can with regard to the areas the Bill addresses.</P>
        <P>It is important that we move away from the piecemeal amendments that we are engaged in.  This is yet another piecemeal piece of legislation.  While I am in principle favourably disposed to an amendment along the lines being proposed, I believe that its implications for the European arrest warrant legislation can best be addressed in the context of the overall review of the EAW procedure, which I have announced.</P>
        <P>I am sure that the proposal and the excellent analysis on which it is based are fully considered.  I have read it carefully and, as Minister, I have an obligation to ensure that what is proposed is fully considered by the Attorney General.  There must be a reasonable time to consider it, so that we do not effect another change in a rushed manner.  It is important that this Bill is enacted in its current form.  For those reasons I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
        <P>I am anxious to get to a space where we have an overall piece of legislation incorporating any further reforms that are necessary.  It is desirable that it should all be embodied in the one Act.  I deliberately gave a date of autumn 2013 because I am conscious of the enormous legislative programme and the pressures on my Department and others for the first six months of 2013 with regard to the EU Presidency.  Work is commencing, however, with regard to the overall review.  If it turns out that the review can be conducted more quickly or that the Attorney General&rsquo;s office has the capacity to address matters more quickly, I hope there would be a possibility of bringing in the next anticipated Bill somewhat sooner.  I do not want to mislead the House in any way, however.   I cannot give a guarantee in that regard and autumn 2013 is the safest time to give.  I do not want with unnecessary speed to accept an amendment, which on the face of it is reasonable but without the Office of the Attorney General having an opportunity to consider it fully and without us fully ensuring there are not hidden unintended consequences that have not come to mind at this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JillianVanTurnhout"><NameTxt>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed that this has been rejected on the basis that the Attorney General has not had time and because the clock is ticking down.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s honesty in saying that.  When I tabled the amendment I considered our EU obligations in complying with the European arrest warrant framework.  I was very careful with the language used.  I appreciate it needs to be considered by the Attorney General, but I fear it puts Ireland in a different situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will outline another hypothetical case.  If a group of French oil workers were murdered in an al-Qaeda terrorist attack in a Gulf state, there would be no question of extraditing those suspected of involvement to the Gulf state as it applies the death penalty and its justice and prison system falls far short of the acceptable international norms.  Some months later a suspect is identified.  He is a national of the Gulf state in question and has fled to Ireland in the meantime.  On the basis of the passive personality principle, that is, the French nationality of the victims, France may wish to prosecute the fugitive and, therefore, a European arrest warrant is issued.  It is unclear if Ireland would surrender the person in such circumstances.  While the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 would appear to allow Ireland to exercise a form of universal jurisdiction in such offences, it could be argued that we should not surrender where we would assert a universal jurisdiction while France would assert jurisdiction on the basis of the passive personality principle.</P>
        <P>If we take a similar case that is not terrorist-related, Ireland only exercises extraterritorial jurisdiction for murder in the case of an Irish suspect and not an Irish victim.  That being so the fact that France exercises its jurisdiction on the basis of the nationality of the victim would mean that we would need to refuse surrender.  This is more or less precisely what happened in the case of Mr. Bailey &mdash; albeit a more dramatic example.  I feel we are exposing Ireland as a place for fugitives because we do not have clarity on the issue.  I obviously admire the work the Minister is doing and I will not press the amendment because he has been honest with me.  If I had been told the wording of my amendment had been flawed and I had not done my homework adequately, I would feel that was fair enough.  However, I am being told that the clock is ticking down &mdash; we are finishing up tomorrow, will not have time to go back to back to the D&aacute;il and will not have time for the Attorney General to consider it.  Is that really how we should be legislating?  I am extremely disappointed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the obligations on the Government to deliver certain legislation within set timeframes as prescribed by the troika, there is a limit to the amount of legislation that can be dealt with at a particular time.  There is a human limit in that regard.  I pay tribute to Attorney General and those in her office.  The amount of legislation we have been able to produce, for example, through the Department of Justice and Equality, has been as a consequence of extraordinary work and dedication by officials in the Department and in the Office of the Attorney General.  One gets to a point where there is a limit to the work that can be completed and it is important that we do things correctly and not in a rushed manner.</P>
        <P>If the paper I was handed in this House last week had been received by me two or three weeks earlier, there would have been some additional time available to ensure that everyone who needed to could give consideration to it.  I refer not just to me, but also to the Office of the Attorney General.  Normally if a major substantive amendment is being proposed to legislation either originating from or being accepted by Government, it is a matter that would be drawn to the attention of Cabinet.  There was not an opportunity for that to happen within the timeframe.  I need to be careful that we deal with matters correctly.</P>
        <P>The examples the Senator has given are interesting.  In the context of the complexities of human relationships, it is reasonable to say that an event such as she describes could occur, but the two examples she gives are less likely events in their complexity than other events that may give rise to the European arrest warrant procedure.  My priority has to be to implement now the provisions of the Bill that have been dealt with in the other House and are before this House, and not to allow an amendment that has not been given the detailed perusal that is required to be suddenly incorporated into the Bill to the detriment of the Bill being enacted before the Houses adjourn.  It is important to implement the reforms contained in this measure.  When we return with the more detailed, consolidated Bill, bringing together what will now end up being four pieces of legislation, we will have an opportunity to address not only the issues the Senator has raised, but also certain possible other areas that need to be tidied up in the legislation.  That is reasonable.</P>
        <P>I come back to the point that if the proposal being made had been received somewhat earlier than it was received, there might have been a capacity to incorporate it.  However, we needed to focus on other legislation.  While it may not be relevant to this, I can inform Senators that the vetting Bill was approved by Cabinet in its full form yesterday and it will be published on Friday.  The Europol Bill was approved by Cabinet yesterday and will probably be published early next week.  I am afraid there is a limit to the amount of legislation or amendments that can be considered at any one time.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, to the House.</P>
        <P>The matter for debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann this evening concerns the highest office in the land and, therefore, must be taken seriously and treated with respect.  For some considerable time it had been recognised virtually universally that the process of nomination for the presidency of Ireland is undemocratic and unfair and is specifically and deliberately geared in favour of party candidates.  Of the nine Presidents since the foundation of this State not one has been fully independent of party affiliation nor has any candidate won without the support of at least one of the major parties and its machinery.</P>
        <P>This is not in any sense to cast aspersions on the holders of that office.  The Irish presidency is in fact one of those rare exceptions that proves the rule.  In this case the rule being the old legal precept that the fruit of a rotten tree must also be suspect.  We can be justly proud of every single President this country has produced from the first President Douglas Hyde in 1938 to the current incumbent.  The current holder of the office, President Michael D. Higgins, got off to a flying start, with a clear and decisive result and has demonstrated a remarkable dynamism and enthusiasm.  His status has increased every day with every speech and every event he has graced with his presence.  The Irish people could not have made a better choice.  I say that with the authority of someone who sought that office in the same election.</P>
        <P>I wish it to be understood in this matter that I have no personal axe to grind.  Under no circumstances do I dispute the result of the presidential election.  I fully acknowledge that I entered this race knowing and accepting the prevailing conditions.  However, this does not mean that I thereby forfeited the right to challenge those conditions.  Throughout the presidential election, I made it clear that I had a concern about the nomination process and with every day that passed that concern increased.  Moreover, this concern is virtually universally shared.  This is shown by the reaction of the public and by the clear statement of every major party in the State on an historical basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">So far there have been nine Presidents.  The first President, Dr. Douglas Hyde, was installed by the political establishment without consultation of any kind with the Irish people. On no less than six occasions no attempt was made to allow involvement of the people of Ireland, namely, in circumstances affecting two-thirds of the presidencies the candidate was successful either by agreement between the parties without an election or by uncontested self-nomination.  Prior to 2011, the last contested election was in 1997, which meant that no one under 30 had any experience of a presidential election or had the opportunity to vote in one.  Had there not been an election in 2011 we would have had a situation whereby no one under 40 had the opportunity to take part in the election of the first citizen of this State.  This almost happened.  It is widely known and was reported generally in the press that there were significant moves by the parties to avoid the expense of a presidential election and secure the nomination of an agreed candidate thereby again bypassing the will of the people.  A number of excellent and outstanding names were mentioned in this regard.  Such efforts might well have been successful had I not intervened at an early stage and demonstrated that there was very considerable support among the electorate for someone with an independent background.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the 1990s an all-party Oireachtas committee was established to review the Constitution and among the elements to be considered was the office of president.  I made a submission to the committee suggesting a reduction in the term of the presidency from seven to five years on the basis that we had modelled our presidency in a number of regards on the French presidency, which country had already made such an amendment in relation to term of office.  Before this matter was considered there was a change of Government and almost inevitably the matter became a party political football.  In 1997, former Fine Gael Deputies Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe and Paul McGrath initiated a Bill entitled the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1997, which was presented to the D&aacute;il on 24 of September 1997.   Under the 1937 Constitution there are two methods of nomination to the office of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann.  One is nomination by no fewer than 20 persons, each of whom is at the time a Member of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and the second is nomination by the councils of not less than four administrative counties including county boroughs as defined by law.  Deputies O&rsquo;Keeffe and McGrath added a third method which is nomination by no fewer than 20,000 citizens each of whom is entitled for the time being to vote in an election held under this article for such nomination to be made in a manner prescribed by law.  In supporting the Bill, Michael McDowell stated that while the democratic legitimacy of the office was enhanced by the fact that the majority of the people have the opportunity to vote:</P>
        <P LI="1">Democratic legitimacy is circumscribed currently by a nominating procedure which is seriously restrictive.  The bald fact is that not everyone can become President.  Until this year it had been, in effect, necessary for any prospective President to obtain the support of one of the three biggest political parties in the State.  As a result, no previous election had more than three candidates and several had only two.  The candidates in contested elections were almost always party politicians and invariably men.  It is clear that many people want to look beyond the political parties to find suitable candidates.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He further stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">It would be invidious and unacceptable if individuals were denied a nomination as a result of the nomination procedure which currently applies.  There is a powerful argument for extending the nomination capacity.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I can find no one who disagreed with this position.  Brian Lenihan, however, expressed unease at the fact that Fine Gael was stealing a march on the constitutional review committee by issuing a pre-emptive strike in the form of this Bill.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I took it that there was an all-party agreement on this subject that when the committee was re-established after the general election, that the all-party committee would look at the Presidency and that a political party would not take unilateral or a stroke approach towards this question by introducing a measure in Private Members&rsquo; time on the subject.  I was very surprised to discover that our former chairperson of the committee is the Deputy proposing this Bill to amend the Constitution.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Thus, it is clear that the Presidency and the question of the nomination procedures had become a political football between the two principal parties and this is a matter of great regret.  However, it is even more significant that despite this politicking there was still unanimous agreement that the nomination procedures were too restrictive.  It was pointed out that an opportunity did already exist through the county council route whereby if one or more of the major parties abstained on a nomination of an Independent, that person could secure a nomination.  However, during my own attempts to gain a nomination it was made clear to me in Longford County Council that Fine Gael had issued explicit instructions not only that they were to abstain but they were to vote against me.</P>
        <P>I say this simply to illustrate the contrast between the theoretical and ethical position adopted by the parties and the pragmatic reality of their political practice.  Doubts were also raised at this stage about the problematic nature of verifying the signatures of the then proposed 20,000 members of the public.  However, the recent years have seen extraordinary advances in the use of computer technology and there is no doubt that this would now be a comparatively simple matter to secure.  The Bill was defeated.  The matter returned for consideration by the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  This body published its third progress report in 1998 and it is significant that it stated clearly, unanimously and unambiguously that, &ldquo;The Committee agrees with the Constitutional Review Group that the Constitutional requirements for nominating a Presidential candidate are too restrictive and in need of democratisation.&rdquo;  It suggested a clear alteration to the nomination process, the reduction from 20 to ten Members of the Oireachtas as nominators, and a provision for popular nomination.  However, this entailed also continuing to bear in mind that the dignity of the office of President must be preserved against the possibility of frivolous or inadequately qualified candidates.  Nevertheless, they made a recommendation that a figure of 10,000 would be appropriate as requiring widespread but at the same time achievable support for a candidacy.  This takes into account the fact that the timescale for achieving this number is a mere 60 days.  These recommendations have since lain dormant.  During the election I consistently raised this issue and it met with a great degree of public support.  Subsequent to the election I considered introducing legislation but on account of the technical difficulty that the Seanad is precluded constitutionally from introducing a referendum Bill, it was not possible for me to introduce this legislatively.</P>
        <P>However, on 2 December 2011, Deputy Catherine Murphy introduced in the D&aacute;il the Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2011 which would have addressed all these points such as: reducing the number of Oireachtas members necessary for nomination from 20 to ten; providing for a popular initiative of 10,000 citizens; and reducing the presidential term of office from seven to five years, among other more technical matters including amending a mistake in Article 12 of the Constitution with inappropriate reference to proportional representation.  Once more there was very considerable support and the matter was argued very finely and with intellectual distinction and a considerable degree of reference to constitutional authorities such as the late Professor J.M. Kelly.  Deputy Murphy was supported by Deputy Barry Cowen of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Sinn F&eacute;in also gave general support to the Bill.</P>
        <P>In response, the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, who is in the House today, appeared to express some qualified support but queried the timing of the Bill.  He and other contributors appeared to believe that despite the present process, everyone who had declared a serious interest in running was ultimately able to get onto the ballot paper, despite the nomination process.  This is incorrect.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s own brother withdrew from seeking a nomination.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>He thought the Senator would beat him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>He stated that in his view it was completely impossible for any Independent candidate to get elected because of the restrictions on nomination.  The nomination process itself is not the only disincentive.  For example, no one below a certain level of income or without the capacity to borrow massively is in a position to stand for this office and this debars all but a tiny minority of our citizens from seeking the democratic right to stand for President.  The current system of funding presidential campaigns requires all candidates or their parties to underwrite their own election expenses.  One would have thought, given the extraordinary difficulties in securing a nomination, that it would be a legitimate expectation to have at least a reasonable proportion of election expenses covered by the State.  The current quota necessary to trigger State support is clearly set on the basis that only party candidates would contest and that there would be only two or three candidates in the race.  In a situation such as the last presidential election where there were seven candidates, it is mathematically obvious that the majority of those legitimately contesting the election will fail to secure any State assistance.  This creates at the very least an unsustainable financial risk aimed at deterring the inclusion of ordinary citizens into what is seen as the private realm of the parties.</P>
        <P>All parties have been demonstrated to play politics with the Presidency and indeed during the last election it was widely stated by senior figures in Fine Gael that since they never had the Presidency it was now their turn.  This is essentially undemocratic.  The Presidency belongs to no party; it belongs always to the people.  It is never the turn of any party; it is always the turn of the people.  However, it is clear that the political establishment does not trust the people, at least in the matter of nomination, and believes this office should be kept the preserve of the political elite.  For the purposes of this debate I am deliberately leaving to one side certain other factors that deterred Independent candidates, in particular, the attitude of the media.  The discrimination against an Independent candidate is highlighted when one considers the existing two-tiered system of funding which allows political parties to accept a maximum donation of &euro;6,348.69 per annum from an individual while an Independent candidate can only accept &euro;2,539.48.  In addition, services provided at an election by an employee of a political party are deemed not to be donations or benefits in kind, nor are election expenses incurred by a political party on behalf of a candidate at a presidential election so considered.  This means, in effect, that once a party candidate has achieved a nomination, finance is automatically in place.  Poster sites can be booked, material printed, etc., while the Independent candidate has merely a window of 30 days in which to achieve this impossible task.</P>
        <P>For an Independent, prior to receiving a nomination it is almost impossible to fund raise.  Funders want to know that their candidate will be in the race.  This means that for an Independent there is effectively only one month in which to fund raise.  The length of time required for an Independent candidate to acquire a nomination means that all services and materials are more expensive as financial commitments cannot be negotiated until certainty exists.  It is clear that all the parties have acknowledged the undemocratic and unfair nature of the nomination to the position of President.  Nevertheless, they have all shown an unwillingness to alter this system and they also have been party to the imposition of financial constraints to inhibit citizens of Ireland from participating in one of the most serious constitutional exercises provided by the State.</P>
        <P>I believe this is a matter that must be rectified and the motion before the House does so in a decent and dignified manner.  The motion suggests two alternatives which I think are very reasonable.  One is for the Minister to bring a proposal to Government to implement the recommendations contained in the 1998 all-party report or to refer the recommendations to the constitutional convention.  The constitutional convention has already been asked to consider the minor matter of the reduction of the term of office of the President and it would seem a quite extraordinary situation if the substantial issue which is that of the nomination process and of the right and capacity of individual citizens to take part in this process, were avoided in the work of the convention.  This, in my opinion, seriously weakens the credibility of the constitutional convention in the same manner as the exclusion from consideration of the reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I am proud to second the motion.  I welcome the Minister of State, who is a regular visitor to the House.  I agree with Senator Norris that we have been most fortunate with President Michael D. Higgins in the performance of his duties and, indeed, with all his predecessors.</P>
        <P>However, this is a time to look forward and I believe these issues should have been put on the agenda for the constitutional convention, in particular the initiative power.  Under the Lisbon treaty 1 million citizens can make petitions to the European Parliament.  That is from a population of 500 million.  It is the same percentage of our 4.8 million as 9,600 people; in other words, the 10,000 signatures that the all-party committee considered.  In fact, it is in line with European practice.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it is very important we deepen and extend democracy and if somebody collects 10,000 signatures, it would be a good idea to put his or her name before the people for election.  As we emerge from the failure of so many Irish institutions which led to the bank guarantee and the rescue of the entire country by the IMF in late 2010, reinventing institutions, the citizenry and governance is a major issue.  There were powers of initiative for citizens under the constitution of the first Free State Government and in these days of improved technology and an alert and interested citizenry &mdash; the Taoiseach said earlier today that he finds Irish citizens much more involved and interested in European issues than is the case in other countries, which is probably because we must have referenda &mdash; we have a very vibrant democracy which will help us jointly to find a way out of our difficulties.</P>
        <P>Allowing 10,000 citizens to nominate a candidate for President would be a deepening of that democracy.  Like my learned friend, I wished that the Minister of State&rsquo;s brother had been able to accumulate that number of signatures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanDBarrett"><NameTxt>Senator Sean D. Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>He would have been a very worthy candidate in view of his work for the Irish in America.  At the very least, this issue should go to the constitutional convention.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn and I received some briefings on the constitutional convention.  I am not particularly worried whether the President serves for seven years.  In fact, I am delighted the last three terms and more were served for seven years each, so I am not sure that reducing the term from seven to five years is very important.  However, all citizens should participate in the choice.  The time when county councils were able to block alternative candidates was not good.  The councils were controlled by the major parties and those parties were able to exercise the power to block alternative candidates.  It has been much better in recent elections with the array of candidates and the popular interest in the election.  It has made for very good choices.  Extending the initiative to 10,000 people is in line with the European practice which provides for 1 million signatures for initiatives.  It would be a good thing and if the Minister cannot accept it today, he should refer it to the constitutional convention for its consideration.</P>
        <P>We debated the constitutional convention with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, last week.  The convention also represents a strengthening and deepening of Irish democracy through the use of the electoral register to bring it to the level of the citizen, which will allow them to say to the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Ministers how they feel the country is going and what type of constitution it needs.  I welcome that very much.  It received unanimous and speedy support in this House.  We would be delighted to do similar with regard to the initiative being extended to 10,000 people, as requested by my colleague&rsquo;s motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &lsquo;&lsquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;&rsquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P FLI="0">&ldquo;&mdash;notes that the Constitution of Ireland sets out the requirements for the nomination of candidates for election to the office of President;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that in the 2011 presidential election seven candidates, the highest ever number, were validly nominated; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" /> notes that, following the completion of reports on the specific matters listed in the resolution passed in this House on 12 July 2012, the Constitutional Convention may report to the Houses of the Oireachtas on such other constitutional amendments that may be recommended by it.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I agree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s glowing report on our current President, Michael D. Higgins.  He said the best man was elected, to which I might simply say: &ldquo;If the best one was elected, what is wrong with the system?&rdquo; and sit down.  The system is working.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>However, I will continue because it is a subject that is worthy of discussion.  Senator Norris and Senator Barrett should note from the amendment that there is a provision to provide that other constitutional amendments may be recommended by the constitutional convention.  That is a most important part of its work and it demonstrates the openness of the Government in establishing the convention that this provision was included.  If it were a closed shop or a dictating or puppet body, there is no way it would have been left in.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Constitutional reform has been on the agenda for some time on foot of the report from the all-party Oireachtas group.  It is undeniable that our current political system is in need of reform and the Government has committed to this reform.  It is ongoing at present.  There have been many reforms, but too many to list here.  They are a one day wonder when they happen and are then forgotten.  However, one cannot change the world in a day.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the convention on the Constitution is an important and exciting initiative that represents an innovative approach to examining constitutional reform.  I commend the Government for establishing it.  The range of matters that the convention will be asked to consider includes both institutional and social issues.  Initially, it will examine reducing the President&rsquo;s term of office to five years.  That is not to be lightly passed over because the term of office is an important issue.  It will require consideration and cannot be decided in an hour.  I have heard some people say it is a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; issue but the time span is important.  The convention will also consider reducing the voting age to 17 years, which is another important issue.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There has been some criticism that the work programme for the convention does not go far enough and that it should encompass even more comprehensive reform.  The Government remains of the view that the work programme outlined in the resolution is appropriate.  The issues that will be before the convention are not light matters, but it is open to the convention to consider other matters as well.  Its time span is not unlimited and we would be the first to criticise if it could take forever and was given too broad a remit without a time to report.  However, to show that the Government is prepared to consider calls for a more comprehensive work programme, there is a facility for the constitutional review group to consider other topics.  The timeframe within which the convention must complete its work is important.  Indeed, concerns have already been expressed that the convention will have insufficient time to complete the work programme outlined in the resolution.  If there is that criticism on the one hand, how can one add to its work burden on the other?</P>
        <P>It is through this mechanism that the issue of the presidential nomination process could be tackled.  Perhaps in the future the constitutional convention&rsquo;s brief could be extended to examine it.  However, it is not included at present and it would be wrong to overload the convention.  We have already passed a motion that the Seanad review should be part of the convention&rsquo;s work.  In fact, it would probably be easier to rewrite the Constitution than to give the convention piecemeal diktats on every issue, and every Member can point to something in the Constitution that they would like to change.  However, issues must be prioritised.</P>
        <P>It is our duty to prevent the convention on the Constitution from being regarded as a missed opportunity to grapple with other big issues.</P>
        <P>The issues that will be considered are important and appropriate.  It is the first time in the history of the State that there is to be a citizens&rsquo; assembly advising the Government, and that is recognised by the people.  While the convention is to have 30 Members of the Oireachtas, the majority will be citizens from outside the Oireachtas.  It is a participative democratic initiative and ought to be very much welcomed.</P>
        <P>I will not elaborate on the nomination process.  A referendum would be required if we were to do what Senator Norris proposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not averse to referenda.  Let us have them every day of the week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaitKeane"><NameTxt>Senator C&aacute;it Keane</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely not.  I agree totally with what the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, said yesterday on referendums.  There is no commitment in the programme for Government for another referendum on the subject in question.  There are so many referendums already in the pipeline, including that on the rights of children, and the Government is only one year in office.  We have a lot of work to do over five years.</P>
        <P>There is no closed door.  Many countries, such as Finland and Poland, have models we could examine.  Twenty thousand citizens can nominate a candidate in Finland.  There is verification only by sight, rather than by computer.  I do not agree with that.  It is not that I do not trust people in Ireland &mdash; in respect of looking at names, for example &mdash; but we know what occurs sometimes.  I would like a computer system developed that could verify 20,000 nominations, thus making the nomination system easier to administer.  The period of 30 days ought to be considered so as to have a level playing field for independent candidates.</P>
        <P>I was 20 years on a council and did not like the Whip system for presidential elections because it is a non-party office.  One could argue there should be a free reign.  The presidency was never in the grasp of the Fine Gael Party.  In this regard, I could look to other parties.  I would not say, &ldquo;Long may it last&rdquo;, as do Senators on the other side of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, to the House.  The reason we want to facilitate what Senator Norris and his colleagues are proposing is to afford Fine Gael the opportunity of having a President some day whom it can claim.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I commend Senator Norris and his colleagues for bringing the matter before the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the motion.  The Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution discussed 19 issues relating to the President, including the executive power of the President regarding external relations, whether there should be direct elections, whether the powers of the President should be extended, the viability of introducing and honour system, and the minimum age of eligibility for election to the office of President.  It also made a number of recommendations on the nomination process for presidential candidates, mainly where the process is too restrictive.</P>
        <P>Article 12.4.2&deg; requires that all new candidates be nominated by at least 20 Oireachtas Members or by four county or borough councils.  A former or retiring President may nominate himself or herself.  The committee made a number of recommendations for indirect nominations, including lowering the minimum number of Oireachtas Members&rsquo; signatures required for nomination from 20 to ten.  My party and I very much agree with that.</P>
        <P>The committee also examined systems from other countries.  Senator Keane alluded to Finland and elsewhere in respect of popular nomination processes that give the people the opportunity to nominate candidates directly, having provided proof of identity to their local authority offices.  The discussion contained in the committee&rsquo;s report on nomination procedures makes very interesting reading.  Given the practical challenges any new system would pose and the fact that any change in the method of nomination of a candidate for election as President would, in all likelihood, require constitutional amendment.  I am sure that all colleagues, including the Acting Chairman, would agree that this topic would benefit from further discussion.  Therefore, neither my party nor I can understand why this issue was not one of those selected for discussion by the constitutional convention.  Instead, it will consider cosmetic changes such as reducing the presidential term.</P>
        <P>The Government is undermining the process of the convention by ploughing ahead with plans to abolish the Seanad and refusing to allow the matter to be discussed by the convention even though this House passed a resolution calling for such a discussion.  I was disappointed that, in answer to the Leader today, the Taoiseach confirmed that the Seanad would not form part of the convention and that he was pressing ahead with a referendum to abolish it.  The people will decide, and they will reject the Government&rsquo;s proposal.</P>
        <P>Instead of a wide-ranging meaningful discussion, the Government has set out a pre-ordained list of issues in keeping with its limited agenda instead of making a sincere effort to debate on changing the role of local government, the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature and Seanad reform.</P>
        <P>According to the news yesterday, changes to Article 26 regarding the President&rsquo;s power to refer articles to the Supreme Court were touted by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, as a possibility.  Surely this would have been another topic that would have benefitted from further scrutiny by the constitutional convention.</P>

	<P>Despite promises about profound political reform, the Government has introduced a constitutional convention that is far too narrow in scope, flawed in composition and limited in resources.  Even more concerning is the fact that the Government has not accepted responsibility to bring proposals from the convention directly to the people via a referendum.  Instead, implementation of the recommendations will be through a report on them by the relevant Minister to the Government, subsequent to which the Government will decide on whether to hold a referendum.  Smokescreen reform will only deepen public cynicism about politics.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Norris for his insight into what it was like to be an Independent seeking presidential election and the ordeal such people need to go through from obtaining nominations to securing funding, publicity, etc. in a limited period.  This must be examined and reasonable time must be given to Independents to seek nomination.</P>
        <P>While I support the right of the people to nominate candidates, the number should be increased from that proposed by Senators Norris and Barrett.  I suggest a minimum of 35,000.  A presidential ballot paper of 20 or 30 candidates is the last situation we want.  Forgive me for saying so, but it would be farcical.</P>
        <P>Senator Keane stated that the Government was committed to political reform.  If the abolition of the Seanad and town councils, a reduction in the number of county councillors, doing away with elections to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and reducing the number of Deputies by a mere six constitute political reform, it is a farcical policy.  Let us be clear that what the Government wants to do is dominate the D&aacute;il with its large majority, abolish the Upper House where it might get caught out and get rid of the town councils.  The town councils, in the Government&rsquo;s view, comprise only ordinary people and it questions what they would they have to say about democracy.  The Government wants to reduce the number of county councillors, who are doing an excellent job for little money but are obviously causing the Government difficulties.  The last straw will be to abolish democracy within Gaeltacht areas.  This is a disgrace.</P>
        <P>I reiterate my support and that of my party for the motion tabled by Senator Norris and his colleague.</P>

	<P>I commend the House on this discussion and I have listened to Senators&rsquo; comments with great interest.  Like Senator Keane, I agree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments regarding an tUachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, who is doing a fantastic job and going from strength to strength.  The office is held in the highest esteem and each of its holders has increased people&rsquo;s respect for it.  This debate is timely.  Although there will be differences of opinion concerning how candidates come forward, everyone wants to ensure a full and proper debate.  I hope that my contribution will help the House to move this work forward.</P>
        <P>The requirements for the nomination of presidential election candidates are set out in Article 12 of the Constitution.  This provides that candidates for election must be nominated by not fewer than 20 Members of the Oireachtas or by not fewer than four city or county councils.  A former or retiring President may become a candidate on his or her own nomination.  No person and no council is entitled to subscribe to the nomination of more than one candidate in respect of the same election.  These requirements did not mitigate against there being seven candidates for election in 2011.  That election saw the highest ever number of candidates on the ballot paper for a presidential election.  Seven candidates were validly nominated.  Three were nominated by the Oireachtas and the majority were nominated by city and county councils.  Notwithstanding the points made about Whips, party instructions on how to vote and so on, I am unaware of anyone who did not become a candidate through one method or the other.</P>
        <P>Allowing councils to nominate gives them a proper role, as laid out in the Constitution, and increases interest in the election as candidates go from council to council.  Council members acted in a proper manner.  Regardless of political parties, at least four independent candidates ran.  The majority of candidates were from outside the party political system.</P>
        <P>During the nomination period for the 2011 presidential election, there was some discussion about the need to reform the process.  By contrast, some have argued that the existing process worked well.  There was an increased level of activity in city and county councils compared with the nomination periods during previous presidential elections.  Many councils listened to presentations from several people seeking nominations other than those whose names were eventually on the ballot paper.  Regarding any alternative to the current nomination process, it would be important to give careful consideration to any suggestion that this important constitutional role be taken away from elected members of city and county councils.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It already has been.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not directing my comments at any Senator.  I am addressing the general arguments of some.  While Senator Norris would not hold this view, some may.  I appreciate that such a suggestion is not in the 1998 report of the all-party Oireachtas committee of which I was a member, but I wanted to make the point in the context of this discussion.</P>
        <P>Some concerns were aired in the run up to the 2011 election to the effect that the nomination process was too restrictive.  There were voices of concern about the possibility that candidates of real potential would fail at the first hurdle.  None did.  The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, in its third progress report, addressed 19 issues relating to the Presidency, including the question of whether the procedure for nominating a presidential candidate was too restrictive.  The committee was of the view that the constitutional requirements for nominating a presidential candidate were too restrictive and in need of democratisation.  Before I briefly explore the recommendations of the committee, I would point out that we made those recommendations 14 years ago and without the experiences of the 2011 presidential election.</P>
        <P>In the 1998 report, the committee, which was chaired by the late Brian Lenihan, recommended two measures to &ldquo;loosen&rdquo; the nomination procedure.  One recommendation was to alter the provisions for indirect nominations so that ten rather than 20 would be the minimum number of Members of the Oireachtas required for nomination.  The other recommendation was that provision should be made for popular nomination in addition to nomination by elected members.  In making this recommendation, the committee believed that, while the nomination procedure would involve practical difficulties and extra expense, it would be feasible.</P>
        <P>The committee recommendation was to provide for popular nomination whereby 10,000 citizens entitled to vote in a presidential election could nominate a candidate.  The committee, noting that a popular nomination could leave open the possibility that the office of President could be demeaned by the nomination of frivolous candidates or endangered by the nomination of inadequately qualified ones, listed a number of matters that would need to be included in the law providing for the validation of such popular nominations.  For example, it would be necessary to have an adequate validation system for the signatory process.  Safeguards would be required to ensure that citizens nominated only one person.  As the committee noted, all of this would involve extra expense.  In these difficult economic times, we need to tread warily where a measure involves extra expense.  We need to consider carefully whether the measure is necessary to achieve our objectives.</P>
        <P>Popular nomination could be seen to imply a greater degree of direct democracy in the nomination process.  The engagement of the majority of city and county councils in the nomination process in 2011 was very good for democracy.  All council members are elected.  Drama was added to the occasion when some candidates were nominated at the last possible opportunity.  It was the focus of attention in every news bulletin.  The candidates were not refused their nominations.  The council selection procedure implied that one needed a degree of appeal over and above the appeal of others to gain a nomination.</P>
        <P>Systems for popular nomination of presidential candidates operate in Austria, Finland and Portugal.  As such, there are models for examination.  On the other hand, there are countries that do not provide for such popular nomination and where arrangements are similar to those in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Two of the constitutional provisions relating to the election of the President are prioritised in the programme for Government.  These will be considered by the convention on the Constitution.  Last week in the Houses, resolutions were passed approving the calling of the convention.  The convention will consider the following matters, make such recommendations as it sees fit and report on them to the Houses &mdash; reducing the presidential term of office to five years and aligning it with the local and European elections; reducing the voting age to 17 years; review of the D&aacute;il electoral system; giving citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections at Irish Embassies or otherwise; provision for same-sex marriage; amending the clause on the role of women in the home and encouraging greater participation of women in public life; increasing the participation of women in politics; and removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution.  Following completion of the above reports, the convention may report to the Oireachtas on such other relevant constitutional amendments that may be recommended by it.</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach made clear in the D&aacute;il last week, the Government is prepared to consider calls for an even more comprehensive work programme for the convention.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . we are prepared to consider whether other topics could be considered at a later date. We will review this in the light of experience and the T&aacute;naiste and I will consult with Opposition representatives and the chairperson of the convention at the appropriate time.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Taoiseach remarked that the inclusion of additional topics could have implications for the timeframe within which the convention must complete its work.  He noted that concerns had already been expressed that it would have insufficient time to complete the work programme outlined.</P>
        <P>The Government is of the view that the timeframe proposed in the resolution is appropriate, given the current work programme.  However, the Government is prepared to review the timeframe in the light of experience and any future change to the work programme.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with representatives of the Opposition parties.  It is clear that the convention has a full programme of work, but the option of reporting on other relevant constitutional amendments is open to it.  The Government does not propose at this early stage to add the presidential nomination process to the list of items to be considered and recommended upon by the convention.  However, it could be considered by the convention in due course or by the Government alongside any recommendation relating to the election of the President that might be made by the convention.  Let us wait and see therefore what emerges from the work of the convention.  I wish members of the convention well in their deliberations and look forward to receiving their reports.</P>

	<P>I welcome this debate and I am delighted that Senators Norris and Barrett tabled this motion for discussion.  While it is not of immediate importance at this stage &mdash; and hopefully it will be seven years before we have another presidential election &mdash; we are pleased to have President Michael D. Higgins in office.  I am sure the matter is worthy of discussion at this point because there is plenty of time to do so.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and liked what he had to say in his address.  I think I am the only one here who can remember being on my father&rsquo;s shoulders watching President Se&aacute;n T. O&rsquo;Kelly on his inauguration day.

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes but I am talking about the day on which he was inaugurated.</P>
        <P>We have a healthy democracy and it has been helped by the 1937 Constitution.  The fact that it has lasted so long is a reminder of what a great deal it contains.  The fact that there were seven candidates in the last presidential election shows what a demand there is for the office and how it is regarded.  That does not stop us from re-examining it and asking whether changes should be made.  We should consider the flaws, also, and we all remember the difficulty that arose last year when those candidates were trying to get elected.  It seems to me, as someone from the Independent benches, that the process is biased against Independent presidential candidates and is clearly in favour of party candidates.  Senator Norris has explained that.</P>
        <P>It is an interesting proposal to bring to the issue because it is usually only heard around the time of a presidential election.  Politicians usually have to worry about other matters, such as the economy or the financial crisis.  I know this matter is of great importance to Senator Norris who encountered considerable difficulty in securing a nomination last year.  It is obvious that politicians are already tainted by influences, including personal and party ones, which can make nomination for the Presidency very difficult.</P>
        <P>I certainly hope the Seanad will not be abolished.  According to what the Taoiseach said here today, it will be up to us to convince the population that they should not accept its abolition.  We must earn our keep, however, and must prove that we are worthwhile.  It seems that if the Seanad is abolished, however, then the requirement rules will be much changed and it would appear to be much more difficult to secure a presidential nomination.  Would that need to be changed to, say, a percentage of Oireachtas Members?  Senator Norris has pointed out the difficulties therein.</P>
        <P>Can Senators remember anyone in the past who should have been on the ballot paper but did not, or could not, get a nomination?  We spoke about the Minister of State&rsquo;s brother, Mr. Neill O&rsquo;Dowd, for example.</P>

	<P>Dana tried also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is right.  One could argue that the current system supports the <i>status quo</i>, but it is an interesting question nonetheless.  An interesting point is that in countries like France and the United States, there are usually only two or three main candidates who are left in the running, although there may be others to begin with.  On the last time out here, we had seven who were all vying for time in the media and equal coverage in debates.  Considering that quite a few of them did not reach enough votes to cover their expenses, would this point to the threshold being too low?  Should we not introduce another round if there are too many candidates?</P>
        <P>On the nomination process, is 35 the right age limit?  Why can a person technically become Taoiseach at 21, a position of much greater power than the Presidency, but one cannot be a presidential candidate unless one is 35?  Surely in the time of the Internet and online voting, as happens in France with ex-pats, we could allow everyone to put forward their nomination and set a threshold.  France utilises unique technology that encrypts and digitally signs online votes before they are cast, directly in the voter&rsquo;s device.  The system claims to be able to prevent anyone, including the system&rsquo;s administrators, from violating voter privacy or jeopardising election results.</P>
        <P>In the 2012 US elections, more than two dozen states will accept some form of electronic or faxed ballots, mostly from military or overseas voters.  Estonia was an early adopter of this technology; a record 25% of voters there cast Internet ballots in 2011.  In Ireland, we claim to be at the cutting-edge when it comes to technology, so we should be doing the presidential nomination and subsequent election in this manner.  Has the Minister of State studied the Estonian and French examples?  If not, I suggest he should do so.  This is the way to go in all electoral processes.  It is possible to examine what other countries have done and learn from them.</P>
        <P>The constitutional convention will be looking at such matters, but I suggest that we should not limit ourselves to the restrictive proposals or suggestions that have been made.  We are not limited to them, of course.  In the forthcoming convention, we will have an opportunity to re-examine these matters.  This debate has been useful, helpful and worthy of the consideration of the constitutional convention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  I have given this Private Members&rsquo; motion a great deal of thought.  It is fair to try to discern the intentions of the Senator in the motion and I welcome the opportunity to do just that.  Having carefully examined the motion, I find that, in principle, there is nothing in it with which I cannot agree.  However, we are constrained to consider the words of the motion before us, as opposed to the intention that lies behind it.  The motion makes some fairly sweeping statements, particularly the second paragraph which states that public support for the move proposed in the motion has been clearly demonstrated.  I am fairly certain that Senator Norris might be in a position to make such a claim, following his candidature in the recent presidential election.  I have to add that he conducted himself with honour and grace throughout his campaign.  I am not so certain, however, that this claim can be universally and objectively verified.</P>
        <P>The motion&rsquo;s assertion that there is unanimous support among professional commentators and constitutional experts, which was expressed during the 2011 presidential campaign, cannot be universally accepted either.  I admit there is much support for what is contained in the motion but it perhaps overstates the level of that support.  It is entirely uncharacteristic of Senator Norris to overstate any position.</P>
        <P>Likewise, the motion states that the presidential term of office is of less significance than the nomination process.  I am not sure that I can agree with this.  Far be it from me to be even mildly critical of the esteemed Senator, but it seems that in this motion the Senator is attempting to have his cake and eat it also.  In the first instance it calls for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to bring the recommendations contained in the 1998 report &mdash; which I see the Minister co-authored &mdash; to Government for immediate implementation.  Failing this, it calls for the recommendations to be brought before the constitutional convention.  I do not think the Senator can have it both ways.</P>
        <P>I have read the report and agree that it makes some interesting observations about the nomination process.  I would find it hard to disagree with many of the recommendations.  The comparisons with other jurisdictions make for interesting reading as well.</P>
        <P>I note that Finland and Portugal have in place a nomination process similar to the one proposed in the motion.  There is some merit in exploring this, but the motion seems to be pointing to the fact that it is difficult to secure a nomination.  While it is undoubtedly difficult for Independent candidates to secure such a nomination, it is not impossible.  The fact that there were seven candidates in the most recent election, gives the lie to this claim.  I would argue that the nomination process &mdash; as the Minister of State and others have said &mdash; adds to the level of engagement among the public and the electorate in the democratic process.  Anything that increases democratic involvement and engagement is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>This proposal is something that on another occasion I might well be minded to support.  However, I feel that the motion is poorly constructed.  It is also ambiguous and, unfortunately, untimely.    The parameters of the constitutional convention have been established and interference with those terms at this stage will be the cause of unnecessary confusion and a deflection from the primary aims of the constitutional convention as envisaged.  The terms of the constitutional convention have long been signalled and the Senator has probably missed the boat on this occasion.  It seems to me also that for the Government to embrace the motion outside the terms of the constitutional convention would be akin to the Government considering other important constitutional issues outside of the convention also, which is something with which I have great difficulty.  If it is too late to change the terms of the constitutional convention then the motion on this occasion must fail.  Perhaps the Senator could attempt to have the matter contained in the motion included in a further phase of the convention, as the Taoiseach outlined in the D&aacute;il last week that other work may be assigned to it.  Of course the Senator would have to improve the construction of the motion.  Unfortunately on this occasion I will be unable to support it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I know I can always rely on a good friend to ensure our interests are looked after.  I welcome the motion which is timely and I congratulate Senator Norris, particularly in light of the opening paragraph in which he refers to the repeated promises of the Government to provide &ldquo;openness, transparency, accountability and democracy&rdquo;.  My colleague, Senator Wilson, has already addressed these issues with regard to all of the Government&rsquo;s proposals to deconstruct democratic institutions in the country.</P>
        <P>I want to refer specifically to a number of the items included by Senator Norris in the generality of his motion, such as the 1998 third progress report of the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  There have been at least three if not four all-party constitutional committees since 1937.  There was one in the 1960s and two in the 1990s, including the O&rsquo;Keeffe committee and the most recent committee which was chaired by the late Brian Lenihan.  This begs the question as to why we are having a debate on the form of the constitutional convention being established by the Government.  I would not be against the notion that the Constitution needs to be put under urgent review.  However, when one looks at the meat and drink of it, there might be drink but there is no meat.  Senator Norris is right in this regard and he is correct to bring forward these proposals which the Government might consider, irrespective of the timeframe involved.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to two issues which exercised the minds of the all-party committee and the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, referred to the fact he was a member of one of the committees.  I should have had the good manners to welcome him to the House.  I had the pleasure and honour of serving with him in the House and he has done well since, as I have often said, and well done to him.</P>
        <P>With regard to nominations for presidential elections, there was a suggestion that 20,000 citizens would be able to sign a nomination paper.  I am not sure whether the all-party committee recommended any change but it was moving towards accepting this recommendation and perhaps it might open it up.  I believe it also recommended that ten Members of the Oireachtas could propose a nominee.  I hope the constitutional convention will deal with this matter.  I ask the Minister of State to correct me if I am wrong, but I believe there is flexibility built into the constitutional convention whereby after it has dealt with the specific issues referred to, it can take on other issues.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, to the House and I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd for his contribution.  There is merit to considering loosening up the rather restrictive nature of the nomination process.  Senator Gilroy was the most recent speaker to make the point that restrictive as it may seem theoretically in practice it works rather well, in that the local authorities, showing they have some independence from the party system in this regard, nominated Dana Rosemary Scallon in the two most recent presidential elections.</P>
        <P>Many congratulatory remarks have been made about the present incumbent in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and I endorse them.  I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with President Higgins on a variety of committees when he was a Member of the Houses, particularly the committee dealing with foreign affairs.  I always found him to be engaging and stimulating in his conversation and wonderful company.  However, I should put on the record that Senator Norris because of his particular travails and Sean Gallagher can probably feel somewhat aggrieved at the manner in which the election campaign went.  It is said that timing is everything in politics and President Higgins is now in office having been elected by the people, but it would be remiss of me if I did not say when the history of the election campaign comes to be written it will be seen to have had particular dimensions which impacted on Senator Norris and Sean Gallagher.  This is not in any way to deflect from the dignity of the office of the President or the incumbent whom I wish well.</P>
        <P>Another issue dealt with by the all-party committee was the question of an honours system.  I remember when President Higgins was the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht we debated the National Cultural Institutions Bill in the late 1990s and discussed an honours system.  He was not in favour of it, being a good republican socialist.  However, it is interesting that in all of the debates that have taken place, including drafts of the original 1937 Constitution and the subsequent debate in the D&aacute;il during which the then Taoiseach, Eamon de Valera, did not demur from the notion there should be an honours system which would be inaugurated and executed by the President.  During the D&aacute;il debate the reference to an honours system was deleted, but on the basis the door would not be closed entirely.  However, it was never revisited.  We should have an honours system and it should be a resurrection of the old Order of St. Patrick&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which is an honourable order.  If one goes to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hall in Dublin Castle one will see the various flags of the recipients of the old Order of St. Patrick.  It was abolished in 1921 and I see no reason it should not be reintroduced.  Every other country has an honours system.  The most republican of republics, France, has a far more elaborate honours system than even the monarchical system in the UK.  However, it has retained its stout independence and presents itself as a republic.  It does not in any way feel compromised by orders, many of which were inherited from the nobility.  I am not speaking about the nobility, but the debate seems to centre on nobility and orders of merit.  Perhaps at some stage if there is some way of nudging the constitutional convention into other matters, which it will inevitably discuss, these other matters might include the question of an honours system and I put it out there for what it is.</P>
        <P>The motion is timely.  Whether it is flawed is a subjective view.  Senator Norris has done the House a favour in keeping the item on the agenda and I applaud him for it.  I hope the motion is accepted.  As a result of this debate the Government may reflect on it and perhaps influence the constitutional convention to examine some of the issues raised on all sides of the House.</P>

I wish to make a number of broad remarks about the constitutional convention.  Senator Gilroy mentioned the fact that the parameters have been set by the Government and he is correct.  He then went on to state that perhaps Senator Norris has missed the boat.  The Government has missed the boat in my view in a number of areas by not including what are very important topics in the constitutional convention.  Many people would see it as a very big missed opportunity.  The Government has limited the convention too much to allow it to have any real effect.  If we are to be honest, many of the issues it will discuss are uncontroversial.  It is possible that some of the outcomes are already predetermined and the matter will end up being a sideshow.  In reality it should have been something completely different.  It should have been a real opportunity for the State to have a conversation about the type of Republic that we live in and how it has dealt with the social, economic and human rights which are important to many of us.  That could have been central to any discussion on a new Constitution or new Republic, which many people talk about.  When it gets down to it we will have watered down what the convention could and should have done.</P>
        <P>The convention is a missed opportunity.  All of the parties will engage within the set parameters and once the convention has been set up there will be a responsibility placed on us to engage.  We must be honest and state that the Government has missed the boat for whatever reason, which is deeply regrettable.</P>
        <P>The role of the President of Ireland is an important and symbolic one.  A number of previous Senators mentioned that many candidates were put through the ringer during the last presidential campaign, not just the two candidates mentioned by Senator Mooney.  I can say that Martin McGuinness sometimes got fair and unfair criticism from the media.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of the candidates received unfair treatment from the media and this played a central role in the presidential campaign.  The media must reflect on how it values the role of the presidency and how it approaches future presidential elections.</P>
        <P>We support the motion but add that it is far from the only reform that needs to be made as regards the presidency.  We have no difficulty with amending the nomination process.  It needs to be done.  It would have been a scandal if candidates who wanted to put their names forward were not in a position to do so.  Some of them had genuine difficulties trying to get the requisite number of signatories from Oireachtas Members to allow them to stand.  At one point it looked like some of them, who went on to get a respectable vote in the presidential campaign, may not have had the opportunity due to the strict and narrow nomination process.  That process needs reform.  The best place to examine and tease out how to change the process while protecting the Office of the Presidency is the constitutional convention and that is why I support the motion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sinn F&eacute;in tabled its first Private Members&rsquo; Bill last November which dealt with the presidency.  We raised a number of issues then that we also asked the constitutional convention to deal with.  One is that all Irish citizens would have a vote in the presidential election.  That would mean extending the vote to citizens who live in the North of Ireland and it would include people who see themselves as Irish, British or both.  In our view every citizen or person born on the island of Ireland should have a vote in the presidential election.  Every citizen who lives abroad should also have a vote in the presidential election.  Ireland would not be on its own in this regard as many European countries allow their citizens to vote in presidential elections.  Recently the Czech Republic held a presidential election and people queued in order to vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an important area that the Government could examine.  Some people would argue that one cannot have representation without taxation but the role of the President does not have any powers or functions over taxation and it is an important but symbolic role.  The President embodies what is best in Irish people and we should allow all Irish people to participate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>Especially given that over 100,000 have been forced to leave our shore.  They should not be denied an opportunity to vote for their President.  Such a measure is important.</P>
        <P>The age limit for the presidential election should be examined.  The provision regarding 35 years is arbitrary.  It exists because people feel that a president should have life experience but 35 years is too high.  Surely it is up to the people to decide whether a candidate who is 25 or 30 years old does not have enough life experience and would not unsuitable for the presidency.  It should be up to them to make the decision.  I am sure that there are many younger people with plenty of life experience who are also qualified to be President if given the opportunity.  That issue also needs to be examined.</P>
        <P>I support the motion.  It is simple and uncontroversial and I do not see why it has not been accepted.  It is one of those matters that should have been examined by the convention along with many other issues.  It is unfortunate that is has not been.  If the motion is challenged by the Government please accept that my party will vote in favour of it.</P>

	<P>I find it regrettable and disappointing that the debate has effectively collapsed despite the presence of other Senators who have not spoken and, in particular, the fact that there was such a small representation on the Government&rsquo;s side.  I think there was only one.</P>

	<P>For the time being.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator chose to question the construction of my motion on the basis that I referred to the unanimous support of professional commentators.  He did so without producing one who did not or who objected to the kind of proposals being made.  I am aware of nobody who suggests that it was inappropriate and it was widely canvassed and discussed during the election.  If the Senator can produce such a person then I would be happy to listen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGilroy"><NameTxt>Senator John Gilroy</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, by the same argument if we apply his logic then Senator Norris would be required to produce all of the experts.  If I have to produce one then he must produce them all using the same logic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieMoloney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Marie Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Senator Norris to conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also referred to the clearly demonstrated public support.  I did not say that it was unanimous but it was very clear that there was a considerable interest in the matter.</P>
        <P>I shall return to the amendment.  I welcome the fact that Senator Gilroy approved of certain aspects despite giving himself some camouflage by picking holes in the language.  I would be happy to joust with him on that aspect but I do not want to waste time.   It is insulting just to recite existing facts.  I note the Constitution of Ireland sets out the requirements for the nomination of candidates to the office of President of Ireland.  What information, that people are not aware of, does that bring to the House?  Every schoolchild in the land is aware of this fact.  It is an insult to produce this as if it was an argument.  One might as well say this country is Ireland and Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes that the country is called Ireland.  It is as fatuous, as empty and as flatulent as that.</P>
        <P>I note in the 2011 presidential election, seven candidates, the highest ever number, were validly nominated in spite of everything that was done by the political parties.  I make an exception in the case of the honourable example of the then Deputy Michael D. Higgins, an old colleague of mine.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

	<P>The question of the constitutional convention was raised.  There is a real contradiction.  We were told we had missed the boat but we could still throw in this topic for consideration by the constitutional convention.  Many people avoided the real issues.</P>
        <P>I am not referring to myself.  I am not aggrieved by any of the political side of things.  Certainly, I have an issue with the media and I will return to the point on another occasion but I specifically excluded that from this debate because I wanted to confine myself to a discussion of the principles.  Can a single Member defend the fact that the political parties with their huge resources are permitting donations from individuals three times the amount that individuals who have to fund a campaign out of their own resources, and that the parties are allowed to exempt contributions in kind, such as postering, transport and all the rest under the standards in public office legislation?  In other words there is a clear, deliberate and massive financial disadvantage deliberately placed on individual citizens by the parties.  That is inarguable.  That is a mathematical fact.  It is not a question of how I phrased it, which people may be picky about if they wish.  It is a mathematical fact.</P>

	<P>This is a scandal and a disgrace.  I am astonished that anybody can stand over it.  In America, they like to say that anybody could be President of America.  One can if one can buy it.  It is going that way in this country too.</P>
        <P>I am not making any retrospective claims for myself.  In the future why should standing for office be a matter of how much money one has?  Why should people from ordinary backgrounds be disenfranchised in this manner from the highest office in the State?</P>

	<P>T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh an tAire. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I wish to raise the issue of changes that have been made to the post-primary school transport scheme.  The changes were introduced by the previous Government but a number of elements of that scheme come into effect this September.</P>
        <P>There were a number of issues in County Waterford which, thankfully, have been resolved this year due to the concessionary transport places on the buses.  I have had e-mail exchanges with the Department of Education and Skills and with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Both bodies have been helpful in providing information so I wish to thank the Minister of State for that.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A number of issues need to be addressed for 2013 and subsequent years, however.  The first one concerns information that is given to parents.  As the Minister of State knows, many parents apply for school transport in March or April.  This year, in parts of Waterford that were affected by the changes to this scheme, parents had to go to their nearest education centre or they would not qualify for school transport.  They made the application in March or April but were not notified of the changes which come into effect in September.  That was an omission by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I know the change was introduced by the previous Government and it could be argued that people were personally responsible to find the information.  It is unreasonable, however, to expect people to know every single change which is made in a budget.  The first mistake was that Bus &Eacute;ireann simply did not inform people when making their applications that a number of changes had been made which might affect their children&rsquo;s places on the bus.</P>
        <P>The second issue concerns the eligibility criteria, which the Minister of State could examine for future years.  It is clear that one must attend one&rsquo;s nearest education centre having regard to ethos and language, but there is no regard for county boundaries or road infrastructure.  I will cite a number of examples.  Portlaw was one area of concern in County Waterford but thankfully when 86 students applied for school transport there were sufficient places for them.  Everybody is therefore sorted this year but in reality some of these people are getting concessionary places.  What will happen in 2013 and 2014?  They were being asked to go Carrick-on-Suir which is in Tipperary, rather than the school in Kilmacthomas which is attended by their siblings and which their parents attended.</P>
        <P>The other question concerns how distance eligibility criteria are measured.  According to the Department&rsquo;s own guidelines, distance eligibility will be determined by Bus &Eacute;ireann by measuring the shortest traversable route from the child&rsquo;s home to the relevant education centre.  In some cases, however, Bus &Eacute;ireann was measuring the distance from one post office to another.  The reason the company gave was that if there is more than one education centre then that is what they do.  For example, pupils in Portlaw were not having the distance measured from their home to the nearest school in Carrick-on-Suir, but from the post office in Portlaw to the post office in Carrick-on-Suir.  The closest school for some parents was Kilmacthomas because they were on the outskirts of Portlaw.  Because of the way it was measured, however, it meant that they did not qualify and are now classed as concessionary.  That situation needs to be re-examined.</P>
        <P>I could not find the words &ldquo;from post office to post office&rdquo; in any of the documents, so I wonder where that came from.  Nor could I see any discretionary element because it seems to be very clear in referring to &ldquo;the shortest traversable route from the child&rsquo;s home&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister of State could offer some clarification on that matter.  If he does not have the information today, perhaps he could provide it by e-mail.</P>
        <P>Another issue concerns choice, which involved parents in Dunmore East.  That marries with the road infrastructure argument as well.  Their nearest secondary school is in Tramore.  Anybody from Dunmore East seeking a secondary school would send their children into the city.  There is only a kilometre in the difference but the road infrastructure is much better.  The road from Dunmore East to Tramore is a secondary one and would not be safe for a school bus in my view.  There is a very good road between Dunmore East and Waterford city, so it would make more sense to use it.  Parents have a choice of seven or eight schools in the city, yet there is only one in Tramore.</P>
        <P>There is also the question of whether schools in those areas that have now become the nearest education centre, have the capacity to meet the needs of those pupils.  The spatial planning for those schools must also be examined.</P>
        <P>I am raising these genuine issues which the Minister of State could examine for future years.  I wish to put on the record, however, the fact that the Minister of State and his officials have been very helpful in this regard.  In addition, Bus &Eacute;ireann has given support to parents who found themselves in a position that could have posed difficulties.  We have got over it this year but there may be problems in 2013 and subsequent years.  I ask the Minister of State to look at the school transport scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Cullinane for raising this matter.  School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on my Department&rsquo;s behalf and covers over 82 million km annually.  In the region of 113,000 children, including more than 8,000 children with special needs, are transported in approximately 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  It is a major daily logistical effort to get those children safely to and from school.  Indeed, it is a very costly effort.</P>
        <P>The main objective of my Department&rsquo;s school transport scheme is to support the safe transport to and from school of children who would have difficulty travelling, for reasons of distance, to their nearest school if transport is not supported.  That is the original ethos underpinning the school transport system, which was first introduced many decades ago.</P>
        <P>I take it the Senator is referring to the changes regarding school transport eligibility for children attending post primary schools, which take effect from the beginning of the next school year in September.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current system for determining eligibility for school transport at post-primary level has been in place for over 40 years.  In 1966, when the then Government announced the introduction of free post-primary education, the country was divided for planning purposes into geographical districts &mdash; also referred to colloquially as catchment areas &mdash; each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>Post-primary pupils are eligible for transport if they reside 4.8 km or more from their local post-primary education centre &mdash; that is, the centre serving the catchment area in which they live.  The definition of school transport catchment boundaries has been the cause of many submissions and representations to the Department over the years.  It is widely considered by many that the current catchment boundary areas do not reflect changed demographics.  They also lead to a significant amount of confusion amongst parents and school management, as to whether or not a child might be eligible to attend a particular school.  Senator Cullinane mentioned earlier that the system as it is now envisaged, where a pupil is entitled to transport to the nearest school, has made the whole situation very clear.  That is exactly what we are setting out to achieve.</P>
        <P>Changes in the post-primary school transport scheme were announced in budget 2011.  One of the changes that will take effect from the commencement of the 2012-13 school year means that the use of the catchment area system as a means of determining eligibility will cease for all pupils newly entering a post-primary school.</P>
        <P>From this date, school transport eligibility for all new pupils entering a post-primary school will simply be determined by reference to the distance they reside from their nearest post-primary education centre, having regard to ethos and language.  I take on board the concerns that Senator Cullinane has about other methods perhaps being used to determine how far a pupil resides from the nearest school.  I will engage with my Department&rsquo;s school transport unit and Bus &Eacute;ireann to see what mechanism is being used to determine that distance.  I understand that it is the shortest traversable route from the young person&rsquo;s home to the front gate of their school, but perhaps another method is being used so we need to clarify that.</P>
        <P>This eligibility criterion will be applied equitably across all schools transport provision on a national basis.  In general, eligible pupils who are currently availing of school transport and who meet the distance criterion of 4.8 km, will retain their eligibility for the duration of their post-primary education, provided there is no change in their current circumstances.</P>
        <P>On the planning of school infrastructure, the general approach of the Department is to plan on the basis of attendance of pupils at their nearest primary schools and that those primary schools then feed into attendance at the nearest post-primary schools or the nearest post-primary centre generally.</P>
        <P>The changes announced in post-primary school transport services are in line with this approach and will result ultimately in a more efficient and cost-effective scheme.</P>
        <P>At a time when this country is losing &euro;44 million per day, one cannot argue that we should be transporting children to a school other than the one nearest to their home.  Senator Cullinane mentioned that we are somehow impinging on parental choice when it comes to determining what post-primary school children should attend.  I would argue that we are not, however.  Ultimately, it is the parents&rsquo; decision as to which school they sent their child to.  It never has been, is not and never will be possible to provide a school transport system that somehow serves that need.    All we can endeavour to do is transport children to their nearest school.  That is a significant service on the part of the State, costing on average &euro;1,000 per annum per child for which we charge a fraction of that cost.  We are doing an exceptional job in very difficult budgetary times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidCullinane"><NameTxt>Senator David Cullinane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for agreeing to investigate my first concern about the distance eligibility.  At the end of his contribution, the Minister of State referred to efficiency and cost-effective schemes.  We have no difficulty with cost-effective schemes.  There is logic in people attending their nearest education centre.  However, sometimes their nearest education centre is not the best choice because of the road infrastructure or because of county boundary issues.  Those are practical considerations that need to be taken into account.</P>
        <P>Some people are now availing of the concessionary transport, for example, in Tramore, where there is a place on the bus to go to Kilmacthomas or from Dunmore East to the city.  However, if they are medical cardholders they need to pay the &euro;350 and do not get the free transport, which is also a concern for many of those parents.  There needs to be an element of choice.  If there are six schools that are 7 km away and one school 6.5 km away and the road infrastructure is not the best, it makes perfect sense.  My point is that there needs to be some flexibility.  One could argue there was some with the catchment areas, although that gave rise to its own set of circumstances.  While there may not be any perfect system, it could be tweaked to add value and improve it for all concerned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to address my query about the Cork Life Centre.  I had raised the matter previously with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the reply I received was incomplete, as, unfortunately, I believe she was not provided with the full information on the centre.  This centre caters for young people aged between 12 and 18 who have dropped out of the educational system.  Many of them have no family support.  Some have come to the attention of the centre because of their involvement with drugs or alcohol and given their lack of family support, they are going down a very dangerous road from the point of view of their long-term health and well-being.</P>
        <P>The centre was set up with the support of the Christian Brothers and this year they are investing &euro;90,000 in the centre.  More than 30 people attend it on a daily basis.  It is open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.  Six of the students sat the applied leaving certificate examinations and eight of them sat the junior certificate examinations.  These are young people who are in serious danger.  A report earlier this year indicated that 200 young people died over a number of years because the support mechanisms in place were in adequate to look after them.  For many of the students, attending the centre has given them the benefit of taking a different route from the one they had been travelling.</P>
        <P>At the moment the centre has a full-time manager and it will receive 960 VEC hours which equate to 1.5 teachers.  It is getting very little support and yet it is providing vital support services for these vulnerable young people.  I understand approximately 18 qualified teachers, who cannot get employment at the moment, work there on a voluntary basis.  They give support to these young people on a one-to-one basis.  Unfortunately, the Christian Brothers have indicated they are no longer able to provide the funding they have been providing in recent years.  We want to ensure a proper structure is put in place for them so that the centre can continue to provide this essential service for these young people with a view to avoiding the tragedies outlined in recent reports from the HSE.  I ask for that to be taken on board in the long-term planning for the funding of the centre.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The Department of Education and Skills provides support to two life centres &mdash; one in Pearse Street in Dublin and the other in Winter&rsquo;s Hill in Cork.  During the past academic year, my Department allocated 2,768 teaching hours to the centres under the co-operation hours scheme operated by the local VECs.  This is equivalent to four full-time teachers.  Additionally, &euro;114,000 is provided annually to the centres to help meet day-to-day running costs.</P>
        <P>Almost 1,000 of these hours and some &euro;50,000 in funding are provided to the Cork Life Centre, which was established by the Christian Brothers in 1996, with the assistance of the Holy Faith Sisters.  It caters for approximately ten young people between the ages of 12 and 16 who are out of the mainstream school system.  The centre provides a model of high-support educational provision incorporating intensive personal, social and educational support.  With the hours allocated, City of Cork VEC employs four tutors who work in the centre and deliver tuition in CSPE, reading, literacy, arts and crafts, woodwork and home economics.  The annual grant is used to help meet day-to-day running costs.</P>
        <P>Young people are referred to the centre by various agencies including the National Educational Welfare Board, social workers, juvenile liaison officers and parents.  Typically, applicants have been out of school for some time, ranging from a few weeks to a few years.  The centre prepares young people for the junior certificate, and for life and work as productive and integrated members of society.  The centre aims to address a range of needs of the young people &mdash; a need for certification, preparation for work, a positive attitude toward society, communication skills, ICT skills and recreational skills.</P>
        <P>Alongside the support and funding the Department provides to this centre, it also funds a range of national programmes that cater for early school leavers, such as Youthreach, F&Aacute;S community training centres and youth encounter projects.  In the city of Cork, the Department funds 100 Youthreach places in four centres through the VEC.  The Youthreach programme provides two years&rsquo; integrated education, training and work experience for unemployed early school leavers with less than upper second level education who are between 15 and 20 years of age.  As part of the Youthreach programme, the Department funds the Cork City Learning Support Service which caters for up to 70 young early school leavers aged 12 to 18 years of age.  The service provides the junior certificate and some FETAC programmes for learners.</P>
        <P>Through F&Aacute;S, my Department provides 155 places in three community training centres which address the training and employment needs of early school leavers, primarily aged between 16 and 21.  The Department also funds the St. Kevin&rsquo;s youth encounter project in Cork which can deal with up to 25 children aged 11 to 15 years of age.  Children are referred to the school by a number of agencies including the court system and they mostly come from socially disadvantaged backgrounds, with a multiplicity of problems and issues.</P>
        <P>The Government has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school leaving.  The total provision for educational inclusion programmes in 2012 is approximately &euro;720 million across all levels of education, including early education, primary and second level, further education programmes and third level student support programmes.  It also included funding for the NEWB, school completion programme, youth projects and early education, responsibility for which transferred to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2011.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year representatives of the life centres met the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn.  Subsequently, they wrote to my Department to advise that the Christian Brothers, who were the major funders, were planning to cease funding the centres and to request replacement funding for the life centres.  This request is being considered by departmental officials and they will be in contact with the life centres in due course.  In reviewing the request from the life centres, we need to be cognisant of the budgetary pressures within the Department.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Senator again for raising this issue and the Department will endeavour to keep him informed of any developments on the future funding of the life centres.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Colm Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.  I am somewhat concerned about some of the information in the reply &mdash; for instance the reference to the VEC.  The 960 VEC hours equates to 1.5 teachers in real terms.  The VEC has indicated it cannot guarantee that it will be able to provide those hours next year.  I am surprised at the 2,768 hours the Minister of State mentioned.  I would question that, but I will check it.  It is certainly news to me.  My understanding is that the Christian Brothers put &euro;90,000 into the centre this year.</P>
        <P>The building is also being provided by the order and not by the Department.  For more than 13 years I was on the board of management of one of the centres to which the Minister of State referred and which is funded by F&Aacute;S.  I was chairman of the board of directors for three years and I had six full-time staff.  Training was provided for more than 50 people at any one time.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s reply refers to people who are aged 15 years and upwards.  In fact, it is dealing with people from the age of 12 years and these children are at risk.  I ask the Department to ensure a long-term budgetary plan is put in place for this centre because it is dealing with people who are very vulnerable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the reply is badly phrased.  The Senator is correct that it refers to 1,000 of the hours being allocated to Cork when in fact 2,768 hours are allocated for the two centres.  The centre caters for children aged between 12 and 16 years and that is correct information.  I will take the Senator&rsquo;s concerns on board.  He will know that the Minister, Deputy Quinn and the operators of the Life centre have been in discussions and it is hoped there will be a positive outcome from that engagement.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for dealing with this matter.  He has always been available and forthcoming on these issues.</P>
        <P>Our concerns are about rural families.  I accept that changes are required as a result of budgetary constraints and the Department must be aware of numbers and figures.  However, in the case of rural areas, it is not always down to statistics and it is not always easy to define boundaries.  I have been inundated with inquiries from concerned parents and grandparents in areas such as Ballyadams and Ballylinan and I am sure this also applies to other rural villages and parishes across the country.  The changes in school bus transport initiated in the budget are now coming into play.  Some of the implications may not have been anticipated.  For instance, I am concerned about legacy issues.  Generations of families may have attended a particular school in their locality which may not necessarily and technically be the school nearest to them.  For instance, a brother and a sister may be attending a local primary school but a sibling due to start school next September will be informed that in order to avail of school bus transport he or she must attend another school which may well be in another parish or in another county in some instances.  This is not fair nor does it make common sense, even though this is the rule.  School-going siblings are being split up as a result and this is not sensible.  Parents cannot be in two places at one time.  Very often children may have to attend events beyond the scope of the school transport system and it is not possible for parents to divide themselves in half.</P>
        <P>While the rules have to be applied I ask that some common sense would be factored into the arrangement and that perhaps an appeals process could be considered.  I ask that inspectors applying the regulations would take into account when considering new applicants the fact that siblings already attend a school and that the family may have a connection over generations with a particular school.  The new arrangements may be a burden and may cause unnecessary concern to families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Whelan for sharing his time with me.  I raised this matter on the Order of Business last week and Senator Cullinane also raised the same matter.  I am concerned about choice.  I agree with Senator Whelan on the need for an appeals process.  If a family lives next to a big urban centre such as Kilkenny city with a wide choice of schools and school transport is available then that family has options.  However, the new rules mean that a family living near a school must go to the nearest school.  In these stringent economic times, families are using school transport to bring their children to school.  Any extra expense of &euro;250 is very difficult for an unemployed person and it means an extra payment of &euro;7 per week.  For instance, a child in fifth year will be allowed stay in the school transport system under the medical card system because they are a current student in a school but a sibling going into first year will be asked to pay &euro;250 or else the parents will have to drive that child two and a half miles to pick up the bus somewhere else.  This is a total of five miles per day and this could cost &euro;7 per week when using a car.  We are asking families who are unemployed to spend perhaps an extra &euro;14 on school transport for their children.</P>
        <P>Another issue arises in respect of county boundaries.  We border Carlow on one side and some of the schools which are relatively close are actually in County Carlow.  I know we are down on our luck in hurling at present but people in County Kilkenny see it as an issue if they have to send their children across the border to another county where they may not learn the skills of hurling as they would in a school in County Kilkenny.  It is a parish issue and it is an issue of choice.  An appeals system should be put in place so that a concession can be made in cases where there is not a great difference in distance between schools.  The education of children is paramount.</P>
        <P>I was involved with a school in Ballyhale where I was chairman of the board of management before I was elected to the Seanad.  Ballyhale specialises in special needs and autism and Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome.  A parent telephone me to say their child has been informed that the nearest school is St. Brigid&rsquo;s in Callan but Ballyhale is one kilometre further away.  Their daughter has a learning disability.  I am not saying St. Brigid&rsquo;s will not look after her but the natural choice for the parents would be Ballyhale because the father himself attended that school.  Ballyhale would give the child the supports she needs.  An appeals system would allow for this situation to be taken into consideration.  It should be the case that learning supports should be in place in a school before a child with special needs is compelled to go on the bus.  Choice is the main issue.  I thank the Minister of State for his attendance and I thank Senator Whelan for raising this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for raising this matter today.  School transport is a very significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on the Department&rsquo;s behalf and covering over 82 million km annually.  Approximately 113,000 children, including more than 8,000 children with special needs, are transported in approximately 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The main objective of my Department&rsquo;s school transport scheme is to support the safe transport to and from school of children who would have difficulty travelling, for reasons of distance, to their nearest school if transport is not supported.  I will explain the relevant changes to the primary school transport scheme more fully so the Senators will have a better understanding of them.</P>
        <P>With effect from the 2012-13 school year, eligibility under the closed school rule will cease and eligibility for school transport will be confined to those children who reside not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest national school, as determined by my Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.  It is important to note that all existing eligible children who are not attending their nearest school will retain their school transport eligibility for the duration of their primary education cycle provided there is no change to their current circumstances.</P>
        <P>It is a significant concession on the part of the Department that a child attending a school will receive school transport to that school for the duration of the child&rsquo;s time in the school.  We argued for this concession but this in itself has led to the anomalous situations which the Senators have described.  These situations will continue to arise during that transitional phase.  The new cohort of pupils will follow the new arrangements.</P>
        <P>The changes mean that greater consistency will be introduced in planning for school places, which is already based on local demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  As part of the value for money review, Bus &Eacute;ireann was requested to carry out a sample analysis of a number of school transport services.  This in-depth analysis indicated that the vast majority of children, over 95%, availing of school transport services are in fact attending their nearest school and are therefore not affected by this change.</P>
        <P>Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis subject to a number of terms and conditions that are detailed in the primary school transport scheme.  When I attended a number of public meetings around the country last year to explain to parents how this scheme would operate there was an accusation that there is a significant gulf between the charge of &euro;50 for an eligible child and &euro;200 for a non-eligible child.  We have now narrowed that gap and are charging both concessionary and non-concessionary children &euro;100.  That was done in an effort to make the scheme more accessible to children and to make the changes we are applying more palatable and more easily absorbed by families.  It is important to note that eligible children who hold a medical card and who are attending their nearest school will always be exempt from paying this charge.</P>
        <P>The changes to the primary school transport scheme will be applied equitably on a national basis.  That means eligibility for school transport will be easier to establish and the scheme will be simpler than it was in the past and more transparent for families and schools.  There will be strange, anomalous situations when the radii of two schools almost intertwine.  That will happen throughout the country.  However, I am confident that those issues will be ironed out over the coming two or three years.  We will arrive at a point, and this is what we wish to achieve, where parents can access a website, click on a map, find where their house and the school are located and be able to determine whether they are entitled to transport to that school.  If so, they will be able to pay for and print a ticket on-line.  That is the ultimate aim.  We have invested some money towards ensuring we will arrive at that position quite soon, and this process of simplifying the school transport system is the first stage in achieving that.  As I said earlier to Senator Cullinane, at a time when this country is experiencing serious financial difficulties one cannot argue that there is any logic or economic sense in transporting a child to a school other than his or her nearest school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnWhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Whelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his fair answer.  I am aware that in his constituency the Minister of State is encountering these types of situation personally.  I am not seeking to break the rules but I earnestly request that the Minister consider situations where children are already attending a certain school and a sibling wishes to attend the same school.  It will not break the bank or lead to a long-term problem to factor that in as a consideration.  As the Minister said, it will work its way out through the system in due course without damaging the genuine objective of establishing a cost effective and transparent system that is applied equitably across the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatONeill"><NameTxt>Senator Pat O&rsquo;Neill</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Whelan.  The Minister mentioned that approximately 95% of all students attend their nearest school, so we are only talking about 5% of students and they will not all be medical card holders.  I do not believe it is a major cost and it should be examined.  How many children does the Minister think would be affected by these changes and what is the saving for the Department?  Perhaps the Minister would consider putting an appeals process in place.  It involves 5% of students and all of them will not be entitled to tickets under the medical card condition.  It might be possible to look at this and give concessions where a bus is passing somebody&rsquo;s door and it makes sense not to have to transport the child two and a half miles to get the bus to the nearest school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I must be frank and honest.  It will not be possible to have such a system in place when the schools open on 1 September, but we will take the suggestions on board as we examine rolling out the transport system from September 2013 onwards.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas as an deis an t-&aacute;bhar seo a ard&uacute; sa Seanad inniu.  My concern is about the recent move of a factory in Gibbstown, County Meath, a Gaeltacht area, into better premises in Johnstown.  This factory is in the ownership of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and it is a tremendous pity it has moved from a Gaeltacht area to Johnstown, Navan, County Meath.  The concern of the local community is that the factory premises be protected and secured.  People are obviously worried about vandalism as it is in a quiet, rural area.  They are also concerned that replacement jobs and industry be brought to Baile Ghib as a matter of priority by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to ensure its commitment not just to secure jobs but also to secure the Irish language in the area.</P>
        <P>I do not know why the factory was moved.  I presume it was moving to a better premises, but there has been talk in Gaeltacht circles that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has a very strict policy on rents and is reluctant to reduce them.  I do not know if that applied in this case and I have no evidence that it did.  However, that has been suggested in a general way with regard to the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response about this factory and whether there will be a replacement.  In the meantime, the premises must be secured and maintained.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach as deis a thabhairt dom an t-&aacute;bhar seo a th&oacute;g&aacute;il sa Seanad.  Tuigtear dom go bhfuil an comhlacht at&aacute; lonnaithe sa mhonarcha at&aacute; i gceist ag an Seanad&oacute;ir chun &eacute; a thabhairt suas ar 19 l&uacute;il 2012.  Is monarcha &iacute; seo a t&oacute;gadh i l&aacute;r na seacht&oacute;id&iacute;, sula raibh go leor den reachta&iacute;ocht at&aacute; againn sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann maidir le sl&aacute;inte agus s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilteacht, truailli&uacute; uisce agus caighde&aacute;in t&oacute;g&aacute;la i bhfeidhm.  Agus an foirgneamh ar ais i seilbh &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, t&oacute;gfar gach c&eacute;im is g&aacute; chun &eacute; a chosaint don todhcha&iacute;.  N&iacute;l aon chinneadh d&eacute;anta f&oacute;s ag an &Uacute;dar&aacute;s maidir lena dh&iacute;ol n&oacute; &eacute; a ch&oacute;iri&uacute; i gcomhar tionscnaimh nua.  Meastar, &aacute;fach, go mbeadh s&eacute; thar a bheith costasach an foirgneamh a ch&oacute;iri&uacute; agus a roinnt ina n-aonaid n&iacute;os l&uacute;.  Ar an taobh eile den sc&eacute;al, d&aacute; nd&iacute;olfa&iacute; an foirgneamh, bheadh s&eacute; f&oacute;s ar f&aacute;il, faoi r&eacute;ir cead plean&aacute;la a bheith ar f&aacute;il, do gn&oacute;tha&iacute; eile a mbeadh sp&eacute;is acu lonn&uacute; ann.  D&eacute;anann &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, i gcomhar le IDA, marga&iacute;ocht lean&uacute;nach ar a chuid monarchan ar mhaithe le fosta&iacute;ocht a chruth&uacute; sa Ghaeltacht.  I l&aacute;thair na huaire, t&aacute; an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le roinnt fiosruithe maidir le sp&aacute;s tionscla&iacute;och sa cheantar seo agus d&eacute;anfar cinneadh maidir le todhcha&iacute; an fhoirgnimh seo i gcomhth&eacute;acs na bhfiosruithe sin.</P>
        <P>Tuigim go maith na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in agus na constaic&iacute; a gcaithfidh &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta dul i ngleic leo sa timpeallacht dheacair gn&oacute; at&aacute; i bhfeidhm faoi lathair.  N&iacute;l amhras ar bith ach go bhfuil an gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im eacnama&iacute;och n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus domhanda ag cruth&uacute; deacrachta&iacute; do chomhlachta&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht agus t&aacute; impleachta&iacute; d&aacute; r&eacute;ir ann do chursai fosta&iacute;ochta.  &Eacute; sin r&aacute;ite, caithfear n&oacute;t&aacute;il gurb &eacute; an Rialtas deiridh a laghdaigh an sol&aacute;thar airgid caipitil at&aacute; &aacute; fh&aacute;il ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, mar shampla, &oacute; &euro;27 milli&uacute;n i 2006 go &euro;18 milli&uacute;n i 2010 agus a ghearr an sol&aacute;thar c&eacute;anna go tubaisteach go dt&iacute; &euro;6 mhilli&uacute;n i 2011.</P>
        <P>Mar at&aacute; r&aacute;ite faoin gcl&aacute;r rialtais, t&aacute; an Rialtas &uacute;r ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ochta don strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge maidir leis na spriocanna ind&eacute;anta at&aacute; luaite ann a chur i gcr&iacute;ch.  Sa chomhth&eacute;acs seo, t&aacute;thar ag s&uacute;il go mbeidh Bille na Gaeltachta imithe tr&iacute;d an Oireachtas am&aacute;rach.  Anuas air sin, t&aacute; gr&uacute;pa oibre at&aacute; comhdh&eacute;anta d&rsquo;oifigigh &oacute;n Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe, &oacute;n Roinn Fiontar, Post agus Nuala&iacute;ochta agus &oacute; mo Roinnse ag scrud&uacute; an r&eacute;imse feidhmeanna a d&rsquo;oirfeadh d&rsquo;&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, go h&aacute;irithe maidir leis an bhfiontra&iacute;ocht a fhorbairt sa todhcha&iacute;.   Ar 31 Bealtaine 2011, th&oacute;g an Rialtas cinnt&iacute; &aacute;irithe maidir le strucht&uacute;r agus feidhmeanna Udar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Shocra&iacute;omar go mairfidh an <i>status quo</i> maidir le feidhmeanna reatha an &uacute;dar&aacute;is go ginear&aacute;lta, a chuid feidhmeanna fiontra&iacute;ochta san &aacute;ireamh, faoi r&eacute;ir for&aacute;il reacht&uacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh i mBille na Gaeltachta 2012 chun cumhacht a thabhairt don Aire Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta treoir a thabhairt don &uacute;dar&aacute;s a chuid acmhainn&iacute; teoranta a dh&iacute;ri&uacute; i dtreo earn&aacute;lacha fiontra&iacute;ochta ar leith, agus meicn&iacute;ocht a fhorbairt chun go mbeidh an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s in ann comhoibri&uacute; le h&aacute;is&iacute;neachta&iacute; fiontra&iacute;ochta eile, ach go h&aacute;irithe i gc&aacute;s togra&iacute; suntasacha Gaeltachta a bhfuil poit&eacute;inseal ard acu.  Ag eascairt on gcinneadh sin, t&aacute; for&aacute;il chu&iacute; curtha san &aacute;ireamh i mBille na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; an gr&uacute;pa oibre at&aacute; comhdh&eacute;anta d&rsquo;oifigigh on Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe, on Roinn Fiontar, Post agus Nuala&iacute;ochta agus &oacute; mo Roinn fh&eacute;in ag obair cheana fein ar mheicn&iacute;ocht a fhorbairt chun go mbeidh an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s in ann comhoibri&uacute; le Fiontra&iacute;ocht &Eacute;ireann agus IDA i gc&aacute;s togra&iacute; suntasacha Gaeltachta a bhfuil poit&eacute;inseal ard acu.  T&aacute; dul chun cinn maith d&eacute;anta cheana chun na cr&iacute;che sin.</P>
        <P>Mar fhocal scoir, is f&eacute;idir liom a r&aacute; go bhfuil an Rialtas tiomanta don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht, Gaeltacht na M&iacute; idir R&aacute;th Chairn agus Baile Ghib ina measc.  T&aacute; sp&eacute;is an Taoisigh sna cursa&iacute; seo thar a bheith soil&eacute;ir, agus an coiste Rialtais faoin nGaeilge agus faoin nGaeltacht athbhunaithe aige faoina chathaoirleacht f&eacute;in chun an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm.  Beidh mise mar Aire St&aacute;it ag obair go dl&uacute;th leis an Aire, an Teachta Deenihan, agus leis an gcoiste Rialtais le cinnti&uacute; go nd&eacute;antar gach n&iacute; gur f&eacute;idir ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus leis an nGaeltacht a fhorbairt.</P>

	<P>Beidh &aacute;thas ar an bpobal i mBaile Ghib a chloisint go bhfuil an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s chun dul i ngleic leis an foirgneamh a chosaint.  C&eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; sin t&aacute;bhachtach, t&aacute; na fiosruithe a luaigh an tAire St&aacute;it ina bhfreagra i bhfad n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute;.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; go bhfuil &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta chun fiosruithe a dh&eacute;anamh maidir le sp&aacute;s tionscla&iacute;och sa cheantar.  Bheadh m&eacute; n&iacute;os s&aacute;sta f&oacute;s d&aacute; mbeadh na c&iacute;osanna &aacute; gcur ar f&aacute;il go r&eacute;as&uacute;nta.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh n&iacute;os m&oacute; sp&eacute;ise ag comhlachta&iacute; sa sp&aacute;s sin m&aacute; tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin.  I am glad the Minister of State has outlined there are inquiries about the factory in Gibbstown.  This is very important.  It is important for the community that the factory be protected and secured.</P>
        <P>I have asked my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, about this matter.  He is soon to attend his second last meeting of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta unless a local authority or the Government appoints him, which is unlikely.  The Senator was elected by the people in Donegal, and I am sure they would re-elect him if they had the chance, but this has been taken away.  The Senator will raise this issue in B&eacute;al an Mhuirthead at the weekend; I believe there is a meeting on Friday.  This matter is very important because, if we really want to protect Irish, we must not have factories leaving Gaeltachta&iacute; and entering superior premises elsewhere.  While the story of the company in question is good in general for the county as a whole, we want to protect jobs and the communities in rural Meath.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Deputy Dinny McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I reassure the Senator once more that his views will be conveyed to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Every job located in a Gaeltacht is important.  I have been to the Gaeltacht in Meath on a number of occasions and hope to be there in the not-too-distant future.  At the meeting on Friday, this matter will be on the agenda of Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill and Mr. Cathal Seoighe, whom I know Senator Byrne knows very well, as do I.  It is in all our interests to do everything to protect existing jobs.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is in negotiations with a number of companies that may be willing to locate at the site in question in what I hope will be the not-too-distant future.</P>
